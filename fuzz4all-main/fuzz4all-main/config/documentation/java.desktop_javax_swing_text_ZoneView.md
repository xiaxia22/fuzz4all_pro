# Class ZoneView

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\text\ZoneView.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ZoneView

extends
BoxView
```

ZoneView is a View implementation that creates zones for which
the child views are not created or stored until they are needed
for display or model/view translations. This enables a substantial
reduction in memory consumption for situations where the model
being represented is very large, by building view objects only for
the region being actively viewed/edited. The size of the children
can be estimated in some way, or calculated asynchronously with
only the result being saved.

ZoneView extends BoxView to provide a box that implements
zones for its children. The zones are special View implementations
(the children of an instance of this class) that represent only a
portion of the model that an instance of ZoneView is responsible
for. The zones don't create child views until an attempt is made
to display them. A box shaped view is well suited to this because:

- Boxes are a heavily used view, and having a box that
provides this behavior gives substantial opportunity
to plug the behavior into a view hierarchy from the
view factory.

Boxes are tiled in one direction, so it is easy to
divide them into zones in a reliable way.

Boxes typically have a simple relationship to the model (i.e. they
create child views that directly represent the child elements).

Boxes are easier to estimate the size of than some other shapes.

The default behavior is controlled by two properties, maxZoneSize
and maxZonesLoaded. Setting maxZoneSize to Integer.MAX_VALUE would
have the effect of causing only one zone to be created. This would
effectively turn the view into an implementation of the decorator
pattern. Setting maxZonesLoaded to a value of Integer.MAX_VALUE would
cause zones to never be unloaded. For simplicity, zones are created on
boundaries represented by the child elements of the element the view is
responsible for. The zones can be any View implementation, but the
default implementation is based upon AsyncBoxView which supports fairly
large zones efficiently.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public ZoneView​(
Element
elem,
int axis)

Constructs a ZoneView.

**Parameters:**
- elem

- the element this view is responsible for
- axis

- either View.X_AXIS or View.Y_AXIS

---

### Method Details

#### public int getMaximumZoneSize()

Get the current maximum zone size.

**Returns:**
- the current maximum zone size

---

#### public void setMaximumZoneSize​(int size)

Set the desired maximum zone size. A
zone may get larger than this size if
a single child view is larger than this
size since zones are formed on child view
boundaries.

**Parameters:**
- size

- the number of characters the zone
may represent before attempting to break
the zone into a smaller size.

---

#### public int getMaxZonesLoaded()

Get the current setting of the number of zones
allowed to be loaded at the same time.

**Returns:**
- current setting of the number of zones
allowed to be loaded at the same time

---

#### public void setMaxZonesLoaded​(int mzl)

Sets the current setting of the number of zones
allowed to be loaded at the same time. This will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

if

mzl

is less
than 1.

**Parameters:**
- mzl

- the desired maximum number of zones
to be actively loaded, must be greater than 0

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

mzl

is < 1

---

#### protected void zoneWasLoaded​(
View
zone)

Called by a zone when it gets loaded. This happens when
an attempt is made to display or perform a model/view
translation on a zone that was in an unloaded state.
This is implemented to check if the maximum number of
zones was reached and to unload the oldest zone if so.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the child view that was just loaded.

---

#### protected void unloadZone​(
View
zone)

Unload a zone (Convert the zone to its memory saving state).
The zones are expected to represent a subset of the
child elements of the element this view is responsible for.
Therefore, the default implementation is to simple remove
all the children.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the child view desired to be set to an
unloaded state.

---

#### protected boolean isZoneLoaded​(
View
zone)

Determine if a zone is in the loaded state.
The zones are expected to represent a subset of the
child elements of the element this view is responsible for.
Therefore, the default implementation is to return
true if the view has children.
param zone the child view

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the zone

**Returns:**
- whether or not the zone is in the loaded state.

---

#### protected
View
createZone​(int p0,
int p1)

Create a view to represent a zone for the given
range within the model (which should be within
the range of this objects responsibility). This
is called by the zone management logic to create
new zones. Subclasses can provide a different
implementation for a zone by changing this method.

**Parameters:**
- p0

- the start of the desired zone. This should
be >= getStartOffset() and < getEndOffset(). This
value should also be < p1.
- p1

- the end of the desired zone. This should
be > getStartOffset() and <= getEndOffset(). This
value should also be > p0.

**Returns:**
- a view to represent a zone for the given range within
the model

---

#### protected void loadChildren​(
ViewFactory
f)

Loads all of the children to initialize the view.
This is called by the

setParent

method.
This is reimplemented to not load any children directly
(as they are created by the zones). This method creates
the initial set of zones. Zones don't actually get
populated however until an attempt is made to display
them or to do model/view coordinate translation.

**Overrides:**
- loadChildren

in class

CompositeView

**Parameters:**
- f

- the view factory

**See Also:**
- CompositeView.setParent(javax.swing.text.View)

---

#### protected int getViewIndexAtPosition​(int pos)

Returns the child view index representing the given position in
the model.

**Overrides:**
- getViewIndexAtPosition

in class

CompositeView

**Parameters:**
- pos

- the position >= 0

**Returns:**
- index of the view representing the given position, or
-1 if no view represents that position

---

#### protected boolean updateChildren​(
DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

ViewFactory
f)

The superclass behavior will try to update the child views
which is not desired in this case, since the children are
zones and not directly effected by the changes to the
associated element. This is reimplemented to do nothing
and return false.

**Overrides:**
- updateChildren

in class

View

**Parameters:**
- ec

- the change information for the element this view
is responsible for. This should not be

null

if
this method gets called
- e

- the change information from the associated document
- f

- the factory to use to build child views

**Returns:**
- whether or not the child views represent the
child elements of the element this view is responsible
for. Some views create children that represent a portion
of the element they are responsible for, and should return
false. This information is used to determine if views
in the range of the added elements should be forwarded to
or not

**See Also:**
- View.insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

,

View.removeUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

,

View.changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

---

#### public void insertUpdate​(
DocumentEvent
changes,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)

Gives notification that something was inserted into the document
in a location that this view is responsible for. This is largely
delegated to the superclass, but is reimplemented to update the
relevant zone (i.e. determine if a zone needs to be split into a
set of 2 or more zones).

**Overrides:**
- insertUpdate

in class

View

**Parameters:**
- changes

- the change information from the associated document
- a

- the current allocation of the view
- f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

**See Also:**
- View.insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

---

#### public void removeUpdate​(
DocumentEvent
changes,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)

Gives notification that something was removed from the document
in a location that this view is responsible for. This is largely
delegated to the superclass, but is reimplemented to update the
relevant zones (i.e. determine if zones need to be removed or
joined with another zone).

**Overrides:**
- removeUpdate

in class

View

**Parameters:**
- changes

- the change information from the associated document
- a

- the current allocation of the view
- f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

**See Also:**
- View.removeUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- ZoneView

```java
public ZoneView​(
Element
elem,
int axis)
```

Constructs a ZoneView.

**Parameters:** elem

- the element this view is responsible for
**Parameters:** axis

- either View.X_AXIS or View.Y_AXIS

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getMaximumZoneSize

```java
public int getMaximumZoneSize()
```

Get the current maximum zone size.

**Returns:** the current maximum zone size

- setMaximumZoneSize

```java
public void setMaximumZoneSize​(int size)
```

Set the desired maximum zone size. A
zone may get larger than this size if
a single child view is larger than this
size since zones are formed on child view
boundaries.

**Parameters:** size

- the number of characters the zone
may represent before attempting to break
the zone into a smaller size.

- getMaxZonesLoaded

```java
public int getMaxZonesLoaded()
```

Get the current setting of the number of zones
allowed to be loaded at the same time.

**Returns:** current setting of the number of zones
allowed to be loaded at the same time

- setMaxZonesLoaded

```java
public void setMaxZonesLoaded​(int mzl)
```

Sets the current setting of the number of zones
allowed to be loaded at the same time. This will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

if

mzl

is less
than 1.

**Parameters:** mzl

- the desired maximum number of zones
to be actively loaded, must be greater than 0
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

mzl

is < 1

- zoneWasLoaded

```java
protected void zoneWasLoaded​(
View
zone)
```

Called by a zone when it gets loaded. This happens when
an attempt is made to display or perform a model/view
translation on a zone that was in an unloaded state.
This is implemented to check if the maximum number of
zones was reached and to unload the oldest zone if so.

**Parameters:** zone

- the child view that was just loaded.

- unloadZone

```java
protected void unloadZone​(
View
zone)
```

Unload a zone (Convert the zone to its memory saving state).
The zones are expected to represent a subset of the
child elements of the element this view is responsible for.
Therefore, the default implementation is to simple remove
all the children.

**Parameters:** zone

- the child view desired to be set to an
unloaded state.

- isZoneLoaded

```java
protected boolean isZoneLoaded​(
View
zone)
```

Determine if a zone is in the loaded state.
The zones are expected to represent a subset of the
child elements of the element this view is responsible for.
Therefore, the default implementation is to return
true if the view has children.
param zone the child view

**Parameters:** zone

- the zone
**Returns:** whether or not the zone is in the loaded state.

- createZone

```java
protected
View
createZone​(int p0,
int p1)
```

Create a view to represent a zone for the given
range within the model (which should be within
the range of this objects responsibility). This
is called by the zone management logic to create
new zones. Subclasses can provide a different
implementation for a zone by changing this method.

**Parameters:** p0

- the start of the desired zone. This should
be >= getStartOffset() and < getEndOffset(). This
value should also be < p1.
**Parameters:** p1

- the end of the desired zone. This should
be > getStartOffset() and <= getEndOffset(). This
value should also be > p0.
**Returns:** a view to represent a zone for the given range within
the model

- loadChildren

```java
protected void loadChildren​(
ViewFactory
f)
```

Loads all of the children to initialize the view.
This is called by the

setParent

method.
This is reimplemented to not load any children directly
(as they are created by the zones). This method creates
the initial set of zones. Zones don't actually get
populated however until an attempt is made to display
them or to do model/view coordinate translation.

**Overrides:** loadChildren

in class

CompositeView
**Parameters:** f

- the view factory
**See Also:** CompositeView.setParent(javax.swing.text.View)

- getViewIndexAtPosition

```java
protected int getViewIndexAtPosition​(int pos)
```

Returns the child view index representing the given position in
the model.

**Overrides:** getViewIndexAtPosition

in class

CompositeView
**Parameters:** pos

- the position >= 0
**Returns:** index of the view representing the given position, or
-1 if no view represents that position

- updateChildren

```java
protected boolean updateChildren​(
DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

ViewFactory
f)
```

The superclass behavior will try to update the child views
which is not desired in this case, since the children are
zones and not directly effected by the changes to the
associated element. This is reimplemented to do nothing
and return false.

**Overrides:** updateChildren

in class

View
**Parameters:** ec

- the change information for the element this view
is responsible for. This should not be

null

if
this method gets called
**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to build child views
**Returns:** whether or not the child views represent the
child elements of the element this view is responsible
for. Some views create children that represent a portion
of the element they are responsible for, and should return
false. This information is used to determine if views
in the range of the added elements should be forwarded to
or not
**See Also:** View.insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

- insertUpdate

```java
public void insertUpdate​(
DocumentEvent
changes,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Gives notification that something was inserted into the document
in a location that this view is responsible for. This is largely
delegated to the superclass, but is reimplemented to update the
relevant zone (i.e. determine if a zone needs to be split into a
set of 2 or more zones).

**Overrides:** insertUpdate

in class

View
**Parameters:** changes

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children
**See Also:** View.insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

- removeUpdate

```java
public void removeUpdate​(
DocumentEvent
changes,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Gives notification that something was removed from the document
in a location that this view is responsible for. This is largely
delegated to the superclass, but is reimplemented to update the
relevant zones (i.e. determine if zones need to be removed or
joined with another zone).

**Overrides:** removeUpdate

in class

View
**Parameters:** changes

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Parameters:** f
