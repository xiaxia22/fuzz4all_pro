# Class GraphicsConfiguration

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\GraphicsConfiguration.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
GraphicsConfiguration

extends
Object
```

The

GraphicsConfiguration

class describes the
characteristics of a graphics destination such as a printer or monitor.
There can be many

GraphicsConfiguration

objects associated
with a single graphics device, representing different drawing modes or
capabilities. The corresponding native structure will vary from platform
to platform. For example, on X11 windowing systems,
each visual is a different

GraphicsConfiguration

.
On Microsoft Windows,

GraphicsConfiguration

s represent
PixelFormats available in the current resolution and color depth.

In a virtual device multi-screen environment in which the desktop
area could span multiple physical screen devices, the bounds of the

GraphicsConfiguration

objects are relative to the
virtual coordinate system. When setting the location of a
component, use

getBounds

to get the bounds of
the desired

GraphicsConfiguration

and offset the location
with the coordinates of the

GraphicsConfiguration

,
as the following code sample illustrates:

```java
Frame f = new Frame(gc); // where gc is a GraphicsConfiguration
Rectangle bounds = gc.getBounds();
f.setLocation(10 + bounds.x, 10 + bounds.y);
```

To determine if your environment is a virtual device
environment, call

getBounds

on all of the

GraphicsConfiguration

objects in your system. If
any of the origins of the returned bounds is not (0, 0),
your environment is a virtual device environment.

You can also use

getBounds

to determine the bounds
of the virtual device. To do this, first call

getBounds

on all
of the

GraphicsConfiguration

objects in your
system. Then calculate the union of all of the bounds returned
from the calls to

getBounds

. The union is the
bounds of the virtual device. The following code sample
calculates the bounds of the virtual device.

```java
Rectangle virtualBounds = new Rectangle();
GraphicsEnvironment ge = GraphicsEnvironment.
getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();
GraphicsDevice[] gs =
ge.getScreenDevices();
for (int j = 0; j < gs.length; j++) {
GraphicsDevice gd = gs[j];
GraphicsConfiguration[] gc =
gd.getConfigurations();
for (int i=0; i < gc.length; i++) {
virtualBounds =
virtualBounds.union(gc[i].getBounds());
}
}
```

#### public abstract
AffineTransform
getDefaultTransform()

Returns the default

AffineTransform

for this

GraphicsConfiguration

. This

AffineTransform

is typically the Identity transform
for most normal screens. The default

AffineTransform

maps coordinates onto the device such that 72 user space
coordinate units measure approximately 1 inch in device
space. The normalizing transform can be used to make
this mapping more exact. Coordinates in the coordinate space
defined by the default

AffineTransform

for screen and
printer devices have the origin in the upper left-hand corner of
the target region of the device, with X coordinates
increasing to the right and Y coordinates increasing downwards.
For image buffers not associated with a device, such as those not
created by

createCompatibleImage

,
this

AffineTransform

is the Identity transform.

**Returns:**
- the default

AffineTransform

for this

GraphicsConfiguration

.

---

#### public abstract
AffineTransform
getNormalizingTransform()

Returns an

AffineTransform

that can be concatenated
with the default

AffineTransform

of a

GraphicsConfiguration

so that 72 units in user
space equals 1 inch in device space.

For a particular

Graphics2D

, g, one
can reset the transformation to create
such a mapping by using the following pseudocode:

```java
GraphicsConfiguration gc = g.getDeviceConfiguration();

g.setTransform(gc.getDefaultTransform());
g.transform(gc.getNormalizingTransform());
```

Note that sometimes this

AffineTransform

is identity,
such as for printers or metafile output, and that this

AffineTransform

is only as accurate as the information
supplied by the underlying system. For image buffers not
associated with a device, such as those not created by

createCompatibleImage

, this

AffineTransform

is the Identity transform
since there is no valid distance measurement.

**Returns:**
- an

AffineTransform

to concatenate to the
default

AffineTransform

so that 72 units in user
space is mapped to 1 inch in device space.

java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration

```java
public abstract class
GraphicsConfiguration

extends
Object
```

The

GraphicsConfiguration

class describes the
characteristics of a graphics destination such as a printer or monitor.
There can be many

GraphicsConfiguration

objects associated
with a single graphics device, representing different drawing modes or
capabilities. The corresponding native structure will vary from platform
to platform. For example, on X11 windowing systems,
each visual is a different

GraphicsConfiguration

.
On Microsoft Windows,

GraphicsConfiguration

s represent
PixelFormats available in the current resolution and color depth.

In a virtual device multi-screen environment in which the desktop
area could span multiple physical screen devices, the bounds of the

GraphicsConfiguration

objects are relative to the
virtual coordinate system. When setting the location of a
component, use

getBounds

to get the bounds of
the desired

GraphicsConfiguration

and offset the location
with the coordinates of the

GraphicsConfiguration

,
as the following code sample illustrates:

```java
Frame f = new Frame(gc); // where gc is a GraphicsConfiguration
Rectangle bounds = gc.getBounds();
f.setLocation(10 + bounds.x, 10 + bounds.y);
```

To determine if your environment is a virtual device
environment, call

getBounds

on all of the

GraphicsConfiguration

objects in your system. If
any of the origins of the returned bounds is not (0, 0),
your environment is a virtual device environment.

You can also use

getBounds

to determine the bounds
of the virtual device. To do this, first call

getBounds

on all
of the

GraphicsConfiguration

objects in your
system. Then calculate the union of all of the bounds returned
from the calls to

getBounds

. The union is the
bounds of the virtual device. The following code sample
calculates the bounds of the virtual device.

```java
Rectangle virtualBounds = new Rectangle();
GraphicsEnvironment ge = GraphicsEnvironment.
getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();
GraphicsDevice[] gs =
ge.getScreenDevices();
for (int j = 0; j < gs.length; j++) {
GraphicsDevice gd = gs[j];
GraphicsConfiguration[] gc =
gd.getConfigurations();
for (int i=0; i < gc.length; i++) {
virtualBounds =
virtualBounds.union(gc[i].getBounds());
}
}

AffineTransform

maps coordinates onto the device such that 72 user space
coordinate units measure approximately 1 inch in device
space. The normalizing transform can be used to make
this mapping more exact. Coordinates in the coordinate space
defined by the default

AffineTransform

for screen and
printer devices have the origin in the upper left-hand corner of
the target region of the device, with X coordinates
increasing to the right and Y coordinates increasing downwards.
For image buffers not associated with a device, such as those not

AffineTransform

is only as accurate as the information
supplied by the underlying system. For image buffers not
associated with a device, such as those not created by

createCompatibleImage

, this

AffineTransform

is the Identity transform

maps coordinates onto the device such that 72 user space
coordinate units measure approximately 1 inch in device
space. The normalizing transform can be used to make
this mapping more exact. Coordinates in the coordinate space
defined by the default

AffineTransform

for screen and
printer devices have the origin in the upper left-hand corner of
the target region of the device, with X coordinates
increasing to the right and Y coordinates increasing downwards.
For image buffers not associated with a device, such as those not
created by

createCompatibleImage

,
this

AffineTransform

is the Identity transform.

**Returns:** the default

AffineTransform

for this

GraphicsConfiguration

.

getNormalizingTransform

```java
public abstract
AffineTransform
getNormalizingTransform()
```

Returns an

AffineTransform

that can be concatenated
with the default

AffineTransform

of a

GraphicsConfiguration

so that 72 units in user
space equals 1 inch in device space.

For a particular

Graphics2D

, g, one
can reset the transformation to create
such a mapping by using the following pseudocode:

```java
GraphicsConfiguration gc = g.getDeviceConfiguration();

g.setTransform(gc.getDefaultTransform());
g.transform(gc.getNormalizingTransform());
```

Note that sometimes this

AffineTransform

is identity,
such as for printers or metafile output, and that this

AffineTransform

is only as accurate as the information
supplied by the underlying system. For image buffers not
associated with a device, such as those not created by

createCompatibleImage

, this

AffineTransform

is the Identity transform
since there is no valid distance measurement.

**Returns:** an

AffineTransform

to concatenate to the
default

AffineTransform

so that 72 units in user
space is mapped to 1 inch in device space.
