# Class PolicyQualifierInfo

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\cert\PolicyQualifierInfo.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
PolicyQualifierInfo

extends
Object
```

An immutable policy qualifier represented by the ASN.1 PolicyQualifierInfo
structure.

The ASN.1 definition is as follows:

```java
PolicyQualifierInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
policyQualifierId PolicyQualifierId,
qualifier ANY DEFINED BY policyQualifierId }
```

A certificate policies extension, if present in an X.509 version 3
certificate, contains a sequence of one or more policy information terms,
each of which consists of an object identifier (OID) and optional
qualifiers. In an end-entity certificate, these policy information terms
indicate the policy under which the certificate has been issued and the
purposes for which the certificate may be used. In a CA certificate, these
policy information terms limit the set of policies for certification paths
which include this certificate.

A

Set

of

PolicyQualifierInfo

objects are returned
by the

PolicyNode.getPolicyQualifiers

method. This allows applications with specific policy requirements to
process and validate each policy qualifier. Applications that need to
process policy qualifiers should explicitly set the

policyQualifiersRejected

flag to false (by calling the

PKIXParameters.setPolicyQualifiersRejected

method) before validating
a certification path.

Note that the PKIX certification path validation algorithm specifies
that any policy qualifier in a certificate policies extension that is
marked critical must be processed and validated. Otherwise the
certification path must be rejected. If the

policyQualifiersRejected

flag is set to false, it is up to
the application to validate all policy qualifiers in this manner in order
to be PKIX compliant.

Concurrent Access

All

PolicyQualifierInfo

objects must be immutable and
thread-safe. That is, multiple threads may concurrently invoke the
methods defined in this class on a single

PolicyQualifierInfo

object (or more than one) with no ill effects. Requiring

PolicyQualifierInfo

objects to be immutable and thread-safe
allows them to be passed around to various pieces of code without
worrying about coordinating access.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public PolicyQualifierInfo​(byte[] encoded)
throws
IOException

Creates an instance of

PolicyQualifierInfo

from the
encoded bytes. The encoded byte array is copied on construction.

**Parameters:**
- encoded

- a byte array containing the qualifier in DER encoding

**Throws:**
- IOException

- thrown if the byte array does not represent a
valid and parsable policy qualifier

---

### Method Details

#### public final
String
getPolicyQualifierId()

Returns the

policyQualifierId

field of this

PolicyQualifierInfo

. The

policyQualifierId

is an Object Identifier (OID) represented by a set of nonnegative
integers separated by periods.

**Returns:**
- the OID (never

null

)

---

#### public final byte[] getEncoded()

Returns the ASN.1 DER encoded form of this

PolicyQualifierInfo

.

**Returns:**
- the ASN.1 DER encoded bytes (never

null

).
Note that a copy is returned, so the data is cloned each time
this method is called.

---

#### public final byte[] getPolicyQualifier()

Returns the ASN.1 DER encoded form of the

qualifier

field of this

PolicyQualifierInfo

.

**Returns:**
- the ASN.1 DER encoded bytes of the

qualifier

field. Note that a copy is returned, so the data is cloned each
time this method is called.

---

#### public
String
toString()

Return a printable representation of this

PolicyQualifierInfo

.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a

String

describing the contents of this

PolicyQualifierInfo
