# Class CertStore

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\cert\CertStore.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
CertStore

extends
Object
```

A class for retrieving

Certificate

s and

CRL

s
from a repository.

This class uses a provider-based architecture.
To create a

CertStore

, call one of the static

getInstance

methods, passing in the type of

CertStore

desired, any applicable initialization parameters
and optionally the name of the provider desired.

Once the

CertStore

has been created, it can be used to
retrieve

Certificate

s and

CRL

s by calling its

getCertificates

and

getCRLs

methods.

Unlike a

KeyStore

, which provides access
to a cache of private keys and trusted certificates, a

CertStore

is designed to provide access to a potentially
vast repository of untrusted certificates and CRLs. For example, an LDAP
implementation of

CertStore

provides access to certificates
and CRLs stored in one or more directories using the LDAP protocol and the
schema as defined in the RFC service attribute.

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard

CertStore

type:

- Collection

This type is described in the

CertStore section

of the
Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.
Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
other types are supported.

Concurrent Access

All public methods of

CertStore

objects must be thread-safe.
That is, multiple threads may concurrently invoke these methods on a
single

CertStore

object (or more than one) with no
ill effects. This allows a

CertPathBuilder

to search for a
CRL while simultaneously searching for further certificates, for instance.

The static methods of this class are also guaranteed to be thread-safe.
Multiple threads may concurrently invoke the static methods defined in
this class with no ill effects.

**Since:** 1.4

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected CertStore​(
CertStoreSpi
storeSpi,

Provider
provider,

String
type,

CertStoreParameters
params)

Creates a

CertStore

object of the given type, and
encapsulates the given provider implementation (SPI object) in it.

**Parameters:**
- storeSpi

- the provider implementation
- provider

- the provider
- type

- the type
- params

- the initialization parameters (may be

null

)

---

### Method Details

#### public final
Collection
<? extends
Certificate
> getCertificates​(
CertSelector
selector)
throws
CertStoreException

Returns a

Collection

of

Certificate

s that
match the specified selector. If no

Certificate

s
match the selector, an empty

Collection

will be returned.

For some

CertStore

types, the resulting

Collection

may not contain

all

of the

Certificate

s that match the selector. For instance,
an LDAP

CertStore

may not search all entries in the
directory. Instead, it may just search entries that are likely to
contain the

Certificate

s it is looking for.

Some

CertStore

implementations (especially LDAP

CertStore

s) may throw a

CertStoreException

unless a non-null

CertSelector

is provided that
includes specific criteria that can be used to find the certificates.
Issuer and/or subject names are especially useful criteria.

**Parameters:**
- selector

- A

CertSelector

used to select which

Certificate

s should be returned. Specify

null

to return all

Certificate

s (if supported).

**Returns:**
- A

Collection

of

Certificate

s that
match the specified selector (never

null

)

**Throws:**
- CertStoreException

- if an exception occurs

---

#### public final
Collection
<? extends
CRL
> getCRLs​(
CRLSelector
selector)
throws
CertStoreException

Returns a

Collection

of

CRL

s that
match the specified selector. If no

CRL

s
match the selector, an empty

Collection

will be returned.

For some

CertStore

types, the resulting

Collection

may not contain

all

of the

CRL

s that match the selector. For instance,
an LDAP

CertStore

may not search all entries in the
directory. Instead, it may just search entries that are likely to
contain the

CRL

s it is looking for.

Some

CertStore

implementations (especially LDAP

CertStore

s) may throw a

CertStoreException

unless a non-null

CRLSelector

is provided that
includes specific criteria that can be used to find the CRLs.
Issuer names and/or the certificate to be checked are especially useful.

**Parameters:**
- selector

- A

CRLSelector

used to select which

CRL

s should be returned. Specify

null

to return all

CRL

s (if supported).

**Returns:**
- A

Collection

of

CRL

s that
match the specified selector (never

null

)

**Throws:**
- CertStoreException

- if an exception occurs

---

#### public static
CertStore
getInstance​(
String
type,

CertStoreParameters
params)
throws
InvalidAlgorithmParameterException
,

NoSuchAlgorithmException

Returns a

CertStore

object that implements the specified

CertStore

type and is initialized with the specified
parameters.

This method traverses the list of registered security Providers,
starting with the most preferred Provider.
A new CertStore object encapsulating the
CertStoreSpi implementation from the first
Provider that supports the specified type is returned.

Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via
the

Security.getProviders()

method.

The

CertStore

that is returned is initialized with the
specified

CertStoreParameters

. The type of parameters
needed may vary between different types of

CertStore

s.
Note that the specified

CertStoreParameters

object is
cloned.

**Parameters:**
- type

- the name of the requested

CertStore

type.
See the CertStore section in the

Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification

for information about standard types.
- params

- the initialization parameters (may be

null

).

**Returns:**
- a

CertStore

object that implements the specified

CertStore

type

**Throws:**
- InvalidAlgorithmParameterException

- if the specified
initialization parameters are inappropriate for this

CertStore
- NoSuchAlgorithmException

- if no

Provider

supports a

CertStoreSpi

implementation for the specified type
- NullPointerException

- if

type

is

null

**See Also:**
- Provider

**Implementation Note:**
- The JDK Reference Implementation additionally uses the

jdk.security.provider.preferred

Security

property to determine
the preferred provider order for the specified algorithm. This
may be different than the order of providers returned by

Security.getProviders()

.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getCertificates

```java
public final
Collection
<? extends
Certificate
> getCertificates​(
CertSelector
selector)
throws
CertStoreException
```

Returns a

Collection

of

Certificate

s that
match the specified selector. If no

Certificate

s
match the selector, an empty

Collection

will be returned.

For some

CertStore

types, the resulting

Collection

may not contain

all

of the

Certificate

s that match the selector. For instance,
an LDAP

CertStore

may not search all entries in the
directory. Instead, it may just search entries that are likely to
contain the

Certificate

s it is looking for.

Some

CertStore

implementations (especially LDAP

CertStore

s) may throw a

CertStoreException

unless a non-null

CertSelector

is provided that
includes specific criteria that can be used to find the certificates.
Issuer and/or subject names are especially useful criteria.

**Parameters:** selector

- A

CertSelector

used to select which

Certificate

s should be returned. Specify

null

to return all

Certificate

s (if supported).
**Returns:** A

Collection

of

Certificate

s that
match the specified selector (never

null

)
**Throws:** CertStoreException

- if an exception occurs

- getCRLs

```java
public final
Collection
<? extends
CRL
> getCRLs​(
CRLSelector
selector)
throws
CertStoreException
```

Returns a

Collection

of

CRL

s that
match the specified selector. If no

CRL

s
match the selector, an empty

Collection

will be returned.

For some

CertStore

types, the resulting

Collection

may not contain

all

of the

CRL

s that match the selector. For instance,
an LDAP

CertStore

may not search all entries in the
directory. Instead, it may just search entries that are likely to
contain the

CRL

s it is looking for.

Some

CertStore

implementations (especially LDAP

CertStore

s) may throw a

CertStoreException

unless a non-null

CRLSelector

is provided that
includes specific criteria that can be used to find the CRLs.
Issuer names and/or the certificate to be checked are especially useful.

**Parameters:** selector

- A

CRLSelector

used to select which

CRL

s should be returned. Specify

null

to return all

CRL

s (if supported).
**Returns:** A

Collection

of

CRL

s that
match the specified selector (never

null

)
**Throws:** CertStoreException

- if an exception occurs

- getInstance

```java
public static
CertStore
getInstance​(
String
type,

CertStoreParameters

contain the

Certificate

s it is looking for.

Some

CertStore

implementations (especially LDAP

CertStore

s) may throw a

CertStoreException

unless a non-null

CertSelector

is provided that
includes specific criteria that can be used to find the certificates.
Issuer and/or subject names are especially useful criteria.
