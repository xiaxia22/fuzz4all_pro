# Interface GSSName

**Source:** `java.security.jgss\org\ietf\jgss\GSSName.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
GSSName
```

This interface encapsulates a single GSS-API principal entity. The
application obtains an implementation of this interface
through one of the

createName

methods that exist in the

GSSManager

class. Conceptually a GSSName contains many
representations of the entity or many primitive name elements, one for
each supported underlying mechanism. In GSS terminology, a GSSName that
contains an element from just one mechanism is called a Mechanism Name
(MN)

Since different authentication mechanisms may employ different
namespaces for identifying their principals, GSS-API's naming support is
necessarily complex in multi-mechanism environments (or even in some
single-mechanism environments where the underlying mechanism supports
multiple namespaces). Different name formats and their definitions are
identified with

Oid's

and some standard types
are defined in this interface. The format of the names can be derived
based on the unique

Oid

of its name type.

Included below are code examples utilizing the

GSSName

interface.
The code below creates a

GSSName

, converts it to an MN, performs a
comparison, obtains a printable representation of the name, exports it
to a byte array and then re-imports to obtain a
new

GSSName

.

```java
GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();

// create a host based service name
GSSName name = manager.createName("service@host",
GSSName.NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE);

Oid krb5 = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2");

GSSName mechName = name.canonicalize(krb5);

// the above two steps are equivalent to the following
GSSName mechName = manager.createName("service@host",
GSSName.NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE, krb5);

// perform name comparison
if (name.equals(mechName))
print("Names are equals.");

// obtain textual representation of name and its printable
// name type
print(mechName.toString() +
mechName.getStringNameType().toString());

// export and re-import the name
byte [] exportName = mechName.export();

// create a new name object from the exported buffer
GSSName newName = manager.createName(exportName,
GSSName.NT_EXPORT_NAME);
```

If a security manager is installed, in order to create a

GSSName

that contains a Kerberos name element without providing its realm,
a

ServicePermission

must be granted and the service principal of the permission must minimally
be inside the Kerberos name element's realm. For example, if the result of

createName("user", NT_USER_NAME)

contains a Kerberos name element

user@EXAMPLE.COM

, then
a

ServicePermission

with service principal

host/www.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

(and any action) must be granted.
Otherwise, the creation will throw a

GSSException

containing the

GSSException.FAILURE

error code.

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### boolean equals​(
GSSName
another)
throws
GSSException

Compares two

GSSName

objects to determine if they refer to the
same entity.

**Parameters:**
- another

- the

GSSName

to compare this name with

**Returns:**
- true if the two names contain at least one primitive element
in common. If either of the names represents an anonymous entity, the
method will return false.

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- when the names cannot be compared, containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.BAD_NAMETYPE

,

GSSException.FAILURE

---

#### boolean equals​(
Object
another)

Compares this

GSSName

object to another Object that might be a

GSSName

. The behaviour is exactly the same as in

equals

except that no GSSException is thrown;
instead, false will be returned in the situation where an error
occurs.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- another

- the object to compare this name to

**Returns:**
- true if the object to compare to is also a

GSSName

and the two
names refer to the same entity.

**See Also:**
- equals(GSSName)

---

#### int hashCode()

Returns a hashcode value for this GSSName.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a hashCode value

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### GSSName
canonicalize​(
Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException

Creates a name that is canonicalized for some
mechanism.

**Parameters:**
- mech

- the oid for the mechanism for which the canonical form of
the name is requested.

**Returns:**
- a

GSSName

that contains just one primitive
element representing this name in a canonicalized form for the desired
mechanism.

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.BAD_MECH

,

GSSException.BAD_NAMETYPE

,

GSSException.BAD_NAME

,

GSSException.FAILURE

---

#### byte[] export()
throws
GSSException

Returns a canonical contiguous byte representation of a mechanism name
(MN), suitable for direct, byte by byte comparison by authorization
functions. If the name is not an MN, implementations may throw a
GSSException with the NAME_NOT_MN status code. If an implementation
chooses not to throw an exception, it should use some system specific
default mechanism to canonicalize the name and then export
it. Structurally, an exported name object consists of a header
containing an OID identifying the mechanism that authenticated the
name, and a trailer containing the name itself, where the syntax of
the trailer is defined by the individual mechanism specification. The
format of the header of the output buffer is specified in RFC 2743.

The exported name is useful when used in large access control lists
where the overhead of creating a

GSSName

object on each
name and invoking the equals method on each name from the ACL may be
prohibitive.

Exported names may be re-imported by using the byte array factory
method

GSSManager.createName

and specifying the NT_EXPORT_NAME as the name
type object identifier. The resulting

GSSName

name will
also be a MN.

**Returns:**
- a byte[] containing the exported name. RFC 2743 defines the
"Mechanism-Independent Exported Name Object Format" for these bytes.

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.BAD_NAME

,

GSSException.BAD_NAMETYPE

,

GSSException.FAILURE

---

#### String
toString()

Returns a textual representation of the

GSSName

object. To retrieve
the printed name format, which determines the syntax of the returned
string, use the

getStringNameType

method.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a String representing this name in printable form.

---

#### Oid
getStringNameType()
throws
GSSException

Returns the name type of the printable
representation of this name that can be obtained from the

toString

method.

**Returns:**
- an Oid representing the namespace of the name returned
from the toString method.

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.FAILURE

---

#### boolean isAnonymous()

Tests if this name object represents an anonymous entity.

**Returns:**
- true if this is an anonymous name, false otherwise.

---

#### boolean isMN()

Tests if this name object represents a Mechanism Name (MN). An MN is
a GSSName the contains exactly one mechanism's primitive name
element.

**Returns:**
- true if this is an MN, false otherwise.

major error codes:

GSSException.BAD_NAMETYPE

,

GSSException.FAILURE

- equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
another)
```

Compares this

GSSName

object to another Object that might be a

GSSName

. The behaviour is exactly the same as in

equals

except that no GSSException is thrown;
instead, false will be returned in the situation where an error
occurs.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** another

- the object to compare this name to
**Returns:** true if the object to compare to is also a

GSSName

and the two
names refer to the same entity.
**See Also:** equals(GSSName)

- hashCode

```java
int hashCode()
```

Returns a hashcode value for this GSSName.

**Overrides:** hashCode

```

Creates a name that is canonicalized for some
mechanism.

**Parameters:** mech

- the oid for the mechanism for which the canonical form of
the name is requested.
**Returns:** a

GSSName

that contains just one primitive
element representing this name in a canonicalized form for the desired
mechanism.
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

- export

```java
byte[] export()
throws
GSSException
```

Returns a canonical contiguous byte representation of a mechanism name
(MN), suitable for direct, byte by byte comparison by authorization
functions. If the name is not an MN, implementations may throw a
GSSException with the NAME_NOT_MN status code. If an implementation
chooses not to throw an exception, it should use some system specific
default mechanism to canonicalize the name and then export
it. Structurally, an exported name object consists of a header
containing an OID identifying the mechanism that authenticated the
name, and a trailer containing the name itself, where the syntax of
the trailer is defined by the individual mechanism specification. The
format of the header of the output buffer is specified in RFC 2743.

The exported name is useful when used in large access control lists
where the overhead of creating a

GSSName

object on each
name and invoking the equals method on each name from the ACL may be
prohibitive.

Exported names may be re-imported by using the byte array factory
method

GSSManager.createName

and specifying the NT_EXPORT_NAME as the name
type object identifier. The resulting

GSSName

name will
also be a MN.

**Returns:** a byte[] containing the exported name. RFC 2743 defines the
"Mechanism-Independent Exported Name Object Format" for these bytes.
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.BAD_NAME

,

GSSException.BAD_NAMETYPE

,

GSSException.FAILURE

- toString

```java
String
toString()
```

Returns a textual representation of the

GSSName

object. To retrieve
the printed name format, which determines the syntax of the returned
string, use the

getStringNameType

method.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a String representing this name in printable form.

- getStringNameType

```java
Oid
getStringNameType()
throws
GSSException
```

Returns the name type of the printable
representation of this name that can be obtained from the

toString

method.

**Returns:** an Oid representing the namespace of the name returned
from the toString method.
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.FAILURE

- isAnonymous
