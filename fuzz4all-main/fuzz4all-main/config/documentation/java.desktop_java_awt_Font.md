# Class Font

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\Font.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Font

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

The

Font

class represents fonts, which are used to
render text in a visible way.
A font provides the information needed to map sequences of

characters

to sequences of

glyphs

and to render sequences of glyphs on

Graphics

and

Component

objects.

Characters and Glyphs

A

character

is a symbol that represents an item such as a letter,
a digit, or punctuation in an abstract way. For example,

'g'

,
LATIN SMALL LETTER G, is a character.

A

glyph

is a shape used to render a character or a sequence of
characters. In simple writing systems, such as Latin, typically one glyph
represents one character. In general, however, characters and glyphs do not
have one-to-one correspondence. For example, the character 'á'
LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE, can be represented by
two glyphs: one for 'a' and one for '´'. On the other hand, the
two-character string "fi" can be represented by a single glyph, an
"fi" ligature. In complex writing systems, such as Arabic or the South
and South-East Asian writing systems, the relationship between characters
and glyphs can be more complicated and involve context-dependent selection
of glyphs as well as glyph reordering.

A font encapsulates the collection of glyphs needed to render a selected set
of characters as well as the tables needed to map sequences of characters to
corresponding sequences of glyphs.

Physical and Logical Fonts

The Java Platform distinguishes between two kinds of fonts:

physical

fonts and

logical

fonts.

Physical

fonts are the actual font libraries containing glyph data
and tables to map from character sequences to glyph sequences, using a font
technology such as TrueType or PostScript Type 1.
All implementations of the Java Platform must support TrueType fonts;
support for other font technologies is implementation dependent.
Physical fonts may use names such as Helvetica, Palatino, HonMincho, or
any number of other font names.
Typically, each physical font supports only a limited set of writing
systems, for example, only Latin characters or only Japanese and Basic
Latin.
The set of available physical fonts varies between configurations.
Applications that require specific fonts can bundle them and instantiate
them using the

createFont

method.

Logical

fonts are the five font families defined by the Java
platform which must be supported by any Java runtime environment:
Serif, SansSerif, Monospaced, Dialog, and DialogInput.
These logical fonts are not actual font libraries. Instead, the logical
font names are mapped to physical fonts by the Java runtime environment.
The mapping is implementation and usually locale dependent, so the look
and the metrics provided by them vary.
Typically, each logical font name maps to several physical fonts in order to
cover a large range of characters.

Peered AWT components, such as

Label

and

TextField

, can only use logical fonts.

For a discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of using
physical or logical fonts, see the

Physical and Logical Fonts

in

The Java Tutorials

document.

Font Faces and Names

A

Font

can have many faces, such as heavy, medium, oblique, gothic and
regular. All of these faces have similar typographic design.

There are three different names that you can get from a

Font

object. The

logical font name

is simply the
name that was used to construct the font.
The

font face name

, or just

font name

for
short, is the name of a particular font face, like Helvetica Bold. The

family name

is the name of the font family that determines the
typographic design across several faces, like Helvetica.

The

Font

class represents an instance of a font face from
a collection of font faces that are present in the system resources
of the host system. As examples, Arial Bold and Courier Bold Italic
are font faces. There can be several

Font

objects
associated with a font face, each differing in size, style, transform
and font features.

Glyphs may not always be rendered with the requested properties (e.g, font
and style) due to platform limitations such as the absence of suitable
platform fonts to implement a logical font.

The

getAllFonts

method
of the

GraphicsEnvironment

class returns an
array of all font faces available in the system. These font faces are
returned as

Font

objects with a size of 1, identity
transform and default font features. These
base fonts can then be used to derive new

Font

objects
with varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features via the

deriveFont

methods in this class.

Font and TextAttribute

Font

supports most

TextAttribute

s. This makes some operations, such as
rendering underlined text, convenient since it is not
necessary to explicitly construct a

TextLayout

object.
Attributes can be set on a Font by constructing or deriving it
using a

Map

of

TextAttribute

values.

The values of some

TextAttributes

are not
serializable, and therefore attempting to serialize an instance of

Font

that has such values will not serialize them.
This means a Font deserialized from such a stream will not compare
equal to the original Font that contained the non-serializable
attributes. This should very rarely pose a problem
since these attributes are typically used only in special
circumstances and are unlikely to be serialized.

- FOREGROUND

and

BACKGROUND

use

Paint

values. The subclass

Color

is
serializable, while

GradientPaint

and

TexturePaint

are not.
- CHAR_REPLACEMENT

uses

GraphicAttribute

values. The subclasses

ShapeGraphicAttribute

and

ImageGraphicAttribute

are not serializable.
- INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT

uses

InputMethodHighlight

values, which are
not serializable. See

InputMethodHighlight

.

Clients who create custom subclasses of

Paint

and

GraphicAttribute

can make them serializable and
avoid this problem. Clients who use input method highlights can
convert these to the platform-specific attributes for that
highlight on the current platform and set them on the Font as
a workaround.

The

Map

-based constructor and

deriveFont

APIs ignore the FONT attribute, and it is
not retained by the Font; the static

getFont(java.util.Map<? extends java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute, ?>)

method should
be used if the FONT attribute might be present. See

TextAttribute.FONT

for more information.

Several attributes will cause additional rendering overhead
and potentially invoke layout. If a

Font

has such
attributes, the

hasLayoutAttributes()

method
will return true.

Note: Font rotations can cause text baselines to be rotated. In
order to account for this (rare) possibility, font APIs are
specified to return metrics and take parameters 'in
baseline-relative coordinates'. This maps the 'x' coordinate to
the advance along the baseline, (positive x is forward along the
baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance along the
perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (positive y is 90 degrees
clockwise from the baseline vector). APIs for which this is
especially important are called out as having 'baseline-relative
coordinates.'

### Constructor Details

#### public Font​(
String
name,
int style,
int size)

Creates a new

Font

from the specified name, style and
point size.

The font name can be a font face name or a font family name.
It is used together with the style to find an appropriate font face.
When a font family name is specified, the style argument is used to
select the most appropriate face from the family. When a font face
name is specified, the face's style and the style argument are
merged to locate the best matching font from the same family.
For example if face name "Arial Bold" is specified with style

Font.ITALIC

, the font system looks for a face in the
"Arial" family that is bold and italic, and may associate the font
instance with the physical font face "Arial Bold Italic".
The style argument is merged with the specified face's style, not
added or subtracted.
This means, specifying a bold face and a bold style does not
double-embolden the font, and specifying a bold face and a plain
style does not lighten the font.

If no face for the requested style can be found, the font system
may apply algorithmic styling to achieve the desired style.
For example, if

ITALIC

is requested, but no italic
face is available, glyphs from the plain face may be algorithmically
obliqued (slanted).

Font name lookup is case insensitive, using the case folding
rules of the US locale.

If the

name

parameter represents something other than a
logical font, i.e. is interpreted as a physical font face or family, and
this cannot be mapped by the implementation to a physical font or a
compatible alternative, then the font system will map the Font
instance to "Dialog", such that for example, the family as reported
by

getFamily

will be "Dialog".

**Parameters:**
- name

- the font name. This can be a font face name or a font
family name, and may represent either a logical font or a physical
font found in this

GraphicsEnvironment

.
The family names for logical fonts are: Dialog, DialogInput,
Monospaced, Serif, or SansSerif. Pre-defined String constants exist
for all of these names, for example,

DIALOG

. If

name

is

null

, the

logical font name

of the new

Font

as returned by

getName()

is set to
the name "Default".
- style

- the style constant for the

Font

The style argument is an integer bitmask that may
be

PLAIN

, or a bitwise union of

BOLD

and/or

ITALIC

(for example,

ITALIC

or

BOLD|ITALIC

).
If the style argument does not conform to one of the expected
integer bitmasks then the style is set to

PLAIN

.
- size

- the point size of the

Font

**See Also:**
- GraphicsEnvironment.getAllFonts()

,

GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames()

**Since:**
- 1.0

#### public Font​(
Map
<? extends
AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
,​?> attributes)

Creates a new

Font

with the specified attributes.
Only keys defined in

TextAttribute

are recognized. In addition the FONT attribute is
not recognized by this constructor
(see

getAvailableAttributes()

). Only attributes that have
values of valid types will affect the new

Font

.

If

attributes

is

null

, a new

Font

is initialized with default values.

**Parameters:**
- attributes

- the attributes to assign to the new

Font

, or

null

**See Also:**
- TextAttribute

---

#### protected Font​(
Font
font)

Creates a new

Font

from the specified

font

.
This constructor is intended for use by subclasses.

**Parameters:**
- font

- from which to create this

Font

.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

font

is null

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

### Method Details

#### public static boolean textRequiresLayout​(char[] chars,
int start,
int end)

Returns true if any part of the specified text is from a
complex script for which the implementation will need to invoke
layout processing in order to render correctly when using

drawString(String,int,int)

and other text rendering methods. Measurement of the text
may similarly need the same extra processing.
The

start

and

end

indices are provided so that
the application can request only a subset of the text be considered.
The last char index examined is at

"end-1"

,
i.e a request to examine the entire array would be

```java
Font.textRequiresLayout(chars, 0, chars.length);
```

An application may find this information helpful in
performance sensitive code.

Note that even if this method returns

false

, layout processing
may still be invoked when used with any

Font

for which

hasLayoutAttributes()

returns

true

,
so that method will need to be consulted for the specific font,
in order to obtain an answer which accounts for such font attributes.

**Parameters:**
- chars

- the text.
- start

- the index of the first char to examine.
- end

- the ending index, exclusive.

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified text will need special layout.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

chars

is null.
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

start

is negative or

end

is greater than the length of the

chars

array.

**Since:**
- 9

#### public static
Font
getFont​(
Map
<? extends
AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
,​?> attributes)

Returns a

Font

appropriate to the attributes.
If

attributes

contains a

FONT

attribute
with a valid

Font

as its value, it will be
merged with any remaining attributes. See

TextAttribute.FONT

for more
information.

**Parameters:**
- attributes

- the attributes to assign to the new

Font

**Returns:**
- a new

Font

created with the specified
attributes

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

attributes

is null.

**See Also:**
- TextAttribute

**Since:**
- 1.2

#### public static
Font
[] createFonts​(
InputStream
fontStream)
throws
FontFormatException
,

IOException

Returns a new array of

Font

decoded from the specified stream.
The returned

Font[]

will have at least one element.

The explicit purpose of this variation on the

createFont(int, InputStream)

method is to support font
sources which represent a TrueType/OpenType font collection and
be able to return all individual fonts in that collection.
Consequently this method will throw

FontFormatException

if the data source does not contain at least one TrueType/OpenType
font. The same exception will also be thrown if any of the fonts in
the collection does not contain the required font tables.

The condition "at least one", allows for the stream to represent
a single OpenType/TrueType font. That is, it does not have to be
a collection.
Each

Font

element of the returned array is
created with a point size of 1 and style

PLAIN

.
This base font can then be used with the

deriveFont

methods in this class to derive new

Font

objects with
varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features.

This method does not close the

InputStream

.

To make each

Font

available to Font constructors it
must be registered in the

GraphicsEnvironment

by calling

registerFont(Font)

.

**Parameters:**
- fontStream

- an

InputStream

object representing the
input data for the font or font collection.

**Returns:**
- a new

Font[]

.

**Throws:**
- FontFormatException

- if the

fontStream

data does
not contain the required font tables for any of the elements of
the collection, or if it contains no fonts at all.
- IOException

- if the

fontStream

cannot be completely read.

**See Also:**
- GraphicsEnvironment.registerFont(Font)

**Since:**
- 9

#### public static
Font
[] createFonts​(
File
fontFile)
throws
FontFormatException
,

IOException

Returns a new array of

Font

decoded from the specified file.
The returned

Font[]

will have at least one element.

The explicit purpose of this variation on the

createFont(int, File)

method is to support font
sources which represent a TrueType/OpenType font collection and
be able to return all individual fonts in that collection.
Consequently this method will throw

FontFormatException

if the data source does not contain at least one TrueType/OpenType
font. The same exception will also be thrown if any of the fonts in
the collection does not contain the required font tables.

The condition "at least one", allows for the stream to represent
a single OpenType/TrueType font. That is, it does not have to be
a collection.
Each

Font

element of the returned array is
created with a point size of 1 and style

PLAIN

.
This base font can then be used with the

deriveFont

methods in this class to derive new

Font

objects with
varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features.

To make each

Font

available to Font constructors it
must be registered in the

GraphicsEnvironment

by calling

registerFont(Font)

.

**Parameters:**
- fontFile

- a

File

object containing the
input data for the font or font collection.

**Returns:**
- a new

Font[]

.

**Throws:**
- FontFormatException

- if the

File

does
not contain the required font tables for any of the elements of
the collection, or if it contains no fonts at all.
- IOException

- if the

fontFile

cannot be read.

methods in this class to derive new

Font

objects with
varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features. This
method does not close the

InputStream

.

To make the

Font

available to Font constructors the

#### public static
Font
createFont​(int fontFormat,

File
fontFile)
throws
FontFormatException
,

IOException

Returns a new

Font

using the specified font type
and the specified font file. The new

Font

is
created with a point size of 1 and style

PLAIN

.
This base font can then be used with the

objects with
varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features.

**Parameters:**
- fontFormat

- the type of the

Font

, which is

TRUETYPE_FONT

if a TrueType resource is
specified or

TYPE1_FONT

if a Type 1 resource is
specified.
So long as the returned font, or its derived fonts are referenced
the implementation may continue to access

fontFile

to retrieve font data. Thus the results are undefined if the file
is changed, or becomes inaccessible.

To make the

Font

available to Font constructors the
returned

Font

must be registered in the

GraphicsEnvironment

by calling

registerFont(Font)

.

#### public
AffineTransform
getTransform()

Returns a copy of the transform associated with this

Font

. This transform is not necessarily the one
used to construct the font. If the font has algorithmic
superscripting or width adjustment, this will be incorporated
into the returned

AffineTransform

.

should call

isTransformed()

first, and only call this
method if

isTransformed

returns true.

**Returns:**
- an

AffineTransform

object representing the
transform attribute of this

Font

object.

---

#### public int getSize()

Returns the point size of this

Font

, rounded to
an integer.
Most users are familiar with the idea of using

point size

to
specify the size of glyphs in a font. This point size defines a
measurement between the baseline of one line to the baseline of the
following line in a single spaced text document. The point size is
based on

typographic points

, approximately 1/72 of an inch.

The Java(tm)2D API adopts the convention that one point is
equivalent to one unit in user coordinates. When using a
normalized transform for converting user space coordinates to
device space coordinates 72 user
space units equal 1 inch in device space. In this case one point

#### public static
Font
getFont​(
String
nm)

Returns a

Font

object from the system properties list.

nm

is treated as the name of a system property to be
obtained. The

String

value of this property is then
interpreted as a

Font

object according to the
specification of

Font.decode(String)

If the specified property is not found, or the executing code does
not have permission to read the property, null is returned instead.

**Parameters:**
- nm

- the property name

**Returns:**
- a

Font

object that the property name
describes, or null if no such property exists.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if nm is null.

**See Also:**
- decode(String)

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public static
Font
decode​(
String
str)

Returns the

Font

that the

str

argument describes.
To ensure that this method returns the desired Font,
format the

str

parameter in
one of these ways

- fontname-style-pointsize

fontname-pointsize

fontname-style

fontname

fontname style pointsize

fontname pointsize

fontname style

fontname

in which

style

is one of the four
case-insensitive strings:

"PLAIN"

,

"BOLD"

,

"BOLDITALIC"

, or

"ITALIC"

, and pointsize is a positive decimal integer
representation of the point size.
For example, if you want a font that is Arial, bold, with
a point size of 18, you would call this method with:
"Arial-BOLD-18".
This is equivalent to calling the Font constructor :

new Font("Arial", Font.BOLD, 18);

and the values are interpreted as specified by that constructor.

A valid trailing decimal field is always interpreted as the pointsize.
Therefore a fontname containing a trailing decimal value should not
be used in the fontname only form.

If a style name field is not one of the valid style strings, it is
interpreted as part of the font name, and the default style is used.

Only one of ' ' or '-' may be used to separate fields in the input.
The identified separator is the one closest to the end of the string
which separates a valid pointsize, or a valid style name from
the rest of the string.
Null (empty) pointsize and style fields are treated
as valid fields with the default value for that field.

Some font names may include the separator characters ' ' or '-'.
If

str

is not formed with 3 components, e.g. such that

style

or

pointsize

fields are not present in

str

, and

fontname

also contains a
character determined to be the separator character
then these characters where they appear as intended to be part of

fontname

may instead be interpreted as separators
so the font name may not be properly recognised.

The default size is 12 and the default style is PLAIN.
If

str

does not specify a valid size, the returned

Font

has a size of 12. If

str

does not
specify a valid style, the returned Font has a style of PLAIN.
If you do not specify a valid font name in
the

str

argument, this method will return
a font with the family name "Dialog".
To determine what font family names are available on
your system, use the

GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames()

method.
If

str

is

null

, a new

Font

is returned with the family name "Dialog", a size of 12 and a
PLAIN style.

**Parameters:**
- str

- the name of the font, or

null

**Returns:**
- the

Font

object that

str

describes, or a new default

Font

if

str

is

null

.

Font
getFont​(
String
nm,

Font
font)

interpreted as a

Font

object.

Font.decode(String)

If the specified property is not found, or the executing code does not
have permission to read the property, the

font

argument is returned instead.

#### public
GlyphVector
layoutGlyphVector​(
FontRenderContext
frc,
char[] text,
int start,
int limit,
int flags)

Returns a new

GlyphVector

object, performing full
layout of the text if possible. Full layout is required for
complex text, such as Arabic or Hindi. Support for different
scripts depends on the font and implementation.

Layout requires bidi analysis, as performed by

Bidi

, and should only be performed on text that
has a uniform direction. The direction is indicated in the
flags parameter,by using LAYOUT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT to indicate a
right-to-left (Arabic and Hebrew) run direction, or
LAYOUT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT to indicate a left-to-right (English)
run direction.

In addition, some operations, such as Arabic shaping, require
context, so that the characters at the start and limit can have
the proper shapes. Sometimes the data in the buffer outside
the provided range does not have valid data. The values
LAYOUT_NO_START_CONTEXT and LAYOUT_NO_LIMIT_CONTEXT can be
added to the flags parameter to indicate that the text before
start, or after limit, respectively, should not be examined
for context.

All other values for the flags parameter are reserved.

**Parameters:**
- frc

- the specified

FontRenderContext
- text

- the text to layout
- start

- the start of the text to use for the

GlyphVector

The

Font

class represents fonts, which are used to
render text in a visible way.
A font provides the information needed to map sequences of

characters

to sequences of

glyphs

and to render sequences of glyphs on

Graphics

and

Component

objects.

Characters and Glyphs

A

character

is a symbol that represents an item such as a letter,
a digit, or punctuation in an abstract way. For example,

'g'

,
LATIN SMALL LETTER G, is a character.

A

glyph

is a shape used to render a character or a sequence of
characters. In simple writing systems, such as Latin, typically one glyph
represents one character. In general, however, characters and glyphs do not
have one-to-one correspondence. For example, the character 'á'
LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE, can be represented by
two glyphs: one for 'a' and one for '´'. On the other hand, the
two-character string "fi" can be represented by a single glyph, an
"fi" ligature. In complex writing systems, such as Arabic or the South
and South-East Asian writing systems, the relationship between characters
and glyphs can be more complicated and involve context-dependent selection
of glyphs as well as glyph reordering.

A font encapsulates the collection of glyphs needed to render a selected set
of characters as well as the tables needed to map sequences of characters to
corresponding sequences of glyphs.

Physical and Logical Fonts

The Java Platform distinguishes between two kinds of fonts:

physical

fonts and

logical

fonts.

Physical

fonts are the actual font libraries containing glyph data
and tables to map from character sequences to glyph sequences, using a font
technology such as TrueType or PostScript Type 1.
All implementations of the Java Platform must support TrueType fonts;
support for other font technologies is implementation dependent.
Physical fonts may use names such as Helvetica, Palatino, HonMincho, or
any number of other font names.
Typically, each physical font supports only a limited set of writing
systems, for example, only Latin characters or only Japanese and Basic
Latin.
The set of available physical fonts varies between configurations.
Applications that require specific fonts can bundle them and instantiate
them using the

createFont

method.

Logical

fonts are the five font families defined by the Java
platform which must be supported by any Java runtime environment:
Serif, SansSerif, Monospaced, Dialog, and DialogInput.
These logical fonts are not actual font libraries. Instead, the logical
font names are mapped to physical fonts by the Java runtime environment.
The mapping is implementation and usually locale dependent, so the look
and the metrics provided by them vary.
Typically, each logical font name maps to several physical fonts in order to
cover a large range of characters.

Peered AWT components, such as

Label

and

TextField

, can only use logical fonts.

For a discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of using
physical or logical fonts, see the

Physical and Logical Fonts

in

The Java Tutorials

document.

Font Faces and Names

A

Font

can have many faces, such as heavy, medium, oblique, gothic and
regular. All of these faces have similar typographic design.

There are three different names that you can get from a

Font

object. The

logical font name

is simply the
name that was used to construct the font.
The

font face name

, or just

font name

for
short, is the name of a particular font face, like Helvetica Bold. The

family name

is the name of the font family that determines the
typographic design across several faces, like Helvetica.

The

Font

class represents an instance of a font face from
a collection of font faces that are present in the system resources
of the host system. As examples, Arial Bold and Courier Bold Italic
are font faces. There can be several

Font

objects
associated with a font face, each differing in size, style, transform
and font features.

Glyphs may not always be rendered with the requested properties (e.g, font
and style) due to platform limitations such as the absence of suitable
platform fonts to implement a logical font.

The

getAllFonts

method
of the

GraphicsEnvironment

class returns an
array of all font faces available in the system. These font faces are
returned as

Font

objects with a size of 1, identity
transform and default font features. These
base fonts can then be used to derive new

Font

objects
with varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features via the

deriveFont

methods in this class.

Font and TextAttribute

Font

supports most

TextAttribute

s. This makes some operations, such as
rendering underlined text, convenient since it is not
necessary to explicitly construct a

TextLayout

object.
Attributes can be set on a Font by constructing or deriving it
using a

Map

of

TextAttribute

values.

The values of some

TextAttributes

are not
serializable, and therefore attempting to serialize an instance of

Font

that has such values will not serialize them.
This means a Font deserialized from such a stream will not compare
equal to the original Font that contained the non-serializable
attributes. This should very rarely pose a problem
since these attributes are typically used only in special
circumstances and are unlikely to be serialized.

- FOREGROUND

and

BACKGROUND

use

Paint

values. The subclass

Color

is
serializable, while

GradientPaint

and

TexturePaint

are not.
- CHAR_REPLACEMENT

uses

GraphicAttribute

values. The subclasses

ShapeGraphicAttribute

and

ImageGraphicAttribute

are not serializable.
- INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT

uses

InputMethodHighlight

values, which are
not serializable. See

InputMethodHighlight

.

Clients who create custom subclasses of

Paint

and

GraphicAttribute

can make them serializable and
avoid this problem. Clients who use input method highlights can
convert these to the platform-specific attributes for that
highlight on the current platform and set them on the Font as
a workaround.

The

Map

-based constructor and

deriveFont

APIs ignore the FONT attribute, and it is
not retained by the Font; the static

getFont(java.util.Map<? extends java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute, ?>)

method should
be used if the FONT attribute might be present. See

TextAttribute.FONT

for more information.

Several attributes will cause additional rendering overhead
and potentially invoke layout. If a

Font

has such
attributes, the

hasLayoutAttributes()

method
will return true.

Note: Font rotations can cause text baselines to be rotated. In
order to account for this (rare) possibility, font APIs are
specified to return metrics and take parameters 'in
baseline-relative coordinates'. This maps the 'x' coordinate to
the advance along the baseline, (positive x is forward along the
baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance along the
perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (positive y is 90 degrees
clockwise from the baseline vector). APIs for which this is
especially important are called out as having 'baseline-relative
coordinates.'

Font Faces and Names

A

Font

can have many faces, such as heavy, medium, oblique, gothic and
regular. All of these faces have similar typographic design.

There are three different names that you can get from a

Font

object. The

logical font name

is simply the
name that was used to construct the font.
The

font face name

, or just

font name

for
short, is the name of a particular font face, like Helvetica Bold. The

family name

is the name of the font family that determines the
typographic design across several faces, like Helvetica.

The

Font

class represents an instance of a font face from
a collection of font faces that are present in the system resources
of the host system. As examples, Arial Bold and Courier Bold Italic
are font faces. There can be several

Font

objects
associated with a font face, each differing in size, style, transform
and font features.

Glyphs may not always be rendered with the requested properties (e.g, font
and style) due to platform limitations such as the absence of suitable
platform fonts to implement a logical font.

The

getAllFonts

method
of the

GraphicsEnvironment

class returns an
array of all font faces available in the system. These font faces are
returned as

Font

objects with a size of 1, identity
transform and default font features. These
base fonts can then be used to derive new

Font

objects
with varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features via the

deriveFont

methods in this class.

Font and TextAttribute

Font

supports most

TextAttribute

s. This makes some operations, such as
rendering underlined text, convenient since it is not
necessary to explicitly construct a

TextLayout

object.
Attributes can be set on a Font by constructing or deriving it
using a

Map

of

TextAttribute

values.

The values of some

TextAttributes

are not
serializable, and therefore attempting to serialize an instance of

Font

that has such values will not serialize them.
This means a Font deserialized from such a stream will not compare
equal to the original Font that contained the non-serializable
attributes. This should very rarely pose a problem
since these attributes are typically used only in special
circumstances and are unlikely to be serialized.

- FOREGROUND

and

BACKGROUND

use

Paint

values. The subclass

Color

is
serializable, while

GradientPaint

and

TexturePaint

are not.
- CHAR_REPLACEMENT

uses

GraphicAttribute

values. The subclasses

ShapeGraphicAttribute

and

ImageGraphicAttribute

are not serializable.
- INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT

uses

InputMethodHighlight

values, which are
not serializable. See

InputMethodHighlight

.

Clients who create custom subclasses of

Paint

and

GraphicAttribute

can make them serializable and
avoid this problem. Clients who use input method highlights can
convert these to the platform-specific attributes for that
highlight on the current platform and set them on the Font as
a workaround.

The

Map

-based constructor and

deriveFont

APIs ignore the FONT attribute, and it is
not retained by the Font; the static

getFont(java.util.Map<? extends java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute, ?>)

method should
be used if the FONT attribute might be present. See

TextAttribute.FONT

for more information.

Several attributes will cause additional rendering overhead
and potentially invoke layout. If a

Font

has such
attributes, the

hasLayoutAttributes()

method
will return true.

Note: Font rotations can cause text baselines to be rotated. In
order to account for this (rare) possibility, font APIs are
specified to return metrics and take parameters 'in
baseline-relative coordinates'. This maps the 'x' coordinate to
the advance along the baseline, (positive x is forward along the
baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance along the
perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (positive y is 90 degrees
clockwise from the baseline vector). APIs for which this is
especially important are called out as having 'baseline-relative
coordinates.'

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- Font

```java
public Font​(
String
name,
int style,
int size)
```

Creates a new

Font

from the specified name, style and
point size.

The font name can be a font face name or a font family name.
It is used together with the style to find an appropriate font face.
When a font family name is specified, the style argument is used to
select the most appropriate face from the family. When a font face
name is specified, the face's style and the style argument are
merged to locate the best matching font from the same family.
For example if face name "Arial Bold" is specified with style

Font.ITALIC

, the font system looks for a face in the
"Arial" family that is bold and italic, and may associate the font
instance with the physical font face "Arial Bold Italic".
The style argument is merged with the specified face's style, not
added or subtracted.
This means, specifying a bold face and a bold style does not
double-embolden the font, and specifying a bold face and a plain
style does not lighten the font.

If no face for the requested style can be found, the font system
may apply algorithmic styling to achieve the desired style.
For example, if

ITALIC

is requested, but no italic
face is available, glyphs from the plain face may be algorithmically
obliqued (slanted).

Font name lookup is case insensitive, using the case folding
rules of the US locale.

If the

name

parameter represents something other than a
logical font, i.e. is interpreted as a physical font face or family, and
this cannot be mapped by the implementation to a physical font or a
compatible alternative, then the font system will map the Font
instance to "Dialog", such that for example, the family as reported
by

getFamily

will be "Dialog".

**Parameters:** name

- the font name. This can be a font face name or a font
family name, and may represent either a logical font or a physical
font found in this

GraphicsEnvironment

.
The family names for logical fonts are: Dialog, DialogInput,
Monospaced, Serif, or SansSerif. Pre-defined String constants exist
for all of these names, for example,

DIALOG

. If

name

is

null

, the

logical font name

of the new

Font

as returned by

getName()

is set to
the name "Default".
**Parameters:** style

- the style constant for the

Font

The style argument is an integer bitmask that may
be

PLAIN

, or a bitwise union of

BOLD

and/or

ITALIC

(for example,

ITALIC

or

BOLD|ITALIC

).
If the style argument does not conform to one of the expected
integer bitmasks then the style is set to

PLAIN

.
**Parameters:** size

- the point size of the

Font
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.getAllFonts()

,

GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames()

- Font

```java
public Font​(
Map
<? extends
AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
,​?> attributes)
```

Creates a new

Font

with the specified attributes.
Only keys defined in

TextAttribute

are recognized. In addition the FONT attribute is
not recognized by this constructor
(see

getAvailableAttributes()

). Only attributes that have
values of valid types will affect the new

Font

.

If

attributes

is

null

, a new

Font

is initialized with default values.

**Parameters:** attributes

- the attributes to assign to the new

Font

, or

null
**See Also:** TextAttribute

- Font

```java
protected Font​(
Font
font)
```

Creates a new

Font

from the specified

font

.
This constructor is intended for use by subclasses.

**Parameters:** font

- from which to create this

Font

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

font

is null
**Since:** 1.6

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- textRequiresLayout

```java
public static boolean textRequiresLayout​(char[] chars,
int start,
int end)
```

Returns true if any part of the specified text is from a
complex script for which the implementation will need to invoke
layout processing in order to render correctly when using

drawString(String,int,int)

and other text rendering methods. Measurement of the text
may similarly need the same extra processing.
The

start

and

end

indices are provided so that
the application can request only a subset of the text be considered.
The last char index examined is at

"end-1"

,
i.e a request to examine the entire array would be

```java
Font.textRequiresLayout(chars, 0, chars.length);
```

An application may find this information helpful in
performance sensitive code.

Note that even if this method returns

false

, layout processing
may still be invoked when used with any

Font

for which

hasLayoutAttributes()

returns

true

,
so that method will need to be consulted for the specific font,
in order to obtain an answer which accounts for such font attributes.

**Parameters:** chars

- the text.
**Parameters:** start

- the index of the first char to examine.
**Parameters:** end

- the ending index, exclusive.
**Returns:** true

if the specified text will need special layout.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

chars

is null.
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

start

is negative or

end

is greater than the length of the

chars

array.
**Since:** 9

- getFont

```java
public static
Font
getFont​(
Map
<? extends
AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
,​?> attributes)
```

Returns a

Font

appropriate to the attributes.
If

attributes

contains a

FONT

attribute
with a valid

Font

as its value, it will be
merged with any remaining attributes. See

TextAttribute.FONT

for more
information.

**Parameters:** attributes

- the attributes to assign to the new

Font
**Returns:** a new

Font

created with the specified
attributes
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

attributes

is null.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** TextAttribute

- createFonts

```java
public static
Font
[] createFonts​(
InputStream
fontStream)
throws
FontFormatException
,

IOException
```

Returns a new array of

Font

decoded from the specified stream.
The returned

Font[]

will have at least one element.

The explicit purpose of this variation on the

createFont(int, InputStream)

method is to support font
sources which represent a TrueType/OpenType font collection and
be able to return all individual fonts in that collection.
Consequently this method will throw

FontFormatException

if the data source does not contain at least one TrueType/OpenType
font. The same exception will also be thrown if any of the fonts in
the collection does not contain the required font tables.

The condition "at least one", allows for the stream to represent
a single OpenType/TrueType font. That is, it does not have to be
a collection.
Each

Font

element of the returned array is
created with a point size of 1 and style

PLAIN

.
This base font can then be used with the

deriveFont

methods in this class to derive new

Font

objects with
varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features.

This method does not close the

InputStream

.

To make each

Font

available to Font constructors it
must be registered in the

GraphicsEnvironment

by calling

registerFont(Font)

.

**Parameters:** fontStream

- an

InputStream

object representing the
input data for the font or font collection.
**Returns:** a new

Font[]

.
**Throws:** FontFormatException

- if the

fontStream

data does
not contain the required font tables for any of the elements of
the collection, or if it contains no fonts at all.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the

fontStream

cannot be completely read.
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.registerFont(Font)

- createFonts

```java
public static
Font
[] createFonts​(
File
fontFile)
throws
FontFormatException
,

IOException
```

Returns a new array of

Font

decoded from the specified file.
The returned

Font[]

will have at least one element.

The explicit purpose of this variation on the

createFont(int, File)

method is to support font
sources which represent a TrueType/OpenType font collection and
be able to return all individual fonts in that collection.
Consequently this method will throw

FontFormatException

if the data source does not contain at least one TrueType/OpenType
font. The same exception will also be thrown if any of the fonts in
the collection does not contain the required font tables.

The condition "at least one", allows for the stream to represent
a single OpenType/TrueType font. That is, it does not have to be
a collection.
Each

Font

element of the returned array is
created with a point size of 1 and style

PLAIN

.
This base font can then be used with the

deriveFont

methods in this class to derive new

Font

objects with
varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features.

To make each

Font

available to Font constructors it
must be registered in the

GraphicsEnvironment

by calling

registerFont(Font)

.

**Parameters:** fontFile

- a

File

object containing the
input data for the font or font collection.
**Returns:** a new

Font[]

.

- createFont

```java
public static
Font
createFont​(int fontFormat,

InputStream
fontStream)
throws
FontFormatException
,

IOException
```

Returns a new

Font

using the specified font type
and input data. The new

Font

is
created with a point size of 1 and style

PLAIN

.
This base font can then be used with the

deriveFont

methods in this class to derive new

Font

objects with
varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features. This
method does not close the

InputStream

.

To make the

Font

available to Font constructors the
returned

Font

must be registered in the

GraphicsEnvironment

by calling

registerFont(Font)

.

**Parameters:** fontFormat

- the type of the

Font

, which is

TRUETYPE_FONT

if a TrueType resource is specified.
or

TYPE1_FONT

if a Type 1 resource is specified.
**Parameters:** fontStream

- an

InputStream

object representing the
input data for the font.
**Returns:** a new

Font

created with the specified font type.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

public static
Font
createFont​(int fontFormat,

File
fontFile)
throws
FontFormatException
,

IOException
```

Returns a new

Font

using the specified font type
and the specified font file. The new

Font

is
created with a point size of 1 and style

PLAIN

.
This base font can then be used with the

methods in this class to derive new

Font

objects with
varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features.

**Parameters:** fontFormat

- the type of the

Font

, which is

TRUETYPE_FONT

if a TrueType resource is
specified or

TYPE1_FONT

if a Type 1 resource is
specified.
So long as the returned font, or its derived fonts are referenced
the implementation may continue to access

fontFile

to retrieve font data. Thus the results are undefined if the file
is changed, or becomes inaccessible.

To make the

Font

available to Font constructors the
returned

Font

must be registered in the

GraphicsEnvironment

by calling

registerFont(Font)

.
**Parameters:** fontFile

Font

. This transform is not necessarily the one
used to construct the font. If the font has algorithmic
superscripting or width adjustment, this will be incorporated
into the returned

AffineTransform

.

should call

isTransformed()

first, and only call this
method if

isTransformed

returns true.

**Returns:** an

AffineTransform

object representing the
transform attribute of this

Font

object.

- getFamily

- getSize

```java
public int getSize()
```

Returns the point size of this

Font

, rounded to
an integer.
Most users are familiar with the idea of using

point size

to
specify the size of glyphs in a font. This point size defines a
measurement between the baseline of one line to the baseline of the
following line in a single spaced text document. The point size is
based on

typographic points

, approximately 1/72 of an inch.

The Java(tm)2D API adopts the convention that one point is
equivalent to one unit in user coordinates. When using a
normalized transform for converting user space coordinates to
device space coordinates 72 user
space units equal 1 inch in device space. In this case one point
is 1/72 of an inch.

**Returns:** the point size of this

Font

in 1/72 of an
inch units.
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** getSize2D()

,

GraphicsConfiguration.getDefaultTransform()

,

GraphicsConfiguration.getNormalizingTransform()

- getSize2D

```java
public float getSize2D()
```

Returns the point size of this

Font

in

float

value.

**Returns:** the point size of this

Font

value.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** getSize()

- isPlain

```java
public boolean isPlain()
```

Indicates whether or not this

Font

object's style is
PLAIN.

**Returns:** true

if this

Font

has a
PLAIN style;

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** getStyle()

- isBold

```java
public boolean isBold()
```

Indicates whether or not this

Font

object's style is
BOLD.

if this

Font

object's
style is BOLD;

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** getStyle()

- isItalic

```java
public boolean isItalic()
```

Indicates whether or not this

Font

object's style is
ITALIC.

**Returns:** true

if this

Font

object's
style is ITALIC;

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** getStyle()

- isTransformed

```java
public boolean isTransformed()
```

Indicates whether or not this

Font

object has a
transform that affects its size in addition to the Size
attribute.

**Returns:** true

if this

Font

object
has a non-identity AffineTransform attribute.

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** getTransform()

- hasLayoutAttributes

```java
public boolean hasLayoutAttributes()
```

Return true if this Font contains attributes that require extra
layout processing.

**Returns:** true if the font has layout attributes
**Since:** 1.6

- getFont

```java
public static
Font
getFont​(
String
nm)
```

Returns a

Font

object from the system properties list.

nm

is treated as the name of a system property to be
obtained. The

String

value of this property is then
interpreted as a

Font

object according to the
specification of

Font.decode(String)

If the specified property is not found, or the executing code does
not have permission to read the property, null is returned instead.

**Parameters:** nm

- the property name
**Returns:** a

Font

object that the property name
describes, or null if no such property exists.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if nm is null.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** decode(String)

- decode

```java
public static
Font
decode​(
String
str)
```

Returns the

Font

that the

str

argument describes.
To ensure that this method returns the desired Font,
format the

str

parameter in
one of these ways

- fontname-style-pointsize

fontname-pointsize

fontname-style

fontname

fontname style pointsize

fontname pointsize

fontname style

fontname

in which

style

is one of the four
case-insensitive strings:

"PLAIN"

,

"BOLD"

,

"BOLDITALIC"

, or

"ITALIC"

, and pointsize is a positive decimal integer
representation of the point size.
For example, if you want a font that is Arial, bold, with
a point size of 18, you would call this method with:
"Arial-BOLD-18".
This is equivalent to calling the Font constructor :

new Font("Arial", Font.BOLD, 18);

and the values are interpreted as specified by that constructor.

A valid trailing decimal field is always interpreted as the pointsize.
Therefore a fontname containing a trailing decimal value should not
be used in the fontname only form.

If a style name field is not one of the valid style strings, it is
interpreted as part of the font name, and the default style is used.

Only one of ' ' or '-' may be used to separate fields in the input.
The identified separator is the one closest to the end of the string
which separates a valid pointsize, or a valid style name from
the rest of the string.
Null (empty) pointsize and style fields are treated
as valid fields with the default value for that field.

Some font names may include the separator characters ' ' or '-'.
If

str

is not formed with 3 components, e.g. such that

style

or

pointsize

fields are not present in

str

, and

fontname

also contains a
character determined to be the separator character
then these characters where they appear as intended to be part of

fontname

may instead be interpreted as separators
so the font name may not be properly recognised.

The default size is 12 and the default style is PLAIN.
If

str

does not specify a valid size, the returned

Font

has a size of 12. If

str

does not
specify a valid style, the returned Font has a style of PLAIN.
If you do not specify a valid font name in
the

str

argument, this method will return
a font with the family name "Dialog".
To determine what font family names are available on
your system, use the

GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames()

method.
If

str

is

null

, a new

Font

is returned with the family name "Dialog", a size of 12 and a
PLAIN style.

**Parameters:** str

- the name of the font, or

null
**Returns:** the

Font

object that

str

describes, or a new default

Font

if

str

is

object, performing full
layout of the text if possible. Full layout is required for
complex text, such as Arabic or Hindi. Support for different
scripts depends on the font and implementation.

Layout requires bidi analysis, as performed by

Bidi

, and should only be performed on text that
has a uniform direction. The direction is indicated in the
flags parameter,by using LAYOUT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT to indicate a
right-to-left (Arabic and Hebrew) run direction, or
LAYOUT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT to indicate a left-to-right (English)
run direction.

In addition, some operations, such as Arabic shaping, require
context, so that the characters at the start and limit can have
the proper shapes. Sometimes the data in the buffer outside
the provided range does not have valid data. The values
LAYOUT_NO_START_CONTEXT and LAYOUT_NO_LIMIT_CONTEXT can be
added to the flags parameter to indicate that the text before
start, or after limit, respectively, should not be examined
for context.

Constructor Detail

- Font

```java
public Font​(
String
name,
int style,
int size)
```

Creates a new

Font

from the specified name, style and
point size.

The font name can be a font face name or a font family name.
It is used together with the style to find an appropriate font face.
When a font family name is specified, the style argument is used to
select the most appropriate face from the family. When a font face
name is specified, the face's style and the style argument are
merged to locate the best matching font from the same family.
For example if face name "Arial Bold" is specified with style

Font.ITALIC

, the font system looks for a face in the
"Arial" family that is bold and italic, and may associate the font
instance with the physical font face "Arial Bold Italic".
The style argument is merged with the specified face's style, not
added or subtracted.
This means, specifying a bold face and a bold style does not
double-embolden the font, and specifying a bold face and a plain
style does not lighten the font.

If no face for the requested style can be found, the font system
may apply algorithmic styling to achieve the desired style.
For example, if

ITALIC

is requested, but no italic
face is available, glyphs from the plain face may be algorithmically
obliqued (slanted).

Font name lookup is case insensitive, using the case folding
rules of the US locale.

If the

name

parameter represents something other than a
logical font, i.e. is interpreted as a physical font face or family, and
this cannot be mapped by the implementation to a physical font or a
compatible alternative, then the font system will map the Font
instance to "Dialog", such that for example, the family as reported
by

getFamily

will be "Dialog".

**Parameters:** name

- the font name. This can be a font face name or a font
family name, and may represent either a logical font or a physical
font found in this

GraphicsEnvironment

.
The family names for logical fonts are: Dialog, DialogInput,
Monospaced, Serif, or SansSerif. Pre-defined String constants exist
for all of these names, for example,

DIALOG

. If

name

is

null

, the

logical font name

of the new

Font

as returned by

getName()

is set to
the name "Default".
**Parameters:** style

- the style constant for the

Font

The style argument is an integer bitmask that may
be

PLAIN

, or a bitwise union of

BOLD

and/or

ITALIC

(for example,

ITALIC

or

BOLD|ITALIC

).
If the style argument does not conform to one of the expected
integer bitmasks then the style is set to

PLAIN

.
**Parameters:** size

- the point size of the

Font
**Since:** 1.0

,

GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames()

- Font

```java
public Font​(

Method Detail

- textRequiresLayout

```java
public static boolean textRequiresLayout​(char[] chars,
int start,
int end)
```

Returns true if any part of the specified text is from a
complex script for which the implementation will need to invoke
layout processing in order to render correctly when using

drawString(String,int,int)

and other text rendering methods. Measurement of the text
may similarly need the same extra processing.
The

start

and

end

indices are provided so that
the application can request only a subset of the text be considered.
The last char index examined is at

"end-1"

,
i.e a request to examine the entire array would be

```java
Font.textRequiresLayout(chars, 0, chars.length);
```

An application may find this information helpful in
performance sensitive code.

Note that even if this method returns

false

, layout processing
may still be invoked when used with any

Font

for which

hasLayoutAttributes()

returns

true

,
so that method will need to be consulted for the specific font,
in order to obtain an answer which accounts for such font attributes.

**Parameters:** chars

- the text.
**Parameters:** start

- the index of the first char to examine.
**Parameters:** end

- the ending index, exclusive.
**Returns:** true

if the specified text will need special layout.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

chars

is null.
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

start

is negative or

end

is greater than the length of the

chars

array.
**Since:** 9

- getFont

```java
public static
Font
getFont​(
Map
<? extends
AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
,​?> attributes)
```

Returns a

Font

appropriate to the attributes.
If

attributes

contains a

FONT

attribute
with a valid

Font

as its value, it will be
merged with any remaining attributes. See

TextAttribute.FONT

for more
information.

**Parameters:** attributes

- the attributes to assign to the new

Font
**Returns:** a new

Font

created with the specified
attributes
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

attributes

is null.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** TextAttribute

- createFonts

```java
public static
Font
[] createFonts​(
InputStream
fontStream)
throws
FontFormatException
,

IOException
```

Returns a new array of

Font

decoded from the specified stream.
The returned

Font[]

will have at least one element.

The explicit purpose of this variation on the

createFont(int, InputStream)

method is to support font
sources which represent a TrueType/OpenType font collection and
be able to return all individual fonts in that collection.
Consequently this method will throw

FontFormatException

if the data source does not contain at least one TrueType/OpenType
font. The same exception will also be thrown if any of the fonts in
the collection does not contain the required font tables.

The condition "at least one", allows for the stream to represent
a single OpenType/TrueType font. That is, it does not have to be
a collection.
Each

Font

element of the returned array is
created with a point size of 1 and style

PLAIN

.
This base font can then be used with the

deriveFont

methods in this class to derive new

Font

objects with
varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features.

This method does not close the

InputStream

.

To make each

Font

available to Font constructors it
must be registered in the

GraphicsEnvironment

by calling

registerFont(Font)

.

**Parameters:** fontStream

- an

InputStream

object representing the
input data for the font or font collection.
**Returns:** a new

Font[]

.
**Throws:** FontFormatException

- if the

fontStream

data does
not contain the required font tables for any of the elements of
the collection, or if it contains no fonts at all.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the

, which is

TRUETYPE_FONT

if a TrueType resource is
specified or

TYPE1_FONT

if a Type 1 resource is
specified.
So long as the returned font, or its derived fonts are referenced
the implementation may continue to access

fontFile

to retrieve font data. Thus the results are undefined if the file
is changed, or becomes inaccessible.

To make the

Font

available to Font constructors the
returned

Font

must be registered in the

GraphicsEnvironment

by calling

registerFont(Font)

.
**Parameters:** fontFile

- a

File

object representing the
input data for the font.
**Returns:** a new

Font

created with the specified font type.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

is not

TRUETYPE_FONT

or

TYPE1_FONT

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

fontFile

is null.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the

fontFile

cannot be read.
**Throws:** FontFormatException

- if

Font

. This transform is not necessarily the one
used to construct the font. If the font has algorithmic
superscripting or width adjustment, this will be incorporated
into the returned

AffineTransform

.

Typically, fonts will not be transformed. Clients generally
should call

isTransformed()

first, and only call this
method if

AffineTransform

object representing the
transform attribute of this

Font

object.

- getSize

```java
public int getSize()
```

Returns the point size of this

Font

, rounded to
an integer.
Most users are familiar with the idea of using

point size

to
specify the size of glyphs in a font. This point size defines a
measurement between the baseline of one line to the baseline of the
following line in a single spaced text document. The point size is
based on

typographic points

, approximately 1/72 of an inch.

The Java(tm)2D API adopts the convention that one point is
equivalent to one unit in user coordinates. When using a
normalized transform for converting user space coordinates to
device space coordinates 72 user
space units equal 1 inch in device space. In this case one point
is 1/72 of an inch.

**Returns:** the point size of this

Font

in 1/72 of an
inch units.
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** getSize2D()

,

GraphicsConfiguration.getDefaultTransform()

,

GraphicsConfiguration.getNormalizingTransform()

- getSize2D

**See Also:** getStyle()

- isItalic

```java
public boolean isItalic()
```

Indicates whether or not this

Font

object's style is
ITALIC.

**Returns:** true

if this

Font

object's
style is ITALIC;

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** getStyle()

- isTransformed

```java
public boolean isTransformed()
```

Indicates whether or not this

Font

object has a
transform that affects its size in addition to the Size
attribute.

has a non-identity AffineTransform attribute.

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** getTransform()

- hasLayoutAttributes

**Since:** 1.6

- getFont

```java
public static
Font
getFont​(
String
nm)
```

Returns a

Font

object from the system properties list.

nm

is treated as the name of a system property to be
obtained. The

String

value of this property is then
interpreted as a

Font

object according to the
specification of

Font.decode(String)

If the specified property is not found, or the executing code does
not have permission to read the property, null is returned instead.

**Parameters:** nm

- the property name
**Returns:** a

Font

object that the property name
describes, or null if no such property exists.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if nm is null.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** decode(String)

- decode

```java
public static
Font
decode​(
String
str)
```

Returns the

Font

that the

str

argument describes.
To ensure that this method returns the desired Font,
format the

str

parameter in
one of these ways

- fontname-style-pointsize

fontname-pointsize

fontname-style

fontname

fontname style pointsize

fontname pointsize

fontname style

fontname

in which

style

is one of the four
case-insensitive strings:

"PLAIN"

,

"BOLD"

,

"BOLDITALIC"

, or

"ITALIC"

, and pointsize is a positive decimal integer
representation of the point size.
For example, if you want a font that is Arial, bold, with
a point size of 18, you would call this method with:
"Arial-BOLD-18".
This is equivalent to calling the Font constructor :

new Font("Arial", Font.BOLD, 18);

and the values are interpreted as specified by that constructor.

A valid trailing decimal field is always interpreted as the pointsize.
Therefore a fontname containing a trailing decimal value should not
be used in the fontname only form.

If a style name field is not one of the valid style strings, it is
interpreted as part of the font name, and the default style is used.

Only one of ' ' or '-' may be used to separate fields in the input.
The identified separator is the one closest to the end of the string
which separates a valid pointsize, or a valid style name from
the rest of the string.
Null (empty) pointsize and style fields are treated
as valid fields with the default value for that field.

Some font names may include the separator characters ' ' or '-'.
If

str

is not formed with 3 components, e.g. such that

style

or

pointsize

fields are not present in

str

, and

fontname

also contains a
character determined to be the separator character
then these characters where they appear as intended to be part of

fontname

may instead be interpreted as separators
so the font name may not be properly recognised.

The default size is 12 and the default style is PLAIN.
If

str

does not specify a valid size, the returned

Font

has a size of 12. If

str

does not
specify a valid style, the returned Font has a style of PLAIN.
If you do not specify a valid font name in
the

str

argument, this method will return
a font with the family name "Dialog".
To determine what font family names are available on
your system, use the

GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames()

method.
If

str

is

null

, a new

Font

is returned with the family name "Dialog", a size of 12 and a
PLAIN style.

**Parameters:** str

- the name of the font, or

null
**Returns:** the

Font

object that

str

describes, or a new default

Font

if

str

is

null

.

**See Also:** getFamily()

- getFont

```java
public static
Font
getFont​(
String
nm,

Font
font)
```

Gets the specified

Font

from the system properties
list. As in the

getProperty

method of

System

, the first
argument is treated as the name of a system property to be
obtained. The

String

value of this property is then
interpreted as a

Font

object.

The property value should be one of the forms accepted by

Font.decode(String)

If the specified property is not found, or the executing code does not
have permission to read the property, the

font

argument is returned instead.

**Parameters:** nm

- the case-insensitive property name
**Parameters:** font

- a default

Font

to return if property

nm

is not defined

CharacterIterator
ci,
int beginIndex,
int limit,

FontRenderContext
frc)
```

Returns the logical bounds of the characters indexed in the
specified

CharacterIterator

in the
specified

FontRenderContext

. The logical bounds
contains the origin, ascent, advance, and height, which includes
the leading. The logical bounds does not always enclose all the
text. For example, in some languages and in some fonts, accent
marks can be positioned above the ascent or below the descent.
To obtain a visual bounding box, which encloses all the text,
use the

getBounds

method of

TextLayout

.

Note: The returned bounds is in baseline-relative coordinates
(see

class notes

).

**Parameters:** ci

- the specified

CharacterIterator
**Parameters:** beginIndex

- the initial offset in

char[] text,
int start,
int limit,
int flags)
```

Returns a new

GlyphVector

object, performing full
layout of the text if possible. Full layout is required for
complex text, such as Arabic or Hindi. Support for different
scripts depends on the font and implementation.

Layout requires bidi analysis, as performed by

Bidi

, and should only be performed on text that
has a uniform direction. The direction is indicated in the
flags parameter,by using LAYOUT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT to indicate a
right-to-left (Arabic and Hebrew) run direction, or
LAYOUT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT to indicate a left-to-right (English)
run direction.

In addition, some operations, such as Arabic shaping, require
context, so that the characters at the start and limit can have
the proper shapes. Sometimes the data in the buffer outside
the provided range does not have valid data. The values
LAYOUT_NO_START_CONTEXT and LAYOUT_NO_LIMIT_CONTEXT can be
added to the flags parameter to indicate that the text before
start, or after limit, respectively, should not be examined
for context.

All other values for the flags parameter are reserved.

**Parameters:** frc

- the specified

FontRenderContext
**Parameters:** text

- the text to layout
**Parameters:** start

- the start of the text to use for the

GlyphVector
**Parameters:** limit

- the limit of the text to use for the

GlyphVector
**Parameters:** flags

- control flags as described above
**Returns:** a new

GlyphVector

representing the text between
start and limit, with glyphs chosen and positioned so as to best represent
the text
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if start or limit is
out of bounds

#### Method Detail

textRequiresLayout

```java
public static boolean textRequiresLayout​(char[] chars,
int start,
int end)
```

Returns true if any part of the specified text is from a
complex script for which the implementation will need to invoke
layout processing in order to render correctly when using

drawString(String,int,int)

and other text rendering methods. Measurement of the text
may similarly need the same extra processing.
The

start

and

end

indices are provided so that
the application can request only a subset of the text be considered.
The last char index examined is at

"end-1"

,
i.e a request to examine the entire array would be

```java
Font.textRequiresLayout(chars, 0, chars.length);
```

An application may find this information helpful in
performance sensitive code.

Note that even if this method returns

false

, layout processing
may still be invoked when used with any

Font

for which

hasLayoutAttributes()

returns

true

,
so that method will need to be consulted for the specific font,
in order to obtain an answer which accounts for such font attributes.

**Parameters:** chars

- the text.
**Parameters:** start

- the index of the first char to examine.
**Parameters:** end

- the ending index, exclusive.
**Returns:** true

if the specified text will need special layout.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

chars

is null.
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

start

is negative or

end

is greater than the length of the

chars

array.
**Since:** 9

createFonts

```java
public static
Font
[] createFonts​(
InputStream
fontStream)
throws
FontFormatException
,

IOException
```

Returns a new array of

Font

decoded from the specified stream.
The returned

Font[]

will have at least one element.

The explicit purpose of this variation on the

createFont(int, InputStream)

method is to support font
sources which represent a TrueType/OpenType font collection and
be able to return all individual fonts in that collection.
Consequently this method will throw

FontFormatException

if the data source does not contain at least one TrueType/OpenType
font. The same exception will also be thrown if any of the fonts in
the collection does not contain the required font tables.

The condition "at least one", allows for the stream to represent
a single OpenType/TrueType font. That is, it does not have to be
a collection.
Each

Font

element of the returned array is
created with a point size of 1 and style

PLAIN

.
This base font can then be used with the

deriveFont

methods in this class to derive new

Font

objects with
varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features.

This method does not close the

InputStream

.

To make each

Font

available to Font constructors it
must be registered in the

GraphicsEnvironment

by calling

registerFont(Font)

.

**Parameters:** fontStream

- an

InputStream

object representing the
input data for the font or font collection.
**Returns:** a new

Font[]

.
**Throws:** FontFormatException

- if the

fontStream

data does
not contain the required font tables for any of the elements of
the collection, or if it contains no fonts at all.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the

getSize

```java
public int getSize()
```

Returns the point size of this

Most users are familiar with the idea of using

point size

to
specify the size of glyphs in a font. This point size defines a
measurement between the baseline of one line to the baseline of the
following line in a single spaced text document. The point size is
based on

typographic points

, approximately 1/72 of an inch.

The Java(tm)2D API adopts the convention that one point is
equivalent to one unit in user coordinates. When using a
normalized transform for converting user space coordinates to
device space coordinates 72 user
space units equal 1 inch in device space. In this case one point
is 1/72 of an inch.

**Returns:** the point size of this

decode

```java
public static
Font
decode​(
String
str)
```

Returns the

Font

that the

str

argument describes.
To ensure that this method returns the desired Font,
format the

str

parameter in
one of these ways

- fontname-style-pointsize

fontname-pointsize

fontname-style

fontname

fontname style pointsize

fontname pointsize

fontname style

fontname

in which

style

is one of the four
case-insensitive strings:

"PLAIN"

,

"BOLD"

,

"BOLDITALIC"

, or

"ITALIC"

, and pointsize is a positive decimal integer
representation of the point size.
For example, if you want a font that is Arial, bold, with
a point size of 18, you would call this method with:
"Arial-BOLD-18".
This is equivalent to calling the Font constructor :

new Font("Arial", Font.BOLD, 18);

and the values are interpreted as specified by that constructor.

A valid trailing decimal field is always interpreted as the pointsize.
Therefore a fontname containing a trailing decimal value should not
be used in the fontname only form.

If a style name field is not one of the valid style strings, it is
interpreted as part of the font name, and the default style is used.

Only one of ' ' or '-' may be used to separate fields in the input.
The identified separator is the one closest to the end of the string
which separates a valid pointsize, or a valid style name from
the rest of the string.
Null (empty) pointsize and style fields are treated
as valid fields with the default value for that field.

Some font names may include the separator characters ' ' or '-'.
If

str

is not formed with 3 components, e.g. such that

style

or

pointsize

fields are not present in

str

, and

fontname

also contains a
character determined to be the separator character
then these characters where they appear as intended to be part of

fontname

may instead be interpreted as separators
so the font name may not be properly recognised.

The default size is 12 and the default style is PLAIN.
If

str

does not specify a valid size, the returned

Font

has a size of 12. If

str

does not
specify a valid style, the returned Font has a style of PLAIN.
If you do not specify a valid font name in
the

str

argument, this method will return
a font with the family name "Dialog".
To determine what font family names are available on
your system, use the

GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames()

method.
If

str

is

null

, a new

Font

is returned with the family name "Dialog", a size of 12 and a
PLAIN style.

**Parameters:** str

- the name of the font, or

null
**Returns:** the

Font

object that

str

describes, or a new default

Font

if

int start,
int limit,
int flags)
```

Returns a new

GlyphVector

object, performing full
layout of the text if possible. Full layout is required for
complex text, such as Arabic or Hindi. Support for different
scripts depends on the font and implementation.

Layout requires bidi analysis, as performed by

Bidi

, and should only be performed on text that
has a uniform direction. The direction is indicated in the
flags parameter,by using LAYOUT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT to indicate a
right-to-left (Arabic and Hebrew) run direction, or
LAYOUT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT to indicate a left-to-right (English)
run direction.

In addition, some operations, such as Arabic shaping, require
context, so that the characters at the start and limit can have
the proper shapes. Sometimes the data in the buffer outside
the provided range does not have valid data. The values
LAYOUT_NO_START_CONTEXT and LAYOUT_NO_LIMIT_CONTEXT can be
added to the flags parameter to indicate that the text before
start, or after limit, respectively, should not be examined
for context.

All other values for the flags parameter are reserved.

**Parameters:** frc

- the specified

FontRenderContext
**Parameters:** text

- the text to layout
**Parameters:** start

- the start of the text to use for the

GlyphVector
**Parameters:** limit

#### layoutGlyphVector

public

GlyphVector

layoutGlyphVector​(

FontRenderContext

frc,
char[] text,
int start,
int limit,
int flags)

Returns a new

GlyphVector

object, performing full
layout of the text if possible. Full layout is required for
complex text, such as Arabic or Hindi. Support for different
scripts depends on the font and implementation.

Layout requires bidi analysis, as performed by

Bidi

, and should only be performed on text that
has a uniform direction. The direction is indicated in the
flags parameter,by using LAYOUT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT to indicate a
right-to-left (Arabic and Hebrew) run direction, or
LAYOUT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT to indicate a left-to-right (English)
run direction.

In addition, some operations, such as Arabic shaping, require
context, so that the characters at the start and limit can have
the proper shapes. Sometimes the data in the buffer outside
the provided range does not have valid data. The values
LAYOUT_NO_START_CONTEXT and LAYOUT_NO_LIMIT_CONTEXT can be
added to the flags parameter to indicate that the text before
start, or after limit, respectively, should not be examined
for context.

All other values for the flags parameter are reserved.
