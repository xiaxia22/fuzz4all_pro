# Class RMIClassLoader

**Source:** `java.rmi\java\rmi\server\RMIClassLoader.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
RMIClassLoader

extends
Object
```

RMIClassLoader

comprises static methods to support
dynamic class loading with RMI. Included are methods for loading
classes from a network location (one or more URLs) and obtaining
the location from which an existing class should be loaded by
remote parties. These methods are used by the RMI runtime when
marshalling and unmarshalling classes contained in the arguments
and return values of remote method calls, and they also may be
invoked directly by applications in order to mimic RMI's dynamic
class loading behavior.

The implementation of the following static methods

- loadClass(URL,String)

loadClass(String,String)

loadClass(String,String,ClassLoader)

loadProxyClass(String,String[],ClassLoader)

getClassLoader(String)

getClassAnnotation(Class)

is provided by an instance of

RMIClassLoaderSpi

, the
service provider interface for those methods. When one of the
methods is invoked, its behavior is to delegate to a corresponding
method on the service provider instance. The details of how each
method delegates to the provider instance is described in the
documentation for each particular method.

The service provider instance is chosen as follows:

- If the system property

java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi

is defined, then if
its value equals the string

"default"

, the provider
instance will be the value returned by an invocation of the

getDefaultProviderInstance()

method, and for any other value, if
a class named with the value of the property can be loaded by the
system class loader (see

ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()

)
and that class is assignable to

RMIClassLoaderSpi

and has a
public no-argument constructor, then that constructor will be
invoked to create the provider instance. If the property is
defined but any other of those conditions are not true, then an
unspecified

Error

will be thrown to code that attempts
to use

RMIClassLoader

, indicating the failure to
obtain a provider instance.

If a resource named

META-INF/services/java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi

is
visible to the system class loader, then the contents of that
resource are interpreted as a provider-configuration file, and the
first class name specified in that file is used as the provider
class name. If a class with that name can be loaded by the system
class loader and that class is assignable to

RMIClassLoaderSpi

and has a public no-argument constructor, then
that constructor will be invoked to create the provider instance.
If the resource is found but a provider cannot be instantiated as
described, then an unspecified

Error

will be thrown to
code that attempts to use

RMIClassLoader

, indicating
the failure to obtain a provider instance.

Otherwise, the provider instance will be the value returned by
an invocation of the

getDefaultProviderInstance()

method.

method would use to load classes
for the same

codebase

argument.

This method delegates to the

RMIClassLoaderSpi.getClassLoader(String)

method
of the provider instance, passing

codebase

as the argument.

If there is a security manger, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked with a

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

permission;
this could result in a

SecurityException

.
The provider implementation of this method may also perform further
security checks to verify that the calling context has permission to
connect to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path.

#### public static
RMIClassLoaderSpi
getDefaultProviderInstance()

Returns the canonical instance of the default provider
for the service provider interface

RMIClassLoaderSpi

.
If the system property

java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi

is not defined, then the

RMIClassLoader

static
methods

- loadClass(URL,String)

loadClass(String,String)

loadClass(String,String,ClassLoader)

loadProxyClass(String,String[],ClassLoader)

getClassLoader(String)

getClassAnnotation(Class)

will use the canonical instance of the default provider
as the service provider instance.

If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked with a

RuntimePermission("setFactory")

permission; this
could result in a

SecurityException

.

The default service provider instance implements

RMIClassLoaderSpi

as follows:

The

getClassAnnotation

method returns a

String

representing the codebase URL path that a remote party should
use to download the definition for the specified class. The
format of the returned string is a path of URLs separated by
spaces.

The codebase string returned depends on the defining class
loader of the specified class:

- If the class loader is the system class loader (see

ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()

), a parent of the
system class loader such as the loader used for installed
extensions, or the bootstrap class loader (which may be
represented by

null

), then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Otherwise, if the class loader is an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the returned string is a
space-separated list of the external forms of the URLs returned
by invoking the

getURLs

methods of the loader. If
the

URLClassLoader

was created by this provider to
service an invocation of its

loadClass

or

loadProxyClass

methods, then no permissions are
required to get the associated codebase string. If it is an
arbitrary other

URLClassLoader

instance, then if
there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked once for each URL returned by the

getURLs

method, with the permission returned by
invoking

openConnection().getPermission()

on each
URL; if any of those invocations throws a

SecurityException

or an

IOException

,
then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Finally, if the class loader is not an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

For the implementations of the methods described below,
which all take a

String

parameter named

codebase

that is a space-separated list of URLs,
each invocation has an associated

codebase loader

that
is identified using the

codebase

argument in
conjunction with the current thread's context class loader (see

Thread.getContextClassLoader()

). When there is a
security manager, this provider maintains an internal table of
class loader instances (which are at least instances of

URLClassLoader

) keyed by the pair of their parent
class loader and their codebase URL path (an ordered list of
URLs). If the

codebase

argument is

null

,
the codebase URL path is the value of the system property

java.rmi.server.codebase

or possibly an
earlier cached value. For a given codebase URL path passed as the

codebase

argument to an invocation of one of the
below methods in a given context, the codebase loader is the
loader in the table with the specified codebase URL path and
the current thread's context class loader as its parent. If no
such loader exists, then one is created and added to the table.
The table does not maintain strong references to its contained
loaders, in order to allow them and their defined classes to be
garbage collected when not otherwise reachable. In order to
prevent arbitrary untrusted code from being implicitly loaded
into a virtual machine with no security manager, if there is no
security manager set, the codebase loader is just the current
thread's context class loader (the supplied codebase URL path
is ignored, so remote class loading is disabled).

The

getClassLoader

method returns the codebase loader for the
specified codebase URL path. If there is a security manager,
then if the calling context does not have permission to connect
to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path, a

SecurityException

will be thrown.

The

loadClass

method attempts to load the class with the
specified name as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

, it first attempts to load the class with the
specified

name

using the

defaultLoader

, such as by evaluating

```java
Class.forName(name, false, defaultLoader)
```

If the class is successfully loaded from the

defaultLoader

, that class is returned. If an
exception other than

ClassNotFoundException

is
thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

Next, the

loadClass

method attempts to load the
class with the specified

name

using the codebase
loader for the specified codebase URL path.
If there is a security manager, then the calling context
must have permission to connect to all of the URLs in the
codebase URL path; otherwise, the current thread's context
class loader will be used instead of the codebase loader.

The

loadProxyClass

method attempts to return a dynamic proxy
class with the named interface as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

and all of the named interfaces can be
resolved through that loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it first attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class (using

Proxy.getProxyClass

) for the resolved interfaces defined in
the codebase loader; if that attempt throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, it then attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in the

defaultLoader

. If both attempts
throw

IllegalArgumentException

, then this method
throws a

ClassNotFoundException

. If any other
exception is thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in that loader.

otherwise, a

LinkageError

is thrown (because a
class that implements all of the specified interfaces cannot be
defined in any loader).

Otherwise, if all of the named interfaces can be resolved
through the codebase loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class for the
resolved interfaces in the codebase loader. If the attempt
throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, then this
method throws a

ClassNotFoundException

.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in that loader.

otherwise, a

LinkageError

is thrown (because a
class that implements all of the specified interfaces cannot be
defined in any loader).

Otherwise, a

ClassNotFoundException

is thrown
for one of the named interfaces that could not be resolved.

**Returns:**
- the canonical instance of the default service provider

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if there is a security manager and the
invocation of its

checkPermission

method fails

**Since:**
- 1.4

<?> loadProxyClass​(
String
codebase,

String
[] interfaces,

ClassLoader
defaultLoader)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
,

MalformedURLException
```

Loads a dynamic proxy class (see

Proxy

)
that implements a set of interfaces with the given names
from a codebase URL path.

The interfaces will be resolved similar to classes loaded via
the

loadClass(String,String)

method using the given

codebase

.

This method delegates to the

RMIClassLoaderSpi.loadProxyClass(String,String[],ClassLoader)

method of the provider instance, passing

codebase

as the first argument,

interfaces

as the second argument,
and

defaultLoader

as the third argument.

**Parameters:** codebase

classes from, or

null
**Parameters:** interfaces

- the names of the interfaces for the proxy class
to implement
**Parameters:** defaultLoader

- additional contextual class loader
to use, or

null
**Returns:** a dynamic proxy class that implements the named interfaces
**Throws:** MalformedURLException

- if

codebase

is
non-

null

for the given
interface list)
**Since:** 1.4

- getClassLoader

```java
public static
ClassLoader
getClassLoader​(
String
codebase)
throws
MalformedURLException
,

SecurityException
```

Returns a class loader that loads classes from the given codebase
URL path.

The class loader returned is the class loader that the

loadClass(String,String)

method would use to load classes
for the same

codebase

argument.

This method delegates to the

RMIClassLoaderSpi.getClassLoader(String)

method
of the provider instance, passing

codebase

as the argument.

If there is a security manger, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked with a

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

permission;
this could result in a

SecurityException

.
The provider implementation of this method may also perform further
security checks to verify that the calling context has permission to
connect to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path.

**Parameters:** codebase

- the list of URLs (space-separated) from which
the returned class loader will load classes from, or

null
**Returns:** a class loader that loads classes from the given codebase URL
path
**Throws:** MalformedURLException

- if

codebase

is
non-

null

and contains an invalid URL, or
if

codebase

is

null

and a provider-specific
URL used to identify the class loader is invalid
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if there is a security manager and the
invocation of its

checkPermission

method fails, or
if the caller does not have permission to connect to all of the
URLs in the codebase URL path
**Since:** 1.3

- getClassAnnotation

```java
public static
String
getClassAnnotation​(
Class
<?> cl)
```

Returns the annotation string (representing a location for
the class definition) that RMI will use to annotate the class
descriptor when marshalling objects of the given class.

This method delegates to the

RMIClassLoaderSpi.getClassAnnotation(Class)

method
of the provider instance, passing

cl

as the argument.

**Parameters:** cl

- the class to obtain the annotation for
**Returns:** a string to be used to annotate the given class when
it gets marshalled, or

null
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

cl

is

null
**Since:** 1.2

- getDefaultProviderInstance

```java
public static
RMIClassLoaderSpi
getDefaultProviderInstance()
```

Returns the canonical instance of the default provider
for the service provider interface

RMIClassLoaderSpi

.
If the system property

java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi

is not defined, then the

RMIClassLoader

static
methods

- loadClass(URL,String)

loadClass(String,String)

loadClass(String,String,ClassLoader)

loadProxyClass(String,String[],ClassLoader)

getClassLoader(String)

getClassAnnotation(Class)

will use the canonical instance of the default provider
as the service provider instance.

If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked with a

RuntimePermission("setFactory")

permission; this
could result in a

SecurityException

.

The default service provider instance implements

RMIClassLoaderSpi

as follows:

The

getClassAnnotation

method returns a

String

representing the codebase URL path that a remote party should
use to download the definition for the specified class. The
format of the returned string is a path of URLs separated by
spaces.

The codebase string returned depends on the defining class
loader of the specified class:

- If the class loader is the system class loader (see

ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()

), a parent of the
system class loader such as the loader used for installed
extensions, or the bootstrap class loader (which may be
represented by

null

), then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Otherwise, if the class loader is an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the returned string is a
space-separated list of the external forms of the URLs returned
by invoking the

getURLs

methods of the loader. If
the

URLClassLoader

was created by this provider to
service an invocation of its

loadClass

or

loadProxyClass

methods, then no permissions are
required to get the associated codebase string. If it is an
arbitrary other

URLClassLoader

instance, then if
there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked once for each URL returned by the

getURLs

method, with the permission returned by
invoking

openConnection().getPermission()

on each
URL; if any of those invocations throws a

SecurityException

or an

IOException

,
then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Finally, if the class loader is not an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

For the implementations of the methods described below,
which all take a

String

parameter named

codebase

that is a space-separated list of URLs,
each invocation has an associated

codebase loader

that
is identified using the

codebase

argument in
conjunction with the current thread's context class loader (see

Thread.getContextClassLoader()

). When there is a
security manager, this provider maintains an internal table of
class loader instances (which are at least instances of

URLClassLoader

) keyed by the pair of their parent
class loader and their codebase URL path (an ordered list of
URLs). If the

codebase

argument is

null

,
the codebase URL path is the value of the system property

java.rmi.server.codebase

or possibly an
earlier cached value. For a given codebase URL path passed as the

codebase

argument to an invocation of one of the
below methods in a given context, the codebase loader is the
loader in the table with the specified codebase URL path and
the current thread's context class loader as its parent. If no
such loader exists, then one is created and added to the table.
The table does not maintain strong references to its contained
loaders, in order to allow them and their defined classes to be
garbage collected when not otherwise reachable. In order to
prevent arbitrary untrusted code from being implicitly loaded
into a virtual machine with no security manager, if there is no
security manager set, the codebase loader is just the current
thread's context class loader (the supplied codebase URL path
is ignored, so remote class loading is disabled).

The

getClassLoader

method returns the codebase loader for the
specified codebase URL path. If there is a security manager,
then if the calling context does not have permission to connect
to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path, a

SecurityException

will be thrown.

The

loadClass

method attempts to load the class with the
specified name as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

, it first attempts to load the class with the
specified

name

using the

defaultLoader

, such as by evaluating

```java
Class.forName(name, false, defaultLoader)
```

If the class is successfully loaded from the

defaultLoader

, that class is returned. If an
exception other than

ClassNotFoundException

is
thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

Next, the

loadClass

method attempts to load the
class with the specified

name

using the codebase
loader for the specified codebase URL path.
If there is a security manager, then the calling context
must have permission to connect to all of the URLs in the
codebase URL path; otherwise, the current thread's context
class loader will be used instead of the codebase loader.

The

loadProxyClass

method attempts to return a dynamic proxy
class with the named interface as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

and all of the named interfaces can be
resolved through that loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it first attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class (using

Proxy.getProxyClass

) for the resolved interfaces defined in
the codebase loader; if that attempt throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, it then attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in the

defaultLoader

. If both attempts
throw

IllegalArgumentException

, then this method
throws a

ClassNotFoundException

. If any other
exception is thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in that loader.

otherwise, a

LinkageError

is thrown (because a
class that implements all of the specified interfaces cannot be
defined in any loader).

Otherwise, if all of the named interfaces can be resolved
through the codebase loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class for the
resolved interfaces in the codebase loader. If the attempt
throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, then this
method throws a

ClassNotFoundException

.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in that loader.

otherwise, a

LinkageError

is thrown (because a
class that implements all of the specified interfaces cannot be
defined in any loader).

Otherwise, a

ClassNotFoundException

is thrown
for one of the named interfaces that could not be resolved.

**Returns:** the canonical instance of the default service provider

of the provider instance, passing

cl

as the argument.

**Parameters:** cl

- the class to obtain the annotation for
**Returns:** a string to be used to annotate the given class when
it gets marshalled, or

- getDefaultProviderInstance

```java
public static
RMIClassLoaderSpi
getDefaultProviderInstance()
```

Returns the canonical instance of the default provider
for the service provider interface

RMIClassLoaderSpi

.
If the system property

java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi

is not defined, then the

RMIClassLoader

static
methods

- loadClass(URL,String)

loadClass(String,String)

loadClass(String,String,ClassLoader)

loadProxyClass(String,String[],ClassLoader)

getClassLoader(String)

getClassAnnotation(Class)

will use the canonical instance of the default provider
as the service provider instance.

If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked with a

RuntimePermission("setFactory")

permission; this
could result in a

SecurityException

.

The default service provider instance implements

RMIClassLoaderSpi

as follows:

The

getClassAnnotation

method returns a

String

representing the codebase URL path that a remote party should
use to download the definition for the specified class. The
format of the returned string is a path of URLs separated by
spaces.

The codebase string returned depends on the defining class
loader of the specified class:

- If the class loader is the system class loader (see

ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()

), a parent of the
system class loader such as the loader used for installed
extensions, or the bootstrap class loader (which may be
represented by

null

), then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Otherwise, if the class loader is an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the returned string is a
space-separated list of the external forms of the URLs returned
by invoking the

getURLs

methods of the loader. If
the

URLClassLoader

was created by this provider to
service an invocation of its

loadClass

or

loadProxyClass

methods, then no permissions are
required to get the associated codebase string. If it is an
arbitrary other

URLClassLoader

instance, then if
there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked once for each URL returned by the

getURLs

method, with the permission returned by
invoking

openConnection().getPermission()

on each
URL; if any of those invocations throws a

SecurityException

or an

IOException

,
then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Finally, if the class loader is not an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

For the implementations of the methods described below,
which all take a

String

parameter named

codebase

that is a space-separated list of URLs,
each invocation has an associated

codebase loader

that
is identified using the

codebase

argument in
conjunction with the current thread's context class loader (see

Thread.getContextClassLoader()

). When there is a
security manager, this provider maintains an internal table of
class loader instances (which are at least instances of

URLClassLoader

) keyed by the pair of their parent
class loader and their codebase URL path (an ordered list of
URLs). If the

codebase

argument is

null

,
the codebase URL path is the value of the system property

java.rmi.server.codebase

or possibly an
earlier cached value. For a given codebase URL path passed as the

codebase

argument to an invocation of one of the
below methods in a given context, the codebase loader is the
loader in the table with the specified codebase URL path and
the current thread's context class loader as its parent. If no
such loader exists, then one is created and added to the table.
The table does not maintain strong references to its contained
loaders, in order to allow them and their defined classes to be
garbage collected when not otherwise reachable. In order to
prevent arbitrary untrusted code from being implicitly loaded
into a virtual machine with no security manager, if there is no
security manager set, the codebase loader is just the current
thread's context class loader (the supplied codebase URL path
is ignored, so remote class loading is disabled).

The

getClassLoader

method returns the codebase loader for the
specified codebase URL path. If there is a security manager,
then if the calling context does not have permission to connect
to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path, a

SecurityException

will be thrown.

The

loadClass

method attempts to load the class with the
specified name as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

, it first attempts to load the class with the
specified

name

using the

defaultLoader

, such as by evaluating

```java
Class.forName(name, false, defaultLoader)
```

If the class is successfully loaded from the

defaultLoader

, that class is returned. If an
exception other than

ClassNotFoundException

is
thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

Next, the

loadClass

method attempts to load the
class with the specified

name

using the codebase
loader for the specified codebase URL path.
If there is a security manager, then the calling context
must have permission to connect to all of the URLs in the
codebase URL path; otherwise, the current thread's context
class loader will be used instead of the codebase loader.

The

loadProxyClass

method attempts to return a dynamic proxy
class with the named interface as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

and all of the named interfaces can be
resolved through that loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it first attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class (using

Proxy.getProxyClass

) for the resolved interfaces defined in
the codebase loader; if that attempt throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, it then attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in the

defaultLoader

. If both attempts
throw

IllegalArgumentException

, then this method
throws a

ClassNotFoundException

. If any other
exception is thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in that loader.

otherwise, a

LinkageError

is thrown (because a
class that implements all of the specified interfaces cannot be
defined in any loader).

Otherwise, if all of the named interfaces can be resolved
through the codebase loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class for the
resolved interfaces in the codebase loader. If the attempt
throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, then this
method throws a

ClassNotFoundException

.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in that loader.

otherwise, a

LinkageError

is thrown (because a
class that implements all of the specified interfaces cannot be
defined in any loader).

Otherwise, a

ClassNotFoundException

is thrown
for one of the named interfaces that could not be resolved.

**Returns:** the canonical instance of the default service provider

getDefaultProviderInstance

```java
public static
RMIClassLoaderSpi
getDefaultProviderInstance()
```

Returns the canonical instance of the default provider
for the service provider interface

RMIClassLoaderSpi

.
If the system property

java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi

is not defined, then the

RMIClassLoader

static
methods

- loadClass(URL,String)

loadClass(String,String)

loadClass(String,String,ClassLoader)

loadProxyClass(String,String[],ClassLoader)

getClassLoader(String)

getClassAnnotation(Class)

will use the canonical instance of the default provider
as the service provider instance.

If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked with a

RuntimePermission("setFactory")

permission; this
could result in a

SecurityException

.

The default service provider instance implements

RMIClassLoaderSpi

as follows:

The

getClassAnnotation

method returns a

String

representing the codebase URL path that a remote party should
use to download the definition for the specified class. The
format of the returned string is a path of URLs separated by
spaces.

The codebase string returned depends on the defining class
loader of the specified class:

- If the class loader is the system class loader (see

ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()

), a parent of the
system class loader such as the loader used for installed
extensions, or the bootstrap class loader (which may be
represented by

null

), then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Otherwise, if the class loader is an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the returned string is a
space-separated list of the external forms of the URLs returned
by invoking the

getURLs

methods of the loader. If
the

URLClassLoader

was created by this provider to
service an invocation of its

loadClass

or

loadProxyClass

methods, then no permissions are
required to get the associated codebase string. If it is an
arbitrary other

URLClassLoader

instance, then if
there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked once for each URL returned by the

getURLs

method, with the permission returned by
invoking

openConnection().getPermission()

on each
URL; if any of those invocations throws a

SecurityException

or an

IOException

,
then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Finally, if the class loader is not an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

For the implementations of the methods described below,
which all take a

String

parameter named

codebase

that is a space-separated list of URLs,
each invocation has an associated

codebase loader

that
is identified using the

codebase

argument in
conjunction with the current thread's context class loader (see

Thread.getContextClassLoader()

). When there is a
security manager, this provider maintains an internal table of
class loader instances (which are at least instances of

URLClassLoader

) keyed by the pair of their parent
class loader and their codebase URL path (an ordered list of
URLs). If the

codebase

argument is

null

,
the codebase URL path is the value of the system property

java.rmi.server.codebase

or possibly an
earlier cached value. For a given codebase URL path passed as the

codebase

argument to an invocation of one of the
below methods in a given context, the codebase loader is the
loader in the table with the specified codebase URL path and
the current thread's context class loader as its parent. If no
such loader exists, then one is created and added to the table.
The table does not maintain strong references to its contained
loaders, in order to allow them and their defined classes to be
garbage collected when not otherwise reachable. In order to
prevent arbitrary untrusted code from being implicitly loaded
into a virtual machine with no security manager, if there is no
security manager set, the codebase loader is just the current
thread's context class loader (the supplied codebase URL path
is ignored, so remote class loading is disabled).

The

getClassLoader

method returns the codebase loader for the
specified codebase URL path. If there is a security manager,
then if the calling context does not have permission to connect
to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path, a

SecurityException

will be thrown.

The

loadClass

method attempts to load the class with the
specified name as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

, it first attempts to load the class with the
specified

name

using the

defaultLoader

, such as by evaluating

```java
Class.forName(name, false, defaultLoader)
```

If the class is successfully loaded from the

defaultLoader

, that class is returned. If an
exception other than

ClassNotFoundException

is
thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

Next, the

loadClass

method attempts to load the
class with the specified

name

using the codebase
loader for the specified codebase URL path.
If there is a security manager, then the calling context
must have permission to connect to all of the URLs in the
codebase URL path; otherwise, the current thread's context
class loader will be used instead of the codebase loader.

The

loadProxyClass

method attempts to return a dynamic proxy
class with the named interface as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

public static

RMIClassLoaderSpi

getDefaultProviderInstance()

Returns the canonical instance of the default provider
for the service provider interface

RMIClassLoaderSpi

.
If the system property

java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi

is not defined, then the

RMIClassLoader

static
methods

- loadClass(URL,String)

loadClass(String,String)

loadClass(String,String,ClassLoader)

loadProxyClass(String,String[],ClassLoader)

getClassLoader(String)

getClassAnnotation(Class)

will use the canonical instance of the default provider
as the service provider instance.

If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked with a

RuntimePermission("setFactory")

permission; this
could result in a

SecurityException

.

The default service provider instance implements

RMIClassLoaderSpi

as follows:

The

getClassAnnotation

method returns a

String

representing the codebase URL path that a remote party should
use to download the definition for the specified class. The
format of the returned string is a path of URLs separated by
spaces.

The codebase string returned depends on the defining class
loader of the specified class:

- If the class loader is the system class loader (see

ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()

), a parent of the
system class loader such as the loader used for installed
extensions, or the bootstrap class loader (which may be
represented by

null

), then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Otherwise, if the class loader is an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the returned string is a
space-separated list of the external forms of the URLs returned
by invoking the

getURLs

methods of the loader. If
the

URLClassLoader

was created by this provider to
service an invocation of its

loadClass

or

loadProxyClass

methods, then no permissions are
required to get the associated codebase string. If it is an
arbitrary other

URLClassLoader

instance, then if
there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked once for each URL returned by the

getURLs

method, with the permission returned by
invoking

openConnection().getPermission()

on each
URL; if any of those invocations throws a

SecurityException

or an

IOException

,
then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Finally, if the class loader is not an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

For the implementations of the methods described below,
which all take a

String

parameter named

codebase

that is a space-separated list of URLs,
each invocation has an associated

codebase loader

that
is identified using the

codebase

argument in
conjunction with the current thread's context class loader (see

Thread.getContextClassLoader()

). When there is a
security manager, this provider maintains an internal table of
class loader instances (which are at least instances of

URLClassLoader

) keyed by the pair of their parent
class loader and their codebase URL path (an ordered list of
URLs). If the

codebase

argument is

null

,
the codebase URL path is the value of the system property

java.rmi.server.codebase

or possibly an
earlier cached value. For a given codebase URL path passed as the

codebase

argument to an invocation of one of the
below methods in a given context, the codebase loader is the
loader in the table with the specified codebase URL path and
the current thread's context class loader as its parent. If no
such loader exists, then one is created and added to the table.
The table does not maintain strong references to its contained
loaders, in order to allow them and their defined classes to be
garbage collected when not otherwise reachable. In order to
prevent arbitrary untrusted code from being implicitly loaded
into a virtual machine with no security manager, if there is no
security manager set, the codebase loader is just the current
thread's context class loader (the supplied codebase URL path
is ignored, so remote class loading is disabled).

The

getClassLoader

method returns the codebase loader for the
specified codebase URL path. If there is a security manager,
then if the calling context does not have permission to connect
to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path, a

SecurityException

will be thrown.

The

loadClass

method attempts to load the class with the
specified name as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

, it first attempts to load the class with the
specified

name

using the

defaultLoader

, such as by evaluating

```java
Class.forName(name, false, defaultLoader)
```

If the class is successfully loaded from the

defaultLoader

, that class is returned. If an
exception other than

ClassNotFoundException

is
thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

Next, the

loadClass

method attempts to load the
class with the specified

name

using the codebase
loader for the specified codebase URL path.
If there is a security manager, then the calling context
must have permission to connect to all of the URLs in the
codebase URL path; otherwise, the current thread's context
class loader will be used instead of the codebase loader.

The

loadProxyClass

method attempts to return a dynamic proxy
class with the named interface as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

and all of the named interfaces can be
resolved through that loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it first attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class (using

Proxy.getProxyClass

) for the resolved interfaces defined in
the codebase loader; if that attempt throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, it then attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in the

defaultLoader

. If both attempts
throw

IllegalArgumentException

, then this method
throws a

ClassNotFoundException

. If any other
exception is thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in that loader.

otherwise, a

LinkageError

is thrown (because a
class that implements all of the specified interfaces cannot be
defined in any loader).

Otherwise, if all of the named interfaces can be resolved
through the codebase loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class for the
resolved interfaces in the codebase loader. If the attempt
throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, then this
method throws a

ClassNotFoundException

.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in that loader.

otherwise, a

LinkageError

is thrown (because a
class that implements all of the specified interfaces cannot be
defined in any loader).

Otherwise, a

ClassNotFoundException

is thrown
for one of the named interfaces that could not be resolved.

loadClass(URL,String)

loadClass(String,String)

loadClass(String,String,ClassLoader)

loadProxyClass(String,String[],ClassLoader)

getClassLoader(String)

getClassAnnotation(Class)

If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked with a

RuntimePermission("setFactory")

permission; this
could result in a

.

The default service provider instance implements

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Otherwise, if the class loader is an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the returned string is a
space-separated list of the external forms of the URLs returned
by invoking the

getURLs

methods of the loader. If
the

URLClassLoader

was created by this provider to
service an invocation of its

loadClass

or

loadProxyClass

methods, then no permissions are
required to get the associated codebase string. If it is an
arbitrary other

URLClassLoader

instance, then if
there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked once for each URL returned by the

getURLs

method, with the permission returned by
invoking

openConnection().getPermission()

on each
URL; if any of those invocations throws a

SecurityException

or an

IOException

,
then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Finally, if the class loader is not an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

For the implementations of the methods described below,
which all take a

that is a space-separated list of URLs,
each invocation has an associated

,
the codebase URL path is the value of the system property

java.rmi.server.codebase

or possibly an

codebase

argument to an invocation of one of the
below methods in a given context, the codebase loader is the
loader in the table with the specified codebase URL path and
the current thread's context class loader as its parent. If no
such loader exists, then one is created and added to the table.
The table does not maintain strong references to its contained
loaders, in order to allow them and their defined classes to be

security manager set, the codebase loader is just the current
thread's context class loader (the supplied codebase URL path
is ignored, so remote class loading is disabled).

The

getClassLoader

method returns the codebase loader for the
specified codebase URL path. If there is a security manager,
then if the calling context does not have permission to connect
to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path, a

SecurityException

will be thrown.

The

loadClass

method attempts to load the class with the
specified name as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

, it first attempts to load the class with the
specified

name

using the

defaultLoader

, such as by evaluating

```java
Class.forName(name, false, defaultLoader)
```

If the class is successfully loaded from the

defaultLoader

, that class is returned. If an
exception other than

ClassNotFoundException

is
thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

Next, the

loadClass

method attempts to load the
class with the specified

name

using the codebase
loader for the specified codebase URL path.
If there is a security manager, then the calling context
must have permission to connect to all of the URLs in the
codebase URL path; otherwise, the current thread's context
class loader will be used instead of the codebase loader.

The

loadProxyClass

method attempts to return a dynamic proxy
class with the named interface as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

and all of the named interfaces can be
resolved through that loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it first attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class (using

Proxy.getProxyClass

) for the resolved interfaces defined in
the codebase loader; if that attempt throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, it then attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in the

defaultLoader

. If both attempts
throw

IllegalArgumentException

, then this method
throws a

ClassNotFoundException

. If any other
exception is thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces

IllegalArgumentException

, then this
method throws a

.

if all of the non-

required to get the associated codebase string. If it is an
arbitrary other

URLClassLoader

instance, then if
there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method will be invoked once for each URL returned by the

getURLs

method, with the permission returned by
invoking

openConnection().getPermission()

on each
URL; if any of those invocations throws a

SecurityException

or an

IOException

,
then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Finally, if the class loader is not an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

Finally, if the class loader is not an instance of

URLClassLoader

, then the value of the

java.rmi.server.codebase

property (or possibly an
earlier cached value) is returned, or

null

is returned if that property is not set.

For the implementations of the methods described below,
which all take a

String

parameter named

codebase

that is a space-separated list of URLs,
each invocation has an associated

codebase loader

that
is identified using the

codebase

argument in
conjunction with the current thread's context class loader (see

Thread.getContextClassLoader()

). When there is a
security manager, this provider maintains an internal table of
class loader instances (which are at least instances of

URLClassLoader

) keyed by the pair of their parent
class loader and their codebase URL path (an ordered list of
URLs). If the

codebase

argument is

null

,
the codebase URL path is the value of the system property

java.rmi.server.codebase

or possibly an
earlier cached value. For a given codebase URL path passed as the

codebase

argument to an invocation of one of the
below methods in a given context, the codebase loader is the
loader in the table with the specified codebase URL path and
the current thread's context class loader as its parent. If no
such loader exists, then one is created and added to the table.
The table does not maintain strong references to its contained
loaders, in order to allow them and their defined classes to be
garbage collected when not otherwise reachable. In order to
prevent arbitrary untrusted code from being implicitly loaded
into a virtual machine with no security manager, if there is no
security manager set, the codebase loader is just the current
thread's context class loader (the supplied codebase URL path
is ignored, so remote class loading is disabled).

The

getClassLoader

method returns the codebase loader for the
specified codebase URL path. If there is a security manager,
then if the calling context does not have permission to connect
to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path, a

SecurityException

will be thrown.

The

loadClass

method attempts to load the class with the
specified name as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

, it first attempts to load the class with the
specified

name

using the

defaultLoader

, such as by evaluating

```java
Class.forName(name, false, defaultLoader)
```

If the class is successfully loaded from the

defaultLoader

, that class is returned. If an
exception other than

ClassNotFoundException

is
thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

Next, the

loadClass

method attempts to load the
class with the specified

name

using the codebase
loader for the specified codebase URL path.
If there is a security manager, then the calling context
must have permission to connect to all of the URLs in the
codebase URL path; otherwise, the current thread's context
class loader will be used instead of the codebase loader.

The

loadProxyClass

method attempts to return a dynamic proxy
class with the named interface as follows:

If the

defaultLoader

argument is
non-

null

and all of the named interfaces can be
resolved through that loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it first attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class (using

Proxy.getProxyClass

) for the resolved interfaces defined in
the codebase loader; if that attempt throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, it then attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in the

defaultLoader

. If both attempts
throw

IllegalArgumentException

, then this method
throws a

ClassNotFoundException

. If any other
exception is thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in that loader.

otherwise, a

LinkageError

is thrown (because a
class that implements all of the specified interfaces cannot be
defined in any loader).

Otherwise, if all of the named interfaces can be resolved
through the codebase loader, then,

- if all of the resolved interfaces are

public

,
then it attempts to obtain a dynamic proxy class for the
resolved interfaces in the codebase loader. If the attempt
throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, then this
method throws a

ClassNotFoundException

.

if all of the non-

public

resolved interfaces
are defined in the same class loader, then it attempts to
obtain a dynamic proxy class for the resolved interfaces
defined in that loader.

otherwise, a

LinkageError

is thrown (because a
class that implements all of the specified interfaces cannot be
defined in any loader).

Otherwise, a

ClassNotFoundException

is thrown
for one of the named interfaces that could not be resolved.

The

getClassLoader

method returns the codebase loader for the
specified codebase URL path. If there is a security manager,
then if the calling context does not have permission to connect
to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path, a

SecurityException

will be thrown.

The

loadClass

method attempts to load the class with the

defaultLoader

, such as by evaluating

```java
Class.forName(name, false, defaultLoader)
```

If the class is successfully loaded from the

defaultLoader

exception other than

is
thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.

Next, the

loadClass

method attempts to load the
class with the specified

name

using the codebase
loader for the specified codebase URL path.
If there is a security manager, then the calling context
must have permission to connect to all of the URLs in the
codebase URL path; otherwise, the current thread's context
class loader will be used instead of the codebase loader.

the codebase loader; if that attempt throws an

IllegalArgumentException

, it then attempts to

defaultLoader

. If both attempts
throw

, then this method
throws a

. If any other
exception is thrown, that exception is thrown to the caller.
