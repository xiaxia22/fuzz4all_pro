# Interface ResourceBundleProvider

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\spi\ResourceBundleProvider.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ResourceBundleProvider
```

ResourceBundleProvider

is a service provider interface for
resource bundles. It is used by

ResourceBundle.getBundle

factory methods to locate and load the service providers that are deployed as
modules via

ServiceLoader

.

Developing resource bundle services

A service for a resource bundle of a given

baseName

must have
a fully-qualified class name of the form:

<package of baseName> + ".spi." + <simple name of baseName> + "Provider"

The service type is in a

spi

subpackage as it may be packaged in
a module separate from the resource bundle providers.
For example, the service for a resource bundle named

com.example.app.MyResources

must be

com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider

:

```java
package com.example.app.spi;
public interface MyResourcesProvider extends ResourceBundleProvider {
}
```

Deploying resource bundle service providers

Resource bundles can be deployed in one or more service providers
in modules. For example, a provider for a service
named "

com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider

"
has the following implementation class:

```java
import com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider;
class MyResourcesProviderImpl extends AbstractResourceBundleProvider
implements MyResourcesProvider
{
public MyResourcesProviderImpl() {
super("java.properties");
}
// this provider maps the resource bundle to per-language package
protected String toBundleName(String baseName, Locale locale) {
return "p." + locale.getLanguage() + "." + baseName;
}

public ResourceBundle getBundle(String baseName, Locale locale) {
// this module only provides bundles in French
if (locale.equals(Locale.FRENCH)) {
return super.getBundle(baseName, locale);
}
// otherwise return null
return null;
}
}
```

This example provides "

com.example.app.MyResources

"
resource bundle of the French locale. Traditionally resource bundles of
all locales are packaged in the same package as the resource bundle base name.
When deploying resource bundles in more than one modules and two modules
containing a package of the same name,

split package

,
is not supported, resource bundles in each module can be packaged in
a different package as shown in this example where this provider packages
the resource bundles in per-language package, i.e.

com.example.app.fr

for French locale.

A provider can provide more than one services, each of which is a service
for a resource bundle of a different base name.

AbstractResourceBundleProvider

provides the basic implementation for

ResourceBundleProvider

and a subclass can override the

toBundleName

method to return a provider-specific location of the resource to be loaded,
for example, per-language package.
A provider can override

ResourceBundleProvider.getBundle

method for example to only search the known supported locales or
return resource bundles in other formats such as XML.

The module declaration of this provider module specifies the following
directive:

```java
provides com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider with com.example.impl.MyResourcesProviderImpl;
```

Obtaining resource bundles from providers

The module declaration of the

consumer module

that calls one of the

ResourceBundle.getBundle

factory methods to obtain a resource
bundle from service providers must specify the following directive:

```java
uses com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider;
```

ResourceBundle.getBundle("com.example.app.MyResource", locale)

locates and loads the providers for

com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider

service and then invokes

ResourceBundleProvider.getBundle("com.example.app.MyResource", locale)

to
find the resource bundle of the given base name and locale.
If the consumer module is a resource bundle service provider for

com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider

,

ResourceBundle.getBundle

will locate resource bundles only from service providers.
Otherwise,

ResourceBundle.getBundle

may continue the search of
the resource bundle in other modules and class path per the specification
of the

ResourceBundle.getBundle

method being called.
