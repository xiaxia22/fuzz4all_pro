# Class UnresolvedPermission

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\UnresolvedPermission.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
UnresolvedPermission

extends
Permission

implements
Serializable
```

The UnresolvedPermission class is used to hold Permissions that
were "unresolved" when the Policy was initialized.
An unresolved permission is one whose actual Permission class
does not yet exist at the time the Policy is initialized (see below).

The policy for a Java runtime (specifying
which permissions are available for code from various principals)
is represented by a Policy object.
Whenever a Policy is initialized or refreshed, Permission objects of
appropriate classes are created for all permissions
allowed by the Policy.

Many permission class types
referenced by the policy configuration are ones that exist
locally (i.e., ones that can be found on CLASSPATH).
Objects for such permissions can be instantiated during
Policy initialization. For example, it is always possible
to instantiate a java.io.FilePermission, since the
FilePermission class is found on the CLASSPATH.

Other permission classes may not yet exist during Policy
initialization. For example, a referenced permission class may
be in a JAR file that will later be loaded.
For each such class, an UnresolvedPermission is instantiated.
Thus, an UnresolvedPermission is essentially a "placeholder"
containing information about the permission.

Later, when code calls AccessController.checkPermission
on a permission of a type that was previously unresolved,
but whose class has since been loaded, previously-unresolved
permissions of that type are "resolved". That is,
for each such UnresolvedPermission, a new object of
the appropriate class type is instantiated, based on the
information in the UnresolvedPermission.

To instantiate the new class, UnresolvedPermission assumes
the class provides a zero, one, and/or two-argument constructor.
The zero-argument constructor would be used to instantiate
a permission without a name and without actions.
A one-arg constructor is assumed to take a

String

name as input, and a two-arg constructor is assumed to take a

String

name and

String

actions
as input. UnresolvedPermission may invoke a
constructor with a

null

name and/or actions.
If an appropriate permission constructor is not available,
the UnresolvedPermission is ignored and the relevant permission
will not be granted to executing code.

The newly created permission object replaces the
UnresolvedPermission, which is removed.

Note that the

getName

method for an

UnresolvedPermission

returns the

type

(class name) for the underlying permission
that has not been resolved.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public UnresolvedPermission​(
String
type,

String
name,

String
actions,

Certificate
[] certs)

Creates a new UnresolvedPermission containing the permission
information needed later to actually create a Permission of the
specified class, when the permission is resolved.

**Parameters:**
- type

- the class name of the Permission class that will be
created when this unresolved permission is resolved.
- name

- the name of the permission.
- actions

- the actions of the permission.
- certs

- the certificates the permission's class was signed with.
This is a list of certificate chains, where each chain is composed of a
signer certificate and optionally its supporting certificate chain.
Each chain is ordered bottom-to-top (i.e., with the signer certificate
first and the (root) certificate authority last). The signer
certificates are copied from the array. Subsequent changes to
the array will not affect this UnresolvedPermission.

---

### Method Details

#### public boolean implies​(
Permission
p)

This method always returns false for unresolved permissions.
That is, an UnresolvedPermission is never considered to
imply another permission.

**Specified by:**
- implies

in class

Permission

**Parameters:**
- p

- the permission to check against.

**Returns:**
- false.

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Checks two UnresolvedPermission objects for equality.
Checks that

obj

is an UnresolvedPermission, and has
the same type (class) name, permission name, actions, and
certificates as this object.

To determine certificate equality, this method only compares
actual signer certificates. Supporting certificate chains
are not taken into consideration by this method.

**Specified by:**
- equals

in class

Permission

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object we are testing for equality with this object.

**Returns:**
- true if obj is an UnresolvedPermission, and has the same
type (class) name, permission name, actions, and
certificates as this object.

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### public int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this object.

**Specified by:**
- hashCode

in class

Permission

**Returns:**
- a hash code value for this object.

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public
String
getActions()

Returns the canonical string representation of the actions,
which currently is the empty string "", since there are no actions for
an UnresolvedPermission. That is, the actions for the
permission that will be created when this UnresolvedPermission
is resolved may be non-null, but an UnresolvedPermission
itself is never considered to have any actions.

**Specified by:**
- getActions

in class

Permission

**Returns:**
- the empty string "".

---

#### public
String
getUnresolvedType()

Get the type (class name) of the underlying permission that
has not been resolved.

**Returns:**
- the type (class name) of the underlying permission that
has not been resolved

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
String
getUnresolvedName()

Get the target name of the underlying permission that
has not been resolved.

**Returns:**
- the target name of the underlying permission that
has not been resolved, or

null

,
if there is no target name

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
String
getUnresolvedActions()

Get the actions for the underlying permission that
has not been resolved.

**Returns:**
- the actions for the underlying permission that
has not been resolved, or

null

if there are no actions

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
Certificate
[] getUnresolvedCerts()

Get the signer certificates (without any supporting chain)
for the underlying permission that has not been resolved.

**Returns:**
- the signer certificates for the underlying permission that
has not been resolved, or null, if there are no signer certificates.
Returns a new array each time this method is called.

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string describing this UnresolvedPermission. The convention
is to specify the class name, the permission name, and the actions, in
the following format: '(unresolved "ClassName" "name" "actions")'.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Permission

**Returns:**
- information about this UnresolvedPermission.

---

#### public
PermissionCollection
newPermissionCollection()

Returns a new PermissionCollection object for storing
UnresolvedPermission objects.

**Overrides:**
- newPermissionCollection

in class

Permission

**Returns:**
- a new PermissionCollection object suitable for
storing UnresolvedPermissions.

```

Creates a new UnresolvedPermission containing the permission
information needed later to actually create a Permission of the
specified class, when the permission is resolved.

**Parameters:** type

- the class name of the Permission class that will be
created when this unresolved permission is resolved.
**Parameters:** name

- the name of the permission.
**Parameters:** actions

- the actions of the permission.
**Parameters:** certs

- the certificates the permission's class was signed with.
This is a list of certificate chains, where each chain is composed of a
signer certificate and optionally its supporting certificate chain.
Each chain is ordered bottom-to-top (i.e., with the signer certificate
first and the (root) certificate authority last). The signer
certificates are copied from the array. Subsequent changes to
the array will not affect this UnresolvedPermission.

#### UnresolvedPermission

public UnresolvedPermission​(

String

type,

String

name,

String

actions,

Certificate

[] certs)

Creates a new UnresolvedPermission containing the permission
information needed later to actually create a Permission of the
specified class, when the permission is resolved.

Method Detail

- implies

```java
public boolean implies​(
Permission
p)
```

This method always returns false for unresolved permissions.
That is, an UnresolvedPermission is never considered to
imply another permission.

**Specified by:** implies

in class

Permission
**Parameters:** p

- the permission to check against.
**Returns:** false.

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Checks two UnresolvedPermission objects for equality.
Checks that

obj

is an UnresolvedPermission, and has
the same type (class) name, permission name, actions, and
certificates as this object.

To determine certificate equality, this method only compares
actual signer certificates. Supporting certificate chains
are not taken into consideration by this method.

**Specified by:** equals

in class

Permission
**Parameters:** obj

- the object we are testing for equality with this object.
**Returns:** true if obj is an UnresolvedPermission, and has the same
type (class) name, permission name, actions, and
certificates as this object.
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this object.

**Specified by:** hashCode

in class

Permission
**Returns:** a hash code value for this object.
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- getActions

```java
public
String
getActions()
```

Returns the canonical string representation of the actions,
which currently is the empty string "", since there are no actions for
an UnresolvedPermission. That is, the actions for the
permission that will be created when this UnresolvedPermission
is resolved may be non-null, but an UnresolvedPermission
itself is never considered to have any actions.

**Specified by:** getActions

in class

Permission
**Returns:** the empty string "".

- getUnresolvedType

```java
public
String
getUnresolvedType()
```

Get the type (class name) of the underlying permission that
has not been resolved.

**Returns:** the type (class name) of the underlying permission that
has not been resolved
**Since:** 1.5

- getUnresolvedName

```java
public
String
getUnresolvedName()
```

Get the target name of the underlying permission that
has not been resolved.

**Returns:** the target name of the underlying permission that
has not been resolved, or

null

,
if there is no target name
**Since:** 1.5

- getUnresolvedActions

```java
public
String
getUnresolvedActions()
```

Get the actions for the underlying permission that
has not been resolved.

**Returns:** the actions for the underlying permission that
has not been resolved, or

null

if there are no actions
**Since:** 1.5

- getUnresolvedCerts

```java
public
Certificate
[] getUnresolvedCerts()
```

Get the signer certificates (without any supporting chain)
for the underlying permission that has not been resolved.

**Returns:** the signer certificates for the underlying permission that
has not been resolved, or null, if there are no signer certificates.
Returns a new array each time this method is called.
**Since:** 1.5

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string describing this UnresolvedPermission. The convention
is to specify the class name, the permission name, and the actions, in
the following format: '(unresolved "ClassName" "name" "actions")'.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Permission
**Returns:** information about this UnresolvedPermission.

- newPermissionCollection

```java
public
PermissionCollection
newPermissionCollection()
```

Returns a new PermissionCollection object for storing
UnresolvedPermission objects.

**Overrides:** newPermissionCollection

in class

Permission
**Returns:** a new PermissionCollection object suitable for
storing UnresolvedPermissions.
