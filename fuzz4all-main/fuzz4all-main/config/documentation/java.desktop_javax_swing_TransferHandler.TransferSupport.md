# Class TransferHandler.TransferSupport

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\TransferHandler.TransferSupport.html`

### Class Description

```java
public static final class
TransferHandler.TransferSupport

extends
Object
```

This class encapsulates all relevant details of a clipboard
or drag and drop transfer, and also allows for customizing
aspects of the drag and drop experience.

The main purpose of this class is to provide the information
needed by a developer to determine the suitability of a
transfer or to import the data contained within. But it also
doubles as a controller for customizing properties during drag
and drop, such as whether or not to show the drop location,
and which drop action to use.

Developers typically need not create instances of this
class. Instead, they are something provided by the DnD
implementation to certain methods in

TransferHandler

.

**Enclosing class:** TransferHandler

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public TransferSupport​(
Component
component,

Transferable
transferable)

Create a

TransferSupport

with

isDrop()

false

for the given component and

Transferable

.

**Parameters:**
- component

- the target component
- transferable

- the transferable

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if either parameter
is

null

---

### Method Details

#### public boolean isDrop()

Returns whether or not this

TransferSupport

represents a drop operation.

**Returns:**
- true

if this is a drop operation,

false

otherwise.

---

#### public
Component
getComponent()

Returns the target component of this transfer.

**Returns:**
- the target component

---

#### public
TransferHandler.DropLocation
getDropLocation()

Returns the current (non-

null

) drop location for the component,
when this

TransferSupport

represents a drop.

Note: For components with built-in drop support, this location
will be a subclass of

DropLocation

of the same type
returned by that component's

getDropLocation

method.

This method is only for use with drag and drop transfers.
Calling it when

isDrop()

is

false

results
in an

IllegalStateException

.

**Returns:**
- the drop location

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this is not a drop

**See Also:**
- isDrop()

---

#### public void setShowDropLocation​(boolean showDropLocation)

Sets whether or not the drop location should be visually indicated
for the transfer - which must represent a drop. This is applicable to
those components that automatically
show the drop location when appropriate during a drag and drop
operation). By default, the drop location is shown only when the

TransferHandler

has said it can accept the import represented
by this

TransferSupport

. With this method you can force the
drop location to always be shown, or always not be shown.

This method is only for use with drag and drop transfers.
Calling it when

isDrop()

is

false

results
in an

IllegalStateException

.

**Parameters:**
- showDropLocation

- whether or not to indicate the drop location

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this is not a drop

**See Also:**
- isDrop()

---

#### public void setDropAction​(int dropAction)

Sets the drop action for the transfer - which must represent a drop
- to the given action,
instead of the default user drop action. The action must be
supported by the source's drop actions, and must be one
of

COPY

,

MOVE

or

LINK

.

This method is only for use with drag and drop transfers.
Calling it when

isDrop()

is

false

results
in an

IllegalStateException

.

**Parameters:**
- dropAction

- the drop action

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this is not a drop
- IllegalArgumentException

- if an invalid action is specified

**See Also:**
- getDropAction()

,

getUserDropAction()

,

getSourceDropActions()

,

isDrop()

---

#### public int getDropAction()

Returns the action chosen for the drop, when this

TransferSupport

represents a drop.

Unless explicitly chosen by way of

setDropAction

,
this returns the user drop action provided by

getUserDropAction

.

You may wish to query this in

TransferHandler

's

importData

method to customize processing based
on the action.

This method is only for use with drag and drop transfers.
Calling it when

isDrop()

is

false

results
in an

IllegalStateException

.

**Returns:**
- the action chosen for the drop

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this is not a drop

**See Also:**
- setDropAction(int)

,

getUserDropAction()

,

isDrop()

---

#### public int getUserDropAction()

Returns the user drop action for the drop, when this

TransferSupport

represents a drop.

The user drop action is chosen for a drop as described in the
documentation for

DropTargetDragEvent

and

DropTargetDropEvent

. A different action
may be chosen as the drop action by way of the

setDropAction

method.

You may wish to query this in

TransferHandler

's

canImport

method when determining the suitability of a
drop or when deciding on a drop action to explicitly choose.

This method is only for use with drag and drop transfers.
Calling it when

isDrop()

is

false

results
in an

IllegalStateException

.

**Returns:**
- the user drop action

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this is not a drop

**See Also:**
- setDropAction(int)

,

getDropAction()

,

isDrop()

---

#### public int getSourceDropActions()

Returns the drag source's supported drop actions, when this

TransferSupport

represents a drop.

The source actions represent the set of actions supported by the
source of this transfer, and are represented as some bitwise-OR
combination of

COPY

,

MOVE

and

LINK

.
You may wish to query this in

TransferHandler

's

canImport

method when determining the suitability of a drop
or when deciding on a drop action to explicitly choose. To determine
if a particular action is supported by the source, bitwise-AND
the action with the source drop actions, and then compare the result
against the original action. For example:

```java
boolean copySupported = (COPY & getSourceDropActions()) == COPY;
```

This method is only for use with drag and drop transfers.
Calling it when

isDrop()

is

false

results
in an

IllegalStateException

.

**Returns:**
- the drag source's supported drop actions

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this is not a drop

**See Also:**
- isDrop()

---

#### public
DataFlavor
[] getDataFlavors()

Returns the data flavors for this transfer.

**Returns:**
- the data flavors for this transfer

---

#### public boolean isDataFlavorSupported​(
DataFlavor
df)

Returns whether or not the given data flavor is supported.

**Parameters:**
- df

- the

DataFlavor

to test

**Returns:**
- whether or not the given flavor is supported.

---

#### public
Transferable
getTransferable()

Returns the

Transferable

associated with this transfer.

Note: Unless it is necessary to fetch the

Transferable

directly, use one of the other methods on this class to inquire about
the transfer. This may perform better than fetching the

Transferable

and asking it directly.

**Returns:**
- the

Transferable

associated with this transfer

Returns the current (non-

null

) drop location for the component,
when this

TransferSupport

represents a drop.

Note: For components with built-in drop support, this location
will be a subclass of

DropLocation

of the same type
returned by that component's

getDropLocation

method.

This method is only for use with drag and drop transfers.
Calling it when

isDrop()

is

false

results
in an

IllegalStateException

.

**Returns:** the drop location
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this is not a drop

setShowDropLocation

```java
public void setShowDropLocation​(boolean showDropLocation)
```

Sets whether or not the drop location should be visually indicated
for the transfer - which must represent a drop. This is applicable to
those components that automatically
show the drop location when appropriate during a drag and drop
operation). By default, the drop location is shown only when the

TransferHandler

has said it can accept the import represented
by this

TransferSupport

. With this method you can force the
drop location to always be shown, or always not be shown.
