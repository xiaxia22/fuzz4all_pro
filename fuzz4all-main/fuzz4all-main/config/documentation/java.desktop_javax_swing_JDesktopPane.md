# Class JDesktopPane

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\JDesktopPane.html`

### Class Description

```java
@JavaBean
(
defaultProperty
="UI")
public class
JDesktopPane

extends
JLayeredPane

implements
Accessible
```

A container used to create a multiple-document interface or a virtual desktop.
You create

JInternalFrame

objects and add them to the

JDesktopPane

.

JDesktopPane

extends

JLayeredPane

to manage the potentially overlapping internal
frames. It also maintains a reference to an instance of

DesktopManager

that is set by the UI
class for the current look and feel (L&F). Note that

JDesktopPane

does not support borders.

This class is normally used as the parent of

JInternalFrames

to provide a pluggable

DesktopManager

object to the

JInternalFrames

. The

installUI

of the
L&F specific implementation is responsible for setting the

desktopManager

variable appropriately.
When the parent of a

JInternalFrame

is a

JDesktopPane

,
it should delegate most of its behavior to the

desktopManager

(closing, resizing, etc).

For further documentation and examples see

How to Use Internal Frames

,
a section in

The Java Tutorial

.

Warning:

Swing is not thread safe. For more
information see

Swing's Threading
Policy

.

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.

---

#### protected void addImpl​(
Component
comp,

Object
constraints,
int index)

Adds the specified component to this container at the specified
index. This method also notifies the layout manager to add
the component to this container's layout using the specified
constraints object via the

addLayoutComponent

method.

The constraints are
defined by the particular layout manager being used. For
example, the

BorderLayout

class defines five
constraints:

BorderLayout.NORTH

,

BorderLayout.SOUTH

,

BorderLayout.EAST

,

BorderLayout.WEST

, and

BorderLayout.CENTER

.

The

GridBagLayout

class requires a

GridBagConstraints

object. Failure to pass
the correct type of constraints object results in an

IllegalArgumentException

.

If the current layout manager implements

LayoutManager2

, then

LayoutManager2.addLayoutComponent(Component,Object)

is invoked on
it. If the current layout manager does not implement

LayoutManager2

, and constraints is a

String

, then

LayoutManager.addLayoutComponent(String,Component)

is invoked on it.

If the component is not an ancestor of this container and has a non-null
parent, it is removed from its current parent before it is added to this
container.

This is the method to override if a program needs to track
every add request to a container as all other add methods defer
to this one. An overriding method should
usually include a call to the superclass's version of the method:

super.addImpl(comp, constraints, index)

This method changes layout-related information, and therefore,
invalidates the component hierarchy. If the container has already been
displayed, the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to
display the added component.

**Overrides:**
- addImpl

in class

Container

**Parameters:**
- comp

- the component to be added
- constraints

- an object expressing layout constraints
for this component
- index

- the position in the container's list at which to
insert the component, where

-1

means append to the end

**See Also:**
- Container.add(Component)

,

Container.add(Component, int)

,

Container.add(Component, java.lang.Object)

,

Container.invalidate()

,

LayoutManager

,

LayoutManager2

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public void remove​(int index)

Remove the indexed component from this pane.
This is the absolute index, ignoring layers.

**Overrides:**
- remove

in class

JLayeredPane

**Parameters:**
- index

- an int specifying the component to remove

**See Also:**
- JLayeredPane.getIndexOf(java.awt.Component)

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public void removeAll()

Removes all the components from this container.

**Overrides:**
- removeAll

in class

JLayeredPane

**See Also:**
- Container.add(java.awt.Component)

,

Container.remove(int)

,

Container.invalidate()

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public void setComponentZOrder​(
Component
comp,
int index)

Moves the specified component to the specified z-order index in
the container. The z-order determines the order that components
are painted; the component with the highest z-order paints first
and the component with the lowest z-order paints last.
Where components overlap, the component with the lower
z-order paints over the component with the higher z-order.

If the component is a child of some other container, it is
removed from that container before being added to this container.
The important difference between this method and

java.awt.Container.add(Component, int)

is that this method
doesn't call

removeNotify

on the component while
removing it from its previous container unless necessary and when
allowed by the underlying native windowing system. This way, if the
component has the keyboard focus, it maintains the focus when
moved to the new position.

This property is guaranteed to apply only to lightweight
non-

Container

components.

This method changes layout-related information, and therefore,
invalidates the component hierarchy.

Note

: Not all platforms support changing the z-order of
heavyweight components from one container into another without
the call to

removeNotify

. There is no way to detect
whether a platform supports this, so developers shouldn't make
any assumptions.

**Overrides:**
- setComponentZOrder

in class

Container

**Parameters:**
- comp

- the component to be moved
- index

- the position in the container's list to
insert the component, where

getComponentCount()

appends to the end

**See Also:**
- Container.getComponentZOrder(java.awt.Component)

,

Container.invalidate()

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### protected
String
paramString()

Returns a string representation of this

JDesktopPane

.
This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and the
content and format of the returned string may vary between
implementations. The returned string may be empty but may not
be

null

.

**Overrides:**
- paramString

in class

JLayeredPane

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this

JDesktopPane

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
AccessibleContext
getAccessibleContext()

Gets the

AccessibleContext

associated with this

JDesktopPane

. For desktop panes, the

AccessibleContext

takes the form of an

AccessibleJDesktopPane

.
A new

AccessibleJDesktopPane

instance is created if necessary.

**Specified by:**
- getAccessibleContext

in interface

Accessible

**Overrides:**
- getAccessibleContext

in class

JLayeredPane

**Returns:**
- an

AccessibleJDesktopPane

that serves as the

AccessibleContext

of this

JDesktopPane

code and should not be called directly. To visually select the frame
the client must call JInternalFrame.setSelected(true) to activate
the frame.

**Parameters:** f

- the internal frame that's currently selected

**Since:** 1.6

- addImpl

```java
protected void addImpl​(
Component
comp,

Object
constraints,
int index)
```

Adds the specified component to this container at the specified
index. This method also notifies the layout manager to add
the component to this container's layout using the specified
constraints object via the

addLayoutComponent

method.

The constraints are
defined by the particular layout manager being used. For
example, the

BorderLayout

class defines five
constraints:

BorderLayout.NORTH

,

BorderLayout.SOUTH

,

BorderLayout.EAST

,

BorderLayout.WEST

, and

BorderLayout.CENTER

.

The

GridBagLayout

class requires a

GridBagConstraints

object. Failure to pass
the correct type of constraints object results in an

IllegalArgumentException

.

If the current layout manager implements

LayoutManager2

, then

LayoutManager2.addLayoutComponent(Component,Object)

is invoked on
it. If the current layout manager does not implement

LayoutManager2

, and constraints is a

String

, then

LayoutManager.addLayoutComponent(String,Component)

is invoked on it.

If the component is not an ancestor of this container and has a non-null
parent, it is removed from its current parent before it is added to this
container.

This is the method to override if a program needs to track
every add request to a container as all other add methods defer
to this one. An overriding method should
usually include a call to the superclass's version of the method:

super.addImpl(comp, constraints, index)

This method changes layout-related information, and therefore,
invalidates the component hierarchy. If the container has already been
displayed, the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to
display the added component.

**Overrides:** addImpl

in class

Container
**Parameters:** comp

- the component to be added
**Parameters:** constraints

- an object expressing layout constraints
for this component
**Parameters:** index

- the position in the container's list at which to
insert the component, where

-1

means append to the end
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** Container.add(Component)

,

Container.add(Component, int)

,

Container.add(Component, java.lang.Object)

,

Container.invalidate()

,

LayoutManager

,

LayoutManager2

- remove

```java
public void remove​(int index)
```

Remove the indexed component from this pane.
This is the absolute index, ignoring layers.

**Overrides:** remove

in class

JLayeredPane
**Parameters:** index

- an int specifying the component to remove
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** JLayeredPane.getIndexOf(java.awt.Component)

- removeAll

```java
public void removeAll()
```

Removes all the components from this container.

**Overrides:** removeAll

in class

JLayeredPane
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** Container.add(java.awt.Component)

,

Container.remove(int)

,

Container.invalidate()

- setComponentZOrder

```java
public void setComponentZOrder​(
Component
comp,
int index)
```

Moves the specified component to the specified z-order index in
the container. The z-order determines the order that components
are painted; the component with the highest z-order paints first
and the component with the lowest z-order paints last.
Where components overlap, the component with the lower
z-order paints over the component with the higher z-order.

If the component is a child of some other container, it is
removed from that container before being added to this container.
The important difference between this method and

java.awt.Container.add(Component, int)

is that this method
doesn't call

removeNotify

on the component while
removing it from its previous container unless necessary and when
allowed by the underlying native windowing system. This way, if the
component has the keyboard focus, it maintains the focus when
moved to the new position.

This property is guaranteed to apply only to lightweight
non-

Container

components.

This method changes layout-related information, and therefore,
invalidates the component hierarchy.

Note

: Not all platforms support changing the z-order of
heavyweight components from one container into another without
the call to

removeNotify

. There is no way to detect
whether a platform supports this, so developers shouldn't make
any assumptions.

**Overrides:** setComponentZOrder

in class

Container
**Parameters:** comp

- the component to be moved
**Parameters:** index

- the position in the container's list to
insert the component, where

getComponentCount()

appends to the end
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** Container.getComponentZOrder(java.awt.Component)

,

Container.invalidate()

- paramString

```java
protected
String
paramString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

JDesktopPane

.
This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and the
content and format of the returned string may vary between
implementations. The returned string may be empty but may not
be

null

.

**Overrides:** paramString

in class

JLayeredPane
**Returns:** a string representation of this

JDesktopPane

- getAccessibleContext

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
AccessibleContext
getAccessibleContext()
```

Gets the

AccessibleContext

associated with this

JDesktopPane

. For desktop panes, the

AccessibleContext

takes the form of an

AccessibleJDesktopPane

.
A new

AccessibleJDesktopPane

instance is created if necessary.

**Specified by:** getAccessibleContext

**Overrides:** getAccessibleContext

in class

JLayeredPane
**Returns:** an

AccessibleJDesktopPane

that serves as the

- addImpl

```java
protected void addImpl​(
Component
comp,

constraints,
int index)
```

Adds the specified component to this container at the specified
index. This method also notifies the layout manager to add
the component to this container's layout using the specified
constraints object via the

addLayoutComponent

method.

The constraints are
defined by the particular layout manager being used. For
example, the

BorderLayout

class defines five
constraints:

BorderLayout.NORTH

,

BorderLayout.SOUTH

,

BorderLayout.EAST

,

BorderLayout.WEST

, and

BorderLayout.CENTER

.

The

GridBagLayout

class requires a

are painted; the component with the highest z-order paints first
and the component with the lowest z-order paints last.
Where components overlap, the component with the lower
z-order paints over the component with the higher z-order.

If the component is a child of some other container, it is

addImpl

```java
protected void addImpl​(
Component
comp,

Object
constraints,
int index)
```

Adds the specified component to this container at the specified
index. This method also notifies the layout manager to add
the component to this container's layout using the specified
constraints object via the

addLayoutComponent

method.

The constraints are
defined by the particular layout manager being used. For
example, the

BorderLayout

class defines five
constraints:

BorderLayout.NORTH

,

BorderLayout.SOUTH

,

BorderLayout.EAST

,

BorderLayout.WEST

, and

BorderLayout.CENTER

.

The

GridBagLayout

class requires a

GridBagConstraints

object. Failure to pass
the correct type of constraints object results in an

IllegalArgumentException

.

If the current layout manager implements

LayoutManager2

, then

LayoutManager2.addLayoutComponent(Component,Object)

is invoked on
it. If the current layout manager does not implement

LayoutManager2

, and constraints is a

String

, then

LayoutManager.addLayoutComponent(String,Component)

is invoked on it.

If the component is not an ancestor of this container and has a non-null
parent, it is removed from its current parent before it is added to this
container.

This is the method to override if a program needs to track
every add request to a container as all other add methods defer
to this one. An overriding method should
usually include a call to the superclass's version of the method:

super.addImpl(comp, constraints, index)

This method changes layout-related information, and therefore,
invalidates the component hierarchy. If the container has already been
displayed, the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to
display the added component.

**Overrides:** addImpl

in class

Container
**Parameters:** comp

- the component to be added
**Parameters:** constraints

- an object expressing layout constraints
for this component
**Parameters:** index

- the position in the container's list at which to
insert the component, where

-1

means append to the end

remove

```java
public void remove​(int index)
```

Remove the indexed component from this pane.
This is the absolute index, ignoring layers.

**Overrides:** remove

in class

JLayeredPane
**Parameters:** index

- an int specifying the component to remove
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** JLayeredPane.getIndexOf(java.awt.Component)

---

#### remove

public void remove​(int index)

removeAll

```java
public void removeAll()
```

Removes all the components from this container.

**Overrides:** removeAll

public void removeAll()

Removes all the components from this container.

setComponentZOrder

```java
public void setComponentZOrder​(
Component
comp,
int index)
```

Moves the specified component to the specified z-order index in
the container. The z-order determines the order that components
are painted; the component with the highest z-order paints first
and the component with the lowest z-order paints last.
Where components overlap, the component with the lower
z-order paints over the component with the higher z-order.

If the component is a child of some other container, it is
removed from that container before being added to this container.
The important difference between this method and

java.awt.Container.add(Component, int)

is that this method
doesn't call

removeNotify

on the component while
removing it from its previous container unless necessary and when
allowed by the underlying native windowing system. This way, if the
component has the keyboard focus, it maintains the focus when
moved to the new position.

This property is guaranteed to apply only to lightweight
non-

Container

components.

This method changes layout-related information, and therefore,
invalidates the component hierarchy.

Note

: Not all platforms support changing the z-order of
heavyweight components from one container into another without
the call to

removeNotify

. There is no way to detect
whether a platform supports this, so developers shouldn't make
any assumptions.

**Overrides:** setComponentZOrder

in class

Container
**Parameters:** comp

- the component to be moved
**Parameters:** index

- the position in the container's list to
insert the component, where
