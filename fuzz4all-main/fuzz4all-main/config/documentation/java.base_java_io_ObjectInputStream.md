# Class ObjectInputStream

**Source:** `java.base\java\io\ObjectInputStream.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ObjectInputStream

extends
InputStream

implements
ObjectInput
,
ObjectStreamConstants
```

An ObjectInputStream deserializes primitive data and objects previously
written using an ObjectOutputStream.

Warning: Deserialization of untrusted data is inherently dangerous
and should be avoided. Untrusted data should be carefully validated according to the
"Serialization and Deserialization" section of the

Secure Coding Guidelines for Java SE

.

Serialization Filtering

describes best
practices for defensive use of serial filters.

ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream can provide an application with
persistent storage for graphs of objects when used with a FileOutputStream
and FileInputStream respectively. ObjectInputStream is used to recover
those objects previously serialized. Other uses include passing objects
between hosts using a socket stream or for marshaling and unmarshaling
arguments and parameters in a remote communication system.

ObjectInputStream ensures that the types of all objects in the graph
created from the stream match the classes present in the Java Virtual
Machine. Classes are loaded as required using the standard mechanisms.

Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable or
java.io.Externalizable interface can be read from streams.

The method

readObject

is used to read an object from the
stream. Java's safe casting should be used to get the desired type. In
Java, strings and arrays are objects and are treated as objects during
serialization. When read they need to be cast to the expected type.

Primitive data types can be read from the stream using the appropriate
method on DataInput.

The default deserialization mechanism for objects restores the contents
of each field to the value and type it had when it was written. Fields
declared as transient or static are ignored by the deserialization process.
References to other objects cause those objects to be read from the stream
as necessary. Graphs of objects are restored correctly using a reference
sharing mechanism. New objects are always allocated when deserializing,
which prevents existing objects from being overwritten.

Reading an object is analogous to running the constructors of a new
object. Memory is allocated for the object and initialized to zero (NULL).
No-arg constructors are invoked for the non-serializable classes and then
the fields of the serializable classes are restored from the stream starting
with the serializable class closest to java.lang.object and finishing with
the object's most specific class.

For example to read from a stream as written by the example in
ObjectOutputStream:

```java
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("t.tmp");
ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);

int i = ois.readInt();
String today = (String) ois.readObject();
Date date = (Date) ois.readObject();

ois.close();
```

Classes control how they are serialized by implementing either the
java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interfaces.

Implementing the Serializable interface allows object serialization to
save and restore the entire state of the object and it allows classes to
evolve between the time the stream is written and the time it is read. It
automatically traverses references between objects, saving and restoring
entire graphs.

Serializable classes that require special handling during the
serialization and deserialization process should implement the following
methods:

```java
private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)
throws IOException;
private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)
throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
private void readObjectNoData()
throws ObjectStreamException;
```

The readObject method is responsible for reading and restoring the state
of the object for its particular class using data written to the stream by
the corresponding writeObject method. The method does not need to concern
itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or subclasses. State is
restored by reading data from the ObjectInputStream for the individual
fields and making assignments to the appropriate fields of the object.
Reading primitive data types is supported by DataInput.

Any attempt to read object data which exceeds the boundaries of the
custom data written by the corresponding writeObject method will cause an
OptionalDataException to be thrown with an eof field value of true.
Non-object reads which exceed the end of the allotted data will reflect the
end of data in the same way that they would indicate the end of the stream:
bytewise reads will return -1 as the byte read or number of bytes read, and
primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions. If there is no corresponding
writeObject method, then the end of default serialized data marks the end of
the allotted data.

Primitive and object read calls issued from within a readExternal method
behave in the same manner--if the stream is already positioned at the end of
data written by the corresponding writeExternal method, object reads will
throw OptionalDataExceptions with eof set to true, bytewise reads will
return -1, and primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions. Note that this
behavior does not hold for streams written with the old

ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1

protocol, in which the
end of data written by writeExternal methods is not demarcated, and hence
cannot be detected.

The readObjectNoData method is responsible for initializing the state of
the object for its particular class in the event that the serialization
stream does not list the given class as a superclass of the object being
deserialized. This may occur in cases where the receiving party uses a
different version of the deserialized instance's class than the sending
party, and the receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by
the sender's version. This may also occur if the serialization stream has
been tampered; hence, readObjectNoData is useful for initializing
deserialized objects properly despite a "hostile" or incomplete source
stream.

Serialization does not read or assign values to the fields of any object
that does not implement the java.io.Serializable interface. Subclasses of
Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case the
non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to
be initialized. In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to
save and restore the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently
the case that the fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or
protected) or that there are get and set methods that can be used to restore
the state.

The contents of the stream can be filtered during deserialization.
If a

filter is set

on an ObjectInputStream, the

ObjectInputFilter

can check that
the classes, array lengths, number of references in the stream, depth, and
number of bytes consumed from the input stream are allowed and
if not, can terminate deserialization.
A

process-wide filter

can be configured that is applied to each

ObjectInputStream

unless replaced
using

setObjectInputFilter

.

Any exception that occurs while deserializing an object will be caught by
the ObjectInputStream and abort the reading process.

Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to assume
complete control over the contents and format of the object's serialized
form. The methods of the Externalizable interface, writeExternal and
readExternal, are called to save and restore the objects state. When
implemented by a class they can write and read their own state using all of
the methods of ObjectOutput and ObjectInput. It is the responsibility of
the objects to handle any versioning that occurs.

Enum constants are deserialized differently than ordinary serializable or
externalizable objects. The serialized form of an enum constant consists
solely of its name; field values of the constant are not transmitted. To
deserialize an enum constant, ObjectInputStream reads the constant name from
the stream; the deserialized constant is then obtained by calling the static
method

Enum.valueOf(Class, String)

with the enum constant's
base type and the received constant name as arguments. Like other
serializable or externalizable objects, enum constants can function as the
targets of back references appearing subsequently in the serialization
stream. The process by which enum constants are deserialized cannot be
customized: any class-specific readObject, readObjectNoData, and readResolve
methods defined by enum types are ignored during deserialization.
Similarly, any serialPersistentFields or serialVersionUID field declarations
are also ignored--all enum types have a fixed serialVersionUID of 0L.

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public ObjectInputStream​(
InputStream
in)
throws
IOException

Creates an ObjectInputStream that reads from the specified InputStream.
A serialization stream header is read from the stream and verified.
This constructor will block until the corresponding ObjectOutputStream
has written and flushed the header.

The serialization filter is initialized to the value of

the process-wide filter

.

If a security manager is installed, this constructor will check for
the "enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission when invoked
directly or indirectly by the constructor of a subclass which overrides
the ObjectInputStream.readFields or ObjectInputStream.readUnshared
methods.

**Parameters:**
- in

- input stream to read from

**Throws:**
- StreamCorruptedException

- if the stream header is incorrect
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while reading stream header
- SecurityException

- if untrusted subclass illegally overrides
security-sensitive methods
- NullPointerException

- if

in

is

null

ObjectOutputStream(OutputStream)

---

#### protected ObjectInputStream()
throws
IOException
,

SecurityException

Provide a way for subclasses that are completely reimplementing
ObjectInputStream to not have to allocate private data just used by this
implementation of ObjectInputStream.

The serialization filter is initialized to the value of

the process-wide filter

.

If there is a security manager installed, this method first calls the
security manager's

checkPermission

method with the

SerializablePermission("enableSubclassImplementation")

permission to ensure it's ok to enable subclassing.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method denies enabling
subclassing.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while creating this stream

**See Also:**
- SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

SerializablePermission

### Method Details

#### public final
Object
readObject()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException

Read an object from the ObjectInputStream. The class of the object, the
signature of the class, and the values of the non-transient and
non-static fields of the class and all of its supertypes are read.
Default deserializing for a class can be overridden using the writeObject
and readObject methods. Objects referenced by this object are read
transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of objects is
reconstructed by readObject.

The root object is completely restored when all of its fields and the
objects it references are completely restored. At this point the object
validation callbacks are executed in order based on their registered
priorities. The callbacks are registered by objects (in the readObject
special methods) as they are individually restored.

The serialization filter, when not

null

, is invoked for
each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
See

setObjectInputFilter

for details.

Exceptions are thrown for problems with the InputStream and for
classes that should not be deserialized. All exceptions are fatal to
the InputStream and leave it in an indeterminate state; it is up to the
caller to ignore or recover the stream state.

**Specified by:**
- readObject

in interface

ObjectInput

**Returns:**
- the object read from the stream

**Throws:**
- ClassNotFoundException

- Class of a serialized object cannot be
found.
- InvalidClassException

- Something is wrong with a class used by
serialization.
- StreamCorruptedException

- Control information in the
stream is inconsistent.
- OptionalDataException

- Primitive data was found in the
stream instead of objects.
- IOException

- Any of the usual Input/Output related exceptions.

---

#### protected
Object
readObjectOverride()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException

This method is called by trusted subclasses of ObjectInputStream that
constructed ObjectInputStream using the protected no-arg constructor.
The subclass is expected to provide an override method with the modifier
"final".

**Returns:**
- the Object read from the stream.

**Throws:**
- ClassNotFoundException

- Class definition of a serialized object
cannot be found.
- OptionalDataException

- Primitive data was found in the stream
instead of objects.
- IOException

- if I/O errors occurred while reading from the
underlying stream

**See Also:**
- ObjectInputStream()

,

readObject()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public
Object
readUnshared()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException

Reads an "unshared" object from the ObjectInputStream. This method is
identical to readObject, except that it prevents subsequent calls to
readObject and readUnshared from returning additional references to the
deserialized instance obtained via this call. Specifically:

- If readUnshared is called to deserialize a back-reference (the
stream representation of an object which has been written
previously to the stream), an ObjectStreamException will be
thrown.

If readUnshared returns successfully, then any subsequent attempts
to deserialize back-references to the stream handle deserialized
by readUnshared will cause an ObjectStreamException to be thrown.

Deserializing an object via readUnshared invalidates the stream handle
associated with the returned object. Note that this in itself does not
always guarantee that the reference returned by readUnshared is unique;
the deserialized object may define a readResolve method which returns an
object visible to other parties, or readUnshared may return a Class
object or enum constant obtainable elsewhere in the stream or through
external means. If the deserialized object defines a readResolve method
and the invocation of that method returns an array, then readUnshared
returns a shallow clone of that array; this guarantees that the returned
array object is unique and cannot be obtained a second time from an
invocation of readObject or readUnshared on the ObjectInputStream,
even if the underlying data stream has been manipulated.

The serialization filter, when not

null

, is invoked for
each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
See

setObjectInputFilter

for details.

ObjectInputStream subclasses which override this method can only be
constructed in security contexts possessing the
"enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission; any attempt to
instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a
SecurityException to be thrown.

**Returns:**
- reference to deserialized object

**Throws:**
- ClassNotFoundException

- if class of an object to deserialize
cannot be found
- StreamCorruptedException

- if control information in the stream
is inconsistent
- ObjectStreamException

- if object to deserialize has already
appeared in stream
- OptionalDataException

- if primitive data is next in stream
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs during deserialization

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public void defaultReadObject()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException

Read the non-static and non-transient fields of the current class from
this stream. This may only be called from the readObject method of the
class being deserialized. It will throw the NotActiveException if it is
called otherwise.

**Throws:**
- ClassNotFoundException

- if the class of a serialized object
could not be found.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
- NotActiveException

- if the stream is not currently reading
objects.

---

#### public
ObjectInputStream.GetField
readFields()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException

Reads the persistent fields from the stream and makes them available by
name.

**Returns:**
- the

GetField

object representing the persistent
fields of the object being deserialized

**Throws:**
- ClassNotFoundException

- if the class of a serialized object
could not be found.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
- NotActiveException

- if the stream is not currently reading
objects.

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public void registerValidation​(
ObjectInputValidation
obj,
int prio)
throws
NotActiveException
,

InvalidObjectException

Register an object to be validated before the graph is returned. While
similar to resolveObject these validations are called after the entire
graph has been reconstituted. Typically, a readObject method will
register the object with the stream so that when all of the objects are
restored a final set of validations can be performed.

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to receive the validation callback.
- prio

- controls the order of callbacks;zero is a good default.
Use higher numbers to be called back earlier, lower numbers for
later callbacks. Within a priority, callbacks are processed in
no particular order.

**Throws:**
- NotActiveException

- The stream is not currently reading objects
so it is invalid to register a callback.
- InvalidObjectException

- The validation object is null.

---

#### protected
Class
<?> resolveClass​(
ObjectStreamClass
desc)
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException

Load the local class equivalent of the specified stream class
description. Subclasses may implement this method to allow classes to
be fetched from an alternate source.

The corresponding method in

ObjectOutputStream

is

annotateClass

. This method will be invoked only once for
each unique class in the stream. This method can be implemented by
subclasses to use an alternate loading mechanism but must return a

Class

object. Once returned, if the class is not an array
class, its serialVersionUID is compared to the serialVersionUID of the
serialized class, and if there is a mismatch, the deserialization fails
and an

InvalidClassException

is thrown.

The default implementation of this method in

ObjectInputStream

returns the result of calling

```java
Class.forName(desc.getName(), false, loader)
```

where

loader

is the first class loader on the current
thread's stack (starting from the currently executing method) that is
neither the

platform
class loader

nor its ancestor; otherwise,

loader

is the

platform class loader

. If this call results in a

ClassNotFoundException

and the name of the passed

ObjectStreamClass

instance is the Java language keyword
for a primitive type or void, then the

Class

object
representing that primitive type or void will be returned
(e.g., an

ObjectStreamClass

with the name

"int"

will be resolved to

Integer.TYPE

).
Otherwise, the

ClassNotFoundException

will be thrown to
the caller of this method.

**Parameters:**
- desc

- an instance of class

ObjectStreamClass

**Returns:**
- a

Class

object corresponding to

desc

**Throws:**
- IOException

- any of the usual Input/Output exceptions.
- ClassNotFoundException

- if class of a serialized object cannot
be found.

---

#### protected
Class
<?> resolveProxyClass​(
String
[] interfaces)
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException

Returns a proxy class that implements the interfaces named in a proxy
class descriptor; subclasses may implement this method to read custom
data from the stream along with the descriptors for dynamic proxy
classes, allowing them to use an alternate loading mechanism for the
interfaces and the proxy class.

This method is called exactly once for each unique proxy class
descriptor in the stream.

The corresponding method in

ObjectOutputStream

is

annotateProxyClass

. For a given subclass of

ObjectInputStream

that overrides this method, the

annotateProxyClass

method in the corresponding subclass of

ObjectOutputStream

must write any data or objects read by
this method.

The default implementation of this method in

ObjectInputStream

returns the result of calling

Proxy.getProxyClass

with the list of

Class

objects for the interfaces that are named in the

interfaces

parameter. The

Class

object for each interface name

i

is the value returned by calling

```java
Class.forName(i, false, loader)
```

where

loader

is the first class loader on the current
thread's stack (starting from the currently executing method) that is
neither the

platform
class loader

nor its ancestor; otherwise,

loader

is the

platform class loader

.
Unless any of the resolved interfaces are non-public, this same value
of

loader

is also the class loader passed to

Proxy.getProxyClass

; if non-public interfaces are present,
their class loader is passed instead (if more than one non-public
interface class loader is encountered, an

IllegalAccessError

is thrown).
If

Proxy.getProxyClass

throws an

IllegalArgumentException

,

resolveProxyClass

will throw a

ClassNotFoundException

containing the

IllegalArgumentException

.

**Parameters:**
- interfaces

- the list of interface names that were
deserialized in the proxy class descriptor

**Returns:**
- a proxy class for the specified interfaces

**Throws:**
- IOException

- any exception thrown by the underlying

InputStream
- ClassNotFoundException

- if the proxy class or any of the
named interfaces could not be found

**See Also:**
- ObjectOutputStream.annotateProxyClass(Class)

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### protected
Object
resolveObject​(
Object
obj)
throws
IOException

This method will allow trusted subclasses of ObjectInputStream to
substitute one object for another during deserialization. Replacing
objects is disabled until enableResolveObject is called. The
enableResolveObject method checks that the stream requesting to resolve
object can be trusted. Every reference to serializable objects is passed
to resolveObject. To insure that the private state of objects is not
unintentionally exposed only trusted streams may use resolveObject.

This method is called after an object has been read but before it is
returned from readObject. The default resolveObject method just returns
the same object.

When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that the
substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference
will be stored. Objects whose type is not a subclass of the type of the
field or array element abort the serialization by raising an exception
and the object is not be stored.

This method is called only once when each object is first
encountered. All subsequent references to the object will be redirected
to the new object.

**Parameters:**
- obj

- object to be substituted

**Returns:**
- the substituted object

**Throws:**
- IOException

- Any of the usual Input/Output exceptions.

---

#### protected boolean enableResolveObject​(boolean enable)
throws
SecurityException

Enables the stream to do replacement of objects read from the stream. When
enabled, the

resolveObject(java.lang.Object)

method is called for every object being
deserialized.

If object replacement is currently not enabled, and

enable

is true, and there is a security manager installed,
this method first calls the security manager's

checkPermission

method with the

SerializablePermission("enableSubstitution")

permission to
ensure that the caller is permitted to enable the stream to do replacement
of objects read from the stream.

**Parameters:**
- enable

- true for enabling use of

resolveObject

for
every object being deserialized

**Returns:**
- the previous setting before this method was invoked

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method denies enabling the stream
to do replacement of objects read from the stream.

#### protected void readStreamHeader()
throws
IOException
,

StreamCorruptedException

The readStreamHeader method is provided to allow subclasses to read and
verify their own stream headers. It reads and verifies the magic number
and version number.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if there are I/O errors while reading from the
underlying

InputStream
- StreamCorruptedException

- if control information in the stream
is inconsistent

---

#### protected
ObjectStreamClass
readClassDescriptor()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException

Read a class descriptor from the serialization stream. This method is
called when the ObjectInputStream expects a class descriptor as the next
item in the serialization stream. Subclasses of ObjectInputStream may
override this method to read in class descriptors that have been written
in non-standard formats (by subclasses of ObjectOutputStream which have
overridden the

writeClassDescriptor

method). By default,
this method reads class descriptors according to the format defined in
the Object Serialization specification.

**Returns:**
- the class descriptor read

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error has occurred.
- ClassNotFoundException

- If the Class of a serialized object used
in the class descriptor representation cannot be found

#### public final
ObjectInputFilter
getObjectInputFilter()

Returns the serialization filter for this stream.
The serialization filter is the most recent filter set in

setObjectInputFilter

or
the initial process-wide filter from

ObjectInputFilter.Config.getSerialFilter

.

**Returns:**
- the serialization filter for the stream; may be null

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public final void setObjectInputFilter​(
ObjectInputFilter
filter)

Set the serialization filter for the stream.
The filter's

checkInput

method is called
for each class and reference in the stream.
The filter can check any or all of the class, the array length, the number
of references, the depth of the graph, and the size of the input stream.
The depth is the number of nested

readObject

calls starting with the reading of the root of the graph being deserialized
and the current object being deserialized.
The number of references is the cumulative number of objects and references
to objects already read from the stream including the current object being read.
The filter is invoked only when reading objects from the stream and not for
primitives.

If the filter returns

Status.REJECTED

,

null

or throws a

RuntimeException

,
the active

readObject

or

readUnshared

throws

InvalidClassException

, otherwise deserialization
continues uninterrupted.

The serialization filter is initialized to the value of

ObjectInputFilter.Config.getSerialFilter

when the

ObjectInputStream

is constructed and can be set
to a custom filter only once.

**Parameters:**
- filter

- the filter, may be null

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if there is security manager and the

SerializablePermission("serialFilter")

is not granted
- IllegalStateException

- if the

current filter

is not

null

and is not the process-wide filter

**Since:**
- 9

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The filter, when not

null

, is invoked during

readObject

and

readUnshared

for each object (regular or class) in the stream.
Strings are treated as primitives and do not invoke the filter.
The filter is called for:

- each object reference previously deserialized from the stream
(class is

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each regular class (class is not

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each interface class explicitly referenced in the stream
(it is not called for interfaces implemented by classes in the stream),

each interface of a dynamic proxy and the dynamic proxy class itself
(class is not

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each array is filtered using the array type and length of the array
(class is the array type, arrayLength is the requested length),

each object replaced by its class'

readResolve

method
is filtered using the replacement object's class, if not

null

,
and if it is an array, the arrayLength, otherwise -1,

and each object replaced by

resolveObject

is filtered using the replacement object's class, if not

null

,
and if it is an array, the arrayLength, otherwise -1.

When the

checkInput

method is invoked
it is given access to the current class, the array length,
the current number of references already read from the stream,
the depth of nested calls to

readObject

or

readUnshared

,
and the implementation dependent number of bytes consumed from the input stream.

Each call to

readObject

or

readUnshared

increases the depth by 1
before reading an object and decreases by 1 before returning
normally or exceptionally.
The depth starts at

1

and increases for each nested object and
decrements when each nested call returns.
The count of references in the stream starts at

1

and
is increased before reading an object.

and should be avoided. Untrusted data should be carefully validated according to the

Serialization Filtering

describes best
practices for defensive use of serial filters.

ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream can provide an application with
persistent storage for graphs of objects when used with a FileOutputStream
and FileInputStream respectively. ObjectInputStream is used to recover
those objects previously serialized. Other uses include passing objects
between hosts using a socket stream or for marshaling and unmarshaling
arguments and parameters in a remote communication system.

ObjectInputStream ensures that the types of all objects in the graph
created from the stream match the classes present in the Java Virtual
Machine. Classes are loaded as required using the standard mechanisms.

Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable or
java.io.Externalizable interface can be read from streams.

The method

readObject

is used to read an object from the
stream. Java's safe casting should be used to get the desired type. In
Java, strings and arrays are objects and are treated as objects during
serialization. When read they need to be cast to the expected type.

Primitive data types can be read from the stream using the appropriate
method on DataInput.

The default deserialization mechanism for objects restores the contents
of each field to the value and type it had when it was written. Fields
declared as transient or static are ignored by the deserialization process.
References to other objects cause those objects to be read from the stream
as necessary. Graphs of objects are restored correctly using a reference
sharing mechanism. New objects are always allocated when deserializing,
which prevents existing objects from being overwritten.

Reading an object is analogous to running the constructors of a new
object. Memory is allocated for the object and initialized to zero (NULL).
No-arg constructors are invoked for the non-serializable classes and then
the fields of the serializable classes are restored from the stream starting
with the serializable class closest to java.lang.object and finishing with
the object's most specific class.

For example to read from a stream as written by the example in
ObjectOutputStream:

```java
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("t.tmp");
ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);

int i = ois.readInt();
String today = (String) ois.readObject();
Date date = (Date) ois.readObject();

ois.close();
```

Classes control how they are serialized by implementing either the
java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interfaces.

Implementing the Serializable interface allows object serialization to
save and restore the entire state of the object and it allows classes to
evolve between the time the stream is written and the time it is read. It
automatically traverses references between objects, saving and restoring
entire graphs.

Serializable classes that require special handling during the
serialization and deserialization process should implement the following
methods:

```java
private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)
throws IOException;
private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)
throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
private void readObjectNoData()
throws ObjectStreamException;
```

The readObject method is responsible for reading and restoring the state
of the object for its particular class using data written to the stream by
the corresponding writeObject method. The method does not need to concern
itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or subclasses. State is
restored by reading data from the ObjectInputStream for the individual
fields and making assignments to the appropriate fields of the object.
Reading primitive data types is supported by DataInput.

Any attempt to read object data which exceeds the boundaries of the
custom data written by the corresponding writeObject method will cause an
OptionalDataException to be thrown with an eof field value of true.
Non-object reads which exceed the end of the allotted data will reflect the
end of data in the same way that they would indicate the end of the stream:
bytewise reads will return -1 as the byte read or number of bytes read, and
primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions. If there is no corresponding
writeObject method, then the end of default serialized data marks the end of
the allotted data.

Primitive and object read calls issued from within a readExternal method
behave in the same manner--if the stream is already positioned at the end of
data written by the corresponding writeExternal method, object reads will
throw OptionalDataExceptions with eof set to true, bytewise reads will
return -1, and primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions. Note that this
behavior does not hold for streams written with the old

ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1

protocol, in which the
end of data written by writeExternal methods is not demarcated, and hence
cannot be detected.

The readObjectNoData method is responsible for initializing the state of
the object for its particular class in the event that the serialization
stream does not list the given class as a superclass of the object being
deserialized. This may occur in cases where the receiving party uses a
different version of the deserialized instance's class than the sending
party, and the receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by
the sender's version. This may also occur if the serialization stream has
been tampered; hence, readObjectNoData is useful for initializing
deserialized objects properly despite a "hostile" or incomplete source
stream.

Serialization does not read or assign values to the fields of any object
that does not implement the java.io.Serializable interface. Subclasses of
Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case the
non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to
be initialized. In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to
save and restore the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently
the case that the fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or
protected) or that there are get and set methods that can be used to restore
the state.

The contents of the stream can be filtered during deserialization.
If a

filter is set

on an ObjectInputStream, the

ObjectInputFilter

can check that
the classes, array lengths, number of references in the stream, depth, and
number of bytes consumed from the input stream are allowed and
if not, can terminate deserialization.
A

process-wide filter

can be configured that is applied to each

ObjectInputStream

unless replaced
using

setObjectInputFilter

.

Any exception that occurs while deserializing an object will be caught by
the ObjectInputStream and abort the reading process.

Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to assume
complete control over the contents and format of the object's serialized
form. The methods of the Externalizable interface, writeExternal and
readExternal, are called to save and restore the objects state. When
implemented by a class they can write and read their own state using all of
the methods of ObjectOutput and ObjectInput. It is the responsibility of
the objects to handle any versioning that occurs.

Enum constants are deserialized differently than ordinary serializable or
externalizable objects. The serialized form of an enum constant consists
solely of its name; field values of the constant are not transmitted. To
deserialize an enum constant, ObjectInputStream reads the constant name from
the stream; the deserialized constant is then obtained by calling the static
method

Enum.valueOf(Class, String)

with the enum constant's
base type and the received constant name as arguments. Like other
serializable or externalizable objects, enum constants can function as the
targets of back references appearing subsequently in the serialization
stream. The process by which enum constants are deserialized cannot be
customized: any class-specific readObject, readObjectNoData, and readResolve
methods defined by enum types are ignored during deserialization.
Similarly, any serialPersistentFields or serialVersionUID field declarations
are also ignored--all enum types have a fixed serialVersionUID of 0L.

return -1, and primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions. Note that this
behavior does not hold for streams written with the old

ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1

protocol, in which the
end of data written by writeExternal methods is not demarcated, and hence
cannot be detected.

The readObjectNoData method is responsible for initializing the state of
the object for its particular class in the event that the serialization
stream does not list the given class as a superclass of the object being
deserialized. This may occur in cases where the receiving party uses a
different version of the deserialized instance's class than the sending
party, and the receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by
the sender's version. This may also occur if the serialization stream has
been tampered; hence, readObjectNoData is useful for initializing
deserialized objects properly despite a "hostile" or incomplete source
stream.

Serialization does not read or assign values to the fields of any object
that does not implement the java.io.Serializable interface. Subclasses of
Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case the
non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to
be initialized. In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to
save and restore the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently
the case that the fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or
protected) or that there are get and set methods that can be used to restore
the state.

The contents of the stream can be filtered during deserialization.
If a

filter is set

on an ObjectInputStream, the

ObjectInputFilter

can check that
the classes, array lengths, number of references in the stream, depth, and
number of bytes consumed from the input stream are allowed and
if not, can terminate deserialization.
A

process-wide filter

can be configured that is applied to each

ObjectInputStream

unless replaced
using

setObjectInputFilter

.

Any exception that occurs while deserializing an object will be caught by
the ObjectInputStream and abort the reading process.

Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to assume
complete control over the contents and format of the object's serialized
form. The methods of the Externalizable interface, writeExternal and
readExternal, are called to save and restore the objects state. When
implemented by a class they can write and read their own state using all of
the methods of ObjectOutput and ObjectInput. It is the responsibility of
the objects to handle any versioning that occurs.

Enum constants are deserialized differently than ordinary serializable or
externalizable objects. The serialized form of an enum constant consists
solely of its name; field values of the constant are not transmitted. To
deserialize an enum constant, ObjectInputStream reads the constant name from
the stream; the deserialized constant is then obtained by calling the static
method

Enum.valueOf(Class, String)

with the enum constant's
base type and the received constant name as arguments. Like other
serializable or externalizable objects, enum constants can function as the
targets of back references appearing subsequently in the serialization
stream. The process by which enum constants are deserialized cannot be
customized: any class-specific readObject, readObjectNoData, and readResolve
methods defined by enum types are ignored during deserialization.
Similarly, any serialPersistentFields or serialVersionUID field declarations
are also ignored--all enum types have a fixed serialVersionUID of 0L.

Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable or
java.io.Externalizable interface can be read from streams.

The method

readObject

is used to read an object from the
stream. Java's safe casting should be used to get the desired type. In
Java, strings and arrays are objects and are treated as objects during
serialization. When read they need to be cast to the expected type.

Primitive data types can be read from the stream using the appropriate
method on DataInput.

The default deserialization mechanism for objects restores the contents
of each field to the value and type it had when it was written. Fields
declared as transient or static are ignored by the deserialization process.
References to other objects cause those objects to be read from the stream
as necessary. Graphs of objects are restored correctly using a reference
sharing mechanism. New objects are always allocated when deserializing,
which prevents existing objects from being overwritten.

Reading an object is analogous to running the constructors of a new
object. Memory is allocated for the object and initialized to zero (NULL).
No-arg constructors are invoked for the non-serializable classes and then
the fields of the serializable classes are restored from the stream starting
with the serializable class closest to java.lang.object and finishing with
the object's most specific class.

For example to read from a stream as written by the example in
ObjectOutputStream:

```java
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("t.tmp");
ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);

int i = ois.readInt();
String today = (String) ois.readObject();
Date date = (Date) ois.readObject();

ois.close();
```

Classes control how they are serialized by implementing either the
java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interfaces.

Implementing the Serializable interface allows object serialization to
save and restore the entire state of the object and it allows classes to
evolve between the time the stream is written and the time it is read. It
automatically traverses references between objects, saving and restoring
entire graphs.

Serializable classes that require special handling during the
serialization and deserialization process should implement the following
methods:

```java
private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)
throws IOException;
private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)
throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
private void readObjectNoData()
throws ObjectStreamException;
```

The readObject method is responsible for reading and restoring the state
of the object for its particular class using data written to the stream by
the corresponding writeObject method. The method does not need to concern
itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or subclasses. State is
restored by reading data from the ObjectInputStream for the individual
fields and making assignments to the appropriate fields of the object.
Reading primitive data types is supported by DataInput.

Any attempt to read object data which exceeds the boundaries of the
custom data written by the corresponding writeObject method will cause an
OptionalDataException to be thrown with an eof field value of true.
Non-object reads which exceed the end of the allotted data will reflect the
end of data in the same way that they would indicate the end of the stream:
bytewise reads will return -1 as the byte read or number of bytes read, and
primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions. If there is no corresponding
writeObject method, then the end of default serialized data marks the end of
the allotted data.

Primitive and object read calls issued from within a readExternal method
behave in the same manner--if the stream is already positioned at the end of
data written by the corresponding writeExternal method, object reads will
throw OptionalDataExceptions with eof set to true, bytewise reads will
return -1, and primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions. Note that this
behavior does not hold for streams written with the old

ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1

protocol, in which the
end of data written by writeExternal methods is not demarcated, and hence
cannot be detected.

The readObjectNoData method is responsible for initializing the state of
the object for its particular class in the event that the serialization
stream does not list the given class as a superclass of the object being

deserialized. This may occur in cases where the receiving party uses a
different version of the deserialized instance's class than the sending
party, and the receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by
the sender's version. This may also occur if the serialization stream has
been tampered; hence, readObjectNoData is useful for initializing
deserialized objects properly despite a "hostile" or incomplete source
stream.

Serialization does not read or assign values to the fields of any object
that does not implement the java.io.Serializable interface. Subclasses of
Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case the
non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to
be initialized. In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to
save and restore the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently
the case that the fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or
protected) or that there are get and set methods that can be used to restore
the state.

The contents of the stream can be filtered during deserialization.
If a

filter is set

on an ObjectInputStream, the

ObjectInputFilter

can check that
the classes, array lengths, number of references in the stream, depth, and
number of bytes consumed from the input stream are allowed and
if not, can terminate deserialization.
A

process-wide filter

can be configured that is applied to each

ObjectInputStream

unless replaced
using

setObjectInputFilter

.

Any exception that occurs while deserializing an object will be caught by
the ObjectInputStream and abort the reading process.

Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to assume
complete control over the contents and format of the object's serialized
form. The methods of the Externalizable interface, writeExternal and
readExternal, are called to save and restore the objects state. When
implemented by a class they can write and read their own state using all of
the methods of ObjectOutput and ObjectInput. It is the responsibility of
the objects to handle any versioning that occurs.

Enum constants are deserialized differently than ordinary serializable or
externalizable objects. The serialized form of an enum constant consists
solely of its name; field values of the constant are not transmitted. To
deserialize an enum constant, ObjectInputStream reads the constant name from
the stream; the deserialized constant is then obtained by calling the static
method

Enum.valueOf(Class, String)

with the enum constant's
base type and the received constant name as arguments. Like other
serializable or externalizable objects, enum constants can function as the
targets of back references appearing subsequently in the serialization
stream. The process by which enum constants are deserialized cannot be
customized: any class-specific readObject, readObjectNoData, and readResolve
methods defined by enum types are ignored during deserialization.
Similarly, any serialPersistentFields or serialVersionUID field declarations
are also ignored--all enum types have a fixed serialVersionUID of 0L.

For example to read from a stream as written by the example in
ObjectOutputStream:

```java
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("t.tmp");
ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);

int i = ois.readInt();
String today = (String) ois.readObject();
Date date = (Date) ois.readObject();

ois.close();
```

Classes control how they are serialized by implementing either the
java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interfaces.

Implementing the Serializable interface allows object serialization to
save and restore the entire state of the object and it allows classes to
evolve between the time the stream is written and the time it is read. It
automatically traverses references between objects, saving and restoring
entire graphs.

Serializable classes that require special handling during the
serialization and deserialization process should implement the following
methods:

```java
private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)
throws IOException;
private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)
throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
private void readObjectNoData()
throws ObjectStreamException;
```

The readObject method is responsible for reading and restoring the state
of the object for its particular class using data written to the stream by
the corresponding writeObject method. The method does not need to concern
itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or subclasses. State is
restored by reading data from the ObjectInputStream for the individual
fields and making assignments to the appropriate fields of the object.
Reading primitive data types is supported by DataInput.

Any attempt to read object data which exceeds the boundaries of the
custom data written by the corresponding writeObject method will cause an
OptionalDataException to be thrown with an eof field value of true.
Non-object reads which exceed the end of the allotted data will reflect the
end of data in the same way that they would indicate the end of the stream:
bytewise reads will return -1 as the byte read or number of bytes read, and
primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions. If there is no corresponding
writeObject method, then the end of default serialized data marks the end of
the allotted data.

Primitive and object read calls issued from within a readExternal method
behave in the same manner--if the stream is already positioned at the end of
data written by the corresponding writeExternal method, object reads will
throw OptionalDataExceptions with eof set to true, bytewise reads will
return -1, and primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions. Note that this
behavior does not hold for streams written with the old

ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1

protocol, in which the
end of data written by writeExternal methods is not demarcated, and hence
cannot be detected.

The readObjectNoData method is responsible for initializing the state of
the object for its particular class in the event that the serialization
stream does not list the given class as a superclass of the object being
deserialized. This may occur in cases where the receiving party uses a
different version of the deserialized instance's class than the sending
party, and the receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by

Primitive and object read calls issued from within a readExternal method
behave in the same manner--if the stream is already positioned at the end of
data written by the corresponding writeExternal method, object reads will
throw OptionalDataExceptions with eof set to true, bytewise reads will
return -1, and primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions. Note that this
behavior does not hold for streams written with the old

ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1

protocol, in which the
end of data written by writeExternal methods is not demarcated, and hence
cannot be detected.

The readObjectNoData method is responsible for initializing the state of
the object for its particular class in the event that the serialization
stream does not list the given class as a superclass of the object being
deserialized. This may occur in cases where the receiving party uses a
different version of the deserialized instance's class than the sending
party, and the receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by
the sender's version. This may also occur if the serialization stream has
been tampered; hence, readObjectNoData is useful for initializing
deserialized objects properly despite a "hostile" or incomplete source
stream.

Serialization does not read or assign values to the fields of any object
that does not implement the java.io.Serializable interface. Subclasses of
Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case the
non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to
be initialized. In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to
save and restore the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently
the case that the fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or
protected) or that there are get and set methods that can be used to restore
the state.

The contents of the stream can be filtered during deserialization.
If a

filter is set

on an ObjectInputStream, the

ObjectInputFilter

can check that
the classes, array lengths, number of references in the stream, depth, and
number of bytes consumed from the input stream are allowed and
if not, can terminate deserialization.
A

process-wide filter

can be configured that is applied to each

ObjectInputStream

unless replaced
using

setObjectInputFilter

.

Any exception that occurs while deserializing an object will be caught by
the ObjectInputStream and abort the reading process.

Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to assume
complete control over the contents and format of the object's serialized
form. The methods of the Externalizable interface, writeExternal and
readExternal, are called to save and restore the objects state. When
implemented by a class they can write and read their own state using all of
the methods of ObjectOutput and ObjectInput. It is the responsibility of
the objects to handle any versioning that occurs.

Enum constants are deserialized differently than ordinary serializable or
externalizable objects. The serialized form of an enum constant consists
solely of its name; field values of the constant are not transmitted. To
deserialize an enum constant, ObjectInputStream reads the constant name from
the stream; the deserialized constant is then obtained by calling the static
method

Enum.valueOf(Class, String)

with the enum constant's
base type and the received constant name as arguments. Like other
serializable or externalizable objects, enum constants can function as the
targets of back references appearing subsequently in the serialization
stream. The process by which enum constants are deserialized cannot be
customized: any class-specific readObject, readObjectNoData, and readResolve
methods defined by enum types are ignored during deserialization.
Similarly, any serialPersistentFields or serialVersionUID field declarations
are also ignored--all enum types have a fixed serialVersionUID of 0L.

The readObjectNoData method is responsible for initializing the state of
the object for its particular class in the event that the serialization
stream does not list the given class as a superclass of the object being
deserialized. This may occur in cases where the receiving party uses a
different version of the deserialized instance's class than the sending
party, and the receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by
the sender's version. This may also occur if the serialization stream has
been tampered; hence, readObjectNoData is useful for initializing
deserialized objects properly despite a "hostile" or incomplete source
stream.

Serialization does not read or assign values to the fields of any object
that does not implement the java.io.Serializable interface. Subclasses of
Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case the
non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to
be initialized. In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to
save and restore the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently
the case that the fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or
protected) or that there are get and set methods that can be used to restore
the state.

The contents of the stream can be filtered during deserialization.
If a

filter is set

on an ObjectInputStream, the

ObjectInputFilter

can check that
the classes, array lengths, number of references in the stream, depth, and
number of bytes consumed from the input stream are allowed and
if not, can terminate deserialization.

can be configured that is applied to each

ObjectInputStream

unless replaced

the ObjectInputStream and abort the reading process.

Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to assume
complete control over the contents and format of the object's serialized
form. The methods of the Externalizable interface, writeExternal and

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- ObjectInputStream

```java
public ObjectInputStream​(
InputStream
in)
throws
IOException
```

Creates an ObjectInputStream that reads from the specified InputStream.
A serialization stream header is read from the stream and verified.
This constructor will block until the corresponding ObjectOutputStream
has written and flushed the header.

The serialization filter is initialized to the value of

the process-wide filter

.

If a security manager is installed, this constructor will check for
the "enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission when invoked
directly or indirectly by the constructor of a subclass which overrides
the ObjectInputStream.readFields or ObjectInputStream.readUnshared
methods.

**Parameters:** in

- input stream to read from
**Throws:** StreamCorruptedException

- if the stream header is incorrect
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while reading stream header
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if untrusted subclass illegally overrides
security-sensitive methods
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

in

is

null

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- readObject

```java
public final
Object
readObject()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Read an object from the ObjectInputStream. The class of the object, the
signature of the class, and the values of the non-transient and
non-static fields of the class and all of its supertypes are read.
Default deserializing for a class can be overridden using the writeObject
and readObject methods. Objects referenced by this object are read
transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of objects is
reconstructed by readObject.

The root object is completely restored when all of its fields and the
objects it references are completely restored. At this point the object
validation callbacks are executed in order based on their registered
priorities. The callbacks are registered by objects (in the readObject
special methods) as they are individually restored.

The serialization filter, when not

null

, is invoked for
each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
See

setObjectInputFilter

for details.

Exceptions are thrown for problems with the InputStream and for
classes that should not be deserialized. All exceptions are fatal to
the InputStream and leave it in an indeterminate state; it is up to the
caller to ignore or recover the stream state.

**Specified by:** readObject

in interface

ObjectInput
**Returns:** the object read from the stream
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- Class of a serialized object cannot be
found.
**Throws:** InvalidClassException

- Something is wrong with a class used by
serialization.
**Throws:** StreamCorruptedException

- Control information in the
stream is inconsistent.
**Throws:** OptionalDataException

- Primitive data was found in the
stream instead of objects.
**Throws:** IOException

- Any of the usual Input/Output related exceptions.

- readObjectOverride

```java
protected
Object
readObjectOverride()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

This method is called by trusted subclasses of ObjectInputStream that
constructed ObjectInputStream using the protected no-arg constructor.
The subclass is expected to provide an override method with the modifier
"final".

**Returns:** the Object read from the stream.
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- Class definition of a serialized object
cannot be found.
**Throws:** OptionalDataException

- Primitive data was found in the stream
instead of objects.
**Throws:** IOException

- if I/O errors occurred while reading from the
underlying stream
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** ObjectInputStream()

,

readObject()

- readUnshared

```java
public
Object
readUnshared()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Reads an "unshared" object from the ObjectInputStream. This method is
identical to readObject, except that it prevents subsequent calls to
readObject and readUnshared from returning additional references to the
deserialized instance obtained via this call. Specifically:

- If readUnshared is called to deserialize a back-reference (the
stream representation of an object which has been written
previously to the stream), an ObjectStreamException will be
thrown.

If readUnshared returns successfully, then any subsequent attempts
to deserialize back-references to the stream handle deserialized
by readUnshared will cause an ObjectStreamException to be thrown.

Deserializing an object via readUnshared invalidates the stream handle
associated with the returned object. Note that this in itself does not
always guarantee that the reference returned by readUnshared is unique;
the deserialized object may define a readResolve method which returns an
object visible to other parties, or readUnshared may return a Class
object or enum constant obtainable elsewhere in the stream or through
external means. If the deserialized object defines a readResolve method
and the invocation of that method returns an array, then readUnshared
returns a shallow clone of that array; this guarantees that the returned
array object is unique and cannot be obtained a second time from an
invocation of readObject or readUnshared on the ObjectInputStream,
even if the underlying data stream has been manipulated.

The serialization filter, when not

null

, is invoked for
each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
See

setObjectInputFilter

for details.

ObjectInputStream subclasses which override this method can only be
constructed in security contexts possessing the
"enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission; any attempt to
instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a
SecurityException to be thrown.

**Returns:** reference to deserialized object
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if class of an object to deserialize
cannot be found
**Throws:** StreamCorruptedException

- if control information in the stream
is inconsistent
**Throws:** ObjectStreamException

- if object to deserialize has already
appeared in stream
**Throws:** OptionalDataException

- if primitive data is next in stream
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs during deserialization
**Since:** 1.4

- defaultReadObject

```java
public void defaultReadObject()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Read the non-static and non-transient fields of the current class from
this stream. This may only be called from the readObject method of the
class being deserialized. It will throw the NotActiveException if it is
called otherwise.

**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if the class of a serialized object
could not be found.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** NotActiveException

- if the stream is not currently reading
objects.

- readFields

```java
public
ObjectInputStream.GetField
readFields()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Reads the persistent fields from the stream and makes them available by
name.

**Returns:** the

GetField

object representing the persistent
fields of the object being deserialized
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if the class of a serialized object
could not be found.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** NotActiveException

- if the stream is not currently reading
objects.
**Since:** 1.2

- registerValidation

```java
public void registerValidation​(
ObjectInputValidation
obj,
int prio)
throws
NotActiveException
,

InvalidObjectException
```

Register an object to be validated before the graph is returned. While
similar to resolveObject these validations are called after the entire
graph has been reconstituted. Typically, a readObject method will
register the object with the stream so that when all of the objects are
restored a final set of validations can be performed.

**Parameters:** obj

- the object to receive the validation callback.
**Parameters:** prio

- controls the order of callbacks;zero is a good default.
Use higher numbers to be called back earlier, lower numbers for
later callbacks. Within a priority, callbacks are processed in
no particular order.
**Throws:** NotActiveException

- The stream is not currently reading objects
so it is invalid to register a callback.
**Throws:** InvalidObjectException

- The validation object is null.

- resolveClass

```java
protected
Class
<?> resolveClass​(
ObjectStreamClass
desc)
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Load the local class equivalent of the specified stream class
description. Subclasses may implement this method to allow classes to
be fetched from an alternate source.

The corresponding method in

ObjectOutputStream

is

annotateClass

. This method will be invoked only once for
each unique class in the stream. This method can be implemented by
subclasses to use an alternate loading mechanism but must return a

Class

object. Once returned, if the class is not an array
class, its serialVersionUID is compared to the serialVersionUID of the
serialized class, and if there is a mismatch, the deserialization fails
and an

InvalidClassException

is thrown.

The default implementation of this method in

ObjectInputStream

returns the result of calling

```java
Class.forName(desc.getName(), false, loader)
```

where

loader

is the first class loader on the current
thread's stack (starting from the currently executing method) that is
neither the

platform
class loader

nor its ancestor; otherwise,

loader

is the

platform class loader

. If this call results in a

ClassNotFoundException

and the name of the passed

ObjectStreamClass

instance is the Java language keyword
for a primitive type or void, then the

Class

object
representing that primitive type or void will be returned
(e.g., an

ObjectStreamClass

with the name

"int"

will be resolved to

Integer.TYPE

).
Otherwise, the

ClassNotFoundException

will be thrown to
the caller of this method.

**Parameters:** desc

- an instance of class

ObjectStreamClass
**Returns:** a

Class

object corresponding to

desc
**Throws:** IOException

- any of the usual Input/Output exceptions.
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if class of a serialized object cannot
be found.

- resolveProxyClass

```java
protected
Class
<?> resolveProxyClass​(
String
[] interfaces)
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Returns a proxy class that implements the interfaces named in a proxy
class descriptor; subclasses may implement this method to read custom
data from the stream along with the descriptors for dynamic proxy
classes, allowing them to use an alternate loading mechanism for the
interfaces and the proxy class.

This method is called exactly once for each unique proxy class
descriptor in the stream.

The corresponding method in

ObjectOutputStream

is

annotateProxyClass

. For a given subclass of

ObjectInputStream

that overrides this method, the

annotateProxyClass

method in the corresponding subclass of

ObjectOutputStream

must write any data or objects read by
this method.

The default implementation of this method in

ObjectInputStream

returns the result of calling

Proxy.getProxyClass

with the list of

Class

objects for the interfaces that are named in the

interfaces

parameter. The

Class

object for each interface name

i

is the value returned by calling

```java
Class.forName(i, false, loader)
```

where

loader

is the first class loader on the current
thread's stack (starting from the currently executing method) that is
neither the

platform
class loader

nor its ancestor; otherwise,

loader

is the

platform class loader

.
Unless any of the resolved interfaces are non-public, this same value
of

loader

is also the class loader passed to

Proxy.getProxyClass

; if non-public interfaces are present,
their class loader is passed instead (if more than one non-public
interface class loader is encountered, an

IllegalAccessError

is thrown).
If

Proxy.getProxyClass

throws an

IllegalArgumentException

,

resolveProxyClass

will throw a

ClassNotFoundException

containing the

IllegalArgumentException

.

**Parameters:** interfaces

- the list of interface names that were
deserialized in the proxy class descriptor
**Returns:** a proxy class for the specified interfaces
**Throws:** IOException

- any exception thrown by the underlying

InputStream
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if the proxy class or any of the
named interfaces could not be found
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** ObjectOutputStream.annotateProxyClass(Class)

- resolveObject

```java
protected
Object
resolveObject​(
Object
obj)
throws
IOException
```

This method will allow trusted subclasses of ObjectInputStream to
substitute one object for another during deserialization. Replacing
objects is disabled until enableResolveObject is called. The
enableResolveObject method checks that the stream requesting to resolve
object can be trusted. Every reference to serializable objects is passed
to resolveObject. To insure that the private state of objects is not
unintentionally exposed only trusted streams may use resolveObject.

This method is called after an object has been read but before it is
returned from readObject. The default resolveObject method just returns
the same object.

When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that the
substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference
will be stored. Objects whose type is not a subclass of the type of the
field or array element abort the serialization by raising an exception
and the object is not be stored.

This method is called only once when each object is first
encountered. All subsequent references to the object will be redirected
to the new object.

**Parameters:** obj

- object to be substituted
**Returns:** the substituted object
**Throws:** IOException

- Any of the usual Input/Output exceptions.

- enableResolveObject

```java
protected boolean enableResolveObject​(boolean enable)
throws
SecurityException
```

Enables the stream to do replacement of objects read from the stream. When
enabled, the

resolveObject(java.lang.Object)

method is called for every object being
deserialized.

If object replacement is currently not enabled, and

enable

is true, and there is a security manager installed,
this method first calls the security manager's

checkPermission

method with the

SerializablePermission("enableSubstitution")

permission to
ensure that the caller is permitted to enable the stream to do replacement
of objects read from the stream.

**Parameters:** enable

- true for enabling use of

resolveObject

for
every object being deserialized
**Returns:** the previous setting before this method was invoked
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method denies enabling the stream
to do replacement of objects read from the stream.
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

SerializablePermission

- readStreamHeader

```java
protected void readStreamHeader()
throws
IOException
,

StreamCorruptedException
```

The readStreamHeader method is provided to allow subclasses to read and
verify their own stream headers. It reads and verifies the magic number
and version number.

**Throws:** IOException

- if there are I/O errors while reading from the
underlying

InputStream
**Throws:** StreamCorruptedException

- if control information in the stream
is inconsistent

- readClassDescriptor

```java
protected
ObjectStreamClass
readClassDescriptor()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Read a class descriptor from the serialization stream. This method is
called when the ObjectInputStream expects a class descriptor as the next
item in the serialization stream. Subclasses of ObjectInputStream may
override this method to read in class descriptors that have been written
in non-standard formats (by subclasses of ObjectOutputStream which have
overridden the

writeClassDescriptor

method). By default,
this method reads class descriptors according to the format defined in
the Object Serialization specification.

**Returns:** the class descriptor read
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error has occurred.
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the Class of a serialized object used
in the class descriptor representation cannot be found
**Since:** 1.3

- getObjectInputFilter

```java
public final
ObjectInputFilter
getObjectInputFilter()
```

Returns the serialization filter for this stream.
The serialization filter is the most recent filter set in

setObjectInputFilter

or
the initial process-wide filter from

ObjectInputFilter.Config.getSerialFilter

.

**Returns:** the serialization filter for the stream; may be null
**Since:** 9

- setObjectInputFilter

```java
public final void setObjectInputFilter​(
ObjectInputFilter
filter)
```

Set the serialization filter for the stream.
The filter's

checkInput

method is called
for each class and reference in the stream.
The filter can check any or all of the class, the array length, the number
of references, the depth of the graph, and the size of the input stream.
The depth is the number of nested

readObject

calls starting with the reading of the root of the graph being deserialized
and the current object being deserialized.
The number of references is the cumulative number of objects and references
to objects already read from the stream including the current object being read.
The filter is invoked only when reading objects from the stream and not for
primitives.

If the filter returns

Status.REJECTED

,

null

or throws a

RuntimeException

,
the active

readObject

or

readUnshared

throws

InvalidClassException

, otherwise deserialization
continues uninterrupted.

The serialization filter is initialized to the value of

ObjectInputFilter.Config.getSerialFilter

when the

ObjectInputStream

is constructed and can be set
to a custom filter only once.

**Implementation Requirements:** The filter, when not

null

, is invoked during

readObject

and

readUnshared

for each object (regular or class) in the stream.
Strings are treated as primitives and do not invoke the filter.
The filter is called for:

- each object reference previously deserialized from the stream
(class is

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each regular class (class is not

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each interface class explicitly referenced in the stream
(it is not called for interfaces implemented by classes in the stream),

each interface of a dynamic proxy and the dynamic proxy class itself
(class is not

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each array is filtered using the array type and length of the array
(class is the array type, arrayLength is the requested length),

each object replaced by its class'

readResolve

method
is filtered using the replacement object's class, if not

null

,
and if it is an array, the arrayLength, otherwise -1,

and each object replaced by

resolveObject

is filtered using the replacement object's class, if not

null

,
and if it is an array, the arrayLength, otherwise -1.

When the

checkInput

method is invoked
it is given access to the current class, the array length,
the current number of references already read from the stream,
the depth of nested calls to

readObject

or

readUnshared

,
and the implementation dependent number of bytes consumed from the input stream.

Each call to

readObject

or

readUnshared

increases the depth by 1
before reading an object and decreases by 1 before returning
normally or exceptionally.
The depth starts at

1

and increases for each nested object and
decrements when each nested call returns.
The count of references in the stream starts at

1

and
is increased before reading an object.
**Parameters:** filter

- the filter, may be null
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if there is security manager and the

SerializablePermission("serialFilter")

is not granted
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the

current filter

is not

null

and is not the process-wide filter
**Since:** 9

Method Detail

- readObject

```java
public final
Object
readObject()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Read an object from the ObjectInputStream. The class of the object, the
signature of the class, and the values of the non-transient and
non-static fields of the class and all of its supertypes are read.
Default deserializing for a class can be overridden using the writeObject
and readObject methods. Objects referenced by this object are read
transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of objects is
reconstructed by readObject.

The root object is completely restored when all of its fields and the
objects it references are completely restored. At this point the object
validation callbacks are executed in order based on their registered
priorities. The callbacks are registered by objects (in the readObject
special methods) as they are individually restored.

The serialization filter, when not

null

, is invoked for
each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
See

setObjectInputFilter

for details.

Exceptions are thrown for problems with the InputStream and for
classes that should not be deserialized. All exceptions are fatal to
the InputStream and leave it in an indeterminate state; it is up to the
caller to ignore or recover the stream state.

**Specified by:** readObject

in interface

ObjectInput
**Returns:** the object read from the stream
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- Class of a serialized object cannot be
found.
**Throws:** InvalidClassException

- Something is wrong with a class used by
serialization.
**Throws:** StreamCorruptedException

- Control information in the
stream is inconsistent.
**Throws:** OptionalDataException

- Primitive data was found in the
stream instead of objects.
**Throws:** IOException

- Any of the usual Input/Output related exceptions.

- readObjectOverride

```java
protected
Object
readObjectOverride()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

This method is called by trusted subclasses of ObjectInputStream that
constructed ObjectInputStream using the protected no-arg constructor.
The subclass is expected to provide an override method with the modifier
"final".

**Returns:** the Object read from the stream.
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- Class definition of a serialized object
cannot be found.
**Throws:** OptionalDataException

- Primitive data was found in the stream
instead of objects.
**Throws:** IOException

- if I/O errors occurred while reading from the
underlying stream
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** ObjectInputStream()

,

readObject()

- readUnshared

```java
public
Object
readUnshared()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Reads an "unshared" object from the ObjectInputStream. This method is
identical to readObject, except that it prevents subsequent calls to
readObject and readUnshared from returning additional references to the
deserialized instance obtained via this call. Specifically:

- If readUnshared is called to deserialize a back-reference (the
stream representation of an object which has been written
previously to the stream), an ObjectStreamException will be
thrown.

If readUnshared returns successfully, then any subsequent attempts
to deserialize back-references to the stream handle deserialized
by readUnshared will cause an ObjectStreamException to be thrown.

Deserializing an object via readUnshared invalidates the stream handle
associated with the returned object. Note that this in itself does not
always guarantee that the reference returned by readUnshared is unique;
the deserialized object may define a readResolve method which returns an
object visible to other parties, or readUnshared may return a Class
object or enum constant obtainable elsewhere in the stream or through
external means. If the deserialized object defines a readResolve method
and the invocation of that method returns an array, then readUnshared
returns a shallow clone of that array; this guarantees that the returned
array object is unique and cannot be obtained a second time from an
invocation of readObject or readUnshared on the ObjectInputStream,
even if the underlying data stream has been manipulated.

The serialization filter, when not

null

, is invoked for
each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
See

setObjectInputFilter

for details.

ObjectInputStream subclasses which override this method can only be
constructed in security contexts possessing the
"enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission; any attempt to
instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a
SecurityException to be thrown.

**Returns:** reference to deserialized object
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if class of an object to deserialize
cannot be found
**Throws:** StreamCorruptedException

- if control information in the stream
is inconsistent
**Throws:** ObjectStreamException

- if object to deserialize has already
appeared in stream
**Throws:** OptionalDataException

- if primitive data is next in stream
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs during deserialization
**Since:** 1.4

- defaultReadObject

```java
public void defaultReadObject()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Read the non-static and non-transient fields of the current class from
this stream. This may only be called from the readObject method of the
class being deserialized. It will throw the NotActiveException if it is
called otherwise.

**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if the class of a serialized object
could not be found.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** NotActiveException

- if the stream is not currently reading
objects.

- readFields

```java
public
ObjectInputStream.GetField
readFields()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Reads the persistent fields from the stream and makes them available by
name.

**Returns:** the

GetField

object representing the persistent
fields of the object being deserialized
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if the class of a serialized object
could not be found.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** NotActiveException

- if the stream is not currently reading
objects.
**Since:** 1.2

- registerValidation

```java
public void registerValidation​(
ObjectInputValidation
obj,
int prio)
throws
NotActiveException
,

InvalidObjectException
```

Register an object to be validated before the graph is returned. While
similar to resolveObject these validations are called after the entire
graph has been reconstituted. Typically, a readObject method will
register the object with the stream so that when all of the objects are
restored a final set of validations can be performed.

**Parameters:** obj

- the object to receive the validation callback.
**Parameters:** prio

- controls the order of callbacks;zero is a good default.
Use higher numbers to be called back earlier, lower numbers for
later callbacks. Within a priority, callbacks are processed in
no particular order.
**Throws:** NotActiveException

- The stream is not currently reading objects
so it is invalid to register a callback.
**Throws:** InvalidObjectException

- The validation object is null.

- resolveClass

```java
protected
Class
<?> resolveClass​(
ObjectStreamClass
desc)
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Load the local class equivalent of the specified stream class
description. Subclasses may implement this method to allow classes to
be fetched from an alternate source.

The corresponding method in

ObjectOutputStream

is

annotateClass

. This method will be invoked only once for
each unique class in the stream. This method can be implemented by
subclasses to use an alternate loading mechanism but must return a

Class

object. Once returned, if the class is not an array
class, its serialVersionUID is compared to the serialVersionUID of the
serialized class, and if there is a mismatch, the deserialization fails
and an

InvalidClassException

is thrown.

The default implementation of this method in

ObjectInputStream

returns the result of calling

```java
Class.forName(desc.getName(), false, loader)
```

where

loader

is the first class loader on the current
thread's stack (starting from the currently executing method) that is
neither the

platform
class loader

nor its ancestor; otherwise,

loader

is the

platform class loader

. If this call results in a

ClassNotFoundException

and the name of the passed

ObjectStreamClass

instance is the Java language keyword
for a primitive type or void, then the

Class

object
representing that primitive type or void will be returned
(e.g., an

ObjectStreamClass

with the name

"int"

will be resolved to

Integer.TYPE

).
Otherwise, the

ClassNotFoundException

will be thrown to
the caller of this method.

**Parameters:** desc

- an instance of class

ObjectStreamClass
**Returns:** a

Class

object corresponding to

desc
**Throws:** IOException

- any of the usual Input/Output exceptions.
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if class of a serialized object cannot
be found.

- resolveProxyClass

```java
protected
Class
<?> resolveProxyClass​(
String
[] interfaces)
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Returns a proxy class that implements the interfaces named in a proxy
class descriptor; subclasses may implement this method to read custom
data from the stream along with the descriptors for dynamic proxy
classes, allowing them to use an alternate loading mechanism for the
interfaces and the proxy class.

This method is called exactly once for each unique proxy class
descriptor in the stream.

The corresponding method in

ObjectOutputStream

is

annotateProxyClass

. For a given subclass of

ObjectInputStream

that overrides this method, the

annotateProxyClass

method in the corresponding subclass of

ObjectOutputStream

must write any data or objects read by
this method.

The default implementation of this method in

ObjectInputStream

returns the result of calling

Proxy.getProxyClass

with the list of

Class

objects for the interfaces that are named in the

interfaces

parameter. The

Class

object for each interface name

i

is the value returned by calling

```java
Class.forName(i, false, loader)
```

where

loader

is the first class loader on the current
thread's stack (starting from the currently executing method) that is
neither the

platform
class loader

nor its ancestor; otherwise,

loader

is the

platform class loader

.
Unless any of the resolved interfaces are non-public, this same value
of

loader

is also the class loader passed to

Proxy.getProxyClass

; if non-public interfaces are present,
their class loader is passed instead (if more than one non-public
interface class loader is encountered, an

IllegalAccessError

is thrown).
If

Proxy.getProxyClass

throws an

IllegalArgumentException

,

resolveProxyClass

will throw a

ClassNotFoundException

containing the

IllegalArgumentException

.

**Parameters:** interfaces

- the list of interface names that were
deserialized in the proxy class descriptor
**Returns:** a proxy class for the specified interfaces
**Throws:** IOException

- any exception thrown by the underlying

InputStream
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if the proxy class or any of the
named interfaces could not be found
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** ObjectOutputStream.annotateProxyClass(Class)

- resolveObject

```java
protected
Object
resolveObject​(
Object
obj)
throws
IOException
```

This method will allow trusted subclasses of ObjectInputStream to
substitute one object for another during deserialization. Replacing
objects is disabled until enableResolveObject is called. The
enableResolveObject method checks that the stream requesting to resolve
object can be trusted. Every reference to serializable objects is passed
to resolveObject. To insure that the private state of objects is not
unintentionally exposed only trusted streams may use resolveObject.

This method is called after an object has been read but before it is
returned from readObject. The default resolveObject method just returns
the same object.

When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that the
substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference
will be stored. Objects whose type is not a subclass of the type of the
field or array element abort the serialization by raising an exception
and the object is not be stored.

This method is called only once when each object is first
encountered. All subsequent references to the object will be redirected
to the new object.

**Parameters:** obj

- object to be substituted
**Returns:** the substituted object
**Throws:** IOException

- Any of the usual Input/Output exceptions.

- enableResolveObject

```java
protected boolean enableResolveObject​(boolean enable)
throws
SecurityException
```

Enables the stream to do replacement of objects read from the stream. When
enabled, the

resolveObject(java.lang.Object)

method is called for every object being
deserialized.

If object replacement is currently not enabled, and

enable

is true, and there is a security manager installed,
this method first calls the security manager's

checkPermission

method with the

SerializablePermission("enableSubstitution")

permission to
ensure that the caller is permitted to enable the stream to do replacement
of objects read from the stream.

**Parameters:** enable

- true for enabling use of

resolveObject

for
every object being deserialized
**Returns:** the previous setting before this method was invoked
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method denies enabling the stream
to do replacement of objects read from the stream.
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

SerializablePermission

- readStreamHeader

```java
protected void readStreamHeader()
throws
IOException
,

StreamCorruptedException
```

The readStreamHeader method is provided to allow subclasses to read and
verify their own stream headers. It reads and verifies the magic number
and version number.

**Throws:** IOException

- if there are I/O errors while reading from the
underlying

InputStream
**Throws:** StreamCorruptedException

- if control information in the stream
is inconsistent

- readClassDescriptor

```java
protected
ObjectStreamClass
readClassDescriptor()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Read a class descriptor from the serialization stream. This method is
called when the ObjectInputStream expects a class descriptor as the next
item in the serialization stream. Subclasses of ObjectInputStream may
override this method to read in class descriptors that have been written
in non-standard formats (by subclasses of ObjectOutputStream which have
overridden the

writeClassDescriptor

method). By default,
this method reads class descriptors according to the format defined in
the Object Serialization specification.

**Returns:** the class descriptor read
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error has occurred.
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the Class of a serialized object used
in the class descriptor representation cannot be found
**Since:** 1.3

getObjectInputFilter()
```

Returns the serialization filter for this stream.
The serialization filter is the most recent filter set in

setObjectInputFilter

or
the initial process-wide filter from

ObjectInputFilter.Config.getSerialFilter

.

**Returns:** the serialization filter for the stream; may be null
**Since:** 9

- setObjectInputFilter

```java
public final void setObjectInputFilter​(
ObjectInputFilter
filter)
```

Set the serialization filter for the stream.
The filter's

checkInput

method is called
for each class and reference in the stream.
The filter can check any or all of the class, the array length, the number
of references, the depth of the graph, and the size of the input stream.
The depth is the number of nested

readObject

calls starting with the reading of the root of the graph being deserialized
and the current object being deserialized.
The number of references is the cumulative number of objects and references
to objects already read from the stream including the current object being read.
The filter is invoked only when reading objects from the stream and not for
primitives.

If the filter returns

Status.REJECTED

,

null

or throws a

RuntimeException

,
the active

readObject

or

readUnshared

throws

InvalidClassException

, otherwise deserialization
continues uninterrupted.

The serialization filter is initialized to the value of

ObjectInputFilter.Config.getSerialFilter

when the

ObjectInputStream

is constructed and can be set
to a custom filter only once.

**Implementation Requirements:** The filter, when not

null

, is invoked during

readObject

and

readUnshared

for each object (regular or class) in the stream.
Strings are treated as primitives and do not invoke the filter.
The filter is called for:

- each object reference previously deserialized from the stream
(class is

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each regular class (class is not

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each interface class explicitly referenced in the stream
(it is not called for interfaces implemented by classes in the stream),

each interface of a dynamic proxy and the dynamic proxy class itself
(class is not

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each array is filtered using the array type and length of the array
(class is the array type, arrayLength is the requested length),

each object replaced by its class'

readResolve

method
is filtered using the replacement object's class, if not

null

,
and if it is an array, the arrayLength, otherwise -1,

and each object replaced by

resolveObject

is filtered using the replacement object's class, if not

null

,
and if it is an array, the arrayLength, otherwise -1.

When the

checkInput

method is invoked
it is given access to the current class, the array length,
the current number of references already read from the stream,
the depth of nested calls to

readObject

or

readUnshared

,
and the implementation dependent number of bytes consumed from the input stream.

Each call to

readObject

or

readUnshared

increases the depth by 1
before reading an object and decreases by 1 before returning
normally or exceptionally.
The depth starts at

1

and increases for each nested object and
decrements when each nested call returns.
The count of references in the stream starts at

1

and
is increased before reading an object.
**Parameters:** filter

- the filter, may be null
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if there is security manager and the

SerializablePermission("serialFilter")

is not granted
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the

current filter

is not

null

and is not the process-wide filter

#### Method Detail

readObject

```java
public final
Object
readObject()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Read an object from the ObjectInputStream. The class of the object, the
signature of the class, and the values of the non-transient and
non-static fields of the class and all of its supertypes are read.
Default deserializing for a class can be overridden using the writeObject
and readObject methods. Objects referenced by this object are read
transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of objects is
reconstructed by readObject.

The root object is completely restored when all of its fields and the
objects it references are completely restored. At this point the object
validation callbacks are executed in order based on their registered
priorities. The callbacks are registered by objects (in the readObject
special methods) as they are individually restored.

The serialization filter, when not

null

, is invoked for
each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
See

setObjectInputFilter

for details.

Exceptions are thrown for problems with the InputStream and for
classes that should not be deserialized. All exceptions are fatal to
the InputStream and leave it in an indeterminate state; it is up to the
caller to ignore or recover the stream state.

**Specified by:** readObject

in interface

ObjectInput
**Returns:** the object read from the stream
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- Class of a serialized object cannot be
found.
**Throws:** InvalidClassException

- Something is wrong with a class used by
serialization.
**Throws:** StreamCorruptedException

- Control information in the

readObject()
throws

ClassNotFoundException

Read an object from the ObjectInputStream. The class of the object, the
signature of the class, and the values of the non-transient and
non-static fields of the class and all of its supertypes are read.
Default deserializing for a class can be overridden using the writeObject
and readObject methods. Objects referenced by this object are read
transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of objects is
reconstructed by readObject.

The root object is completely restored when all of its fields and the
objects it references are completely restored. At this point the object
validation callbacks are executed in order based on their registered
priorities. The callbacks are registered by objects (in the readObject
special methods) as they are individually restored.

The serialization filter, when not

null

, is invoked for
each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
See

setObjectInputFilter

for details.

Exceptions are thrown for problems with the InputStream and for
classes that should not be deserialized. All exceptions are fatal to
the InputStream and leave it in an indeterminate state; it is up to the
caller to ignore or recover the stream state.

This method is called by trusted subclasses of ObjectInputStream that
constructed ObjectInputStream using the protected no-arg constructor.
The subclass is expected to provide an override method with the modifier
"final".

**Returns:** the Object read from the stream.
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- Class definition of a serialized object
cannot be found.
**Throws:** OptionalDataException

- Primitive data was found in the stream

readUnshared

```java
public
Object
readUnshared()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Reads an "unshared" object from the ObjectInputStream. This method is
identical to readObject, except that it prevents subsequent calls to
readObject and readUnshared from returning additional references to the
deserialized instance obtained via this call. Specifically:

- If readUnshared is called to deserialize a back-reference (the
stream representation of an object which has been written
previously to the stream), an ObjectStreamException will be
thrown.

If readUnshared returns successfully, then any subsequent attempts
to deserialize back-references to the stream handle deserialized
by readUnshared will cause an ObjectStreamException to be thrown.

Deserializing an object via readUnshared invalidates the stream handle
associated with the returned object. Note that this in itself does not
always guarantee that the reference returned by readUnshared is unique;
the deserialized object may define a readResolve method which returns an
object visible to other parties, or readUnshared may return a Class
object or enum constant obtainable elsewhere in the stream or through
external means. If the deserialized object defines a readResolve method
and the invocation of that method returns an array, then readUnshared
returns a shallow clone of that array; this guarantees that the returned
array object is unique and cannot be obtained a second time from an
invocation of readObject or readUnshared on the ObjectInputStream,
even if the underlying data stream has been manipulated.

The serialization filter, when not

null

, is invoked for
each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
See

setObjectInputFilter

for details.

ObjectInputStream subclasses which override this method can only be
constructed in security contexts possessing the
"enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission; any attempt to
instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a
SecurityException to be thrown.

**Returns:** reference to deserialized object
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if class of an object to deserialize
cannot be found
**Throws:** StreamCorruptedException

- if control information in the stream
is inconsistent
**Throws:** ObjectStreamException

- if object to deserialize has already

Register an object to be validated before the graph is returned. While
similar to resolveObject these validations are called after the entire
graph has been reconstituted. Typically, a readObject method will
register the object with the stream so that when all of the objects are
restored a final set of validations can be performed.

**Parameters:** obj

- the object to receive the validation callback.
**Parameters:** prio

- controls the order of callbacks;zero is a good default.
Use higher numbers to be called back earlier, lower numbers for
later callbacks. Within a priority, callbacks are processed in

unintentionally exposed only trusted streams may use resolveObject.

This method is called after an object has been read but before it is
returned from readObject. The default resolveObject method just returns
the same object.

When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that the
substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference
will be stored. Objects whose type is not a subclass of the type of the
field or array element abort the serialization by raising an exception
and the object is not be stored.

This method is called only once when each object is first

```java
protected
ObjectStreamClass
readClassDescriptor()
throws
IOException
,

ClassNotFoundException
```

Read a class descriptor from the serialization stream. This method is
called when the ObjectInputStream expects a class descriptor as the next
item in the serialization stream. Subclasses of ObjectInputStream may
override this method to read in class descriptors that have been written
in non-standard formats (by subclasses of ObjectOutputStream which have
overridden the

writeClassDescriptor

method). By default,
this method reads class descriptors according to the format defined in
the Object Serialization specification.

**Returns:** the class descriptor read
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error has occurred.
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the Class of a serialized object used
in the class descriptor representation cannot be found
**Since:** 1.3

```java
public final

**Since:** 9

---

#### getObjectInputFilter

public final

ObjectInputFilter

getObjectInputFilter()

Returns the serialization filter for this stream.

setObjectInputFilter

or
the initial process-wide filter from

ObjectInputFilter.Config.getSerialFilter

.

setObjectInputFilter

```java
public final void setObjectInputFilter​(
ObjectInputFilter
filter)
```

Set the serialization filter for the stream.
The filter's

checkInput

method is called
for each class and reference in the stream.
The filter can check any or all of the class, the array length, the number
of references, the depth of the graph, and the size of the input stream.
The depth is the number of nested

readObject

calls starting with the reading of the root of the graph being deserialized
and the current object being deserialized.
The number of references is the cumulative number of objects and references
to objects already read from the stream including the current object being read.
The filter is invoked only when reading objects from the stream and not for
primitives.

If the filter returns

Status.REJECTED

,

null

or throws a

RuntimeException

,
the active

readObject

or

readUnshared

throws

InvalidClassException

, otherwise deserialization
continues uninterrupted.

The serialization filter is initialized to the value of

ObjectInputFilter.Config.getSerialFilter

when the

ObjectInputStream

is constructed and can be set
to a custom filter only once.

**Implementation Requirements:** The filter, when not

null

, is invoked during

readObject

and

readUnshared

for each object (regular or class) in the stream.
Strings are treated as primitives and do not invoke the filter.
The filter is called for:

- each object reference previously deserialized from the stream
(class is

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each regular class (class is not

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each interface class explicitly referenced in the stream
(it is not called for interfaces implemented by classes in the stream),

each interface of a dynamic proxy and the dynamic proxy class itself
(class is not

null

, arrayLength is -1),

each array is filtered using the array type and length of the array
(class is the array type, arrayLength is the requested length),

each object replaced by its class'

readResolve

method
is filtered using the replacement object's class, if not

null

,
and if it is an array, the arrayLength, otherwise -1,

and each object replaced by

resolveObject

is filtered using the replacement object's class, if not

null

,
and if it is an array, the arrayLength, otherwise -1.

When the

checkInput

method is invoked
it is given access to the current class, the array length,
the current number of references already read from the stream,
the depth of nested calls to

readObject

or

readUnshared

,
and the implementation dependent number of bytes consumed from the input stream.

Each call to

readObject

or

readUnshared

increases the depth by 1
before reading an object and decreases by 1 before returning
normally or exceptionally.
The depth starts at

1

and increases for each nested object and
decrements when each nested call returns.
The count of references in the stream starts at

1

and
is increased before reading an object.
**Parameters:** filter

- the filter, may be null
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if there is security manager and the

SerializablePermission("serialFilter")

is not granted
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the

current filter

is not

null

and is not the process-wide filter
**Since:** 9
