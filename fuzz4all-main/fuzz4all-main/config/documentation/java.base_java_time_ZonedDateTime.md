# Class ZonedDateTime

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\ZonedDateTime.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
ZonedDateTime

extends
Object

implements
Temporal
,
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
LocalDate
>,
Serializable
```

A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
such as

2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris

.

ZonedDateTime

is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.
This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
and a time-zone, with a zone offset used to handle ambiguous local date-times.
For example, the value
"2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00 in the Europe/Paris time-zone"
can be stored in a

ZonedDateTime

.

This class handles conversion from the local time-line of

LocalDateTime

to the instant time-line of

Instant

.
The difference between the two time-lines is the offset from UTC/Greenwich,
represented by a

ZoneOffset

.

Converting between the two time-lines involves calculating the offset using the

rules

accessed from the

ZoneId

.
Obtaining the offset for an instant is simple, as there is exactly one valid
offset for each instant. By contrast, obtaining the offset for a local date-time
is not straightforward. There are three cases:

- Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.
- Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically
due to the spring daylight savings change from "winter" to "summer".
In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.
- Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically
due to the autumn daylight savings change from "summer" to "winter".
In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.

Any method that converts directly or implicitly from a local date-time to an
instant by obtaining the offset has the potential to be complicated.

For Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
middle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time
shifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting in a date-time in the later
offset, typically "summer" time.

For Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no
previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is
used, typically "summer" time.. Two additional methods,

withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()

and

withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

,
help manage the case of an overlap.

In terms of design, this class should be viewed primarily as the combination
of a

LocalDateTime

and a

ZoneId

. The

ZoneOffset

is
a vital, but secondary, piece of information, used to ensure that the class
represents an instant, especially during a daylight savings overlap.

This is a

value-based

class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
(

==

), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of

ZonedDateTime

may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
The

equals

method should be used for comparisons.

### Method Details

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
now()

Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current date-time.
The zone and offset will be set based on the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Returns:**
- the current date-time using the system clock, not null

---

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
now​(
ZoneId
zone)

Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current date-time.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
The offset will be calculated from the specified time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the zone ID to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the current date-time using the system clock, not null

---

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
now​(
Clock
clock)

Obtains the current date-time from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current date-time.
The zone and offset will be set based on the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

**Parameters:**
- clock

- the clock to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the current date-time, not null

---

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
of​(
LocalDate
date,

LocalTime
time,

ZoneId
zone)

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a local date and time.

This creates a zoned date-time matching the input local date and time as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

The local date time and first combined to form a local date-time.
The local date-time is then resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, when clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, when clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

**Parameters:**
- date

- the local date, not null
- time

- the local time, not null
- zone

- the time-zone, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset date-time, not null

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
of​(int year,
int month,
int dayOfMonth,
int hour,
int minute,
int second,
int nanoOfSecond,

ZoneId
zone)

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a year, month, day,
hour, minute, second, nanosecond and time-zone.

This creates a zoned date-time matching the local date-time of the seven
specified fields as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, when clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, when clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.

LocalDateTime

has five additional convenience variants of the
equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.

**Parameters:**

- zone

- the time-zone, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the value of any field is out of range, or
if the day-of-month is invalid for the month-year

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
ofLocal​(
LocalDateTime
localDateTime,

ZoneId
zone,

ZoneOffset
preferredOffset)

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a local date-time
using the preferred offset if possible.

The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
If the preferred offset is one of the valid offsets then it is used.
Otherwise the earlier valid offset is used, typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

**Parameters:**
- localDateTime

- the local date-time, not null
- zone

- the time-zone, not null
- preferredOffset

- the zone offset, null if no preference

**Returns:**
- the zoned date-time, not null

---

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
ofInstant​(
Instant
instant,

ZoneId
zone)

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from an

Instant

.

This creates a zoned date-time with the same instant as that specified.
Calling

ChronoZonedDateTime.toInstant()

will return an instant equal to the one used here.

Converting an instant to a zoned date-time is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant.

**Parameters:**
- instant

- the instant to create the date-time from, not null
- zone

- the time-zone, not null

**Returns:**
- the zoned date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported range

---

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
ofInstant​(
LocalDateTime
localDateTime,

ZoneOffset
offset,

ZoneId
zone)

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from the instant formed by combining
the local date-time and offset.

This creates a zoned date-time by

combining

the

LocalDateTime

and

ZoneOffset

.
This combination uniquely specifies an instant without ambiguity.

Converting an instant to a zoned date-time is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant. If the valid offset is different to the offset specified,
then the date-time and offset of the zoned date-time will differ from those specified.

If the

ZoneId

to be used is a

ZoneOffset

, this method is equivalent
to

of(LocalDateTime, ZoneId)

.

**Parameters:**
- localDateTime

- the local date-time, not null
- offset

- the zone offset, not null
- zone

- the time-zone, not null

**Returns:**
- the zoned date-time, not null

---

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
ofStrict​(
LocalDateTime
localDateTime,

ZoneOffset
offset,

ZoneId
zone)

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

strictly validating the
combination of local date-time, offset and zone ID.

This creates a zoned date-time ensuring that the offset is valid for the
local date-time according to the rules of the specified zone.
If the offset is invalid, an exception is thrown.

**Parameters:**
- localDateTime

- the local date-time, not null
- offset

- the zone offset, not null
- zone

- the time-zone, not null

**Returns:**
- the zoned date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the combination of arguments is invalid

---

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains a zoned date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ZonedDateTime

.

The conversion will first obtain a

ZoneId

from the temporal object,
falling back to a

ZoneOffset

if necessary. It will then try to obtain
an

Instant

, falling back to a

LocalDateTime

if necessary.
The result will be either the combination of

ZoneId

or

ZoneOffset

with

Instant

or

LocalDateTime

.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ZonedDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null

**Returns:**
- the zoned date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to an

ZonedDateTime

**See Also:**
- Chronology.zonedDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text)

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a text string such as

2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]

.

The string must represent a valid date-time and is parsed using

DateTimeFormatter.ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME

.

**Parameters:**
- text

- the text to parse such as "2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]", not null

**Returns:**
- the parsed zoned date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

---

#### public static
ZonedDateTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text,

DateTimeFormatter
formatter)

ZonedDateTime

from a text string using a specific formatter.

The text is parsed using the formatter, returning a date-time.

**Parameters:**
- text

- the text to parse, not null
- formatter

- the formatter to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the parsed zoned date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

---

#### public boolean isSupported​(

**Returns:**
- the zone offset, not null

---

#### public
ZonedDateTime
withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
earlier of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the earlier of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>

**Returns:**
- a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the earlier offset, not null

---

#### public
ZonedDateTime
withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
later of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the later of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- withLaterOffsetAtOverlap

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>

**Returns:**
- a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the later offset, not null

---

#### public
ZoneId
getZone()

Gets the time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris'.

This returns the zone ID. This identifies the time-zone

rules

that determine when and how the offset from UTC/Greenwich changes.

The zone ID may be same as the

offset

.
If this is true, then any future calculations, such as addition or subtraction,
have no complex edge cases due to time-zone rules.
See also

withFixedOffsetZone()

.

**Specified by:**
- getZone

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>

**Returns:**
- the time-zone, not null

---

#### public
ZonedDateTime
withZoneSameLocal​(
ZoneId
zone)

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the local date-time if possible.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the local date-time.
The local date-time is only changed if it is invalid for the new zone,
determined using the same approach as

ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)

.

To change the zone and adjust the local date-time,
use

withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- withZoneSameLocal

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null

**Returns:**
- a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null

---

#### public
ZonedDateTime
withZoneSameInstant​(
ZoneId
zone)

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the instant.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the instant.
This normally results in a change to the local date-time.

This method is based on retaining the same instant, thus gaps and overlaps
in the local time-line have no effect on the result.

To change the offset while keeping the local time,
use

withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId)

.

**Specified by:**
- withZoneSameInstant

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null

**Returns:**
- a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

---

#### public
ZonedDateTime
withFixedOffsetZone()

Returns a copy of this date-time with the zone ID set to the offset.

This returns a zoned date-time where the zone ID is the same as

getOffset()

.
The local date-time, offset and instant of the result will be the same as in this date-time.

Setting the date-time to a fixed single offset means that any future
calculations, such as addition or subtraction, have no complex edge cases
due to time-zone rules.
This might also be useful when sending a zoned date-time across a network,
as most protocols, such as ISO-8601, only handle offsets,
and not region-based zone IDs.

This is equivalent to

ZonedDateTime.of(zdt.toLocalDateTime(), zdt.getOffset())

.

**Returns:**
- a

ZonedDateTime

with the zone ID set to the offset, not null

---

#### public
LocalDateTime
toLocalDateTime()

Gets the

LocalDateTime

part of this date-time.

This returns a

LocalDateTime

with the same year, month, day and time
as this date-time.

**Specified by:**
- toLocalDateTime

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>

**Returns:**
- the local date-time part of this date-time, not null

---

#### public
LocalDate
toLocalDate()

Gets the

LocalDate

part of this date-time.

This returns a

LocalDate

with the same year, month and day
as this date-time.

**Specified by:**
- toLocalDate

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>

**Returns:**
- the date part of this date-time, not null

---

#### public int getYear()

Gets the year field.

This method returns the primitive

int

value for the year.

The year returned by this method is proleptic as per

get(YEAR)

.
To obtain the year-of-era, use

get(YEAR_OF_ERA)

.

**Returns:**
- the year, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR

---

#### public int getMonthValue()

Gets the month-of-year field from 1 to 12.

This method returns the month as an

int

from 1 to 12.
Application code is frequently clearer if the enum

#### public
ZonedDateTime
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)

Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
Key date-time classes also implement the

TemporalAdjuster

interface,
such as

Month

and

MonthDay

.
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:

```java
import static java.time.Month.*;
import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

result = zonedDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
```

The classes

LocalDate

and

LocalTime

implement

TemporalAdjuster

,
thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:

```java
result = zonedDateTime.with(date);
result = zonedDateTime.with(time);
```

ZoneOffset

also implements

TemporalAdjuster

however using it
as an argument typically has no effect. The offset of a

ZonedDateTime

is
controlled primarily by the time-zone. As such, changing the offset does not generally
make sense, because there is only one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

method on the
specified adjuster passing

this

as the argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null

**Returns:**
- a

ZonedDateTime

based on

this

with the adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the adjustment cannot be made
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### public
ZonedDateTime
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

INSTANT_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
The zone and nano-of-second are unchanged.
The result will have an offset derived from the new instant and original zone.
If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The

OFFSET_SECONDS

field will typically be ignored.
The offset of a

ZonedDateTime

is controlled primarily by the time-zone.
As such, changing the offset does not generally make sense, because there is only
one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
If the new offset value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalDateTime

.
The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.
When converting back to

ZonedDateTime

, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to set in the result, not null
- newValue

- the new value of the field in the result

**Returns:**
- a

ZonedDateTime

based on

this

with the specified field set, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

#### public
ZonedDateTime
plusHours​(long hours)

Returns a copy of this

ZonedDateTime

with the specified number of hours added.

This operates on the instant time-line, such that adding one hour will
always be a duration of one hour later.
This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one hour.
Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years,
thus adding one day is not the same as adding 24 hours.

For example, consider a time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris', where the
Autumn DST cutover means that the local times 02:00 to 02:59 occur twice
changing from offset +02:00 in summer to +01:00 in winter.

- Adding one hour to 01:30+02:00 will result in 02:30+02:00
(both in summer time)

Adding one hour to 02:30+02:00 will result in 02:30+01:00
(moving from summer to winter time)

Adding one hour to 02:30+01:00 will result in 03:30+01:00
(both in winter time)

#### public
ZonedDateTime
minusHours​(long hours)

Returns a copy of this

ZonedDateTime

with the specified number of hours subtracted.

This operates on the instant time-line, such that subtracting one hour will
always be a duration of one hour earlier.
This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one hour.
Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years,
thus subtracting one day is not the same as adding 24 hours.

For example, consider a time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris', where the
Autumn DST cutover means that the local times 02:00 to 02:59 occur twice
changing from offset +02:00 in summer to +01:00 in winter.

- Subtracting one hour from 03:30+01:00 will result in 02:30+01:00

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:**
- query

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
- query

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- query

- the query to invoke, not null

**Returns:**
- the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)

---

#### public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

ZonedDateTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date-time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
using

startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

ZonedDateTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the time-zone differs between the two zoned date-times, the specified
end date-time is normalized to have the same zone as this date-time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two date-times.
For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

,

DAYS

,

WEEKS

,

MONTHS

,

YEARS

,

DECADES

,

CENTURIES

,

MILLENNIA

and

ERAS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

The calculation for date and time units differ.

Date units operate on the local time-line, using the local date-time.
For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
in days will always be counted as exactly one day, irrespective of whether
there was a daylight savings change or not.

Time units operate on the instant time-line.
The calculation effectively converts both zoned date-times to instants
and then calculates the period between the instants.
For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
in hours may be 23, 24 or 25 hours (or some other amount) depending on
whether there was a daylight savings change or not.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- until

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- endExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a

ZonedDateTime

, not null
- unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null

**Returns:**
- the amount of time between this date-time and the end date-time

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to a

ZonedDateTime
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
such as

2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris

.

ZonedDateTime

is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.
This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
and a time-zone, with a zone offset used to handle ambiguous local date-times.
For example, the value
"2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00 in the Europe/Paris time-zone"
can be stored in a

ZonedDateTime

.

This class handles conversion from the local time-line of

LocalDateTime

to the instant time-line of

Instant

.
The difference between the two time-lines is the offset from UTC/Greenwich,
represented by a

ZoneOffset

.

Converting between the two time-lines involves calculating the offset using the

rules

accessed from the

ZoneId

.
Obtaining the offset for an instant is simple, as there is exactly one valid
offset for each instant. By contrast, obtaining the offset for a local date-time
is not straightforward. There are three cases:

- Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.
- Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically
due to the spring daylight savings change from "winter" to "summer".
In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.
- Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically
due to the autumn daylight savings change from "summer" to "winter".
In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.

Any method that converts directly or implicitly from a local date-time to an
instant by obtaining the offset has the potential to be complicated.

For Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
middle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time
shifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting in a date-time in the later
offset, typically "summer" time.

For Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no
previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is
used, typically "summer" time.. Two additional methods,

withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()

and

withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

,
help manage the case of an overlap.

In terms of design, this class should be viewed primarily as the combination
of a

LocalDateTime

and a

ZoneId

. The

ZoneOffset

is
a vital, but secondary, piece of information, used to ensure that the class
represents an instant, especially during a daylight savings overlap.

This is a

value-based

class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
(

==

), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of

ZonedDateTime

may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
The

equals

method should be used for comparisons.

**Implementation Requirements:** A

ZonedDateTime

holds state equivalent to three separate objects,
a

LocalDateTime

, a

ZoneId

and the resolved

ZoneOffset

.
The offset and local date-time are used to define an instant when necessary.
The zone ID is used to obtain the rules for how and when the offset changes.
The offset cannot be freely set, as the zone controls which offsets are valid.

This class is immutable and thread-safe.

middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no
previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is
used, typically "summer" time.. Two additional methods,

withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()

and

withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

,
help manage the case of an overlap.

In terms of design, this class should be viewed primarily as the combination
of a

LocalDateTime

and a

ZoneId

. The

ZoneOffset

is
a vital, but secondary, piece of information, used to ensure that the class
represents an instant, especially during a daylight savings overlap.

This is a

value-based

class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
(

==

), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of

ZonedDateTime

may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
The

equals

method should be used for comparisons.

For Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
middle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time
shifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting in a date-time in the later
offset, typically "summer" time.

For Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no
previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- now

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
now()
```

Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current date-time.
The zone and offset will be set based on the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Returns:** the current date-time using the system clock, not null

- now

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
now​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current date-time.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
The offset will be calculated from the specified time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:** zone

- the zone ID to use, not null
**Returns:** the current date-time using the system clock, not null

- now

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
now​(
Clock
clock)
```

Obtains the current date-time from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current date-time.
The zone and offset will be set based on the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

**Parameters:** clock

- the clock to use, not null
**Returns:** the current date-time, not null

- of

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
of​(
LocalDate
date,

LocalTime
time,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a local date and time.

This creates a zoned date-time matching the input local date and time as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

The local date time and first combined to form a local date-time.
The local date-time is then resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, when clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, when clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

**Parameters:** date

- the local date, not null
**Parameters:** time

- the local time, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Returns:** the offset date-time, not null

int minute,
int second,
int nanoOfSecond,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a year, month, day,
hour, minute, second, nanosecond and time-zone.

This creates a zoned date-time matching the local date-time of the seven
specified fields as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local

For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.

LocalDateTime

has five additional convenience variants of the
equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.

**Parameters:** year

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Returns:** the offset date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the value of any field is out of range, or
if the day-of-month is invalid for the month-year

- ofLocal

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
ofLocal​(
LocalDateTime
localDateTime,

ZoneId
zone,

ZoneOffset
preferredOffset)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a local date-time
using the preferred offset if possible.

The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
If the preferred offset is one of the valid offsets then it is used.
Otherwise the earlier valid offset is used, typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

**Parameters:** localDateTime

- the local date-time, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Parameters:** preferredOffset

- the zone offset, null if no preference
**Returns:** the zoned date-time, not null

- ofInstant

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
ofInstant​(
Instant
instant,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from an

Instant

.

This creates a zoned date-time with the same instant as that specified.
Calling

ChronoZonedDateTime.toInstant()

will return an instant equal to the one used here.

Converting an instant to a zoned date-time is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant.

**Parameters:** instant

- the instant to create the date-time from, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported range

- ofInstant

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
ofInstant​(
LocalDateTime
localDateTime,

ZoneOffset
offset,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from the instant formed by combining
the local date-time and offset.

This creates a zoned date-time by

combining

the

LocalDateTime

and

ZoneOffset

.
This combination uniquely specifies an instant without ambiguity.

Converting an instant to a zoned date-time is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant. If the valid offset is different to the offset specified,
then the date-time and offset of the zoned date-time will differ from those specified.

If the

ZoneId

to be used is a

ZoneOffset

, this method is equivalent
to

of(LocalDateTime, ZoneId)

.

**Parameters:** localDateTime

- the local date-time, not null
**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time, not null

- ofStrict

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
ofStrict​(
LocalDateTime
localDateTime,

ZoneOffset
offset,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

strictly validating the
combination of local date-time, offset and zone ID.

This creates a zoned date-time ensuring that the offset is valid for the
local date-time according to the rules of the specified zone.
If the offset is invalid, an exception is thrown.

**Parameters:** localDateTime

- the local date-time, not null
**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the combination of arguments is invalid

- from

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains a zoned date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ZonedDateTime

.

The conversion will first obtain a

ZoneId

from the temporal object,
falling back to a

ZoneOffset

if necessary. It will then try to obtain
an

Instant

, falling back to a

LocalDateTime

if necessary.
The result will be either the combination of

ZoneId

or

ZoneOffset

with

Instant

or

LocalDateTime

.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ZonedDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to an

ZonedDateTime
**See Also:** Chronology.zonedDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

CharSequence
text)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a text string such as

2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]

.

The string must represent a valid date-time and is parsed using

DateTimeFormatter.ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME

.

**Parameters:** text

- the text to parse such as "2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]", not null

**Returns:** the parsed zoned date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- isSupported

```java
public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField

```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if this date-time can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

range

field)
```

Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
This date-time is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return
appropriate range instances.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

**Returns:** the zone offset, not null

- withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()
```

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
earlier of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the earlier of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the earlier offset, not null

- withLaterOffsetAtOverlap

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()
```

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
later of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the later of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** withLaterOffsetAtOverlap

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the later offset, not null

- getZone

```java
public
ZoneId
getZone()
```

Gets the time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris'.

This returns the zone ID. This identifies the time-zone

rules

that determine when and how the offset from UTC/Greenwich changes.

The zone ID may be same as the

offset

.
If this is true, then any future calculations, such as addition or subtraction,
have no complex edge cases due to time-zone rules.
See also

withFixedOffsetZone()

.

**Specified by:** getZone

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Returns:** the time-zone, not null

- withZoneSameLocal

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
withZoneSameLocal​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the local date-time if possible.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the local date-time.
The local date-time is only changed if it is invalid for the new zone,
determined using the same approach as

ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)

.

To change the zone and adjust the local date-time,
use

withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** withZoneSameLocal

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null

- withZoneSameInstant

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
withZoneSameInstant​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the instant.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the instant.
This normally results in a change to the local date-time.

This method is based on retaining the same instant, thus gaps and overlaps
in the local time-line have no effect on the result.

To change the offset while keeping the local time,
use

withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId)

.

**Specified by:** withZoneSameInstant

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

- withFixedOffsetZone

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
withFixedOffsetZone()
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with the zone ID set to the offset.

This returns a zoned date-time where the zone ID is the same as

getOffset()

.
The local date-time, offset and instant of the result will be the same as in this date-time.

Setting the date-time to a fixed single offset means that any future
calculations, such as addition or subtraction, have no complex edge cases
due to time-zone rules.
This might also be useful when sending a zoned date-time across a network,
as most protocols, such as ISO-8601, only handle offsets,
and not region-based zone IDs.

This is equivalent to

ZonedDateTime.of(zdt.toLocalDateTime(), zdt.getOffset())

.

**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

with the zone ID set to the offset, not null

- toLocalDateTime

```java
public
LocalDateTime
toLocalDateTime()
```

Gets the

LocalDateTime

part of this date-time.

This returns a

LocalDateTime

with the same year, month, day and time
as this date-time.

**Specified by:** toLocalDateTime

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Returns:** the local date-time part of this date-time, not null

- toLocalDate

```java
public
LocalDate
toLocalDate()
```

Gets the

LocalDate

part of this date-time.

This returns a

LocalDate

with the same year, month and day
as this date-time.

**Specified by:** toLocalDate

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Returns:** the date part of this date-time, not null

- getYear

```java
public int getYear()
```

Gets the year field.

This method returns the primitive

int

value for the year.

The year returned by this method is proleptic as per

get(YEAR)

.
To obtain the year-of-era, use

get(YEAR_OF_ERA)

.

**Returns:** the year, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR

- getMonthValue

```java
public int getMonthValue()
```

Gets the month-of-year field from 1 to 12.

This method returns the month as an

int

from 1 to 12.
Application code is frequently clearer if the enum

Month

is used by calling

getMonth()

.

**Returns:** the month-of-year, from 1 to 12
**See Also:** getMonth()

- getMonth

```java
public
Month
getMonth()
```

Gets the month-of-year field using the

Month

enum.

This method returns the enum

Month

for the month.
This avoids confusion as to what

int

values mean.
If you need access to the primitive

int

value then the enum
provides the

int value

.

**Returns:** the month-of-year, not null
**See Also:** getMonthValue()

- getDayOfMonth

```java
public int getDayOfMonth()
```

Gets the day-of-month field.

This method returns the primitive

int

value for the day-of-month.

**Returns:** the day-of-month, from 1 to 31

- getDayOfYear

```java
public int getDayOfYear()
```

Gets the day-of-year field.

This method returns the primitive

int

value for the day-of-year.

**Returns:** the day-of-year, from 1 to 365, or 366 in a leap year

- getDayOfWeek

```java
public
DayOfWeek
getDayOfWeek()
```

Gets the day-of-week field, which is an enum

DayOfWeek

.

This method returns the enum

DayOfWeek

for the day-of-week.
This avoids confusion as to what

int

values mean.
If you need access to the primitive

int

value then the enum
provides the

int value

.

Additional information can be obtained from the

DayOfWeek

.
This includes textual names of the values.

**Returns:** the day-of-week, not null

- toLocalTime

```java
public
LocalTime
toLocalTime()
```

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>

- with

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
Key date-time classes also implement the

TemporalAdjuster

interface,
such as

Month

and

MonthDay

.
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:

```java
import static java.time.Month.*;
import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

result = zonedDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
```

The classes

LocalDate

and

LocalTime

implement

TemporalAdjuster

,
thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:

```java
result = zonedDateTime.with(date);
result = zonedDateTime.with(time);
```

ZoneOffset

also implements

TemporalAdjuster

however using it
as an argument typically has no effect. The offset of a

ZonedDateTime

is
controlled primarily by the time-zone. As such, changing the offset does not generally
make sense, because there is only one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

method on the
specified adjuster passing

this

as the argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on

this

with the adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the adjustment cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

INSTANT_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
The zone and nano-of-second are unchanged.
The result will have an offset derived from the new instant and original zone.
If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The

OFFSET_SECONDS

field will typically be ignored.
The offset of a

ZonedDateTime

is controlled primarily by the time-zone.
As such, changing the offset does not generally make sense, because there is only
one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
If the new offset value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalDateTime

.
The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.
When converting back to

ZonedDateTime

, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

- plusHours

```java

plusHours​(long hours)
```

Returns a copy of this

ZonedDateTime

with the specified number of hours added.

This operates on the instant time-line, such that adding one hour will
always be a duration of one hour later.
This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one hour.
Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years,
thus adding one day is not the same as adding 24 hours.

For example, consider a time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris', where the
Autumn DST cutover means that the local times 02:00 to 02:59 occur twice
changing from offset +02:00 in summer to +01:00 in winter.

- Adding one hour to 01:30+02:00 will result in 02:30+02:00

If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** years

- the years to subtract, may be negative
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the years subtracted, not null

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

- minusMonths

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
minusMonths​(long months)
```

Returns a copy of this

ZonedDateTime

with the specified number of months subtracted.

This operates on the local time-line,

subtracting months

to the local date-time.
This is then converted back to a

ZonedDateTime

, using the zone ID
to obtain the offset.

When converting back to

ZonedDateTime

, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** months

- the months to subtract, may be negative
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the months subtracted, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

- minusWeeks

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
minusWeeks​(long weeks)
```

Returns a copy of this

ZonedDateTime

with the specified number of weeks subtracted.

This operates on the local time-line,

subtracting weeks

to the local date-time.
This is then converted back to a

ZonedDateTime

, using the zone ID
to obtain the offset.

When converting back to

ZonedDateTime

, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** weeks

- the weeks to subtract, may be negative
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the weeks subtracted, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

- minusDays

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
minusDays​(long days)
```

Returns a copy of this

ZonedDateTime

with the specified number of days subtracted.

This operates on the local time-line,

subtracting days

to the local date-time.
This is then converted back to a

ZonedDateTime

, using the zone ID
to obtain the offset.

When converting back to

ZonedDateTime

, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

**Parameters:** days

- the days to subtract, may be negative
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the days subtracted, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

- minusHours

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
minusHours​(long hours)
```

Returns a copy of this

ZonedDateTime

with the specified number of hours subtracted.

This operates on the instant time-line, such that subtracting one hour will
always be a duration of one hour earlier.
This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one hour.
Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years,
thus subtracting one day is not the same as adding 24 hours.

For example, consider a time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris', where the
Autumn DST cutover means that the local times 02:00 to 02:59 occur twice
changing from offset +02:00 in summer to +01:00 in winter.

- Subtracting one hour from 03:30+01:00 will result in 02:30+01:00
(both in winter time)

Subtracting one hour from 02:30+01:00 will result in 02:30+02:00
(moving from winter to summer time)

Subtracting one hour from 02:30+02:00 will result in 01:30+02:00
(both in summer time)

Subtracting three hours from 03:30+01:00 will result in 01:30+02:00
(moving from winter to summer time)

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

- the nanos to subtract, may be negative
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the nanoseconds subtracted, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- query

```java
public <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this date-time using the specified query.

This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

- until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

ZonedDateTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date-time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
using

startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

ZonedDateTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the time-zone differs between the two zoned date-times, the specified
end date-time is normalized to have the same zone as this date-time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two date-times.
For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

,

DAYS

,

WEEKS

,

MONTHS

,

YEARS

,

DECADES

,

CENTURIES

,

MILLENNIA

and

ERAS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

The calculation for date and time units differ.

Date units operate on the local time-line, using the local date-time.
For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
in days will always be counted as exactly one day, irrespective of whether
there was a daylight savings change or not.

Time units operate on the instant time-line.
The calculation effectively converts both zoned date-times to instants
and then calculates the period between the instants.
For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
in hours may be 23, 24 or 25 hours (or some other amount) depending on
whether there was a daylight savings change or not.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

Method Detail

- now

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
now()
```

Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current date-time.
The zone and offset will be set based on the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Returns:** the current date-time using the system clock, not null

- now

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
now​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current date-time.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
The offset will be calculated from the specified time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:** zone

- the zone ID to use, not null
**Returns:** the current date-time using the system clock, not null

- now

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
now​(
Clock
clock)
```

Obtains the current date-time from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current date-time.
The zone and offset will be set based on the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

**Parameters:** clock

- the clock to use, not null
**Returns:** the current date-time, not null

- of

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
of​(
LocalDate
date,

LocalTime
time,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a local date and time.

This creates a zoned date-time matching the input local date and time as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

The local date time and first combined to form a local date-time.
The local date-time is then resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, when clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, when clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

**Parameters:** date

- the local date, not null
**Parameters:** time

- the local time, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Returns:** the offset date-time, not null

from a year, month, day,
hour, minute, second, nanosecond and time-zone.

This creates a zoned date-time matching the local date-time of the seven
specified fields as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

ofLocal​(
LocalDateTime
localDateTime,

ZoneId
zone,

ZoneOffset
preferredOffset)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a local date-time
using the preferred offset if possible.

The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
If the preferred offset is one of the valid offsets then it is used.
Otherwise the earlier valid offset is used, typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

**Parameters:** localDateTime

- the local date-time, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Parameters:** preferredOffset

- the zone offset, null if no preference

from an

Instant

.

This creates a zoned date-time with the same instant as that specified.
Calling

ChronoZonedDateTime.toInstant()

will return an instant equal to the one used here.

Converting an instant to a zoned date-time is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant.

**Parameters:** instant

- the instant to create the date-time from, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

ofInstant​(
LocalDateTime
localDateTime,

ZoneOffset
offset,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from the instant formed by combining
the local date-time and offset.

This creates a zoned date-time by

combining

the

LocalDateTime

and

ZoneOffset

.
This combination uniquely specifies an instant without ambiguity.

Converting an instant to a zoned date-time is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant. If the valid offset is different to the offset specified,
then the date-time and offset of the zoned date-time will differ from those specified.

If the

ZoneId

to be used is a

ZoneOffset

, this method is equivalent
to

of(LocalDateTime, ZoneId)

.

**Parameters:** localDateTime

- the local date-time, not null
**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time, not null

- ofStrict

```java

ofStrict​(
LocalDateTime
localDateTime,

ZoneOffset
offset,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

strictly validating the
combination of local date-time, offset and zone ID.

This creates a zoned date-time ensuring that the offset is valid for the
local date-time according to the rules of the specified zone.
If the offset is invalid, an exception is thrown.

**Parameters:** localDateTime

- the local date-time, not null
**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the combination of arguments is invalid

- from

```java
public static
ZonedDateTime
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains a zoned date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ZonedDateTime

.

The conversion will first obtain a

ZoneId

from the temporal object,
falling back to a

ZoneOffset

if necessary. It will then try to obtain
an

Instant

, falling back to a

LocalDateTime

if necessary.
The result will be either the combination of

ZoneId

or

ZoneOffset

with

Instant

or

LocalDateTime

.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ZonedDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to an

CharSequence
text)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a text string such as

2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]

.

The string must represent a valid date-time and is parsed using

DateTimeFormatter.ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME

.

**Returns:** the parsed zoned date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- isSupported

```java
public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField

```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if this date-time can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
This date-time is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return
appropriate range instances.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessor)

- getOffset

```java
public
ZoneOffset
getOffset()
```

**Returns:** the zone offset, not null

- withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()
```

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
earlier of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the earlier of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the earlier offset, not null

- withLaterOffsetAtOverlap

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()
```

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
later of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the later of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** withLaterOffsetAtOverlap

**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the later offset, not null

- getZone

```java
public
ZoneId
getZone()
```

Gets the time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris'.

This returns the zone ID. This identifies the time-zone

rules

that determine when and how the offset from UTC/Greenwich changes.

The zone ID may be same as the

offset

.
If this is true, then any future calculations, such as addition or subtraction,
have no complex edge cases due to time-zone rules.
See also

withFixedOffsetZone()

.

**Specified by:** getZone

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Returns:** the time-zone, not null

- withZoneSameLocal

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
withZoneSameLocal​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the local date-time if possible.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the local date-time.
The local date-time is only changed if it is invalid for the new zone,
determined using the same approach as

ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)

.

To change the zone and adjust the local date-time,
use

withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** withZoneSameLocal

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null

- withZoneSameInstant

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
withZoneSameInstant​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the instant.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the instant.
This normally results in a change to the local date-time.

This method is based on retaining the same instant, thus gaps and overlaps
in the local time-line have no effect on the result.

To change the offset while keeping the local time,
use

withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId)

.

**Specified by:** withZoneSameInstant

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

- withFixedOffsetZone

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
withFixedOffsetZone()
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with the zone ID set to the offset.

This returns a zoned date-time where the zone ID is the same as

getOffset()

.
The local date-time, offset and instant of the result will be the same as in this date-time.

Setting the date-time to a fixed single offset means that any future
calculations, such as addition or subtraction, have no complex edge cases
due to time-zone rules.
This might also be useful when sending a zoned date-time across a network,
as most protocols, such as ISO-8601, only handle offsets,
and not region-based zone IDs.

This is equivalent to

ZonedDateTime.of(zdt.toLocalDateTime(), zdt.getOffset())

.

**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

with the zone ID set to the offset, not null

- toLocalDateTime

```java
public
LocalDateTime
toLocalDateTime()
```

Gets the

LocalDateTime

part of this date-time.

This returns a

LocalDateTime

with the same year, month, day and time
as this date-time.

**Specified by:** toLocalDateTime

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Returns:** the local date-time part of this date-time, not null

- toLocalDate

```java
public
LocalDate
toLocalDate()
```

Gets the

LocalDate

part of this date-time.

This returns a

LocalDate

with the same year, month and day
as this date-time.

**Specified by:** toLocalDate

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Returns:** the date part of this date-time, not null

- getYear

```java
public int getYear()
```

Gets the year field.

This method returns the primitive

int

value for the year.

The year returned by this method is proleptic as per

get(YEAR)

.
To obtain the year-of-era, use

get(YEAR_OF_ERA)

.

**Returns:** the year, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR

- getMonthValue

```java
public int getMonthValue()
```

Gets the month-of-year field from 1 to 12.

This method returns the month as an

int

from 1 to 12.
Application code is frequently clearer if the enum

Month

is used by calling

getMonth()

.

**Returns:** the month-of-year, from 1 to 12
**See Also:** getMonth()

- getMonth

```java
public
Month
getMonth()
```

Gets the month-of-year field using the

Month

enum.

This method returns the enum

Month

for the month.
This avoids confusion as to what

int

values mean.
If you need access to the primitive

int

value then the enum
provides the

int value

.

**Returns:** the month-of-year, not null
**See Also:** getMonthValue()

- getDayOfMonth

```java
public int getDayOfMonth()
```

Gets the day-of-month field.

This method returns the primitive

int

value for the day-of-month.

**Returns:** the day-of-month, from 1 to 31

- getDayOfYear

```java
public int getDayOfYear()
```

Gets the day-of-year field.

This method returns the primitive

int

value for the day-of-year.

**Returns:** the day-of-year, from 1 to 365, or 366 in a leap year

- getDayOfWeek

```java
public
DayOfWeek
getDayOfWeek()
```

Gets the day-of-week field, which is an enum

DayOfWeek

.

This method returns the enum

DayOfWeek

for the day-of-week.
This avoids confusion as to what

int

values mean.
If you need access to the primitive

int

value then the enum
provides the

int value

.

Additional information can be obtained from the

DayOfWeek

.
This includes textual names of the values.

**Returns:** the day-of-week, not null

- toLocalTime

```java
public
LocalTime
toLocalTime()
```

Gets the

LocalTime

part of this date-time.

This returns a

LocalTime

with the same hour, minute, second and
nanosecond as this date-time.

**Specified by:** toLocalTime

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

>
**Returns:** the time part of this date-time, not null

- getHour

```java
public int getHour()
```

Gets the hour-of-day field.

**Returns:** the hour-of-day, from 0 to 23

- getMinute

```java
public int getMinute()

- with

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
Key date-time classes also implement the

TemporalAdjuster

interface,
such as

Month

and

MonthDay

.
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:

```java
import static java.time.Month.*;
import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

result = zonedDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
```

The classes

LocalDate

and

LocalTime

implement

TemporalAdjuster

,
thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:

```java
result = zonedDateTime.with(date);
result = zonedDateTime.with(time);
```

ZoneOffset

also implements

TemporalAdjuster

however using it
as an argument typically has no effect. The offset of a

ZonedDateTime

is
controlled primarily by the time-zone. As such, changing the offset does not generally
make sense, because there is only one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

method on the
specified adjuster passing

this

as the argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

ChronoZonedDateTime

<

LocalDate

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

based on

this

with the adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the adjustment cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

INSTANT_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
The zone and nano-of-second are unchanged.
The result will have an offset derived from the new instant and original zone.
If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The

OFFSET_SECONDS

field will typically be ignored.
The offset of a

ZonedDateTime

is controlled primarily by the time-zone.
As such, changing the offset does not generally make sense, because there is only
one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
If the new offset value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalDateTime

.
The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.
When converting back to

ZonedDateTime

, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

Period

or

Duration

but may be
any other type implementing the

TemporalAmount

interface.

The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling

TemporalAmount.addTo(Temporal)

. The amount implementation is free
to implement the addition in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

. Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully added.

in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoUnit

then the addition is implemented here.
The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged in the result.
The calculation for date and time units differ.

Date units operate on the local time-line.
The period is first added to the local date-time, then converted back
to a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
The conversion uses

ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)

with the offset before the addition.

Time units operate on the instant time-line.
The period is first added to the local date-time, then converted back to
a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
The conversion uses

ofInstant(LocalDateTime, ZoneOffset, ZoneId)

with the offset before the addition.

- plusHours

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
plusHours​(long hours)
```

Returns a copy of this

ZonedDateTime

with the specified number of hours added.

This operates on the instant time-line, such that adding one hour will
always be a duration of one hour later.
This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one hour.
Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years,
thus adding one day is not the same as adding 24 hours.

For example, consider a time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris', where the
Autumn DST cutover means that the local times 02:00 to 02:59 occur twice
changing from offset +02:00 in summer to +01:00 in winter.

- Adding one hour to 01:30+02:00 will result in 02:30+02:00
(both in summer time)

Adding one hour to 02:30+02:00 will result in 02:30+01:00
(moving from summer to winter time)

Adding one hour to 02:30+01:00 will result in 03:30+01:00

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** nanos

- the nanos to add, may be negative
**Returns:** a

ZonedDateTime

- minus

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
minus​(
TemporalAmount
amountToSubtract)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount subtracted.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the specified amount subtracted.
The amount is typically

Period

or

Duration

but may be
any other type implementing the

TemporalAmount

interface.

The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling

TemporalAmount.subtractFrom(Temporal)

. The amount implementation is free
to implement the subtraction in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to

minus(long, TemporalUnit)

. Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully subtracted.

minus​(long amountToSubtract,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount subtracted.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the amount
in terms of the unit subtracted. If it is not possible to subtract the amount,
because the unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

The calculation for date and time units differ.

Date units operate on the local time-line.
The period is first subtracted from the local date-time, then converted back
to a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
The conversion uses

ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)

with the offset before the subtraction.

Time units operate on the instant time-line.
The period is first subtracted from the local date-time, then converted back to
a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
The conversion uses

ofInstant(LocalDateTime, ZoneOffset, ZoneId)

with the offset before the subtraction.

This method is equivalent to

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

with the amount negated.
See that method for a full description of how addition, and thus subtraction, works.

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null

- until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

ZonedDateTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date-time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
using

startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

ZonedDateTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the time-zone differs between the two zoned date-times, the specified
end date-time is normalized to have the same zone as this date-time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two date-times.
For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

,

DAYS

,

WEEKS

,

MONTHS

,

YEARS

,

DECADES

,

CENTURIES

,

MILLENNIA

and

ERAS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

The calculation for date and time units differ.

Date units operate on the local time-line, using the local date-time.
For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
in days will always be counted as exactly one day, irrespective of whether
there was a daylight savings change or not.

Time units operate on the instant time-line.
The calculation effectively converts both zoned date-times to instants
and then calculates the period between the instants.
For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
in hours may be 23, 24 or 25 hours (or some other amount) depending on
whether there was a daylight savings change or not.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Checks if this date-time is equal to another date-time.

ZonedDateTime

date,

time,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

ZonedDateTime

from a local date and time.

This creates a zoned date-time matching the input local date and time as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

The local date time and first combined to form a local date-time.
The local date-time is then resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
Key date-time classes also implement the

TemporalAdjuster

interface,

The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:

```java

import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

result = zonedDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
```

The classes

LocalDate

and

thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:

```java
result = zonedDateTime.with(date);
result = zonedDateTime.with(time);
```

ZoneOffset

also implements

TemporalAdjuster

however using it
as an argument typically has no effect. The offset of a

ZonedDateTime

is
controlled primarily by the time-zone. As such, changing the offset does not generally
make sense, because there is only one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

INSTANT_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
The zone and nano-of-second are unchanged.
The result will have an offset derived from the new instant and original zone.

If the new offset value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalDateTime

.
The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.
When converting back to

ZonedDateTime

, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

whether and how to adjust the instant.

ZonedDateTime

with​(

TemporalField

field,
long newValue)

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

INSTANT_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
The zone and nano-of-second are unchanged.
The result will have an offset derived from the new instant and original zone.
If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The

OFFSET_SECONDS

field will typically be ignored.
The offset of a

ZonedDateTime

is controlled primarily by the time-zone.
As such, changing the offset does not generally make sense, because there is only
one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
If the new offset value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalDateTime

.
The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.
When converting back to

ZonedDateTime

, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.

because the unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

The calculation for date and time units differ.

Date units operate on the local time-line.
The period is first subtracted from the local date-time, then converted back
to a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
The conversion uses

Time units operate on the instant time-line.
The period is first subtracted from the local date-time, then converted back to
a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
The conversion uses

until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

ZonedDateTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date-time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
using

startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

ZonedDateTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the time-zone differs between the two zoned date-times, the specified
end date-time is normalized to have the same zone as this date-time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two date-times.
For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
in days will always be counted as exactly one day, irrespective of whether
there was a daylight savings change or not.

Time units operate on the instant time-line.
The calculation effectively converts both zoned date-times to instants
and then calculates the period between the instants.
For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
in hours may be 23, 24 or 25 hours (or some other amount) depending on
whether there was a daylight savings change or not.
