stratum,

String
sourceName,
int lineNumber)
throws
AbsentInformationException

Returns a List containing all

Location

objects
that map to the given line number and source name.

Returns a list containing each

Location

that maps
to the given line. The returned list will contain a
location for each disjoint range of code indices that have
been assigned to the given line by the compiler and/or
VM. Each returned location corresponds to the beginning of
this range. An empty list will be returned if there is no
executable code at the specified line number; specifically,
native and abstract methods will always return an empty
list.

Returned list is for the specified

stratum

(see

Location

for a description of strata).

**Parameters:**
- stratum

- the stratum to use for comparing line number
and source name, or null to use the default
stratum
- sourceName

- the source name containing the
line number, or null to match all
source names
- lineNumber

- the line number

is non-

null

and source name information is not present.

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### Location
locationOfCodeIndex​(long codeIndex)

Returns a

Location

for the given code index.

**Returns:**
- the

Location

corresponding to the
given code index or null if the specified code index is not a
valid code index for this method (native and abstract methods
will always return null).

---

#### List
<
LocalVariable
> variables()
throws
AbsentInformationException

Returns a list containing each

LocalVariable

declared
in this method. The list includes any variable declared in any
scope within the method. It may contain multiple variables of the
same name declared within disjoint scopes. Arguments are considered
local variables and will be present in the returned list.

If local variable information is not available, values of
actual arguments to method invocations can be obtained
by using the method

StackFrame.getArgumentValues()

**Returns:**
- the list of

LocalVariable

objects which mirror
local variables declared in this method in the target VM.
If there are no local variables, a zero-length list is returned.

**Throws:**
- AbsentInformationException

- if there is no variable
information for this method.
Generally, local variable information is not available for
native or abstract methods (that is, their argument name
information is not available), thus they will throw this exception.

---

#### List
<
LocalVariable
> variablesByName​(
String
name)
throws
AbsentInformationException

Returns a list containing each

LocalVariable

of a
given name in this method.
Multiple variables can be returned
if the same variable name is used in disjoint
scopes within the method.

**Returns:**
- the list of

LocalVariable

objects of the given
name.
If there are no matching local variables, a zero-length list
is returned.

**Throws:**
- AbsentInformationException

- if there is no variable
information for this method.
Generally, local variable information is not available for
native or abstract methods (that is, their argument name
information is not available), thus they will throw this exception.

---

#### List
<
LocalVariable
> arguments()
throws
AbsentInformationException

Returns a list containing each

LocalVariable

that is
declared as an argument of this method.

If local variable information is not available, values of
actual arguments to method invocations can be obtained
by using the method

StackFrame.getArgumentValues()

**Returns:**
- the list of

LocalVariable

arguments.
If there are no arguments, a zero-length list is returned.

**Throws:**
- AbsentInformationException

- if there is no variable
information for this method.
Generally, local variable information is not available for
native or abstract methods (that is, their argument name
information is not available), thus they will throw this exception.

---

Returns a list containing a

Location

object for
each executable source line in this method.

Each location maps a source line to a range of code
indices.
The beginning of the range can be determined through

Location.codeIndex()

.
The returned list is ordered by code index
(from low to high).

The returned list may contain multiple locations for a
particular line number, if the compiler and/or VM has
mapped that line to two or more disjoint code index ranges.

If the method is native or abstract, an empty list is
returned.

Returned list is for the specified

stratum

(see

Location

for a description of strata).

**Parameters:** stratum

- The stratum to retrieve information from
or

null

for the

ReferenceType.defaultStratum()
**Parameters:** sourceName

- Return locations only within this
source file or

null

to return locations.
**Returns:** a List of all source line

Location

objects.
**Throws:** AbsentInformationException
