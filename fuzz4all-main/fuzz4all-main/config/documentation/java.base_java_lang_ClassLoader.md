# Class ClassLoader

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\ClassLoader.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
ClassLoader

extends
Object
```

A class loader is an object that is responsible for loading classes. The
class

ClassLoader

is an abstract class. Given the

binary name

of a class, a class loader should attempt to
locate or generate data that constitutes a definition for the class. A
typical strategy is to transform the name into a file name and then read a
"class file" of that name from a file system.

Every

Class

object contains a

reference

to the

ClassLoader

that defined
it.

Class

objects for array classes are not created by class
loaders, but are created automatically as required by the Java runtime.
The class loader for an array class, as returned by

Class.getClassLoader()

is the same as the class loader for its element
type; if the element type is a primitive type, then the array class has no
class loader.

Applications implement subclasses of

ClassLoader

in order to
extend the manner in which the Java virtual machine dynamically loads
classes.

Class loaders may typically be used by security managers to indicate
security domains.

In addition to loading classes, a class loader is also responsible for
locating resources. A resource is some data (a "

.class

" file,
configuration data, or an image for example) that is identified with an
abstract '/'-separated path name. Resources are typically packaged with an
application or library so that they can be located by code in the
application or library. In some cases, the resources are included so that
they can be located by other libraries.

The

ClassLoader

class uses a delegation model to search for
classes and resources. Each instance of

ClassLoader

has an
associated parent class loader. When requested to find a class or
resource, a

ClassLoader

instance will usually delegate the search
for the class or resource to its parent class loader before attempting to
find the class or resource itself.

Class loaders that support concurrent loading of classes are known as

parallel capable

class
loaders and are required to register themselves at their class initialization
time by invoking the

ClassLoader.registerAsParallelCapable

method. Note that the

ClassLoader

class is registered as parallel
capable by default. However, its subclasses still need to register themselves
if they are parallel capable.
In environments in which the delegation model is not strictly
hierarchical, class loaders need to be parallel capable, otherwise class
loading can lead to deadlocks because the loader lock is held for the
duration of the class loading process (see

loadClass

methods).

Run-time Built-in Class Loaders

The Java run-time has the following built-in class loaders:

- Bootstrap class loader.
It is the virtual machine's built-in class loader, typically represented
as

null

, and does not have a parent.
- Platform class loader

.
All

platform classes

are visible to the platform class loader
that can be used as the parent of a

ClassLoader

instance.
Platform classes include Java SE platform APIs, their implementation
classes and JDK-specific run-time classes that are defined by the
platform class loader or its ancestors.

To allow for upgrading/overriding of modules defined to the platform
class loader, and where upgraded modules read modules defined to class
loaders other than the platform class loader and its ancestors, then
the platform class loader may have to delegate to other class loaders,
the application class loader for example.
In other words, classes in named modules defined to class loaders
other than the platform class loader and its ancestors may be visible
to the platform class loader.
- System class loader

.
It is also known as

application class loader

and is distinct
from the platform class loader.
The system class loader is typically used to define classes on the
application class path, module path, and JDK-specific tools.
The platform class loader is a parent or an ancestor of the system class
loader that all platform classes are visible to it.

Normally, the Java virtual machine loads classes from the local file
system in a platform-dependent manner.
However, some classes may not originate from a file; they may originate
from other sources, such as the network, or they could be constructed by an
application. The method

defineClass

converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

. Instances of this newly defined class can be created using

Class.newInstance

.

The methods and constructors of objects created by a class loader may
reference other classes. To determine the class(es) referred to, the Java
virtual machine invokes the

loadClass

method of
the class loader that originally created the class.

For example, an application could create a network class loader to
download class files from a server. Sample code might look like:

```java
ClassLoader loader = new NetworkClassLoader(host, port);
Object main = loader.loadClass("Main", true).newInstance();
. . .
```

The network class loader subclass must define the methods

findClass

and

loadClassData

to load a class
from the network. Once it has downloaded the bytes that make up the class,
it should use the method

defineClass

to
create a class instance. A sample implementation is:

```java
class NetworkClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
String host;
int port;

public Class findClass(String name) {
byte[] b = loadClassData(name);
return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
}

private byte[] loadClassData(String name) {
// load the class data from the connection
. . .
}
}
```

Binary names

Any class name provided as a

String

parameter to methods in

ClassLoader

must be a binary name as defined by

The Java™ Language Specification

.

Examples of valid class names include:

```java
"java.lang.String"
"javax.swing.JSpinner$DefaultEditor"
"java.security.KeyStore$Builder$FileBuilder$1"
"java.net.URLClassLoader$3$1"
```

Any package name provided as a

String

parameter to methods in

ClassLoader

must be either the empty string (denoting an unnamed package)
or a fully qualified name as defined by

The Java™ Language Specification

.

SecurityManager.checkCreateClassLoader()

method doesn't allow creation of a new class loader.

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- If the parent is specified as

null

(for the
bootstrap class loader) then there is no guarantee that all platform
classes are visible.

---

#### protected ClassLoader​(
ClassLoader
parent)

Creates a new class loader using the specified parent class loader for
delegation.

If there is a security manager, its

checkCreateClassLoader

method
is invoked. This may result in a security exception.

**Parameters:**
- parent

- The parent class loader

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

checkCreateClassLoader

method doesn't allow creation
of a new class loader.

**Since:**
- 1.2

**API Note:**
- If the parent is specified as

null

(for the
bootstrap class loader) then there is no guarantee that all platform
classes are visible.

---

#### protected ClassLoader()

Creates a new class loader using the

ClassLoader

returned by
the method

getSystemClassLoader()

as the parent class loader.

If there is a security manager, its

checkCreateClassLoader

method is invoked. This may result in
a security exception.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

checkCreateClassLoader

method doesn't allow creation
of a new class loader.

---

### Method Details

#### public
String
getName()

Returns the name of this class loader or

null

if
this class loader is not named.

**Returns:**
- name of this class loader; or

null

if
this class loader is not named.

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- This method is non-final for compatibility. If this
method is overridden, this method must return the same name
as specified when this class loader was instantiated.

---

#### public
Class
<?> loadClass​(
String
name)
throws
ClassNotFoundException

Loads the class with the specified

binary name

.
This method searches for classes in the same manner as the

loadClass(String, boolean)

method. It is invoked by the Java virtual
machine to resolve class references. Invoking this method is equivalent
to invoking

loadClass(name,
false)

.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The

binary name

of the class

**Returns:**
- The resulting

Class

object

**Throws:**
- ClassNotFoundException

- If the class was not found

---

#### protected
Class
<?> loadClass​(
String
name,
boolean resolve)
throws
ClassNotFoundException

Loads the class with the specified

binary name

. The
default implementation of this method searches for classes in the
following order:

- Invoke

findLoadedClass(String)

to check if the class
has already been loaded.
- Invoke the

loadClass

method
on the parent class loader. If the parent is

null

the class
loader built into the virtual machine is used, instead.
- Invoke the

findClass(String)

method to find the
class.

If the class was found using the above steps, and the

resolve

flag is true, this method will then invoke the

resolveClass(Class)

method on the resulting

Class

object.

Subclasses of

ClassLoader

are encouraged to override

findClass(String)

, rather than this method.

Unless overridden, this method synchronizes on the result of

getClassLoadingLock

method
during the entire class loading process.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The

binary name

of the class
- resolve

- If

true

then resolve the class

**Returns:**
- The resulting

Class

object

**Throws:**
- ClassNotFoundException

- If the class could not be found

---

#### protected
Object
getClassLoadingLock​(
String
className)

Returns the lock object for class loading operations.
For backward compatibility, the default implementation of this method
behaves as follows. If this ClassLoader object is registered as
parallel capable, the method returns a dedicated object associated
with the specified class name. Otherwise, the method returns this
ClassLoader object.

**Parameters:**
- className

- The name of the to-be-loaded class

**Returns:**
- the lock for class loading operations

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If registered as parallel capable and

className

is null

**See Also:**
- loadClass(String, boolean)

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### protected
Class
<?> findClass​(
String
name)
throws
ClassNotFoundException

Finds the class with the specified

binary name

.
This method should be overridden by class loader implementations that
follow the delegation model for loading classes, and will be invoked by
the

loadClass

method after checking the
parent class loader for the requested class.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The

binary name

of the class

**Returns:**
- The resulting

Class

object

**Throws:**
- ClassNotFoundException

- If the class could not be found

**Since:**
- 1.2

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation throws

ClassNotFoundException

.

---

#### protected
Class
<?> findClass​(
String
moduleName,

String
name)

Finds the class with the given

binary name

in a module defined to this class loader.
Class loader implementations that support loading from modules
should override this method.

**Parameters:**
- moduleName

- The module name; or

null

to find the class in the

unnamed module

for this
class loader
- name

- The

binary name

of the class

**Returns:**
- The resulting

Class

object, or

null

if the class could not be found.

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- This method returns

null

rather than throwing

ClassNotFoundException

if the class could not be found.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation attempts to find the class by
invoking

findClass(String)

when the

moduleName

is

null

. It otherwise returns

null

.

ClassFormatError

Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

.
Before the

Class

can be used it must be resolved. This method
is deprecated in favor of the version that takes a

binary name

as its first argument, and is more secure.

**Parameters:**
- b

- The bytes that make up the class data. The bytes in positions

off

through

off+len-1

should have the format
of a valid class file as defined by

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

.

- The start offset in

b

of the class data
- len

- The length of the class data

**Returns:**
- The

Class

object that was created from the specified
class data

**Throws:**
- ClassFormatError

- If the data did not contain a valid class
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If either

off

or

len

is negative, or if

off+len

is greater than

b.length

.
- SecurityException

- If an attempt is made to add this class to a package that
contains classes that were signed by a different set of
certificates than this class, or if an attempt is made
to define a class in a package with a fully-qualified name
that starts with "

java.

".

#### protected final
Class
<?> defineClass​(
String
name,
byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
ClassFormatError

Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

.
Before the

Class

can be used it must be resolved.

This method assigns a default

ProtectionDomain

to the newly defined class. The

ProtectionDomain

is effectively granted the same set of
permissions returned when

Policy.getPolicy().getPermissions(new CodeSource(null, null))

is invoked. The default protection domain is created on the first invocation
of

defineClass

,
and re-used on subsequent invocations.

To assign a specific

ProtectionDomain

to the class, use
the

defineClass

method that takes a

ProtectionDomain

as one of its arguments.

This method defines a package in this class loader corresponding to the
package of the

Class

(if such a package has not already been defined
in this class loader). The name of the defined package is derived from
the

binary name

of the class specified by
the byte array

b

.
Other properties of the defined package are as specified by

Package

.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The expected

binary name

of the class, or

null

if not known
- b

- The bytes that make up the class data. The bytes in positions

off

through

off+len-1

should have the format
of a valid class file as defined by

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

.

**Returns:**
- The

Class

object that was created from the specified
class data.

**Throws:**
- ClassFormatError

- If the data did not contain a valid class
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If either

off

or

len

is negative, or if

off+len

is greater than

b.length

.
- SecurityException

- If an attempt is made to add this class to a package that
contains classes that were signed by a different set of
certificates than this class (which is unsigned), or if

name

begins with "

ProtectionDomain
protectionDomain)
throws
ClassFormatError

Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

,
with a given

ProtectionDomain

.

If the given

ProtectionDomain

is

null

,
then a default protection domain will be assigned to the class as specified
in the documentation for

defineClass(String, byte[], int, int)

.
Before the class can be used it must be resolved.

The first class defined in a package determines the exact set of
certificates that all subsequent classes defined in that package must
contain. The set of certificates for a class is obtained from the

CodeSource

within the

ProtectionDomain

of the class. Any classes added to that
package must contain the same set of certificates or a

SecurityException

will be thrown. Note that if

name

is

null

, this check is not performed.
You should always pass in the

binary name

of the
class you are defining as well as the bytes. This ensures that the
class you are defining is indeed the class you think it is.

If the specified

name

begins with "

java.

", it can
only be defined by the

platform class loader

or its ancestors; otherwise

SecurityException

will be thrown. If

name

is not

null

, it must be equal to
the

binary name

of the class
specified by the byte array

b

, otherwise a

NoClassDefFoundError

will be thrown.

This method defines a package in this class loader corresponding to the
package of the

Class

(if such a package has not already been defined
in this class loader). The name of the defined package is derived from
the

binary name

of the class specified by
the byte array

b

.
Other properties of the defined package are as specified by

Package

of the class specified by

b
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If either

off

or

len

is negative, or if

off+len

is greater than

b.length

.
- SecurityException

- If an attempt is made to add this class to a package that
contains classes that were signed by a different set of
certificates than this class, or if

#### protected final void resolveClass​(
Class
<?> c)

Links the specified class. This (misleadingly named) method may be
used by a class loader to link a class. If the class

c

has
already been linked, then this method simply returns. Otherwise, the
class is linked as described in the "Execution" chapter of

The Java™ Language Specification

.

**Parameters:**
- c

loading it if necessary.

This method loads the class through the system class loader (see

getSystemClassLoader()

). The

Class

object returned
might have more than one

ClassLoader

associated with it.
Subclasses of

---

#### protected
URL
findResource​(
String
moduleName,

String
name)
throws
IOException

Returns a URL to a resource in a module defined to this class loader.
Class loader implementations that support loading from modules
should override this method.

**Parameters:**
- moduleName

- The module name; or

null

to find a resource in the

unnamed module

for this
class loader
- name

- The resource name

**Returns:**
- A URL to the resource;

null

if the resource could not be
found, a URL could not be constructed to locate the resource,
access to the resource is denied by the security manager, or
there isn't a module of the given name defined to the class
loader.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If I/O errors occur

**See Also:**
- ModuleReader.find(String)

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- This method is the basis for the

Class.getResource

,

Class.getResourceAsStream

, and

Module.getResourceAsStream

methods. It is not subject to the rules for
encapsulation specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation attempts to find the resource by
invoking

findResource(String)

when the

moduleName

is

null

. It otherwise returns

null

.

---

#### public
URL
getResource​(
String
name)

Finds the resource with the given name. A resource is some data
(images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
that is independent of the location of the code.

The name of a resource is a '

/

'-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).

**Parameters:**
- name

- The resource name

**Returns:**
- URL

object for reading the resource;

null

if
the resource could not be found, a

URL

could not be
constructed to locate the resource, the resource is in a package
that is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource is
denied by the security manager.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

name

is

null

**Since:**
- 1.1

**API Note:**
- Where several modules are defined to the same class loader,
and where more than one module contains a resource with the given name,
then the ordering that modules are searched is not specified and may be
very unpredictable.
When overriding this method it is recommended that an implementation
ensures that any delegation is consistent with the

getResources(String)

method.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation will first search the parent class
loader for the resource; if the parent is

null

the path of the
class loader built into the virtual machine is searched. If not found,
this method will invoke

findResource(String)

to find the resource.

---

#### public
Enumeration
<
URL
> getResources​(
String
name)
throws
IOException

Finds all the resources with the given name. A resource is some data
(images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
that is independent of the location of the code.

The name of a resource is a

/

-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).

**Parameters:**
- name

- The resource name

**Returns:**
- An enumeration of

URL

objects for the
resource. If no resources could be found, the enumeration will
be empty. Resources for which a

URL

cannot be
constructed, are in a package that is not opened
unconditionally, or access to the resource is denied by the
security manager, are not returned in the enumeration.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If I/O errors occur
- NullPointerException

- If

name

is

null

**Since:**
- 1.2

**API Note:**
- Where several modules are defined to the same class loader,
and where more than one module contains a resource with the given name,
then the ordering is not specified and may be very unpredictable.
When overriding this method it is recommended that an
implementation ensures that any delegation is consistent with the

getResource(String)

method. This should
ensure that the first element returned by the Enumeration's

nextElement

method is the same resource that the

getResource(String)

method would return.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation will first search the parent class
loader for the resource; if the parent is

null

the path of the
class loader built into the virtual machine is searched. It then
invokes

findResources(String)

to find the resources with the
name in this class loader. It returns an enumeration whose elements
are the URLs found by searching the parent class loader followed by
the elements found with

findResources

.

---

#### public
Stream
<
URL
> resources​(
String
name)

Returns a stream whose elements are the URLs of all the resources with
the given name. A resource is some data (images, audio, text, etc) that
can be accessed by class code in a way that is independent of the
location of the code.

The name of a resource is a

/

-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

The resources will be located when the returned stream is evaluated.
If the evaluation results in an

IOException

then the I/O
exception is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

that is then
thrown.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).

**Parameters:**
- name

- The resource name

**Returns:**
- A stream of resource

URL

objects. If no
resources could be found, the stream will be empty. Resources
for which a

URL

cannot be constructed, are in a package
that is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource
is denied by the security manager, will not be in the stream.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

name

is

null

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- When overriding this method it is recommended that an
implementation ensures that any delegation is consistent with the

getResource(String)

method. This should
ensure that the first element returned by the stream is the same
resource that the

getResource(String)

method would return.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation invokes

getResources

to find all the resources with the given name and returns
a stream with the elements in the enumeration as the source.

#### protected
URL
findResource​(
String
name)

Finds the resource with the given name. Class loader implementations
should override this method.

For resources in named modules then the method must implement the
rules for encapsulation specified in the

Module

getResourceAsStream

method. Additionally,
it must not find non-"

.class

" resources in packages of named
modules unless the package is

opened

unconditionally.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The resource name

**Returns:**
- URL

object for reading the resource;

null

if
the resource could not be found, a

URL

could not be
constructed to locate the resource, the resource is in a package
that is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource is
denied by the security manager.

**Since:**
- 1.2

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation returns

null

.

objects
representing all the resources with the given name. Class loader
implementations should override this method.

For resources in named modules then the method must implement the
rules for encapsulation specified in the

Module

getResourceAsStream

method. Additionally,
it must not find non-"

.class

" resources in packages of named
modules unless the package is

unconditionally.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The resource name

**Returns:**
- An enumeration of

URL

objects for
the resource. If no resources could be found, the enumeration
will be empty. Resources for which a

cannot be
constructed, are in a package that is not opened unconditionally,
or access to the resource is denied by the security manager,
are not returned in the enumeration.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If I/O errors occur

**Since:**
- 1.2

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation returns an enumeration that
contains no elements.

---

#### public static
ClassLoader
getSystemClassLoader()

Returns the system class loader. This is the default
delegation parent for new

ClassLoader

instances, and is
typically the class loader used to start the application.

This method is first invoked early in the runtime's startup
sequence, at which point it creates the system class loader. This
class loader will be the context class loader for the main application
thread (for example, the thread that invokes the

main

method of
the main class).

The default system class loader is an implementation-dependent
instance of this class.

If the system property "

java.system.class.loader

" is defined
when this method is first invoked then the value of that property is
taken to be the name of a class that will be returned as the system
class loader. The class is loaded using the default system class loader
and must define a public constructor that takes a single parameter of
type

ClassLoader

which is used as the delegation parent. An
instance is then created using this constructor with the default system
class loader as the parameter. The resulting class loader is defined
to be the system class loader. During construction, the class loader
should take great care to avoid calling

getSystemClassLoader()

.
If circular initialization of the system class loader is detected then
an

IllegalStateException

is thrown.

**Returns:**
- The system

ClassLoader

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader
is not

null

and is not the same as or an ancestor of the
system class loader, and the caller does not have the

RuntimePermission

("getClassLoader")
- IllegalStateException

- If invoked recursively during the construction of the class
loader specified by the "

java.system.class.loader

"
property.
- Error

- If the system property "

java.system.class.loader

"
is defined but the named class could not be loaded, the
provider class does not define the required constructor, or an
exception is thrown by that constructor when it is invoked. The
underlying cause of the error can be retrieved via the

Throwable.getCause()

method.

**Implementation Note:**
- The system property to override the system class loader is not
examined until the VM is almost fully initialized. Code that executes
this method during startup should take care not to cache the return
value until the system is fully initialized.

The name of the built-in system class loader is

"app"

.
The system property "

java.class.path

" is read during early
initialization of the VM to determine the class path.
An empty value of "

java.class.path

" property is interpreted
differently depending on whether the initial module (the module
containing the main class) is named or unnamed:
If named, the built-in system class loader will have no class path and
will search for classes and resources using the application module path;
otherwise, if unnamed, it will set the class path to the current
working directory.

Defines a package by

name

in this

ClassLoader

.

Package names

must be unique within a class loader and
cannot be redefined or changed once created.

If a class loader wishes to define a package with specific properties,
such as version information, then the class loader should call this

definePackage

method before calling

defineClass

.
Otherwise, the

defineClass

method will define a package in this class loader corresponding to the package
of the newly defined class; the properties of this defined package are
specified by

Package

.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The

package name
- specTitle

- The specification title
- specVersion

- The specification version
- specVendor

- The specification vendor
- implTitle

- The implementation title
- implVersion

- The implementation version
- implVendor

- The implementation vendor
- sealBase

- If not

null

, then this package is sealed with
respect to the given code source

URL

object. Otherwise, the package is not sealed.

**Returns:**
- The newly defined

Package

object

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if a package of the given

name

is already
defined by this class loader

**See Also:**
- The JAR File Specification: Package Sealing

**Since:**
- 1.2

**API Note:**
- A class loader that wishes to define a package for classes in a JAR
typically uses the specification and implementation titles, versions, and
vendors from the JAR's manifest. If the package is specified as

sealed

in the JAR's manifest,
the

URL

of the JAR file is typically used as the

sealBase

.
If classes of package

'p'

defined by this class loader
are loaded from multiple JARs, the

Package

object may contain
different information depending on the first class of package

'p'

defined and which JAR's manifest is read first to explicitly define
package

'p'

.

It is strongly recommended that a class loader does not call this
method to explicitly define packages in

named modules

; instead,
the package will be automatically defined when a class is

being defined

.
If it is desirable to define

Package

explicitly, it should ensure
that all packages in a named module are defined with the properties
specified by

Package

. Otherwise, some

Package

objects
in a named module may be for example sealed with different seal base.

this method will not find packages defined to the application
class loader.

---

#### protected

Returns all of the

Package

s that have been defined by
this class loader and its ancestors. The returned array may contain
more than one

may delegate to the application class loader. In other words,
packages in modules defined to the application class loader may be
visible to the platform class loader. On the other hand,
the application class loader is not its ancestor and hence
when invoked on the platform class loader, this method will not
return any packages defined to the application class loader.

findLibrary​(
String
libname)

Returns the absolute path name of a native library. The VM invokes this
method to locate the native libraries that belong to classes loaded with
this class loader. If this method returns

#### public void setDefaultAssertionStatus​(boolean enabled)

Sets the default assertion status for this class loader. This setting
determines whether classes loaded by this class loader and initialized
in the future will have assertions enabled or disabled by default.
This setting may be overridden on a per-package or per-class basis by
invoking

setPackageAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

or

setClassAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

.

**Parameters:**
- enabled

-

true

if classes loaded by this class loader will
henceforth have assertions enabled by default,

false

if they will have assertions disabled by default.

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public void setPackageAssertionStatus​(
String
packageName,
boolean enabled)

Sets the package default assertion status for the named package. The
package default assertion status determines the assertion status for
classes initialized in the future that belong to the named package or
any of its "subpackages".

A subpackage of a package named p is any package whose name begins
with "

p.

". For example,

javax.swing.text

is a
subpackage of

javax.swing

, and both

java.util

and

java.lang.reflect

are subpackages of

java

.

In the event that multiple package defaults apply to a given class,
the package default pertaining to the most specific package takes
precedence over the others. For example, if

javax.lang

and

javax.lang.reflect

both have package defaults associated with
them, the latter package default applies to classes in

javax.lang.reflect

.

Package defaults take precedence over the class loader's default
assertion status, and may be overridden on a per-class basis by invoking

setClassAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

.

**Parameters:**
- packageName

- The name of the package whose package default assertion status
is to be set. A

null

value indicates the unnamed
package that is "current"
(see section 7.4.2 of

The Java™ Language Specification

.)
- enabled

-

true

if classes loaded by this classloader and
belonging to the named package or any of its subpackages will
have assertions enabled by default,

false

if they will
have assertions disabled by default.

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public void setClassAssertionStatus​(
String
className,
boolean enabled)

Sets the desired assertion status for the named top-level class in this
class loader and any nested classes contained therein. This setting
takes precedence over the class loader's default assertion status, and
over any applicable per-package default. This method has no effect if
the named class has already been initialized. (Once a class is
initialized, its assertion status cannot change.)

If the named class is not a top-level class, this invocation will
have no effect on the actual assertion status of any class.

**Parameters:**
- className

- The fully qualified class name of the top-level class whose
assertion status is to be set.
- enabled

-

true

if the named class is to have assertions
enabled when (and if) it is initialized,

false

if the
class is to have assertions disabled.

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public void clearAssertionStatus()

Sets the default assertion status for this class loader to

false

and discards any package defaults or class assertion
status settings associated with the class loader. This method is
provided so that class loaders can be made to ignore any command line or
persistent assertion status settings and "start with a clean slate."

**Since:**
- 1.4

#### Class ClassLoader

- java.lang.ClassLoader

java.lang.ClassLoader

**Direct Known Subclasses:** SecureClassLoader

```java
public abstract class
ClassLoader

extends
Object
```

A class loader is an object that is responsible for loading classes. The
class

ClassLoader

is an abstract class. Given the

binary name

of a class, a class loader should attempt to
locate or generate data that constitutes a definition for the class. A
typical strategy is to transform the name into a file name and then read a
"class file" of that name from a file system.

Every

Class

object contains a

reference

to the

ClassLoader

that defined
it.

Class

objects for array classes are not created by class
loaders, but are created automatically as required by the Java runtime.
The class loader for an array class, as returned by

Class.getClassLoader()

is the same as the class loader for its element
type; if the element type is a primitive type, then the array class has no
class loader.

Applications implement subclasses of

ClassLoader

in order to
extend the manner in which the Java virtual machine dynamically loads
classes.

Class loaders may typically be used by security managers to indicate
security domains.

In addition to loading classes, a class loader is also responsible for
locating resources. A resource is some data (a "

.class

" file,
configuration data, or an image for example) that is identified with an
abstract '/'-separated path name. Resources are typically packaged with an
application or library so that they can be located by code in the
application or library. In some cases, the resources are included so that
they can be located by other libraries.

The

ClassLoader

class uses a delegation model to search for
classes and resources. Each instance of

ClassLoader

has an
associated parent class loader. When requested to find a class or
resource, a

ClassLoader

instance will usually delegate the search
for the class or resource to its parent class loader before attempting to
find the class or resource itself.

Class loaders that support concurrent loading of classes are known as

parallel capable

class
loaders and are required to register themselves at their class initialization
time by invoking the

ClassLoader.registerAsParallelCapable

method. Note that the

ClassLoader

class is registered as parallel
capable by default. However, its subclasses still need to register themselves
if they are parallel capable.
In environments in which the delegation model is not strictly
hierarchical, class loaders need to be parallel capable, otherwise class
loading can lead to deadlocks because the loader lock is held for the
duration of the class loading process (see

loadClass

methods).

Run-time Built-in Class Loaders

The Java run-time has the following built-in class loaders:

- Bootstrap class loader.
It is the virtual machine's built-in class loader, typically represented
as

null

, and does not have a parent.
- Platform class loader

.
All

platform classes

are visible to the platform class loader
that can be used as the parent of a

ClassLoader

instance.
Platform classes include Java SE platform APIs, their implementation
classes and JDK-specific run-time classes that are defined by the
platform class loader or its ancestors.

To allow for upgrading/overriding of modules defined to the platform
class loader, and where upgraded modules read modules defined to class
loaders other than the platform class loader and its ancestors, then
the platform class loader may have to delegate to other class loaders,
the application class loader for example.
In other words, classes in named modules defined to class loaders
other than the platform class loader and its ancestors may be visible
to the platform class loader.
- System class loader

.
It is also known as

application class loader

and is distinct
from the platform class loader.
The system class loader is typically used to define classes on the
application class path, module path, and JDK-specific tools.
The platform class loader is a parent or an ancestor of the system class
loader that all platform classes are visible to it.

Normally, the Java virtual machine loads classes from the local file
system in a platform-dependent manner.
However, some classes may not originate from a file; they may originate
from other sources, such as the network, or they could be constructed by an
application. The method

defineClass

converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

. Instances of this newly defined class can be created using

Class.newInstance

.

The methods and constructors of objects created by a class loader may
reference other classes. To determine the class(es) referred to, the Java
virtual machine invokes the

loadClass

method of
the class loader that originally created the class.

For example, an application could create a network class loader to
download class files from a server. Sample code might look like:

```java
ClassLoader loader = new NetworkClassLoader(host, port);
Object main = loader.loadClass("Main", true).newInstance();
. . .
```

The network class loader subclass must define the methods

findClass

and

loadClassData

to load a class
from the network. Once it has downloaded the bytes that make up the class,
it should use the method

defineClass

to
create a class instance. A sample implementation is:

```java
class NetworkClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
String host;
int port;

public Class findClass(String name) {
byte[] b = loadClassData(name);
return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
}

private byte[] loadClassData(String name) {
// load the class data from the connection
. . .
}
}
```

Binary names

Any class name provided as a

String

parameter to methods in

ClassLoader

must be a binary name as defined by

The Java™ Language Specification

.

Examples of valid class names include:

```java
"java.lang.String"
"javax.swing.JSpinner$DefaultEditor"
"java.security.KeyStore$Builder$FileBuilder$1"
"java.net.URLClassLoader$3$1"
```

Any package name provided as a

String

parameter to methods in

ClassLoader

must be either the empty string (denoting an unnamed package)
or a fully qualified name as defined by

The Java™ Language Specification

.

**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** resolveClass(Class)
**See The Java™ Language Specification :** 6.7 Fully Qualified Names, 13.1 The Form of a Binary

public abstract class

ClassLoader

extends

Object

A class loader is an object that is responsible for loading classes. The
class

ClassLoader

is an abstract class. Given the

binary name

of a class, a class loader should attempt to
locate or generate data that constitutes a definition for the class. A
typical strategy is to transform the name into a file name and then read a
"class file" of that name from a file system.

Every

Class

object contains a

reference

to the

ClassLoader

that defined
it.

Class

objects for array classes are not created by class
loaders, but are created automatically as required by the Java runtime.
The class loader for an array class, as returned by

Class.getClassLoader()

is the same as the class loader for its element
type; if the element type is a primitive type, then the array class has no
class loader.

Applications implement subclasses of

ClassLoader

in order to
extend the manner in which the Java virtual machine dynamically loads
classes.

Class loaders may typically be used by security managers to indicate
security domains.

In addition to loading classes, a class loader is also responsible for
locating resources. A resource is some data (a "

.class

" file,
configuration data, or an image for example) that is identified with an
abstract '/'-separated path name. Resources are typically packaged with an
application or library so that they can be located by code in the
application or library. In some cases, the resources are included so that
they can be located by other libraries.

The

ClassLoader

class uses a delegation model to search for
classes and resources. Each instance of

ClassLoader

has an
associated parent class loader. When requested to find a class or
resource, a

ClassLoader

instance will usually delegate the search
for the class or resource to its parent class loader before attempting to
find the class or resource itself.

Class loaders that support concurrent loading of classes are known as

parallel capable

class
loaders and are required to register themselves at their class initialization
time by invoking the

ClassLoader.registerAsParallelCapable

method. Note that the

ClassLoader

class is registered as parallel
capable by default. However, its subclasses still need to register themselves
if they are parallel capable.
In environments in which the delegation model is not strictly
hierarchical, class loaders need to be parallel capable, otherwise class
loading can lead to deadlocks because the loader lock is held for the
duration of the class loading process (see

loadClass

methods).

Run-time Built-in Class Loaders

The Java run-time has the following built-in class loaders:

- Bootstrap class loader.
It is the virtual machine's built-in class loader, typically represented
as

null

, and does not have a parent.
- Platform class loader

.
All

platform classes

are visible to the platform class loader
that can be used as the parent of a

ClassLoader

instance.
Platform classes include Java SE platform APIs, their implementation
classes and JDK-specific run-time classes that are defined by the
platform class loader or its ancestors.

To allow for upgrading/overriding of modules defined to the platform
class loader, and where upgraded modules read modules defined to class
loaders other than the platform class loader and its ancestors, then
the platform class loader may have to delegate to other class loaders,
the application class loader for example.
In other words, classes in named modules defined to class loaders
other than the platform class loader and its ancestors may be visible
to the platform class loader.
- System class loader

.
It is also known as

application class loader

and is distinct
from the platform class loader.
The system class loader is typically used to define classes on the
application class path, module path, and JDK-specific tools.
The platform class loader is a parent or an ancestor of the system class
loader that all platform classes are visible to it.

Normally, the Java virtual machine loads classes from the local file
system in a platform-dependent manner.
However, some classes may not originate from a file; they may originate
from other sources, such as the network, or they could be constructed by an
application. The method

defineClass

converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

. Instances of this newly defined class can be created using

Class.newInstance

.

The methods and constructors of objects created by a class loader may
reference other classes. To determine the class(es) referred to, the Java
virtual machine invokes the

loadClass

method of
the class loader that originally created the class.

For example, an application could create a network class loader to
download class files from a server. Sample code might look like:

```java
ClassLoader loader = new NetworkClassLoader(host, port);
Object main = loader.loadClass("Main", true).newInstance();
. . .
```

The network class loader subclass must define the methods

findClass

and

loadClassData

to load a class
from the network. Once it has downloaded the bytes that make up the class,
it should use the method

defineClass

to
create a class instance. A sample implementation is:

```java
class NetworkClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
String host;
int port;

public Class findClass(String name) {
byte[] b = loadClassData(name);
return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
}

private byte[] loadClassData(String name) {
// load the class data from the connection
. . .
}
}
```

Binary names

Any class name provided as a

String

parameter to methods in

ClassLoader

must be a binary name as defined by

The Java™ Language Specification

.

Examples of valid class names include:

```java
"java.lang.String"
"javax.swing.JSpinner$DefaultEditor"
"java.security.KeyStore$Builder$FileBuilder$1"
"java.net.URLClassLoader$3$1"
```

Any package name provided as a

String

parameter to methods in

ClassLoader

must be either the empty string (denoting an unnamed package)
or a fully qualified name as defined by

The Java™ Language Specification

.

Every

Class

object contains a

reference

to the

ClassLoader

that defined
it.

Class

objects for array classes are not created by class
loaders, but are created automatically as required by the Java runtime.
The class loader for an array class, as returned by

Class.getClassLoader()

is the same as the class loader for its element
type; if the element type is a primitive type, then the array class has no
class loader.

Applications implement subclasses of

ClassLoader

in order to
extend the manner in which the Java virtual machine dynamically loads
classes.

Class loaders may typically be used by security managers to indicate
security domains.

In addition to loading classes, a class loader is also responsible for
locating resources. A resource is some data (a "

.class

" file,
configuration data, or an image for example) that is identified with an
abstract '/'-separated path name. Resources are typically packaged with an
application or library so that they can be located by code in the
application or library. In some cases, the resources are included so that
they can be located by other libraries.

The

ClassLoader

class uses a delegation model to search for
classes and resources. Each instance of

ClassLoader

has an
associated parent class loader. When requested to find a class or
resource, a

ClassLoader

instance will usually delegate the search
for the class or resource to its parent class loader before attempting to
find the class or resource itself.

Class loaders that support concurrent loading of classes are known as

parallel capable

class
loaders and are required to register themselves at their class initialization
time by invoking the

ClassLoader.registerAsParallelCapable

method. Note that the

ClassLoader

class is registered as parallel
capable by default. However, its subclasses still need to register themselves
if they are parallel capable.
In environments in which the delegation model is not strictly
hierarchical, class loaders need to be parallel capable, otherwise class
loading can lead to deadlocks because the loader lock is held for the
duration of the class loading process (see

other than the platform class loader and its ancestors may be visible
to the platform class loader.
- System class loader

.
It is also known as

application class loader

and is distinct
from the platform class loader.
The system class loader is typically used to define classes on the
application class path, module path, and JDK-specific tools.
The platform class loader is a parent or an ancestor of the system class
loader that all platform classes are visible to it.

Normally, the Java virtual machine loads classes from the local file
system in a platform-dependent manner.
However, some classes may not originate from a file; they may originate
from other sources, such as the network, or they could be constructed by an
application. The method

defineClass

converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

. Instances of this newly defined class can be created using

Class.newInstance

.

The methods and constructors of objects created by a class loader may
reference other classes. To determine the class(es) referred to, the Java
virtual machine invokes the

loadClass

method of
the class loader that originally created the class.

For example, an application could create a network class loader to
download class files from a server. Sample code might look like:

```java
ClassLoader loader = new NetworkClassLoader(host, port);
Object main = loader.loadClass("Main", true).newInstance();
. . .
```

The network class loader subclass must define the methods

findClass

and

loadClassData

to load a class
from the network. Once it has downloaded the bytes that make up the class,
it should use the method

defineClass

to
create a class instance. A sample implementation is:

```java
class NetworkClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
String host;
int port;

public Class findClass(String name) {
byte[] b = loadClassData(name);
return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
}

private byte[] loadClassData(String name) {
// load the class data from the connection
. . .
}
}
```

Binary names

Any class name provided as a

String

parameter to methods in

ClassLoader

must be a binary name as defined by

The Java™ Language Specification

.

Examples of valid class names include:

```java
"java.lang.String"
"javax.swing.JSpinner$DefaultEditor"
"java.security.KeyStore$Builder$FileBuilder$1"
"java.net.URLClassLoader$3$1"
```

Any package name provided as a

String

parameter to methods in

ClassLoader

must be either the empty string (denoting an unnamed package)
or a fully qualified name as defined by

The Java™ Language Specification

.

Class loaders that support concurrent loading of classes are known as

parallel capable

class
loaders and are required to register themselves at their class initialization
time by invoking the

ClassLoader.registerAsParallelCapable

method. Note that the

ClassLoader

class is registered as parallel
capable by default. However, its subclasses still need to register themselves
if they are parallel capable.
In environments in which the delegation model is not strictly
hierarchical, class loaders need to be parallel capable, otherwise class
loading can lead to deadlocks because the loader lock is held for the
duration of the class loading process (see

loadClass

methods).

Run-time Built-in Class Loaders

The Java run-time has the following built-in class loaders:

- Bootstrap class loader.
It is the virtual machine's built-in class loader, typically represented
as

null

, and does not have a parent.
- Platform class loader

.
All

platform classes

are visible to the platform class loader
that can be used as the parent of a

ClassLoader

instance.
Platform classes include Java SE platform APIs, their implementation
classes and JDK-specific run-time classes that are defined by the
platform class loader or its ancestors.

To allow for upgrading/overriding of modules defined to the platform
class loader, and where upgraded modules read modules defined to class
loaders other than the platform class loader and its ancestors, then
the platform class loader may have to delegate to other class loaders,
the application class loader for example.
In other words, classes in named modules defined to class loaders
other than the platform class loader and its ancestors may be visible
to the platform class loader.
- System class loader

.
It is also known as

application class loader

and is distinct
from the platform class loader.
The system class loader is typically used to define classes on the
application class path, module path, and JDK-specific tools.
The platform class loader is a parent or an ancestor of the system class
loader that all platform classes are visible to it.

Normally, the Java virtual machine loads classes from the local file
system in a platform-dependent manner.
However, some classes may not originate from a file; they may originate
from other sources, such as the network, or they could be constructed by an
application. The method

defineClass

converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

. Instances of this newly defined class can be created using

Class.newInstance

.

The methods and constructors of objects created by a class loader may
reference other classes. To determine the class(es) referred to, the Java
virtual machine invokes the

loadClass

method of
the class loader that originally created the class.

For example, an application could create a network class loader to
download class files from a server. Sample code might look like:

```java
ClassLoader loader = new NetworkClassLoader(host, port);
Object main = loader.loadClass("Main", true).newInstance();
. . .
```

The network class loader subclass must define the methods

findClass

and

loadClassData

to load a class
from the network. Once it has downloaded the bytes that make up the class,
it should use the method

defineClass

to
create a class instance. A sample implementation is:

```java
class NetworkClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
String host;
int port;

public Class findClass(String name) {
byte[] b = loadClassData(name);
return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
}

private byte[] loadClassData(String name) {
// load the class data from the connection
. . .
}
}
```

Binary names

Any class name provided as a

String

parameter to methods in

ClassLoader

must be a binary name as defined by

The Java™ Language Specification

.

Examples of valid class names include:

```java
"java.lang.String"
"javax.swing.JSpinner$DefaultEditor"
"java.security.KeyStore$Builder$FileBuilder$1"
"java.net.URLClassLoader$3$1"
```

Any package name provided as a

String

parameter to methods in

ClassLoader

must be either the empty string (denoting an unnamed package)
or a fully qualified name as defined by

The Java™ Language Specification

.

#### Methods declared in class java.lang. Object

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- ClassLoader

```java
protected ClassLoader​(
String
name,

ClassLoader
parent)
```

Creates a new class loader of the specified name and using the
specified parent class loader for delegation.

**API Note:** If the parent is specified as

null

(for the
bootstrap class loader) then there is no guarantee that all platform
classes are visible.
**Parameters:** name

- class loader name; or

null

if not named
**Parameters:** parent

- the parent class loader
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the given name is empty.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkCreateClassLoader()

method doesn't allow creation of a new class loader.
**Since:** 9

- ClassLoader

```java
protected ClassLoader​(
ClassLoader
parent)
```

Creates a new class loader using the specified parent class loader for
delegation.

If there is a security manager, its

checkCreateClassLoader

method
is invoked. This may result in a security exception.

**API Note:** If the parent is specified as

null

(for the
bootstrap class loader) then there is no guarantee that all platform
classes are visible.
**Parameters:** parent

- The parent class loader
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

checkCreateClassLoader

method doesn't allow creation
of a new class loader.
**Since:** 1.2

- ClassLoader

```java
protected ClassLoader()
```

Creates a new class loader using the

ClassLoader

returned by
the method

getSystemClassLoader()

as the parent class loader.

If there is a security manager, its

checkCreateClassLoader

method is invoked. This may result in
a security exception.

**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

checkCreateClassLoader

method doesn't allow creation
of a new class loader.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getName

```java
public
String
getName()
```

Returns the name of this class loader or

null

if
this class loader is not named.

**API Note:** This method is non-final for compatibility. If this
method is overridden, this method must return the same name
as specified when this class loader was instantiated.
**Returns:** name of this class loader; or

null

if
this class loader is not named.
**Since:** 9

- loadClass

```java
public
Class
<?> loadClass​(
String
name)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
```

Loads the class with the specified

binary name

.
This method searches for classes in the same manner as the

loadClass(String, boolean)

method. It is invoked by the Java virtual
machine to resolve class references. Invoking this method is equivalent
to invoking

loadClass(name,
false)

.

**Parameters:** name

- The

binary name

of the class
**Returns:** The resulting

Class

object
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the class was not found

- loadClass

```java
protected
Class
<?> loadClass​(
String
name,
boolean resolve)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
```

Loads the class with the specified

binary name

. The
default implementation of this method searches for classes in the
following order:

- Invoke

findLoadedClass(String)

to check if the class
has already been loaded.
- Invoke the

loadClass

method
on the parent class loader. If the parent is

null

the class
loader built into the virtual machine is used, instead.
- Invoke the

findClass(String)

method to find the
class.

If the class was found using the above steps, and the

resolve

flag is true, this method will then invoke the

resolveClass(Class)

method on the resulting

Class

object.

Subclasses of

ClassLoader

are encouraged to override

findClass(String)

, rather than this method.

Unless overridden, this method synchronizes on the result of

getClassLoadingLock

method
during the entire class loading process.

**Parameters:** name

- The

binary name

of the class
**Parameters:** resolve

- If

true

then resolve the class
**Returns:** The resulting

Class

object
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the class could not be found

- getClassLoadingLock

```java
protected
Object
getClassLoadingLock​(
String
className)
```

Returns the lock object for class loading operations.
For backward compatibility, the default implementation of this method
behaves as follows. If this ClassLoader object is registered as
parallel capable, the method returns a dedicated object associated
with the specified class name. Otherwise, the method returns this
ClassLoader object.

**Parameters:** className

- The name of the to-be-loaded class
**Returns:** the lock for class loading operations
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If registered as parallel capable and

className

is null
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** loadClass(String, boolean)

- findClass

```java
protected
Class
<?> findClass​(
String
name)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
```

Finds the class with the specified

binary name

.
This method should be overridden by class loader implementations that
follow the delegation model for loading classes, and will be invoked by
the

loadClass

method after checking the
parent class loader for the requested class.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation throws

ClassNotFoundException

.
**Parameters:** name

- The

binary name

of the class
**Returns:** The resulting

Class

object
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the class could not be found
**Since:** 1.2

- findClass

```java
protected
Class
<?> findClass​(
String
moduleName,

String
name)
```

Finds the class with the given

binary name

in a module defined to this class loader.
Class loader implementations that support loading from modules
should override this method.

**API Note:** This method returns

null

rather than throwing

ClassNotFoundException

if the class could not be found.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation attempts to find the class by
invoking

findClass(String)

when the

moduleName

is

null

. It otherwise returns

null

.
**Parameters:** moduleName

- The module name; or

null

to find the class in the

unnamed module

for this
class loader
**Parameters:** name

- The

binary name

of the class
**Returns:** The resulting

Class

object, or

null

if the class could not be found.
**Since:** 9

- defineClass

```java
@Deprecated
(
since
="1.1")
protected final
Class
<?> defineClass​(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
ClassFormatError
```

Deprecated.

Replaced by

defineClass(String, byte[], int, int)

Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

.
Before the

Class

can be used it must be resolved. This method
is deprecated in favor of the version that takes a

binary name

as its first argument, and is more secure.

**Parameters:** b

- The bytes that make up the class data. The bytes in positions

off

through

off+len-1

should have the format
of a valid class file as defined by

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

.
**Parameters:** off

- The start offset in

b

of the class data
**Parameters:** len

- The length of the class data
**Returns:** The

Class

object that was created from the specified
class data
**Throws:** ClassFormatError

- If the data did not contain a valid class
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If either

off

or

len

is negative, or if

off+len

is greater than

b.length

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If an attempt is made to add this class to a package that
contains classes that were signed by a different set of
certificates than this class, or if an attempt is made
to define a class in a package with a fully-qualified name
that starts with "

java.

".
**See Also:** loadClass(String, boolean)

resolveClass(Class)

- defineClass

```java
protected final
Class
<?> defineClass​(
String
name,
byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
ClassFormatError
```

Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

.
Before the

Class

can be used it must be resolved.

This method assigns a default

ProtectionDomain

to the newly defined class. The

ProtectionDomain

is effectively granted the same set of
permissions returned when

Policy.getPolicy().getPermissions(new CodeSource(null, null))

is invoked. The default protection domain is created on the first invocation
of

defineClass

,
and re-used on subsequent invocations.

To assign a specific

ProtectionDomain

to the class, use
the

defineClass

method that takes a

ProtectionDomain

as one of its arguments.

This method defines a package in this class loader corresponding to the
package of the

Class

(if such a package has not already been defined
in this class loader). The name of the defined package is derived from
the

binary name

of the class specified by
the byte array

b

.
Other properties of the defined package are as specified by

Package

.

**Parameters:** name

- The expected

binary name

of the class, or

null

if not known
**Parameters:** b

- The bytes that make up the class data. The bytes in positions

off

through

off+len-1

should have the format
of a valid class file as defined by

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

.
**Parameters:** off

- The start offset in

b

of the class data
**Parameters:** len

- The length of the class data
**Returns:** The

Class

object that was created from the specified
class data.
**Throws:** ClassFormatError

- If the data did not contain a valid class
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If either

off

or

len

is negative, or if

off+len

is greater than

b.length

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If an attempt is made to add this class to a package that
contains classes that were signed by a different set of
certificates than this class (which is unsigned), or if

name

begins with "

java.

```java
protected final
Class
<?> defineClass​(
String
name,
byte[] b,
int off,
int len,

ProtectionDomain
protectionDomain)
throws
ClassFormatError
```

Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

,
with a given

ProtectionDomain

.

If the given

ProtectionDomain

is

null

,
then a default protection domain will be assigned to the class as specified
in the documentation for

defineClass(String, byte[], int, int)

.
Before the class can be used it must be resolved.

The first class defined in a package determines the exact set of
certificates that all subsequent classes defined in that package must
contain. The set of certificates for a class is obtained from the

CodeSource

within the

ProtectionDomain

of the class. Any classes added to that
package must contain the same set of certificates or a

SecurityException

will be thrown. Note that if

name

is

null

, this check is not performed.
You should always pass in the

binary name

of the
class you are defining as well as the bytes. This ensures that the
class you are defining is indeed the class you think it is.

If the specified

name

begins with "

java.

", it can
only be defined by the

platform class loader

or its ancestors; otherwise

SecurityException

will be thrown. If

name

is not

null

, it must be equal to
the

binary name

of the class
specified by the byte array

b

, otherwise a

NoClassDefFoundError

will be thrown.

This method defines a package in this class loader corresponding to the
package of the

Class

(if such a package has not already been defined
in this class loader). The name of the defined package is derived from
the

binary name

of the class specified by
the byte array

b

.
Other properties of the defined package are as specified by

Package

.

**Parameters:** name

- The expected

binary name

of the class, or

null

if not known
**Parameters:** b

- The bytes that make up the class data. The bytes in positions

off

through

off+len-1

should have the format
of a valid class file as defined by

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

.
**Parameters:** off

- The start offset in

b

of the class data
**Parameters:** len

- The length of the class data
**Parameters:** protectionDomain

- The

ProtectionDomain

of the class
**Returns:** The

Class

object created from the data,
and

ProtectionDomain

.
**Throws:** ClassFormatError

- If the data did not contain a valid class
**Throws:** NoClassDefFoundError

- If

name

is not

null

and not equal to the

binary name

of the class specified by

b
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If either

off

or

len

is negative, or if

off+len

is greater than

b.length

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If an attempt is made to add this class to a package that
contains classes that were signed by a different set of
certificates than this class, or if

name

begins with
"

java.

" and this class loader is not the platform
class loader or its ancestor.

- defineClass

```java
protected final
Class
<?> defineClass​(
String
name,

ByteBuffer
b,

ProtectionDomain
protectionDomain)
throws
ClassFormatError
```

Converts a

ByteBuffer

into an instance
of class

Class

, with the given

ProtectionDomain

.
If the given

ProtectionDomain

is

null

, then a default
protection domain will be assigned to the class as
specified in the documentation for

defineClass(String, byte[],
int, int)

. Before the class can be used it must be resolved.

The rules about the first class defined in a package determining the
set of certificates for the package, the restrictions on class names,
and the defined package of the class
are identical to those specified in the documentation for

defineClass(String, byte[], int, int, ProtectionDomain)

.

An invocation of this method of the form

cl

.defineClass(

name

,

bBuffer

,

pd

)

yields exactly the same
result as the statements

...

byte[] temp = new byte[bBuffer.

remaining

()];

bBuffer.

get

(temp);

return

cl.defineClass

(name, temp, 0,
temp.length, pd);

**Parameters:** name

- The expected

binary name

. of the class, or

null

if not known
**Parameters:** b

- The bytes that make up the class data. The bytes from positions

b.position()

through

b.position() + b.limit() -1

should have the format of a valid class file as defined by

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

.
**Parameters:** protectionDomain

- The

ProtectionDomain

of the class, or

null

.
**Returns:** The

Class

object created from the data,
and

ProtectionDomain

.
**Throws:** ClassFormatError

is not

null

and not equal to the

binary name

of the class specified by

b
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If an attempt is made to add this class to a package that
contains classes that were signed by a different set of
certificates than this class, or if

name

begins with
"

java.

".
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** defineClass(String, byte[], int, int, ProtectionDomain)

- resolveClass

```java
protected final void resolveClass​(
Class
<?> c)
```

Links the specified class. This (misleadingly named) method may be
used by a class loader to link a class. If the class

c

has
already been linked, then this method simply returns. Otherwise, the
class is linked as described in the "Execution" chapter of

The Java™ Language Specification

.

**Parameters:** c

- The class to link
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

c

is

null

.
**See Also:** defineClass(String, byte[], int, int)

- findSystemClass

```java
protected final
Class
<?> findSystemClass​(
String
name)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
```

Finds a class with the specified

binary name

,
loading it if necessary.

This method loads the class through the system class loader (see

getSystemClassLoader()

). The

Class

object returned
might have more than one

ClassLoader

associated with it.
Subclasses of

ClassLoader

need not usually invoke this method,
because most class loaders need to override just

findClass(String)

.

**Parameters:** name

- The

binary name

of the class
**Returns:** The

Class

object for the specified

name
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the class could not be found
**See Also:** ClassLoader(ClassLoader)

,

getParent()

- findLoadedClass

```java
protected final
Class
<?> findLoadedClass​(
String
name)
```

Returns the class with the given

binary name

if this
loader has been recorded by the Java virtual machine as an initiating
loader of a class with that

binary name

. Otherwise

null

is returned.

**Parameters:** name

- The

binary name

of the class
**Returns:** The

Class

object, or

null

if the class has
not been loaded
**Since:** 1.1

- setSigners

```java
protected final void setSigners​(
Class
<?> c,

Object
[] signers)
```

Sets the signers of a class. This should be invoked after defining a
class.

**Parameters:** c

- The

Class

object
**Parameters:** signers

- The signers for the class
**Since:** 1.1

- findResource

```java
protected
URL
findResource​(
String
moduleName,

String
name)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a URL to a resource in a module defined to this class loader.
Class loader implementations that support loading from modules
should override this method.

**API Note:** This method is the basis for the

Class.getResource

,

Class.getResourceAsStream

, and

Module.getResourceAsStream

methods. It is not subject to the rules for
encapsulation specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation attempts to find the resource by
invoking

findResource(String)

when the

moduleName

is

null

. It otherwise returns

null

.
**Parameters:** moduleName

- The module name; or

null

to find a resource in the

unnamed module

for this
class loader
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** A URL to the resource;

null

if the resource could not be
found, a URL could not be constructed to locate the resource,
access to the resource is denied by the security manager, or
there isn't a module of the given name defined to the class
loader.
**Throws:** IOException

- If I/O errors occur
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** ModuleReader.find(String)

- getResource

```java
public
URL
getResource​(
String
name)
```

Finds the resource with the given name. A resource is some data
(images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
that is independent of the location of the code.

The name of a resource is a '

/

'-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).

**API Note:** Where several modules are defined to the same class loader,
and where more than one module contains a resource with the given name,
then the ordering that modules are searched is not specified and may be
very unpredictable.
When overriding this method it is recommended that an implementation
ensures that any delegation is consistent with the

getResources(String)

method.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation will first search the parent class
loader for the resource; if the parent is

null

the path of the
class loader built into the virtual machine is searched. If not found,
this method will invoke

findResource(String)

to find the resource.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** URL

object for reading the resource;

null

if
the resource could not be found, a

URL

could not be
constructed to locate the resource, the resource is in a package
that is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource is
denied by the security manager.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

name

is

null
**Since:** 1.1

- getResources

```java
public
Enumeration
<
URL
> getResources​(
String
name)
throws
IOException
```

Finds all the resources with the given name. A resource is some data
(images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
that is independent of the location of the code.

The name of a resource is a

/

-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).

**API Note:** Where several modules are defined to the same class loader,
and where more than one module contains a resource with the given name,
then the ordering is not specified and may be very unpredictable.
When overriding this method it is recommended that an
implementation ensures that any delegation is consistent with the

getResource(String)

method. This should
ensure that the first element returned by the Enumeration's

nextElement

method is the same resource that the

getResource(String)

method would return.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation will first search the parent class
loader for the resource; if the parent is

null

the path of the
class loader built into the virtual machine is searched. It then
invokes

findResources(String)

to find the resources with the
name in this class loader. It returns an enumeration whose elements
are the URLs found by searching the parent class loader followed by
the elements found with

findResources

.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** An enumeration of

URL

objects for the
resource. If no resources could be found, the enumeration will
be empty. Resources for which a

URL

cannot be
constructed, are in a package that is not opened
unconditionally, or access to the resource is denied by the
security manager, are not returned in the enumeration.

- resources

```java
public
Stream
<
URL
> resources​(
String
name)
```

Returns a stream whose elements are the URLs of all the resources with
the given name. A resource is some data (images, audio, text, etc) that
can be accessed by class code in a way that is independent of the
location of the code.

The name of a resource is a

/

-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

The resources will be located when the returned stream is evaluated.
If the evaluation results in an

IOException

then the I/O
exception is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

that is then
thrown.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).

**API Note:** When overriding this method it is recommended that an
implementation ensures that any delegation is consistent with the

getResource(String)

method. This should
ensure that the first element returned by the stream is the same
resource that the

getResource(String)

method would return.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation invokes

getResources

to find all the resources with the given name and returns
a stream with the elements in the enumeration as the source.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** A stream of resource

URL

objects. If no
resources could be found, the stream will be empty. Resources
for which a

URL

cannot be constructed, are in a package
that is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource
is denied by the security manager, will not be in the stream.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

name

is

null
**Since:** 9

- findResource

```java
protected
URL
findResource​(
String
name)
```

Finds the resource with the given name. Class loader implementations
should override this method.

For resources in named modules then the method must implement the
rules for encapsulation specified in the

Module

getResourceAsStream

method. Additionally,
it must not find non-"

.class

" resources in packages of named
modules unless the package is

opened

unconditionally.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation returns

null

.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** URL

object for reading the resource;

null

if
the resource could not be found, a

URL

could not be
constructed to locate the resource, the resource is in a package
that is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource is
denied by the security manager.
**Since:** 1.2

- findResources

```java
protected
Enumeration
<
URL
> findResources​(
String
name)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an enumeration of

URL

objects
representing all the resources with the given name. Class loader
implementations should override this method.

For resources in named modules then the method must implement the
rules for encapsulation specified in the

Module

getResourceAsStream

method. Additionally,
it must not find non-"

.class

" resources in packages of named
modules unless the package is

opened

unconditionally.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation returns an enumeration that
contains no elements.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** An enumeration of

URL

objects for
the resource. If no resources could be found, the enumeration
will be empty. Resources for which a

URL

cannot be
constructed, are in a package that is not opened unconditionally,
or access to the resource is denied by the security manager,
are not returned in the enumeration.
**Throws:** IOException

- If I/O errors occur
**Since:** 1.2

- registerAsParallelCapable

```java
protected static boolean registerAsParallelCapable()
```

Registers the caller as

parallel capable

.
The registration succeeds if and only if all of the following
conditions are met:

- no instance of the caller has been created
- all of the super classes (except class Object) of the caller are
registered as parallel capable

Note that once a class loader is registered as parallel capable, there
is no way to change it back.

**Returns:** true

if the caller is successfully registered as
parallel capable and

false

if otherwise.
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** isRegisteredAsParallelCapable()

- isRegisteredAsParallelCapable

```java
public final boolean isRegisteredAsParallelCapable()
```

Returns

true

if this class loader is registered as

parallel capable

, otherwise

false

.

**Returns:** true

if this class loader is parallel capable,
otherwise

false

.
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** registerAsParallelCapable()

- getSystemResource

```java
public static
URL
getSystemResource​(
String
name)
```

Find a resource of the specified name from the search path used to load
classes. This method locates the resource through the system class
loader (see

getSystemClassLoader()

).

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally.

**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** A

URL

to the resource;

null

if the resource could not be found, a URL could not be
constructed to locate the resource, the resource is in a package
that is not opened unconditionally or access to the resource is
denied by the security manager.
**Since:** 1.1

- getSystemResources

```java
public static
Enumeration
<
URL
> getSystemResources​(
String
name)
throws
IOException
```

Finds all resources of the specified name from the search path used to
load classes. The resources thus found are returned as an

Enumeration

of

URL

objects.

The search order is described in the documentation for

getSystemResource(String)

.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally.

**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** An enumeration of

URL

objects for
the resource. If no resources could be found, the enumeration
will be empty. Resources for which a

URL

cannot be
constructed, are in a package that is not opened unconditionally,
or access to the resource is denied by the security manager,
are not returned in the enumeration.
**Throws:** IOException

- If I/O errors occur
**Since:** 1.2

- getResourceAsStream

```java
public
InputStream
getResourceAsStream​(
String
name)
```

Returns an input stream for reading the specified resource.

**Since:** 1.1

- getSystemResourceAsStream

```java
public static
InputStream
getSystemResourceAsStream​(
String
name)
```

Open for reading, a resource of the specified name from the search path
used to load classes. This method locates the resource through the
system class loader (see

getSystemClassLoader()

).

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally.

**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** An input stream for reading the resource;

null

if the
resource could not be found, the resource is in a package that
is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource is
denied by the security manager.
**Since:** 1.1

- getParent

```java
public final
ClassLoader
getParent()
```

Returns the parent class loader for delegation. Some implementations may
use

null

to represent the bootstrap class loader. This method
will return

null

in such implementations if this class loader's
parent is the bootstrap class loader.

**Returns:** The parent

ClassLoader
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader
is not

null

and is not an ancestor of this class loader,
and the caller does not have the

RuntimePermission

("getClassLoader")
**Since:** 1.2

- getUnnamedModule

```java
public final
Module
getUnnamedModule()
```

Returns the unnamed

Module

for this class loader.

**Returns:** The unnamed Module for this class loader
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** Module.isNamed()

- getPlatformClassLoader

```java
public static
ClassLoader
getPlatformClassLoader()
```

Returns the platform class loader. All

platform classes

are visible to
the platform class loader.

**Implementation Note:** The name of the builtin platform class loader is

"platform"

.
**Returns:** The platform

ClassLoader

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader is
not

null

, and the caller's class loader is not the same
as or an ancestor of the platform class loader,
and the caller does not have the

RuntimePermission

("getClassLoader")
**Since:** 9

- getSystemClassLoader

```java
public static
ClassLoader
getSystemClassLoader()
```

Returns the system class loader. This is the default
delegation parent for new

ClassLoader

instances, and is
typically the class loader used to start the application.

This method is first invoked early in the runtime's startup
sequence, at which point it creates the system class loader. This
class loader will be the context class loader for the main application
thread (for example, the thread that invokes the

main

method of
the main class).

The default system class loader is an implementation-dependent
instance of this class.

If the system property "

java.system.class.loader

" is defined
when this method is first invoked then the value of that property is
taken to be the name of a class that will be returned as the system
class loader. The class is loaded using the default system class loader
and must define a public constructor that takes a single parameter of
type

ClassLoader

which is used as the delegation parent. An
instance is then created using this constructor with the default system
class loader as the parameter. The resulting class loader is defined
to be the system class loader. During construction, the class loader
should take great care to avoid calling

getSystemClassLoader()

.
If circular initialization of the system class loader is detected then
an

IllegalStateException

is thrown.

**Implementation Note:** The system property to override the system class loader is not
examined until the VM is almost fully initialized. Code that executes
this method during startup should take care not to cache the return
value until the system is fully initialized.

The name of the built-in system class loader is

"app"

.
The system property "

java.class.path

" is read during early
initialization of the VM to determine the class path.
An empty value of "

java.class.path

" property is interpreted
differently depending on whether the initial module (the module
containing the main class) is named or unnamed:
If named, the built-in system class loader will have no class path and
will search for classes and resources using the application module path;
otherwise, if unnamed, it will set the class path to the current
working directory.
**Returns:** The system

ClassLoader
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader
is not

null

and is not the same as or an ancestor of the
system class loader, and the caller does not have the

RuntimePermission

("getClassLoader")
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If invoked recursively during the construction of the class
loader specified by the "

java.system.class.loader

"
property.
**Throws:** Error

- If the system property "

java.system.class.loader

"
is defined but the named class could not be loaded, the
provider class does not define the required constructor, or an
exception is thrown by that constructor when it is invoked. The
underlying cause of the error can be retrieved via the

Throwable.getCause()

method.

- definePackage

```java
protected
Package
definePackage​(
String
name,

String
specTitle,

String
specVersion,

String
specVendor,

String
implTitle,

String
implVersion,

String
implVendor,

URL
sealBase)
```

Defines a package by

name

in this

ClassLoader

.

Package names

must be unique within a class loader and
cannot be redefined or changed once created.

If a class loader wishes to define a package with specific properties,
such as version information, then the class loader should call this

definePackage

method before calling

defineClass

.
Otherwise, the

defineClass

method will define a package in this class loader corresponding to the package
of the newly defined class; the properties of this defined package are
specified by

Package

.

**API Note:** A class loader that wishes to define a package for classes in a JAR
typically uses the specification and implementation titles, versions, and
vendors from the JAR's manifest. If the package is specified as

sealed

in the JAR's manifest,
the

URL

of the JAR file is typically used as the

sealBase

.
If classes of package

'p'

defined by this class loader
are loaded from multiple JARs, the

Package

object may contain
different information depending on the first class of package

'p'

defined and which JAR's manifest is read first to explicitly define
package

'p'

.

It is strongly recommended that a class loader does not call this
method to explicitly define packages in

named modules

; instead,
the package will be automatically defined when a class is

being defined

.
If it is desirable to define

Package

explicitly, it should ensure
that all packages in a named module are defined with the properties
specified by

Package

. Otherwise, some

Package

objects
in a named module may be for example sealed with different seal base.
**Parameters:** name

- The

package name
**Parameters:** specTitle

- The specification title
**Parameters:** specVersion

- The specification version
**Parameters:** specVendor

- The specification vendor
**Parameters:** implTitle

- The implementation title
**Parameters:** implVersion

- The implementation version
**Parameters:** implVendor

- The implementation vendor
**Parameters:** sealBase

- If not

null

, then this package is sealed with
respect to the given code source

URL

object. Otherwise, the package is not sealed.
**Returns:** The newly defined

Package

object
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a package of the given

name

is already
defined by this class loader

**See The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification :** 5.3 Run-time package

- getDefinedPackage

```java
public final
Package
getDefinedPackage​(
String
name)
```

Returns a

Package

of the given

name

that
has been defined by this class loader.

**Parameters:** name

- The

package name
**Returns:** The

Package

of the given name that has been defined
by this class loader, or

null

if not found
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
**Since:** 9
**See The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification :** 5.3 Run-time package

- getDefinedPackages

```java
public final
Package
[] getDefinedPackages()
```

Returns all of the

Package

s that have been defined by
this class loader. The returned array has no duplicated

Package

s
of the same name.

**API Note:** This method returns an array rather than a

Set

or

Stream

for consistency with the existing

getPackages()

method.
**Returns:** The array of

Package

objects that have been defined by
this class loader; or an zero length array if no package has been
defined by this class loader.
**Since:** 9
**See The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification :** 5.3 Run-time package

- getPackage

```java
@Deprecated
(
since
="9")
protected
Package
getPackage​(
String
name)
```

Deprecated.

If multiple class loaders delegate to each other and define classes
with the same package name, and one such loader relies on the lookup
behavior of

getPackage

to return a

Package

from
a parent loader, then the properties exposed by the

Package

may not be as expected in the rest of the program.
For example, the

Package

will only expose annotations from the

package-info.class

file defined by the parent loader, even if
annotations exist in a

package-info.class

file defined by
a child loader. A more robust approach is to use the

getDefinedPackage(java.lang.String)

method which returns
a

Package

for the specified class loader.

Finds a package by

name

in this class loader and its ancestors.

If this class loader defines a

Package

of the given name,
the

Package

is returned. Otherwise, the ancestors of
this class loader are searched recursively (parent by parent)
for a

Package

of the given name.

**API Note:** The

platform class loader

may delegate to the application class loader but the application class
loader is not its ancestor. When invoked on the platform class loader,
this method will not find packages defined to the application
class loader.
**Parameters:** name

- The

package name
**Returns:** The

Package

of the given name that has been defined by
this class loader or its ancestors, or

null

if not found.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** getDefinedPackage(String)

- getPackages

```java
protected
Package
[] getPackages()
```

Returns all of the

Package

s that have been defined by
this class loader and its ancestors. The returned array may contain
more than one

Package

object of the same package name, each
defined by a different class loader in the class loader hierarchy.

**API Note:** The

platform class loader

may delegate to the application class loader. In other words,
packages in modules defined to the application class loader may be
visible to the platform class loader. On the other hand,
the application class loader is not its ancestor and hence
when invoked on the platform class loader, this method will not
return any packages defined to the application class loader.
**Returns:** The array of

Package

objects that have been defined by
this class loader and its ancestors
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** getDefinedPackages()

- findLibrary

```java
protected
String
findLibrary​(
String
libname)
```

Returns the absolute path name of a native library. The VM invokes this
method to locate the native libraries that belong to classes loaded with
this class loader. If this method returns

null

, the VM
searches the library along the path specified as the
"

java.library.path

" property.

**Parameters:** libname

- The library name
**Returns:** The absolute path of the native library
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** System.loadLibrary(String)

,

System.mapLibraryName(String)

- setDefaultAssertionStatus

```java
public void setDefaultAssertionStatus​(boolean enabled)
```

Sets the default assertion status for this class loader. This setting
determines whether classes loaded by this class loader and initialized
in the future will have assertions enabled or disabled by default.
This setting may be overridden on a per-package or per-class basis by
invoking

setPackageAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

or

setClassAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

.

**Parameters:** enabled

-

true

if classes loaded by this class loader will
henceforth have assertions enabled by default,

false

if they will have assertions disabled by default.
**Since:** 1.4

- setPackageAssertionStatus

```java
public void setPackageAssertionStatus​(
String
packageName,
boolean enabled)
```

Sets the package default assertion status for the named package. The
package default assertion status determines the assertion status for
classes initialized in the future that belong to the named package or
any of its "subpackages".

A subpackage of a package named p is any package whose name begins
with "

p.

". For example,

javax.swing.text

is a
subpackage of

javax.swing

, and both

java.util

and

java.lang.reflect

are subpackages of

java

.

In the event that multiple package defaults apply to a given class,
the package default pertaining to the most specific package takes
precedence over the others. For example, if

javax.lang

and

javax.lang.reflect

both have package defaults associated with
them, the latter package default applies to classes in

javax.lang.reflect

.

Package defaults take precedence over the class loader's default
assertion status, and may be overridden on a per-class basis by invoking

setClassAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

.

**Parameters:** packageName

- The name of the package whose package default assertion status
is to be set. A

null

value indicates the unnamed
package that is "current"
(see section 7.4.2 of

The Java™ Language Specification

.)
**Parameters:** enabled

-

true

if classes loaded by this classloader and
belonging to the named package or any of its subpackages will
have assertions enabled by default,

false

if they will
have assertions disabled by default.
**Since:** 1.4

- setClassAssertionStatus

```java
public void setClassAssertionStatus​(
String
className,
boolean enabled)
```

Sets the desired assertion status for the named top-level class in this
class loader and any nested classes contained therein. This setting
takes precedence over the class loader's default assertion status, and
over any applicable per-package default. This method has no effect if
the named class has already been initialized. (Once a class is
initialized, its assertion status cannot change.)

If the named class is not a top-level class, this invocation will
have no effect on the actual assertion status of any class.

**Parameters:** className

- The fully qualified class name of the top-level class whose
assertion status is to be set.
**Parameters:** enabled

-

true

if the named class is to have assertions
enabled when (and if) it is initialized,

false

if the
class is to have assertions disabled.
**Since:** 1.4

- clearAssertionStatus

```java
public void clearAssertionStatus()
```

Sets the default assertion status for this class loader to

false

and discards any package defaults or class assertion
status settings associated with the class loader. This method is
provided so that class loaders can be made to ignore any command line or
persistent assertion status settings and "start with a clean slate."

**Since:** 1.4

Method Detail

- getName

```java
public
String
getName()
```

Returns the name of this class loader or

null

if
this class loader is not named.

**API Note:** This method is non-final for compatibility. If this
method is overridden, this method must return the same name
as specified when this class loader was instantiated.
**Returns:** name of this class loader; or

null

if
this class loader is not named.
**Since:** 9

- loadClass

```java
public
Class
<?> loadClass​(
String
name)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
```

Loads the class with the specified

binary name

.
This method searches for classes in the same manner as the

loadClass(String, boolean)

method. It is invoked by the Java virtual
machine to resolve class references. Invoking this method is equivalent
to invoking

loadClass(name,
false)

.

**Parameters:** name

- The

binary name

of the class
**Returns:** The resulting

Class

object
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the class was not found

- loadClass

```java
protected
Class
<?> loadClass​(
String
name,
boolean resolve)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
```

Loads the class with the specified

binary name

. The
default implementation of this method searches for classes in the
following order:

- Invoke

findLoadedClass(String)

to check if the class
has already been loaded.
- Invoke the

loadClass

method
on the parent class loader. If the parent is

null

the class
loader built into the virtual machine is used, instead.
- Invoke the

findClass(String)

method to find the
class.

If the class was found using the above steps, and the

resolve

flag is true, this method will then invoke the

resolveClass(Class)

method on the resulting

Class

object.

Subclasses of

ClassLoader

are encouraged to override

findClass(String)

, rather than this method.

Unless overridden, this method synchronizes on the result of

getClassLoadingLock

method
during the entire class loading process.

**Parameters:** name

- The

binary name

of the class
**Parameters:** resolve

- If

true

then resolve the class
**Returns:** The resulting

Class

object
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the class could not be found

- getClassLoadingLock

```java
protected
Object
getClassLoadingLock​(
String
className)
```

Returns the lock object for class loading operations.
For backward compatibility, the default implementation of this method
behaves as follows. If this ClassLoader object is registered as
parallel capable, the method returns a dedicated object associated
with the specified class name. Otherwise, the method returns this
ClassLoader object.

**Parameters:** className

- The name of the to-be-loaded class
**Returns:** the lock for class loading operations
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If registered as parallel capable and

className

is null
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** loadClass(String, boolean)

- findClass

```java
protected
Class
<?> findClass​(
String
name)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
```

Finds the class with the specified

binary name

.
This method should be overridden by class loader implementations that
follow the delegation model for loading classes, and will be invoked by
the

loadClass

method after checking the
parent class loader for the requested class.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation throws

ClassNotFoundException

.
**Parameters:** name

- The

binary name

of the class
**Returns:** The resulting

Class

object
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the class could not be found
**Since:** 1.2

- findClass

```java
protected
Class
<?> findClass​(
String
moduleName,

String
name)
```

Finds the class with the given

binary name

in a module defined to this class loader.
Class loader implementations that support loading from modules
should override this method.

**API Note:** This method returns

null

rather than throwing

ClassNotFoundException

if the class could not be found.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation attempts to find the class by
invoking

findClass(String)

when the

moduleName

is

null

. It otherwise returns

null

.
**Parameters:** moduleName

- The module name; or

null

to find the class in the

unnamed module

for this
class loader
**Parameters:** name

- The

binary name

of the class

can be used it must be resolved.

This method assigns a default

ProtectionDomain

to the newly defined class. The

ProtectionDomain

is effectively granted the same set of
permissions returned when

Policy.getPolicy().getPermissions(new CodeSource(null, null))

is invoked. The default protection domain is created on the first invocation
of

defineClass

,
and re-used on subsequent invocations.

To assign a specific

ProtectionDomain

to the class, use
the

defineClass

method that takes a

ProtectionDomain

as one of its arguments.

This method defines a package in this class loader corresponding to the
package of the

Class

(if such a package has not already been defined
in this class loader). The name of the defined package is derived from
the

binary name

of the class specified by
the byte array

b

.
Other properties of the defined package are as specified by

Package

.

**Parameters:** name

- The expected

binary name

of the class, or

null

if not known

```

Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class

Class

,
with a given

ProtectionDomain

.

If the given

ProtectionDomain

is

null

,
then a default protection domain will be assigned to the class as specified
in the documentation for

defineClass(String, byte[], int, int)

.
Before the class can be used it must be resolved.

The first class defined in a package determines the exact set of
certificates that all subsequent classes defined in that package must
contain. The set of certificates for a class is obtained from the

CodeSource

within the

ProtectionDomain

of the class. Any classes added to that
package must contain the same set of certificates or a

SecurityException

will be thrown. Note that if

name

is

null

, this check is not performed.
You should always pass in the

binary name

of the
class you are defining as well as the bytes. This ensures that the
class you are defining is indeed the class you think it is.

If the specified

name

begins with "

java.

", it can
only be defined by the

platform class loader

or its ancestors; otherwise

SecurityException

will be thrown. If

name

is not

null

, it must be equal to
the

binary name

of the class
specified by the byte array

b

, otherwise a

NoClassDefFoundError

will be thrown.

This method defines a package in this class loader corresponding to the

- resolveClass

```java
protected final void resolveClass​(
Class
<?> c)
```

Links the specified class. This (misleadingly named) method may be
used by a class loader to link a class. If the class

c

has
already been linked, then this method simply returns. Otherwise, the
class is linked as described in the "Execution" chapter of

The Java™ Language Specification

.

**Parameters:** c

- The class to link
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

```java
protected final
Class
<?> findSystemClass​(
String
name)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
```

Finds a class with the specified

binary name

,
loading it if necessary.

This method loads the class through the system class loader (see

getSystemClassLoader()

). The

Class

object returned
might have more than one

ClassLoader

associated with it.
Subclasses of

- The

binary name

of the class
**Returns:** The

Class

object for the specified

name
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- If the class could not be found

,

getParent()

- findLoadedClass

```java
protected final
Class
<?> findLoadedClass​(
String
name)
```

Returns the class with the given

binary name

if this
loader has been recorded by the Java virtual machine as an initiating
loader of a class with that

binary name

. Otherwise

- The

Class

object
**Parameters:** signers

- The signers for the class
**Since:** 1.1

- findResource

```java
protected
URL
findResource​(
String
moduleName,

String
name)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a URL to a resource in a module defined to this class loader.
Class loader implementations that support loading from modules
should override this method.

**API Note:** This method is the basis for the

Class.getResource

,

Class.getResourceAsStream

, and

Module.getResourceAsStream

methods. It is not subject to the rules for
encapsulation specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation attempts to find the resource by
invoking

findResource(String)

when the

moduleName

is

null

. It otherwise returns

null

.
**Parameters:** moduleName

- The module name; or

null

to find a resource in the

unnamed module

for this
class loader
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** A URL to the resource;

null

if the resource could not be
found, a URL could not be constructed to locate the resource,
access to the resource is denied by the security manager, or
there isn't a module of the given name defined to the class
loader.
**Throws:** IOException

- If I/O errors occur
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** ModuleReader.find(String)

- getResource

```java
public
URL
getResource​(
String
name)
```

Finds the resource with the given name. A resource is some data
(images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
that is independent of the location of the code.

The name of a resource is a '

/

'-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).

**API Note:** Where several modules are defined to the same class loader,
and where more than one module contains a resource with the given name,
then the ordering that modules are searched is not specified and may be
very unpredictable.
When overriding this method it is recommended that an implementation
ensures that any delegation is consistent with the

getResources(String)

method.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation will first search the parent class
loader for the resource; if the parent is

null

the path of the
class loader built into the virtual machine is searched. If not found,
this method will invoke

findResource(String)

to find the resource.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** URL

object for reading the resource;

null

if
the resource could not be found, a

URL

could not be
constructed to locate the resource, the resource is in a package
that is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource is
denied by the security manager.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

name

is

null
**Since:** 1.1

- getResources

```java
public
Enumeration
<
URL
> getResources​(
String
name)
throws
IOException
```

Finds all the resources with the given name. A resource is some data
(images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
that is independent of the location of the code.

The name of a resource is a

/

-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).

**API Note:** Where several modules are defined to the same class loader,
and where more than one module contains a resource with the given name,
then the ordering is not specified and may be very unpredictable.
When overriding this method it is recommended that an
implementation ensures that any delegation is consistent with the

getResource(String)

method. This should
ensure that the first element returned by the Enumeration's

nextElement

method is the same resource that the

getResource(String)

method would return.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation will first search the parent class
loader for the resource; if the parent is

null

the path of the
class loader built into the virtual machine is searched. It then
invokes

findResources(String)

to find the resources with the
name in this class loader. It returns an enumeration whose elements
are the URLs found by searching the parent class loader followed by
the elements found with

findResources

.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** An enumeration of

URL

objects for the
resource. If no resources could be found, the enumeration will
be empty. Resources for which a

URL

cannot be
constructed, are in a package that is not opened
unconditionally, or access to the resource is denied by the
security manager, are not returned in the enumeration.
**Throws:** IOException

- If I/O errors occur
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

name

is

null
**Since:** 1.2

- resources

```java
public
Stream
<
URL
> resources​(
String
name)
```

Returns a stream whose elements are the URLs of all the resources with
the given name. A resource is some data (images, audio, text, etc) that
can be accessed by class code in a way that is independent of the
location of the code.

The name of a resource is a

/

-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

The resources will be located when the returned stream is evaluated.
If the evaluation results in an

IOException

then the I/O
exception is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

that is then
thrown.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).

**API Note:** When overriding this method it is recommended that an
implementation ensures that any delegation is consistent with the

getResource(String)

method. This should
ensure that the first element returned by the stream is the same
resource that the

getResource(String)

method would return.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation invokes

getResources

to find all the resources with the given name and returns
a stream with the elements in the enumeration as the source.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** A stream of resource

URL

objects. If no
resources could be found, the stream will be empty. Resources
for which a

URL

cannot be constructed, are in a package
that is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource
is denied by the security manager, will not be in the stream.

- If

name

is

null
**Since:** 9

- findResource

```java
protected
URL
findResource​(
String
name)
```

" resources in packages of named
modules unless the package is

opened

unconditionally.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation returns

null

.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** URL

object for reading the resource;

null

if
the resource could not be found, a

URL

could not be
constructed to locate the resource, the resource is in a package
that is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource is
denied by the security manager.

it must not find non-"

.class

" resources in packages of named
modules unless the package is

opened

unconditionally.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation returns an enumeration that
contains no elements.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** An enumeration of

URL

objects for
the resource. If no resources could be found, the enumeration
will be empty. Resources for which a

URL

cannot be

method of
the main class).

The default system class loader is an implementation-dependent
instance of this class.

If the system property "

java.system.class.loader

" is defined
when this method is first invoked then the value of that property is
taken to be the name of a class that will be returned as the system
class loader. The class is loaded using the default system class loader
and must define a public constructor that takes a single parameter of
type

ClassLoader

which is used as the delegation parent. An
instance is then created using this constructor with the default system
class loader as the parameter. The resulting class loader is defined
to be the system class loader. During construction, the class loader
should take great care to avoid calling

getSystemClassLoader()

.
If circular initialization of the system class loader is detected then
an

IllegalStateException

is thrown.

**Implementation Note:** The system property to override the system class loader is not
examined until the VM is almost fully initialized. Code that executes
this method during startup should take care not to cache the return
value until the system is fully initialized.

The name of the built-in system class loader is

"app"

.
The system property "

java.class.path

" is read during early
initialization of the VM to determine the class path.
An empty value of "

java.class.path

" property is interpreted
differently depending on whether the initial module (the module
containing the main class) is named or unnamed:
If named, the built-in system class loader will have no class path and
will search for classes and resources using the application module path;
otherwise, if unnamed, it will set the class path to the current
working directory.
**Returns:** The system

ClassLoader
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader
is not

null

and is not the same as or an ancestor of the
system class loader, and the caller does not have the

RuntimePermission

("getClassLoader")
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If invoked recursively during the construction of the class
loader specified by the "

java.system.class.loader

"
property.
**Throws:** Error

- If the system property "

java.system.class.loader

"
is defined but the named class could not be loaded, the
provider class does not define the required constructor, or an
exception is thrown by that constructor when it is invoked. The
underlying cause of the error can be retrieved via the

Throwable.getCause()

method.

- definePackage

```java
protected
Package
definePackage​(
String
name,

String
specTitle,

String
specVersion,

String
specVendor,

String
implTitle,

String
implVersion,

String
implVendor,

URL
sealBase)
```

Defines a package by

name

in this

ClassLoader

.

Package names

must be unique within a class loader and
cannot be redefined or changed once created.

If a class loader wishes to define a package with specific properties,
such as version information, then the class loader should call this

definePackage

method before calling

defineClass

.
Otherwise, the

defineClass

method will define a package in this class loader corresponding to the package
of the newly defined class; the properties of this defined package are
specified by

Package

.

**API Note:** A class loader that wishes to define a package for classes in a JAR
typically uses the specification and implementation titles, versions, and
vendors from the JAR's manifest. If the package is specified as

sealed

in the JAR's manifest,
the

URL

of the JAR file is typically used as the

sealBase

.
If classes of package

'p'

defined by this class loader
are loaded from multiple JARs, the

Package

object may contain
different information depending on the first class of package

'p'

defined and which JAR's manifest is read first to explicitly define
package

'p'

.

It is strongly recommended that a class loader does not call this
method to explicitly define packages in

named modules

; instead,
the package will be automatically defined when a class is

being defined

.
If it is desirable to define

Package

explicitly, it should ensure
that all packages in a named module are defined with the properties
specified by

Package

. Otherwise, some

Package

objects
in a named module may be for example sealed with different seal base.
**Parameters:** name

- The

package name
**Parameters:** specTitle

- The specification title
**Parameters:** specVersion

- The specification version
**Parameters:** specVendor

- The specification vendor
**Parameters:** implTitle

- The implementation title
**Parameters:** implVersion

- The implementation version
**Parameters:** implVendor

- The implementation vendor
**Parameters:** sealBase

- If not

null

, then this package is sealed with
respect to the given code source

URL

object. Otherwise, the package is not sealed.
**Returns:** The newly defined

Package

object
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a package of the given

name

is already
defined by this class loader

- getDefinedPackage

```java
public final
Package
getDefinedPackage​(
String
name)
```

Returns a

Package

of the given

name

that
has been defined by this class loader.

**Parameters:** name

- The

package name
**Returns:** The

Package

of the given name that has been defined
by this class loader, or

null

if not found
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
**Since:** 9
**See The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification :** 5.3 Run-time package

- getDefinedPackages

```java
public final
Package
[] getDefinedPackages()
```

Returns all of the

Package

s that have been defined by
this class loader. The returned array has no duplicated

Package

s
of the same name.

**API Note:** This method returns an array rather than a

Set

or

Stream

for consistency with the existing

getPackages()

method.
**Returns:** The array of

Package

objects that have been defined by
this class loader; or an zero length array if no package has been
defined by this class loader.
**Since:** 9
**See The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification :** 5.3 Run-time package

- getPackage

```java
@Deprecated
(
since
="9")
protected
Package
getPackage​(
String
name)
```

Deprecated.

If multiple class loaders delegate to each other and define classes
with the same package name, and one such loader relies on the lookup
behavior of

getPackage

to return a

Package

from
a parent loader, then the properties exposed by the

Package

may not be as expected in the rest of the program.
For example, the

Package

will only expose annotations from the

package-info.class

file defined by the parent loader, even if
annotations exist in a

package-info.class

file defined by
a child loader. A more robust approach is to use the

getDefinedPackage(java.lang.String)

method which returns
a

Package

for the specified class loader.

Finds a package by

name

in this class loader and its ancestors.

If this class loader defines a

Package

of the given name,
the

Package

is returned. Otherwise, the ancestors of
this class loader are searched recursively (parent by parent)
for a

Package

of the given name.

**API Note:** The

platform class loader

may delegate to the application class loader but the application class
loader is not its ancestor. When invoked on the platform class loader,
this method will not find packages defined to the application
class loader.
**Parameters:** name

- The

package name
**Returns:** The

Package

of the given name that has been defined by
this class loader or its ancestors, or

null

if not found.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** getDefinedPackage(String)

- getPackages

```java
protected
Package
[] getPackages()
```

Returns all of the

Package

s that have been defined by
this class loader and its ancestors. The returned array may contain
more than one

Package

object of the same package name, each
defined by a different class loader in the class loader hierarchy.

**API Note:** The

platform class loader

may delegate to the application class loader. In other words,
packages in modules defined to the application class loader may be
visible to the platform class loader. On the other hand,
the application class loader is not its ancestor and hence
when invoked on the platform class loader, this method will not
return any packages defined to the application class loader.
**Returns:** The array of

Package

objects that have been defined by
this class loader and its ancestors
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** getDefinedPackages()

- findLibrary

```java
protected
String
findLibrary​(
String
libname)
```

Returns the absolute path name of a native library. The VM invokes this
method to locate the native libraries that belong to classes loaded with
this class loader. If this method returns

null

, the VM
searches the library along the path specified as the
"

java.library.path

" property.

**Parameters:** libname

- The library name
**Returns:** The absolute path of the native library
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** System.loadLibrary(String)

,

System.mapLibraryName(String)

- setDefaultAssertionStatus

```java
public void setDefaultAssertionStatus​(boolean enabled)
```

Sets the default assertion status for this class loader. This setting
determines whether classes loaded by this class loader and initialized
in the future will have assertions enabled or disabled by default.
This setting may be overridden on a per-package or per-class basis by
invoking

setPackageAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

or

setClassAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

.

**Parameters:** enabled

-

true

if classes loaded by this class loader will
henceforth have assertions enabled by default,

false

if they will have assertions disabled by default.
**Since:** 1.4

- setPackageAssertionStatus

```java
public void setPackageAssertionStatus​(
String
packageName,
boolean enabled)
```

Sets the package default assertion status for the named package. The
package default assertion status determines the assertion status for
classes initialized in the future that belong to the named package or
any of its "subpackages".

A subpackage of a package named p is any package whose name begins
with "

p.

". For example,

javax.swing.text

is a
subpackage of

javax.swing

, and both

java.util

and

java.lang.reflect

are subpackages of

java

.

In the event that multiple package defaults apply to a given class,
the package default pertaining to the most specific package takes
precedence over the others. For example, if

javax.lang

and

javax.lang.reflect

both have package defaults associated with
them, the latter package default applies to classes in

javax.lang.reflect

.

Package defaults take precedence over the class loader's default
assertion status, and may be overridden on a per-class basis by invoking

setClassAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

.

**Parameters:** packageName

- The name of the package whose package default assertion status
is to be set. A

null

value indicates the unnamed
package that is "current"
(see section 7.4.2 of

The Java™ Language Specification

.)
**Parameters:** enabled

-

true

if classes loaded by this classloader and
belonging to the named package or any of its subpackages will
have assertions enabled by default,

false

if they will
have assertions disabled by default.
**Since:** 1.4

- setClassAssertionStatus

```java
public void setClassAssertionStatus​(
String
className,
boolean enabled)
```

Sets the desired assertion status for the named top-level class in this
class loader and any nested classes contained therein. This setting
takes precedence over the class loader's default assertion status, and
over any applicable per-package default. This method has no effect if
the named class has already been initialized. (Once a class is
initialized, its assertion status cannot change.)

If the named class is not a top-level class, this invocation will
have no effect on the actual assertion status of any class.

**Parameters:** className

- The fully qualified class name of the top-level class whose
assertion status is to be set.
**Parameters:** enabled

-

true

if the named class is to have assertions
enabled when (and if) it is initialized,

false

if the
class is to have assertions disabled.
**Since:** 1.4

- clearAssertionStatus

```java
public void clearAssertionStatus()
```

Sets the default assertion status for this class loader to

false

and discards any package defaults or class assertion
status settings associated with the class loader. This method is
provided so that class loaders can be made to ignore any command line or
persistent assertion status settings and "start with a clean slate."

**Since:** 1.4

loadClass

method
on the parent class loader. If the parent is

null

the class
loader built into the virtual machine is used, instead.
- Invoke the

findClass(String)

method to find the
class.

If the class was found using the above steps, and the

resolve

flag is true, this method will then invoke the

resolveClass(Class)

method on the resulting

Class

object.

Subclasses of

ClassLoader

are encouraged to override

findClass(String)

, rather than this method.

```

Returns the lock object for class loading operations.
For backward compatibility, the default implementation of this method
behaves as follows. If this ClassLoader object is registered as
parallel capable, the method returns a dedicated object associated
with the specified class name. Otherwise, the method returns this
ClassLoader object.

**Parameters:** className

- The name of the to-be-loaded class
**Returns:** the lock for class loading operations
**Throws:** NullPointerException

Returns a URL to a resource in a module defined to this class loader.
Class loader implementations that support loading from modules
should override this method.

**API Note:** This method is the basis for the

Class.getResource

,

Class.getResourceAsStream

, and

Module.getResourceAsStream

methods. It is not subject to the rules for
encapsulation specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation attempts to find the resource by
invoking

getResource

```java

URL
getResource​(
String
name)
```

Finds the resource with the given name. A resource is some data
(images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
that is independent of the location of the code.

The name of a resource is a '

/

'-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "

.class

", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is

opened

unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).

**API Note:** Where several modules are defined to the same class loader,
and where more than one module contains a resource with the given name,
then the ordering that modules are searched is not specified and may be
very unpredictable.
When overriding this method it is recommended that an implementation
ensures that any delegation is consistent with the

getResources(String)

method.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation will first search the parent class
loader for the resource; if the parent is

null

the path of the
class loader built into the virtual machine is searched. If not found,
this method will invoke

findResource(String)

to find the resource.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** URL

object for reading the resource;

null

if
the resource could not be found, a

URL

could not be
constructed to locate the resource, the resource is in a package
that is not opened unconditionally, or access to the resource is
denied by the security manager.

method would return.
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation will first search the parent class
loader for the resource; if the parent is

null

the path of the
class loader built into the virtual machine is searched. It then
invokes

findResources(String)

to find the resources with the
name in this class loader. It returns an enumeration whose elements
are the URLs found by searching the parent class loader followed by
the elements found with

findResources

.
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** An enumeration of

getSystemClassLoader

```java
public static
ClassLoader
getSystemClassLoader()
```

Returns the system class loader. This is the default
delegation parent for new

ClassLoader

instances, and is
typically the class loader used to start the application.

This method is first invoked early in the runtime's startup
sequence, at which point it creates the system class loader. This
class loader will be the context class loader for the main application
thread (for example, the thread that invokes the

main

method of
the main class).

The default system class loader is an implementation-dependent
instance of this class.

If the system property "

java.system.class.loader

" is defined
when this method is first invoked then the value of that property is
taken to be the name of a class that will be returned as the system
class loader. The class is loaded using the default system class loader
and must define a public constructor that takes a single parameter of
type

ClassLoader

which is used as the delegation parent. An
instance is then created using this constructor with the default system
class loader as the parameter. The resulting class loader is defined
to be the system class loader. During construction, the class loader
should take great care to avoid calling

getSystemClassLoader()

.
If circular initialization of the system class loader is detected then
an

IllegalStateException

is thrown.

**Implementation Note:** The system property to override the system class loader is not
examined until the VM is almost fully initialized. Code that executes
this method during startup should take care not to cache the return
value until the system is fully initialized.

The name of the built-in system class loader is

"app"

.
The system property "

java.class.path

" is read during early
initialization of the VM to determine the class path.
An empty value of "

java.class.path

" property is interpreted
differently depending on whether the initial module (the module
containing the main class) is named or unnamed:
If named, the built-in system class loader will have no class path and
will search for classes and resources using the application module path;
otherwise, if unnamed, it will set the class path to the current
working directory.
**Returns:** The system

ClassLoader
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader
is not

null

and is not the same as or an ancestor of the
system class loader, and the caller does not have the

RuntimePermission

("getClassLoader")
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If invoked recursively during the construction of the class
loader specified by the "

java.system.class.loader

"
property.
**Throws:** Error

- If the system property "

java.system.class.loader

"
is defined but the named class could not be loaded, the
provider class does not define the required constructor, or an
exception is thrown by that constructor when it is invoked. The
underlying cause of the error can be retrieved via the

Throwable.getCause()

method.

```

Defines a package by

name

in this

ClassLoader

.

Package names

must be unique within a class loader and
cannot be redefined or changed once created.

If a class loader wishes to define a package with specific properties,
such as version information, then the class loader should call this

definePackage

method before calling

defineClass

.
Otherwise, the

defineClass

method will define a package in this class loader corresponding to the package
of the newly defined class; the properties of this defined package are
specified by

Package

.

**API Note:** A class loader that wishes to define a package for classes in a JAR
typically uses the specification and implementation titles, versions, and
vendors from the JAR's manifest. If the package is specified as

sealed

in the JAR's manifest,
the

URL

of the JAR file is typically used as the

sealBase

.
If classes of package

'p'

defined by this class loader
are loaded from multiple JARs, the

Package

object may contain
different information depending on the first class of package

'p'

defined and which JAR's manifest is read first to explicitly define
package

'p'

.

It is strongly recommended that a class loader does not call this
method to explicitly define packages in

named modules

; instead,
the package will be automatically defined when a class is

being defined

.
If it is desirable to define

Package

explicitly, it should ensure
that all packages in a named module are defined with the properties
specified by

Package

. Otherwise, some

Package

objects
in a named module may be for example sealed with different seal base.
**Parameters:** name

- The

package name
**Parameters:** specTitle

If multiple class loaders delegate to each other and define classes
with the same package name, and one such loader relies on the lookup
behavior of

getPackage

to return a

Package

from
a parent loader, then the properties exposed by the

Package

may not be as expected in the rest of the program.
For example, the

Package

will only expose annotations from the

package-info.class

file defined by the parent loader, even if
annotations exist in a

package-info.class

file defined by
a child loader. A more robust approach is to use the

getDefinedPackage(java.lang.String)

method which returns
a

Package

for the specified class loader.

Finds a package by

name

in this class loader and its ancestors.

If this class loader defines a

Package

of the given name,
the

Package

is returned. Otherwise, the ancestors of
this class loader are searched recursively (parent by parent)
for a

Package

of the given name.

**API Note:** The

platform class loader

may delegate to the application class loader but the application class
loader is not its ancestor. When invoked on the platform class loader,
this method will not find packages defined to the application
class loader.
**Parameters:** name

- The library name
**Returns:** The absolute path of the native library
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** System.loadLibrary(String)

,

System.mapLibraryName(String)

#### findLibrary

protected

String

findLibrary​(

String

libname)

Returns the absolute path name of a native library. The VM invokes this
method to locate the native libraries that belong to classes loaded with
this class loader. If this method returns

null

, the VM
searches the library along the path specified as the
"

java.library.path

" property.

setDefaultAssertionStatus

```java
public void setDefaultAssertionStatus​(boolean enabled)
```

Sets the default assertion status for this class loader. This setting
determines whether classes loaded by this class loader and initialized
in the future will have assertions enabled or disabled by default.
This setting may be overridden on a per-package or per-class basis by
invoking

setPackageAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

or

setClassAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

.

**Parameters:** enabled

-

true

if classes loaded by this class loader will
henceforth have assertions enabled by default,

false

if they will have assertions disabled by default.
**Since:** 1.4

#### setDefaultAssertionStatus

public void setDefaultAssertionStatus​(boolean enabled)

Sets the default assertion status for this class loader. This setting
determines whether classes loaded by this class loader and initialized
in the future will have assertions enabled or disabled by default.
This setting may be overridden on a per-package or per-class basis by
invoking

setPackageAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

or

setClassAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

.

setPackageAssertionStatus

```java
public void setPackageAssertionStatus​(
String
packageName,
boolean enabled)
```

Sets the package default assertion status for the named package. The
package default assertion status determines the assertion status for
classes initialized in the future that belong to the named package or
any of its "subpackages".

A subpackage of a package named p is any package whose name begins
with "

p.

". For example,

javax.swing.text

is a
subpackage of

javax.swing

, and both

java.util

and

java.lang.reflect

are subpackages of

java

.

In the event that multiple package defaults apply to a given class,
the package default pertaining to the most specific package takes
precedence over the others. For example, if

javax.lang

and

javax.lang.reflect

both have package defaults associated with
them, the latter package default applies to classes in

javax.lang.reflect

.

Package defaults take precedence over the class loader's default
assertion status, and may be overridden on a per-class basis by invoking

setClassAssertionStatus(String, boolean)

.

**Parameters:** packageName

- The name of the package whose package default assertion status
is to be set. A

null

value indicates the unnamed
package that is "current"
(see section 7.4.2 of

The Java™ Language Specification

.)
**Parameters:** enabled

-

true

if classes loaded by this classloader and
belonging to the named package or any of its subpackages will
have assertions enabled by default,

false

if they will
have assertions disabled by default.
**Since:** 1.4

setClassAssertionStatus

```java
public void setClassAssertionStatus​(
String
className,
boolean enabled)
```

Sets the desired assertion status for the named top-level class in this
class loader and any nested classes contained therein. This setting
takes precedence over the class loader's default assertion status, and
over any applicable per-package default. This method has no effect if
the named class has already been initialized. (Once a class is
initialized, its assertion status cannot change.)

If the named class is not a top-level class, this invocation will
have no effect on the actual assertion status of any class.

**Parameters:** className

- The fully qualified class name of the top-level class whose
assertion status is to be set.
**Parameters:** enabled

-

true

if the named class is to have assertions
enabled when (and if) it is initialized,

false

if the
class is to have assertions disabled.
**Since:** 1.4

Sets the desired assertion status for the named top-level class in this
class loader and any nested classes contained therein. This setting
takes precedence over the class loader's default assertion status, and
over any applicable per-package default. This method has no effect if
the named class has already been initialized. (Once a class is

have no effect on the actual assertion status of any class.

clearAssertionStatus

```java
public void clearAssertionStatus()
```

Sets the default assertion status for this class loader to

false

and discards any package defaults or class assertion
status settings associated with the class loader. This method is
provided so that class loaders can be made to ignore any command line or
persistent assertion status settings and "start with a clean slate."

**Since:** 1.4
