# Class CertPathBuilder

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\cert\CertPathBuilder.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
CertPathBuilder

extends
Object
```

A class for building certification paths (also known as certificate chains).

This class uses a provider-based architecture.
To create a

CertPathBuilder

, call
one of the static

getInstance

methods, passing in the
algorithm name of the

CertPathBuilder

desired and optionally
the name of the provider desired.

Once a

CertPathBuilder

object has been created, certification
paths can be constructed by calling the

build

method and
passing it an algorithm-specific set of parameters. If successful, the
result (including the

CertPath

that was built) is returned
in an object that implements the

CertPathBuilderResult

interface.

The

getRevocationChecker()

method allows an application to specify
additional algorithm-specific parameters and options used by the

CertPathBuilder

when checking the revocation status of certificates.
Here is an example demonstrating how it is used with the PKIX algorithm:

```java
CertPathBuilder cpb = CertPathBuilder.getInstance("PKIX");
PKIXRevocationChecker rc = (PKIXRevocationChecker)cpb.getRevocationChecker();
rc.setOptions(EnumSet.of(Option.PREFER_CRLS));
params.addCertPathChecker(rc);
CertPathBuilderResult cpbr = cpb.build(params);
```

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard

CertPathBuilder

algorithm:

- PKIX

This algorithm is described in the

CertPathBuilder section

of the
Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.
Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
other algorithms are supported.

Concurrent Access

The static methods of this class are guaranteed to be thread-safe.
Multiple threads may concurrently invoke the static methods defined in
this class with no ill effects.

However, this is not true for the non-static methods defined by this class.
Unless otherwise documented by a specific provider, threads that need to
access a single

CertPathBuilder

instance concurrently should
synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple
threads each manipulating a different

CertPathBuilder

instance
need not synchronize.

Creates a

CertPathBuilder

object of the given algorithm,

### Method Details

#### public static
CertPathBuilder
getInstance​(
String
algorithm)
throws
NoSuchAlgorithmException

Returns a

CertPathBuilder

object that implements the
specified algorithm.

This method traverses the list of registered security Providers,
starting with the most preferred Provider.
A new CertPathBuilder object encapsulating the
CertPathBuilderSpi implementation from the first
Provider that supports the specified algorithm is returned.

Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via
the

Security.getProviders()

method.

**Parameters:**
- algorithm

- the name of the requested

CertPathBuilder

algorithm. See the CertPathBuilder section in the

Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification

for information about standard algorithm names.

**Returns:**

specified algorithm

**Throws:**
- NoSuchAlgorithmException

- if no

Provider

supports a

CertPathBuilderSpi

implementation for the
specified algorithm
- NullPointerException

- if

algorithm

is

null

**See Also:**
- Provider

**Implementation Note:**
- The JDK Reference Implementation additionally uses the

jdk.security.provider.preferred

Security

property to determine
the preferred provider order for the specified algorithm. This
may be different than the order of providers returned by

Security.getProviders()

.

A new CertPathBuilder object encapsulating the
CertPathBuilderSpi implementation from the specified provider
is returned. The specified provider must be registered
in the security provider list.

Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via
the

Security.getProviders()

method.

**Parameters:**

CertPathBuilder

algorithm. See the CertPathBuilder section in the

provider)
throws

CertPathBuilder

---

#### public static final
String
getDefaultType()

Returns the default

CertPathBuilder

type as specified by
the

certpathbuilder.type

security property, or the string
"PKIX" if no such property exists.

The default

CertPathBuilder

type can be used by
applications that do not want to use a hard-coded type when calling one
of the

getInstance

methods, and want to provide a default
type in case a user does not specify its own.

The default

CertPathBuilder

type can be changed by
setting the value of the

certpathbuilder.type

security property
to the desired type.
