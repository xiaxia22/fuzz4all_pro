# Interface RowSetReader

**Source:** `java.sql\javax\sql\RowSetReader.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
RowSetReader
```

The facility that a disconnected

RowSet

object calls on
to populate itself with rows of data. A reader (an object implementing the

RowSetReader

interface) may be registered with
a

RowSet

object that supports the reader/writer paradigm.
When the

RowSet

object's

execute

method is
called, it in turn calls the reader's

readData

method.

### Method Details

#### void readData​(
RowSetInternal
caller)
throws
SQLException

Reads the new contents of the calling

RowSet

object.
In order to call this method, a

RowSet

object must have implemented the

RowSetInternal

interface
and registered this

RowSetReader

object as its reader.
The

readData

method is invoked internally
by the

RowSet.execute

method for rowsets that support the
reader/writer paradigm.

The

readData

method adds rows to the caller.
It can be implemented in a wide variety of ways and can even
populate the caller with rows from a nonrelational data source.
In general, a reader may invoke any of the rowset's methods,
with one exception. Calling the method

execute

will
cause an

SQLException

to be thrown
because

execute

may not be called recursively. Also,
when a reader invokes

RowSet

methods, no listeners
are notified; that is, no

RowSetEvent

objects are
generated and no

RowSetListener

methods are invoked.
This is true because listeners are already being notified by the method

execute

.

**Parameters:**
- caller

- the

RowSet

object (1) that has implemented the

RowSetInternal

interface, (2) with which this reader is
registered, and (3) whose

execute

method called this reader

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or this method
invokes the

RowSet.execute

method

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- readData

```java
void readData​(
RowSetInternal
caller)
throws
SQLException
```

Reads the new contents of the calling

RowSet

object.
In order to call this method, a

RowSet

object must have implemented the

RowSetInternal

interface
and registered this

RowSetReader

object as its reader.
The

readData

method is invoked internally
by the

RowSet.execute

method for rowsets that support the
reader/writer paradigm.

The

readData

method adds rows to the caller.
It can be implemented in a wide variety of ways and can even
populate the caller with rows from a nonrelational data source.
In general, a reader may invoke any of the rowset's methods,
with one exception. Calling the method

execute

will
cause an

SQLException

to be thrown
because

may not be called recursively. Also,
when a reader invokes

RowSet

methods, no listeners
are notified; that is, no

RowSetEvent

objects are
generated and no

RowSetListener

methods are invoked.
This is true because listeners are already being notified by the method

execute

.

**Parameters:** caller

- the

RowSet

object (1) that has implemented the

RowSetInternal

interface, (2) with which this reader is
registered, and (3) whose

execute

method called this reader
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or this method
invokes the

method
