# Class System.LoggerFinder

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\System.LoggerFinder.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract static class
System.LoggerFinder

extends
Object
```

The

LoggerFinder

service is responsible for creating, managing,
and configuring loggers to the underlying framework it uses.

A logger finder is a concrete implementation of this class that has a
zero-argument constructor and implements the abstract methods defined
by this class.
The loggers returned from a logger finder are capable of routing log
messages to the logging backend this provider supports.
A given invocation of the Java Runtime maintains a single
system-wide LoggerFinder instance that is loaded as follows:

- First it finds any custom

LoggerFinder

provider
using the

ServiceLoader

facility with the

system class
loader

.
- If no

LoggerFinder

provider is found, the system default

LoggerFinder

implementation will be used.

An application can replace the logging backend

even when the java.logging module is present

, by simply providing
and declaring an implementation of the

System.LoggerFinder

service.

Default Implementation

The system default

LoggerFinder

implementation uses

java.util.logging

as the backend framework when the

java.logging

module is present.
It returns a

logger

instance
that will route log messages to a

java.util.logging.Logger

. Otherwise, if

java.logging

is not
present, the default implementation will return a simple logger
instance that will route log messages of

INFO

level and above to
the console (

System.err

).

Logging Configuration

Logger

instances obtained from the

LoggerFinder

factory methods are not directly configurable by
the application. Configuration is the responsibility of the underlying
logging backend, and usually requires using APIs specific to that backend.

For the default

LoggerFinder

implementation
using

java.util.logging

as its backend, refer to

java.util.logging

for logging configuration.
For the default

LoggerFinder

implementation returning simple loggers
when the

java.logging

module is absent, the configuration
is implementation dependent.

Usually an application that uses a logging framework will log messages
through a logger facade defined (or supported) by that framework.
Applications that wish to use an external framework should log
through the facade associated with that framework.

A system class that needs to log messages will typically obtain
a

System.Logger

instance to route messages to the logging
framework selected by the application.

Libraries and classes that only need loggers to produce log messages
should not attempt to configure loggers by themselves, as that
would make them dependent from a specific implementation of the

LoggerFinder

service.

In addition, when a security manager is present, loggers provided to
system classes should not be directly configurable through the logging
backend without requiring permissions.

It is the responsibility of the provider of
the concrete

LoggerFinder

implementation to ensure that
these loggers are not configured by untrusted code without proper
permission checks, as configuration performed on such loggers usually
affects all applications in the same Java Runtime.

Message Levels and Mapping to backend levels

A logger finder is responsible for mapping from a

System.Logger.Level

to a level supported by the logging backend it uses.

The default LoggerFinder using

java.util.logging

as the backend
maps

System.Logger

levels to

java.util.logging

levels
of corresponding severity - as described in

Logger.Level

.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected LoggerFinder()

Creates a new instance of

LoggerFinder

.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the

RuntimePermission("loggerFinder")

.

**Implementation Note:**
- It is recommended that a

LoggerFinder

service
implementation does not perform any heavy initialization in its
constructor, in order to avoid possible risks of deadlock or class
loading cycles during the instantiation of the service provider.

---

### Method Details

#### public abstract
System.Logger
getLogger​(
String
name,

Module
module)

Returns an instance of

Logger

for the given

module

.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the logger.
- module

- the module for which the logger is being requested.

**Returns:**
- a

logger

suitable for use within the given
module.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

or

module

is

null

.
- SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the

RuntimePermission("loggerFinder")

.

---

#### public
System.Logger
getLocalizedLogger​(
String
name,

ResourceBundle
bundle,

Module
module)

Returns a localizable instance of

Logger

for the given

module

.
The returned logger will use the provided resource bundle for
message localization.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the logger.
- bundle

- a resource bundle; can be

null

.
- module

- the module for which the logger is being requested.

**Returns:**
- an instance of

Logger

which will use the
provided resource bundle for message localization.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

or

module

is

null

.
- SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the

RuntimePermission("loggerFinder")

.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- By default, this method calls

this.getLogger(name, module)

to obtain a logger, then wraps that
logger in a

System.Logger

instance where all methods that do not
take a

ResourceBundle

as parameter are redirected to one
which does - passing the given

bundle

for
localization. So for instance, a call to

Logger.log(Level.INFO, msg)

will end up as a call to

Logger.log(Level.INFO, bundle, msg, (Object[])null)

on the wrapped
logger instance.
Note however that by default, string messages returned by

Supplier<String>

will not be
localized, as it is assumed that such strings are messages which are
already constructed, rather than keys in a resource bundle.

An implementation of

LoggerFinder

may override this method,
for example, when the underlying logging backend provides its own
mechanism for localizing log messages, then such a

LoggerFinder

would be free to return a logger
that makes direct use of the mechanism provided by the backend.

---

#### public static
System.LoggerFinder
getLoggerFinder()

Returns the

LoggerFinder

instance. There is one
single system-wide

LoggerFinder

instance in
the Java Runtime. See the class specification of how the

LoggerFinder

implementation is located and
loaded.

**Returns:**
- the

LoggerFinder

instance.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the

RuntimePermission("loggerFinder")

.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- LoggerFinder

```java
protected LoggerFinder()
```

Creates a new instance of

LoggerFinder

.

**Implementation Note:** It is recommended that a

LoggerFinder

service
implementation does not perform any heavy initialization in its
constructor, in order to avoid possible risks of deadlock or class
loading cycles during the instantiation of the service provider.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the

RuntimePermission("loggerFinder")

.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getLogger

```java
public abstract
System.Logger
getLogger​(
String
name,

Module
module)
```

Returns an instance of

Logger

for the given

module

.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the logger.
**Parameters:** module

- the module for which the logger is being requested.
**Returns:** a

logger

suitable for use within the given
module.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

or

module

is

null

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the

RuntimePermission("loggerFinder")

.

- getLocalizedLogger

```java
public
System.Logger
getLocalizedLogger​(
String
name,

ResourceBundle
bundle,

Module
module)
```

Returns a localizable instance of

Logger

for the given

module

.
The returned logger will use the provided resource bundle for
message localization.

**Implementation Requirements:** By default, this method calls

this.getLogger(name, module)

to obtain a logger, then wraps that
logger in a

System.Logger

instance where all methods that do not
take a

ResourceBundle

as parameter are redirected to one
which does - passing the given

bundle

for
localization. So for instance, a call to

Logger.log(Level.INFO, msg)

will end up as a call to

Logger.log(Level.INFO, bundle, msg, (Object[])null)

on the wrapped
logger instance.
Note however that by default, string messages returned by

Supplier<String>

will not be
localized, as it is assumed that such strings are messages which are
already constructed, rather than keys in a resource bundle.

An implementation of

LoggerFinder

may override this method,
for example, when the underlying logging backend provides its own
mechanism for localizing log messages, then such a

LoggerFinder

would be free to return a logger
that makes direct use of the mechanism provided by the backend.
**Parameters:** name

- the name of the logger.
**Parameters:** bundle

- a resource bundle; can be

null

.
**Parameters:** module

- the module for which the logger is being requested.
**Returns:** an instance of

Logger

which will use the
provided resource bundle for message localization.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

or

module

is

null

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the

RuntimePermission("loggerFinder")

.

- getLoggerFinder

```java
public static
System.LoggerFinder
getLoggerFinder()
```

Returns the

LoggerFinder

instance. There is one
single system-wide

LoggerFinder

instance in
the Java Runtime. See the class specification of how the

LoggerFinder

implementation is located and
loaded.

**Returns:** the

LoggerFinder

instance.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the

RuntimePermission("loggerFinder")

.
