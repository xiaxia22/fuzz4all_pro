### Class Description

```java
public final class
ServiceLoader<S>

extends
Object

implements
Iterable
<S>
```

A facility to load implementations of a service.

A

service

is a well-known interface or class for which zero, one,
or many service providers exist. A

service provider

(or just

provider

) is a class that implements or subclasses the well-known
interface or class. A

ServiceLoader

is an object that locates and
loads service providers deployed in the run time environment at a time of an
application's choosing. Application code refers only to the service, not to
service providers, and is assumed to be capable of differentiating between
multiple service providers as well as handling the possibility that no service
providers are located.

Obtaining a service loader

An application obtains a service loader for a given service by invoking
one of the static

load

methods of ServiceLoader. If the application
is a module, then its module declaration must have a

uses

directive
that specifies the service; this helps to locate providers and ensure they
will execute reliably. In addition, if the service is not in the application
module, then the module declaration must have a

requires

directive
that specifies the module which exports the service.

A service loader can be used to locate and instantiate providers of the
service by means of the

iterator

method.

ServiceLoader

also defines the

stream

method to obtain a stream of providers
that can be inspected and filtered without instantiating them.

As an example, suppose the service is

com.example.CodecFactory

, an
interface that defines methods for producing encoders and decoders:

```java
package com.example;
public interface CodecFactory {
Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName);
Decoder getDecoder(String encodingName);
}
```

The following code obtains a service loader for the

CodecFactory

service, then uses its iterator (created automatically by the enhanced-for
loop) to yield instances of the service providers that are located:

```java
ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
for (CodecFactory factory : loader) {
Encoder enc = factory.getEncoder("PNG");
if (enc != null)
... use enc to encode a PNG file
break;
}
```

If this code resides in a module, then in order to refer to the

com.example.CodecFactory

interface, the module declaration would
require the module which exports the interface. The module declaration would
also specify use of

com.example.CodecFactory

:

```java
requires com.example.codec.core;
uses com.example.CodecFactory;
```

Sometimes an application may wish to inspect a service provider before
instantiating it, in order to determine if an instance of that service
provider would be useful. For example, a service provider for

CodecFactory

that is capable of producing a "PNG" encoder may be annotated
with

@PNG

. The following code uses service loader's

stream

method to yield instances of

Provider<CodecFactory>

in contrast to
how the iterator yields instances of

CodecFactory

:

```java
ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
Set<CodecFactory> pngFactories = loader
.stream() // Note a below
.filter(p -> p.type().isAnnotationPresent(PNG.class)) // Note b
.map(Provider::get) // Note c
.collect(Collectors.toSet());
```

- A stream of

Provider<CodecFactory>

objects
- p.type()

yields a

Class<CodecFactory>
- get()

yields an instance of

CodecFactory

Designing services

A service is a single type, usually an interface or abstract class. A
concrete class can be used, but this is not recommended. The type may have
any accessibility. The methods of a service are highly domain-specific, so
this API specification cannot give concrete advice about their form or
function. However, there are two general guidelines:

- A service should declare as many methods as needed to allow service
providers to communicate their domain-specific properties and other
quality-of-implementation factors. An application which obtains a service
loader for the service may then invoke these methods on each instance of
a service provider, in order to choose the best provider for the
application.
- A service should express whether its service providers are intended
to be direct implementations of the service or to be an indirection
mechanism such as a "proxy" or a "factory". Service providers tend to be
indirection mechanisms when domain-specific objects are relatively
expensive to instantiate; in this case, the service should be designed
so that service providers are abstractions which create the "real"
implementation on demand. For example, the

CodecFactory

service
expresses through its name that its service providers are factories
for codecs, rather than codecs themselves, because it may be expensive
or complicated to produce certain codecs.

Developing service providers

A service provider is a single type, usually a concrete class. An
interface or abstract class is permitted because it may declare a static
provider method, discussed later. The type must be public and must not be
an inner class.

A service provider and its supporting code may be developed in a module,
which is then deployed on the application module path or in a modular
image. Alternatively, a service provider and its supporting code may be
packaged as a JAR file and deployed on the application class path. The
advantage of developing a service provider in a module is that the provider
can be fully encapsulated to hide all details of its implementation.

An application that obtains a service loader for a given service is
indifferent to whether providers of the service are deployed in modules or
packaged as JAR files. The application instantiates service providers via
the service loader's iterator, or via

Provider

objects in
the service loader's stream, without knowledge of the service providers'
locations.

Deploying service providers as modules

A service provider that is developed in a module must be specified in a

provides

directive in the module declaration. The provides directive
specifies both the service and the service provider; this helps to locate the
provider when another module, with a

uses

directive for the service,
obtains a service loader for the service. It is strongly recommended that the
module does not export the package containing the service provider. There is
no support for a module specifying, in a

provides

directive, a service
provider in another module.

A service provider that is developed in a module has no control over when
it is instantiated, since that occurs at the behest of the application, but it
does have control over how it is instantiated:

- If the service provider declares a provider method, then the service
loader invokes that method to obtain an instance of the service provider. A
provider method is a public static method named "provider" with no formal
parameters and a return type that is assignable to the service's interface
or class.

In this case, the service provider itself need not be assignable to the
service's interface or class.
- If the service provider does not declare a provider method, then the
service provider is instantiated directly, via its provider constructor. A
provider constructor is a public constructor with no formal parameters.

In this case, the service provider must be assignable to the service's
interface or class

A service provider that is deployed as an

automatic module

on
the application module path must have a provider constructor. There is no
support for a provider method in this case.

As an example, suppose a module specifies the following directives:

```java
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.StandardCodecs;
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory;
```

where

- com.example.CodecFactory

is the two-method service from
earlier.
- com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is a public class that implements

CodecFactory

and has a public no-args constructor.
- com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory

is a public class that
does not implement CodecFactory, but it declares a public static no-args
method named "provider" with a return type of

CodecFactory

.

A service loader will instantiate

StandardCodecs

via its
constructor, and will instantiate

ExtendedCodecsFactory

by invoking
its

provider

method. The requirement that the provider constructor or
provider method is public helps to document the intent that the class (that is,
the service provider) will be instantiated by an entity (that is, a service
loader) which is outside the class's package.

Deploying service providers on the class path

A service provider that is packaged as a JAR file for the class path is
identified by placing a

provider-configuration file

in the resource
directory

META-INF/services

. The name of the provider-configuration
file is the fully qualified binary name of the service. The provider-configuration
file contains a list of fully qualified binary names of service providers, one
per line.

For example, suppose the service provider

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is packaged in a JAR file for the
class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may
be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a
different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader
that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the
provider-configuration file.

Timing of provider discovery

Service providers are loaded and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand.
A service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so
far. Each invocation of the

iterator

method returns an

Iterator

that first yields all of the elements cached from previous iteration, in
instantiation order, and then lazily locates and instantiates any remaining
providers, adding each one to the cache in turn. Similarly, each invocation
of the stream method returns a

Stream

that first processes all
providers loaded by previous stream operations, in load order, and then lazily
locates any remaining providers. Caches are cleared via the

reload

method.

Errors

When using the service loader's

iterator

, the

hasNext

and

next

methods will
fail with

ServiceConfigurationError

if an error occurs locating,
loading or instantiating a service provider. When processing the service
loader's stream then

ServiceConfigurationError

may be thrown by any
method that causes a service provider to be located or loaded.

When loading or instantiating a service provider in a module,

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The service provider cannot be loaded.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and either
it is not assignable to the service's interface/class or does not have a
provider constructor.
- The service provider declares a public static no-args method named
"provider" with a return type that is not assignable to the service's
interface or class.
- The service provider class file has more than one public static
no-args method named "

provider

".
- The service provider declares a provider method and it fails by
returning

null

or throwing an exception.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and its
provider constructor fails by throwing an exception.

When reading a provider-configuration file, or loading or instantiating
a provider class named in a provider-configuration file, then

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The format of the provider-configuration file violates the

format

specified above;
- An

IOException

occurs while reading the
provider-configuration file;
- A service provider cannot be loaded;
- A service provider is not assignable to the service's interface or
class, or does not define a provider constructor, or cannot be
instantiated.

Security

Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller
of the iterator or stream methods and may also be restricted by the security
context of the caller that created the service loader.
Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and
the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged
security context.

Concurrency

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

Null handling

Unless otherwise specified, passing a

null

argument to any
method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

**Type Parameters:** S

- The type of the service to be loaded by this loader

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### public
Iterator
<
S
> iterator()

Returns an iterator to lazily load and instantiate the available
providers of this loader's service.

To achieve laziness the actual work of locating and instantiating
providers is done by the iterator itself. Its

hasNext

and

next

methods can therefore throw a

ServiceConfigurationError

for any of the reasons specified in
the

Errors

section above. To write robust code it
is only necessary to catch

ServiceConfigurationError

when using
the iterator. If an error is thrown then subsequent invocations of the
iterator will make a best effort to locate and instantiate the next
available provider, but in general such recovery cannot be guaranteed.

Caching: The iterator returned by this method first yields all of
the elements of the provider cache, in the order that they were loaded.
It then lazily loads and instantiates any remaining service providers,
adding each one to the cache in turn. If this loader's provider caches are
cleared by invoking the

reload

method then existing
iterators for this service loader should be discarded.
The

hasNext

and

next

methods of the iterator throw

ConcurrentModificationException

if used after the provider cache has been cleared.

The iterator returned by this method does not support removal.
Invoking its

remove

method will
cause an

UnsupportedOperationException

to be thrown.

**Specified by:**
- iterator

in interface

Iterable

<

S

>

**Returns:**
- An iterator that lazily loads providers for this loader's
service

**API Note:**
- Throwing an error in these cases may seem extreme. The rationale
for this behavior is that a malformed provider-configuration file, like a
malformed class file, indicates a serious problem with the way the Java
virtual machine is configured or is being used. As such it is preferable
to throw an error rather than try to recover or, even worse, fail silently.

---

#### public
Stream
<
ServiceLoader.Provider
<
S
>> stream()

Returns a stream to lazily load available providers of this loader's
service. The stream elements are of type

Provider

, the

Provider

's

get

method must be invoked to
get or instantiate the provider.

To achieve laziness the actual work of locating providers is done
when processing the stream. If a service provider cannot be loaded for any
of the reasons specified in the

Errors

section
above then

ServiceConfigurationError

is thrown by whatever method
caused the service provider to be loaded.

Caching: When processing the stream then providers that were previously
loaded by stream operations are processed first, in load order. It then
lazily loads any remaining service providers. If this loader's provider
caches are cleared by invoking the

reload

method then
existing streams for this service loader should be discarded. The returned
stream's source

spliterator

is

fail-fast

and
will throw

ConcurrentModificationException

if the provider cache
has been cleared.

The following examples demonstrate usage. The first example creates
a stream of

CodecFactory

objects, the second example is the same
except that it sorts the providers by provider class name (and so locate
all providers).

```java
Stream<CodecFactory> providers = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class)
.stream()
.map(Provider::get);

Stream<CodecFactory> providers = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class)
.stream()
.sorted(Comparator.comparing(p -> p.type().getName()))
.map(Provider::get);
```

**Returns:**
- A stream that lazily loads providers for this loader's service

**Since:**
- 9

#### public static <S>
ServiceLoader
<S> load​(
Class
<S> service,

ClassLoader
loader)

Creates a new service loader for the given service. The service loader
uses the given class loader as the starting point to locate service
providers for the service. The service loader's

iterator

and

stream

locate providers in both named
and unnamed modules, as follows:

- Step 1: Locate providers in named modules.

Service providers are located in all named modules of the class
loader or to any class loader reachable via parent delegation.

In addition, if the class loader is not the bootstrap or

platform class loader

, then service
providers may be located in the named modules of other class loaders.
Specifically, if the class loader, or any class loader reachable via
parent delegation, has a module in a

module
layer

, then service providers in all modules in the module layer are
located.

For example, suppose there is a module layer where each module is
in its own class loader (see

defineModulesWithManyLoaders

). If this

ServiceLoader.load

method
is invoked to locate providers using any of the class loaders created for
the module layer, then it will locate all of the providers in the module
layer, irrespective of their defining class loader.

Ordering: The service loader will first locate any service providers
in modules defined to the class loader, then its parent class loader,
its parent parent, and so on to the bootstrap class loader. If a class
loader has modules in a module layer then all providers in that module
layer are located (irrespective of their class loader) before the
providers in the parent class loader are located. The ordering of
modules in same class loader, or the ordering of modules in a module
layer, is not defined.

If a module declares more than one provider then the providers
are located in the order that its module descriptor

lists the
providers

. Providers added dynamically by instrumentation agents (see

redefineModule

)
are always located after providers declared by the module.
- Step 2: Locate providers in unnamed modules.

Service providers in unnamed modules are located if their class names
are listed in provider-configuration files located by the class loader's

getResources

method.

The ordering is based on the order that the class loader's

getResources

method finds the service configuration files and within
that, the order that the class names are listed in the file.

In a provider-configuration file, any mention of a service provider
that is deployed in a named module is ignored. This is to avoid
duplicates that would otherwise arise when a named module has both a

provides

directive and a provider-configuration file that mention
the same service provider.

The provider class must be visible to the class loader.

**Parameters:**
- service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service
- loader

- The class loader to be used to load provider-configuration files
and provider classes, or

null

if the system class
loader (or, failing that, the bootstrap class loader) is to be
used

**Returns:**
- A new service loader

**Throws:**
- ServiceConfigurationError

- if the service type is not accessible to the caller or the
caller is in an explicit module and its module descriptor does
not declare that it uses

service

**API Note:**
- If the class path of the class loader includes remote network
URLs then those URLs may be dereferenced in the process of searching for
provider-configuration files.

This activity is normal, although it may cause puzzling entries to be
created in web-server logs. If a web server is not configured correctly,
however, then this activity may cause the provider-loading algorithm to fail
spuriously.

A web server should return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) response when a
requested resource does not exist. Sometimes, however, web servers are
erroneously configured to return an HTTP 200 (OK) response along with a
helpful HTML error page in such cases. This will cause a

ServiceConfigurationError

to be thrown when this class attempts to parse
the HTML page as a provider-configuration file. The best solution to this
problem is to fix the misconfigured web server to return the correct
response code (HTTP 404) along with the HTML error page.

**Type Parameters:**
- S

- the class of the service type

---

#### public static <S>
ServiceLoader
<S> load​(
Class
<S> service)

Creates a new service loader for the given service type, using the
current thread's

context class loader

.

An invocation of this convenience method of the form

```java
ServiceLoader.load(service)
```

is equivalent to

```java
ServiceLoader.load(service, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader())
```

**Parameters:**
- service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service

**Returns:**
- A new service loader

**Throws:**
- ServiceConfigurationError

- if the service type is not accessible to the caller or the
caller is in an explicit module and its module descriptor does
not declare that it uses

service

**API Note:**
- Service loader objects obtained with this method should not be
cached VM-wide. For example, different applications in the same VM may
have different thread context class loaders. A lookup by one application
may locate a service provider that is only visible via its thread
context class loader and so is not suitable to be located by the other
application. Memory leaks can also arise. A thread local may be suited
to some applications.

**Type Parameters:**
- S

- the class of the service type

---

#### public static <S>
ServiceLoader
<S> loadInstalled​(
Class
<S> service)

Creates a new service loader for the given service type, using the

platform class loader

.

This convenience method is equivalent to:

```java
ServiceLoader.load(service, ClassLoader.getPlatformClassLoader())
```

This method is intended for use when only installed providers are
desired. The resulting service will only find and load providers that
have been installed into the current Java virtual machine; providers on
the application's module path or class path will be ignored.

**Parameters:**
- service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service

**Returns:**
- A new service loader

**Throws:**
- ServiceConfigurationError

- if the service type is not accessible to the caller or the
caller is in an explicit module and its module descriptor does
not declare that it uses

service

**Type Parameters:**
- S

- the class of the service type

---

#### public static <S>
ServiceLoader
<S> load​(
ModuleLayer
layer,

Class
<S> service)

Creates a new service loader for the given service type to load service
providers from modules in the given module layer and its ancestors. It
does not locate providers in unnamed modules. The ordering that the service
loader's

iterator

and

stream

locate
providers and yield elements is as follows:

- Providers are located in a module layer before locating providers
in parent layers. Traversal of parent layers is depth-first with each
layer visited at most once. For example, suppose L0 is the boot layer, L1
and L2 are modules layers with L0 as their parent. Now suppose that L3 is
created with L1 and L2 as the parents (in that order). Using a service
loader to locate providers with L3 as the context will locate providers
in the following order: L3, L1, L0, L2.
- If a module declares more than one provider then the providers
are located in the order that its module descriptor

lists the providers

. Providers added dynamically by instrumentation
agents are always located after providers declared by the module.
- The ordering of modules in a module layer is not defined.

**Parameters:**
- layer

- The module layer
- service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service

**Returns:**
- A new service loader

**Throws:**
- ServiceConfigurationError

- if the service type is not accessible to the caller or the
caller is in an explicit module and its module descriptor does
not declare that it uses

service

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- Unlike the other load methods defined here, the service type
is the second parameter. The reason for this is to avoid source
compatibility issues for code that uses

load(S, null)

.

**Type Parameters:**
- S

- the class of the service type

---

#### public
Optional
<
S
> findFirst()

Load the first available service provider of this loader's service. This
convenience method is equivalent to invoking the

iterator()

method and obtaining the first element. It therefore
returns the first element from the provider cache if possible, it
otherwise attempts to load and instantiate the first provider.

The following example loads the first available service provider. If
no service providers are located then it uses a default implementation.

```java
CodecFactory factory = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class)
.findFirst()
.orElse(DEFAULT_CODECSET_FACTORY);
```

**Returns:**
- The first service provider or empty

Optional

if no
service providers are located

**Throws:**
- ServiceConfigurationError

- If a provider class cannot be loaded for any of the reasons
specified in the

Errors

section above.

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public void reload()

Clear this loader's provider cache so that all providers will be
reloaded.

After invoking this method, subsequent invocations of the

iterator

or

stream

methods will lazily
locate providers (and instantiate in the case of

iterator

)
from scratch, just as is done by a newly-created service loader.

This method is intended for use in situations in which new service
providers can be installed into a running Java virtual machine.

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string describing this service.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- A descriptive string

```

A facility to load implementations of a service.

A

service

is a well-known interface or class for which zero, one,
or many service providers exist. A

service provider

(or just

provider

) is a class that implements or subclasses the well-known
interface or class. A

ServiceLoader

is an object that locates and
loads service providers deployed in the run time environment at a time of an
application's choosing. Application code refers only to the service, not to
service providers, and is assumed to be capable of differentiating between
multiple service providers as well as handling the possibility that no service
providers are located.

Obtaining a service loader

An application obtains a service loader for a given service by invoking
one of the static

load

methods of ServiceLoader. If the application
is a module, then its module declaration must have a

uses

directive
that specifies the service; this helps to locate providers and ensure they
will execute reliably. In addition, if the service is not in the application
module, then the module declaration must have a

requires

directive
that specifies the module which exports the service.

A service loader can be used to locate and instantiate providers of the
service by means of the

iterator

method.

ServiceLoader

also defines the

stream

method to obtain a stream of providers
that can be inspected and filtered without instantiating them.

As an example, suppose the service is

com.example.CodecFactory

, an
interface that defines methods for producing encoders and decoders:

```java
package com.example;
public interface CodecFactory {
Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName);
Decoder getDecoder(String encodingName);
}
```

The following code obtains a service loader for the

CodecFactory

service, then uses its iterator (created automatically by the enhanced-for
loop) to yield instances of the service providers that are located:

```java
ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
for (CodecFactory factory : loader) {
Encoder enc = factory.getEncoder("PNG");
if (enc != null)
... use enc to encode a PNG file
break;
}
```

If this code resides in a module, then in order to refer to the

com.example.CodecFactory

interface, the module declaration would
require the module which exports the interface. The module declaration would
also specify use of

com.example.CodecFactory

:

```java
requires com.example.codec.core;
uses com.example.CodecFactory;
```

Sometimes an application may wish to inspect a service provider before
instantiating it, in order to determine if an instance of that service
provider would be useful. For example, a service provider for

CodecFactory

that is capable of producing a "PNG" encoder may be annotated
with

@PNG

. The following code uses service loader's

stream

method to yield instances of

Provider<CodecFactory>

in contrast to
how the iterator yields instances of

CodecFactory

:

```java
ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
Set<CodecFactory> pngFactories = loader
.stream() // Note a below
.filter(p -> p.type().isAnnotationPresent(PNG.class)) // Note b
.map(Provider::get) // Note c
.collect(Collectors.toSet());
```

- A stream of

Provider<CodecFactory>

objects
- p.type()

yields a

Class<CodecFactory>
- get()

yields an instance of

CodecFactory

Designing services

A service is a single type, usually an interface or abstract class. A
concrete class can be used, but this is not recommended. The type may have
any accessibility. The methods of a service are highly domain-specific, so
this API specification cannot give concrete advice about their form or
function. However, there are two general guidelines:

- A service should declare as many methods as needed to allow service
providers to communicate their domain-specific properties and other
quality-of-implementation factors. An application which obtains a service
loader for the service may then invoke these methods on each instance of
a service provider, in order to choose the best provider for the
application.
- A service should express whether its service providers are intended
to be direct implementations of the service or to be an indirection
mechanism such as a "proxy" or a "factory". Service providers tend to be
indirection mechanisms when domain-specific objects are relatively
expensive to instantiate; in this case, the service should be designed
so that service providers are abstractions which create the "real"
implementation on demand. For example, the

CodecFactory

service
expresses through its name that its service providers are factories
for codecs, rather than codecs themselves, because it may be expensive
or complicated to produce certain codecs.

Developing service providers

A service provider is a single type, usually a concrete class. An
interface or abstract class is permitted because it may declare a static
provider method, discussed later. The type must be public and must not be
an inner class.

A service provider and its supporting code may be developed in a module,
which is then deployed on the application module path or in a modular
image. Alternatively, a service provider and its supporting code may be
packaged as a JAR file and deployed on the application class path. The
advantage of developing a service provider in a module is that the provider
can be fully encapsulated to hide all details of its implementation.

An application that obtains a service loader for a given service is
indifferent to whether providers of the service are deployed in modules or
packaged as JAR files. The application instantiates service providers via
the service loader's iterator, or via

Provider

objects in
the service loader's stream, without knowledge of the service providers'
locations.

Deploying service providers as modules

A service provider that is developed in a module must be specified in a

provides

directive in the module declaration. The provides directive
specifies both the service and the service provider; this helps to locate the
provider when another module, with a

uses

directive for the service,
obtains a service loader for the service. It is strongly recommended that the
module does not export the package containing the service provider. There is
no support for a module specifying, in a

provides

directive, a service
provider in another module.

A service provider that is developed in a module has no control over when
it is instantiated, since that occurs at the behest of the application, but it
does have control over how it is instantiated:

- If the service provider declares a provider method, then the service
loader invokes that method to obtain an instance of the service provider. A
provider method is a public static method named "provider" with no formal
parameters and a return type that is assignable to the service's interface
or class.

In this case, the service provider itself need not be assignable to the
service's interface or class.
- If the service provider does not declare a provider method, then the
service provider is instantiated directly, via its provider constructor. A
provider constructor is a public constructor with no formal parameters.

In this case, the service provider must be assignable to the service's
interface or class

A service provider that is deployed as an

automatic module

on
the application module path must have a provider constructor. There is no
support for a provider method in this case.

As an example, suppose a module specifies the following directives:

```java
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.StandardCodecs;
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory;
```

where

- com.example.CodecFactory

is the two-method service from
earlier.
- com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is a public class that implements

CodecFactory

and has a public no-args constructor.
- com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory

is a public class that
does not implement CodecFactory, but it declares a public static no-args
method named "provider" with a return type of

CodecFactory

.

A service loader will instantiate

StandardCodecs

via its
constructor, and will instantiate

ExtendedCodecsFactory

by invoking
its

provider

method. The requirement that the provider constructor or
provider method is public helps to document the intent that the class (that is,
the service provider) will be instantiated by an entity (that is, a service
loader) which is outside the class's package.

Deploying service providers on the class path

A service provider that is packaged as a JAR file for the class path is
identified by placing a

provider-configuration file

in the resource
directory

META-INF/services

. The name of the provider-configuration
file is the fully qualified binary name of the service. The provider-configuration
file contains a list of fully qualified binary names of service providers, one
per line.

For example, suppose the service provider

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is packaged in a JAR file for the
class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may
be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a
different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader
that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the
provider-configuration file.

Timing of provider discovery

Service providers are loaded and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand.
A service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so
far. Each invocation of the

iterator

method returns an

Iterator

that first yields all of the elements cached from previous iteration, in
instantiation order, and then lazily locates and instantiates any remaining
providers, adding each one to the cache in turn. Similarly, each invocation
of the stream method returns a

Stream

that first processes all
providers loaded by previous stream operations, in load order, and then lazily
locates any remaining providers. Caches are cleared via the

reload

method.

Errors

When using the service loader's

iterator

, the

hasNext

and

next

methods will
fail with

ServiceConfigurationError

if an error occurs locating,
loading or instantiating a service provider. When processing the service
loader's stream then

ServiceConfigurationError

may be thrown by any
method that causes a service provider to be located or loaded.

When loading or instantiating a service provider in a module,

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The service provider cannot be loaded.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and either
it is not assignable to the service's interface/class or does not have a
provider constructor.
- The service provider declares a public static no-args method named
"provider" with a return type that is not assignable to the service's
interface or class.
- The service provider class file has more than one public static
no-args method named "

provider

".
- The service provider declares a provider method and it fails by
returning

null

or throwing an exception.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and its
provider constructor fails by throwing an exception.

When reading a provider-configuration file, or loading or instantiating
a provider class named in a provider-configuration file, then

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The format of the provider-configuration file violates the

format

specified above;
- An

IOException

occurs while reading the
provider-configuration file;
- A service provider cannot be loaded;
- A service provider is not assignable to the service's interface or
class, or does not define a provider constructor, or cannot be
instantiated.

Security

Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller
of the iterator or stream methods and may also be restricted by the security
context of the caller that created the service loader.
Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and
the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged
security context.

Concurrency

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

Null handling

Unless otherwise specified, passing a

null

argument to any
method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

**Since:** 1.6

public final class

ServiceLoader<S>

extends

Object

implements

Iterable

<S>

A facility to load implementations of a service.

A

service

is a well-known interface or class for which zero, one,
or many service providers exist. A

service provider

(or just

provider

) is a class that implements or subclasses the well-known
interface or class. A

ServiceLoader

is an object that locates and
loads service providers deployed in the run time environment at a time of an
application's choosing. Application code refers only to the service, not to
service providers, and is assumed to be capable of differentiating between
multiple service providers as well as handling the possibility that no service
providers are located.

Obtaining a service loader

An application obtains a service loader for a given service by invoking
one of the static

load

methods of ServiceLoader. If the application
is a module, then its module declaration must have a

uses

directive
that specifies the service; this helps to locate providers and ensure they
will execute reliably. In addition, if the service is not in the application
module, then the module declaration must have a

requires

directive
that specifies the module which exports the service.

A service loader can be used to locate and instantiate providers of the
service by means of the

iterator

method.

ServiceLoader

also defines the

stream

method to obtain a stream of providers
that can be inspected and filtered without instantiating them.

As an example, suppose the service is

com.example.CodecFactory

, an
interface that defines methods for producing encoders and decoders:

```java
package com.example;
public interface CodecFactory {
Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName);
Decoder getDecoder(String encodingName);
}
```

The following code obtains a service loader for the

CodecFactory

service, then uses its iterator (created automatically by the enhanced-for
loop) to yield instances of the service providers that are located:

```java
ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
for (CodecFactory factory : loader) {
Encoder enc = factory.getEncoder("PNG");
if (enc != null)
... use enc to encode a PNG file
break;
}
```

If this code resides in a module, then in order to refer to the

com.example.CodecFactory

interface, the module declaration would
require the module which exports the interface. The module declaration would
also specify use of

com.example.CodecFactory

:

```java
requires com.example.codec.core;
uses com.example.CodecFactory;
```

Sometimes an application may wish to inspect a service provider before
instantiating it, in order to determine if an instance of that service
provider would be useful. For example, a service provider for

CodecFactory

that is capable of producing a "PNG" encoder may be annotated
with

@PNG

. The following code uses service loader's

stream

method to yield instances of

Provider<CodecFactory>

in contrast to
how the iterator yields instances of

CodecFactory

:

```java
ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
Set<CodecFactory> pngFactories = loader
.stream() // Note a below
.filter(p -> p.type().isAnnotationPresent(PNG.class)) // Note b
.map(Provider::get) // Note c
.collect(Collectors.toSet());
```

- A stream of

Provider<CodecFactory>

objects
- p.type()

yields a

Class<CodecFactory>
- get()

yields an instance of

CodecFactory

Designing services

A service is a single type, usually an interface or abstract class. A
concrete class can be used, but this is not recommended. The type may have
any accessibility. The methods of a service are highly domain-specific, so
this API specification cannot give concrete advice about their form or
function. However, there are two general guidelines:

- A service should declare as many methods as needed to allow service
providers to communicate their domain-specific properties and other
quality-of-implementation factors. An application which obtains a service
loader for the service may then invoke these methods on each instance of
a service provider, in order to choose the best provider for the
application.
- A service should express whether its service providers are intended
to be direct implementations of the service or to be an indirection
mechanism such as a "proxy" or a "factory". Service providers tend to be
indirection mechanisms when domain-specific objects are relatively
expensive to instantiate; in this case, the service should be designed
so that service providers are abstractions which create the "real"
implementation on demand. For example, the

CodecFactory

service
expresses through its name that its service providers are factories
for codecs, rather than codecs themselves, because it may be expensive
or complicated to produce certain codecs.

Developing service providers

A service provider is a single type, usually a concrete class. An
interface or abstract class is permitted because it may declare a static
provider method, discussed later. The type must be public and must not be
an inner class.

A service provider and its supporting code may be developed in a module,
which is then deployed on the application module path or in a modular
image. Alternatively, a service provider and its supporting code may be
packaged as a JAR file and deployed on the application class path. The
advantage of developing a service provider in a module is that the provider
can be fully encapsulated to hide all details of its implementation.

An application that obtains a service loader for a given service is
indifferent to whether providers of the service are deployed in modules or
packaged as JAR files. The application instantiates service providers via
the service loader's iterator, or via

Provider

objects in
the service loader's stream, without knowledge of the service providers'
locations.

A service provider that is developed in a module must be specified in a

provides

specifies both the service and the service provider; this helps to locate the
provider when another module, with a

obtains a service loader for the service. It is strongly recommended that the
module does not export the package containing the service provider. There is

provider method is a public static method named "provider" with no formal
parameters and a return type that is assignable to the service's interface

In this case, the service provider itself need not be assignable to the

- If the service provider does not declare a provider method, then the
service provider is instantiated directly, via its provider constructor. A
provider constructor is a public constructor with no formal parameters.

As an example, suppose a module specifies the following directives:

```java
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.StandardCodecs;
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory;
```

where

- com.example.CodecFactory

is the two-method service from
earlier.
- com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is a public class that implements

CodecFactory

and has a public no-args constructor.
- com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory

is a public class that
does not implement CodecFactory, but it declares a public static no-args
method named "provider" with a return type of

CodecFactory

.

A service loader will instantiate

StandardCodecs

via its
constructor, and will instantiate

ExtendedCodecsFactory

by invoking
its

provider

method. The requirement that the provider constructor or
provider method is public helps to document the intent that the class (that is,
the service provider) will be instantiated by an entity (that is, a service
loader) which is outside the class's package.

For example, suppose the service provider

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is packaged in a JAR file for the
class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may
be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a

#### Obtaining a service loader

An application obtains a service loader for a given service by invoking
one of the static

load

methods of ServiceLoader. If the application
is a module, then its module declaration must have a

uses

directive
that specifies the service; this helps to locate providers and ensure they
will execute reliably. In addition, if the service is not in the application
module, then the module declaration must have a

requires

directive
that specifies the module which exports the service.

A service loader can be used to locate and instantiate providers of the
service by means of the

iterator

method.

ServiceLoader

also defines the

stream

method to obtain a stream of providers
that can be inspected and filtered without instantiating them.

As an example, suppose the service is

com.example.CodecFactory

, an
interface that defines methods for producing encoders and decoders:

```java
package com.example;
public interface CodecFactory {
Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName);
Decoder getDecoder(String encodingName);
}
```

The following code obtains a service loader for the

CodecFactory

service, then uses its iterator (created automatically by the enhanced-for
loop) to yield instances of the service providers that are located:

```java
ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
for (CodecFactory factory : loader) {
Encoder enc = factory.getEncoder("PNG");
if (enc != null)
... use enc to encode a PNG file
break;
}
```

If this code resides in a module, then in order to refer to the

com.example.CodecFactory

interface, the module declaration would
require the module which exports the interface. The module declaration would
also specify use of

com.example.CodecFactory

:

```java
requires com.example.codec.core;
uses com.example.CodecFactory;
```

Sometimes an application may wish to inspect a service provider before
instantiating it, in order to determine if an instance of that service
provider would be useful. For example, a service provider for

CodecFactory

that is capable of producing a "PNG" encoder may be annotated
with

@PNG

. The following code uses service loader's

stream

method to yield instances of

Provider<CodecFactory>

in contrast to
how the iterator yields instances of

CodecFactory

:

```java
ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
Set<CodecFactory> pngFactories = loader
.stream() // Note a below
.filter(p -> p.type().isAnnotationPresent(PNG.class)) // Note b
.map(Provider::get) // Note c
.collect(Collectors.toSet());
```

- A stream of

Provider<CodecFactory>

objects
- p.type()

yields a

Class<CodecFactory>
- get()

yields an instance of

CodecFactory

Designing services

A service is a single type, usually an interface or abstract class. A
concrete class can be used, but this is not recommended. The type may have
any accessibility. The methods of a service are highly domain-specific, so
this API specification cannot give concrete advice about their form or
function. However, there are two general guidelines:

- A service should declare as many methods as needed to allow service
providers to communicate their domain-specific properties and other
quality-of-implementation factors. An application which obtains a service
loader for the service may then invoke these methods on each instance of
a service provider, in order to choose the best provider for the
application.
- A service should express whether its service providers are intended
to be direct implementations of the service or to be an indirection
mechanism such as a "proxy" or a "factory". Service providers tend to be
indirection mechanisms when domain-specific objects are relatively
expensive to instantiate; in this case, the service should be designed
so that service providers are abstractions which create the "real"
implementation on demand. For example, the

CodecFactory

service
expresses through its name that its service providers are factories
for codecs, rather than codecs themselves, because it may be expensive
or complicated to produce certain codecs.

Developing service providers

A service provider is a single type, usually a concrete class. An
interface or abstract class is permitted because it may declare a static
provider method, discussed later. The type must be public and must not be
an inner class.

A service provider and its supporting code may be developed in a module,
which is then deployed on the application module path or in a modular
image. Alternatively, a service provider and its supporting code may be
packaged as a JAR file and deployed on the application class path. The
advantage of developing a service provider in a module is that the provider
can be fully encapsulated to hide all details of its implementation.

An application that obtains a service loader for a given service is
indifferent to whether providers of the service are deployed in modules or
packaged as JAR files. The application instantiates service providers via
the service loader's iterator, or via

Provider

objects in
the service loader's stream, without knowledge of the service providers'
locations.

Deploying service providers as modules

A service provider that is developed in a module must be specified in a

provides

directive in the module declaration. The provides directive
specifies both the service and the service provider; this helps to locate the
provider when another module, with a

uses

directive for the service,
obtains a service loader for the service. It is strongly recommended that the
module does not export the package containing the service provider. There is
no support for a module specifying, in a

provides

directive, a service
provider in another module.

A service provider that is developed in a module has no control over when
it is instantiated, since that occurs at the behest of the application, but it
does have control over how it is instantiated:

- If the service provider declares a provider method, then the service
loader invokes that method to obtain an instance of the service provider. A
provider method is a public static method named "provider" with no formal
parameters and a return type that is assignable to the service's interface
or class.

In this case, the service provider itself need not be assignable to the
service's interface or class.
- If the service provider does not declare a provider method, then the
service provider is instantiated directly, via its provider constructor. A
provider constructor is a public constructor with no formal parameters.

In this case, the service provider must be assignable to the service's
interface or class

A service provider that is deployed as an

automatic module

on
the application module path must have a provider constructor. There is no
support for a provider method in this case.

As an example, suppose a module specifies the following directives:

```java
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.StandardCodecs;
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory;
```

where

- com.example.CodecFactory

is the two-method service from
earlier.
- com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is a public class that implements

CodecFactory

and has a public no-args constructor.
- com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory

is a public class that
does not implement CodecFactory, but it declares a public static no-args
method named "provider" with a return type of

CodecFactory

.

A service loader will instantiate

StandardCodecs

via its
constructor, and will instantiate

ExtendedCodecsFactory

by invoking
its

provider

method. The requirement that the provider constructor or
provider method is public helps to document the intent that the class (that is,
the service provider) will be instantiated by an entity (that is, a service
loader) which is outside the class's package.

Deploying service providers on the class path

A service provider that is packaged as a JAR file for the class path is
identified by placing a

provider-configuration file

in the resource
directory

META-INF/services

. The name of the provider-configuration
file is the fully qualified binary name of the service. The provider-configuration
file contains a list of fully qualified binary names of service providers, one
per line.

For example, suppose the service provider

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is packaged in a JAR file for the
class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may
be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a
different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader
that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the
provider-configuration file.

Timing of provider discovery

Service providers are loaded and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand.
A service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so
far. Each invocation of the

iterator

method returns an

Iterator

that first yields all of the elements cached from previous iteration, in
instantiation order, and then lazily locates and instantiates any remaining
providers, adding each one to the cache in turn. Similarly, each invocation
of the stream method returns a

Stream

that first processes all
providers loaded by previous stream operations, in load order, and then lazily
locates any remaining providers. Caches are cleared via the

reload

method.

Errors

When using the service loader's

iterator

, the

hasNext

and

next

methods will
fail with

ServiceConfigurationError

if an error occurs locating,
loading or instantiating a service provider. When processing the service
loader's stream then

ServiceConfigurationError

may be thrown by any
method that causes a service provider to be located or loaded.

When loading or instantiating a service provider in a module,

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The service provider cannot be loaded.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and either
it is not assignable to the service's interface/class or does not have a
provider constructor.
- The service provider declares a public static no-args method named
"provider" with a return type that is not assignable to the service's
interface or class.
- The service provider class file has more than one public static
no-args method named "

provider

".
- The service provider declares a provider method and it fails by
returning

null

or throwing an exception.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and its
provider constructor fails by throwing an exception.

When reading a provider-configuration file, or loading or instantiating
a provider class named in a provider-configuration file, then

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The format of the provider-configuration file violates the

format

specified above;
- An

IOException

occurs while reading the
provider-configuration file;
- A service provider cannot be loaded;
- A service provider is not assignable to the service's interface or
class, or does not define a provider constructor, or cannot be
instantiated.

Security

Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller
of the iterator or stream methods and may also be restricted by the security
context of the caller that created the service loader.
Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and
the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged
security context.

Concurrency

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent

... use enc to encode a PNG file
break;
}
```

.map(Provider::get) // Note c

- A stream of

Provider<CodecFactory>

objects
- p.type()

yields a

- get()

yields an instance of

different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader
that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the
provider-configuration file.

Timing of provider discovery

Service providers are loaded and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand.
A service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so
far. Each invocation of the

iterator

method returns an

Iterator

that first yields all of the elements cached from previous iteration, in
instantiation order, and then lazily locates and instantiates any remaining
providers, adding each one to the cache in turn. Similarly, each invocation
of the stream method returns a

Stream

that first processes all
providers loaded by previous stream operations, in load order, and then lazily
locates any remaining providers. Caches are cleared via the

reload

method.

Errors

When using the service loader's

iterator

, the

hasNext

and

next

methods will
fail with

ServiceConfigurationError

if an error occurs locating,
loading or instantiating a service provider. When processing the service
loader's stream then

ServiceConfigurationError

may be thrown by any
method that causes a service provider to be located or loaded.

When loading or instantiating a service provider in a module,

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The service provider cannot be loaded.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and either
it is not assignable to the service's interface/class or does not have a
provider constructor.
- The service provider declares a public static no-args method named
"provider" with a return type that is not assignable to the service's
interface or class.
- The service provider class file has more than one public static
no-args method named "

provider

".
- The service provider declares a provider method and it fails by
returning

null

or throwing an exception.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and its
provider constructor fails by throwing an exception.

When reading a provider-configuration file, or loading or instantiating
a provider class named in a provider-configuration file, then

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The format of the provider-configuration file violates the

format

specified above;
- An

IOException

occurs while reading the
provider-configuration file;
- A service provider cannot be loaded;
- A service provider is not assignable to the service's interface or
class, or does not define a provider constructor, or cannot be
instantiated.

Security

Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller
of the iterator or stream methods and may also be restricted by the security
context of the caller that created the service loader.
Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and
the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged
security context.

Concurrency

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

Null handling

Unless otherwise specified, passing a

null

argument to any
method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

package com.example;
public interface CodecFactory {
Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName);
Decoder getDecoder(String encodingName);
}

The following code obtains a service loader for the

CodecFactory

service, then uses its iterator (created automatically by the enhanced-for
loop) to yield instances of the service providers that are located:

```java
ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
for (CodecFactory factory : loader) {
Encoder enc = factory.getEncoder("PNG");
if (enc != null)
... use enc to encode a PNG file
break;
}
```

If this code resides in a module, then in order to refer to the

com.example.CodecFactory

interface, the module declaration would
require the module which exports the interface. The module declaration would
also specify use of

com.example.CodecFactory

:

```java
requires com.example.codec.core;
uses com.example.CodecFactory;
```

Sometimes an application may wish to inspect a service provider before
instantiating it, in order to determine if an instance of that service
provider would be useful. For example, a service provider for

CodecFactory

that is capable of producing a "PNG" encoder may be annotated
with

@PNG

. The following code uses service loader's

stream

method to yield instances of

Provider<CodecFactory>

in contrast to
how the iterator yields instances of

CodecFactory

:

```java
ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
Set<CodecFactory> pngFactories = loader
.stream() // Note a below
.filter(p -> p.type().isAnnotationPresent(PNG.class)) // Note b
.map(Provider::get) // Note c
.collect(Collectors.toSet());
```

- A stream of

Provider<CodecFactory>

objects
- p.type()

yields a

Class<CodecFactory>
- get()

yields an instance of

CodecFactory

Designing services

A service is a single type, usually an interface or abstract class. A
concrete class can be used, but this is not recommended. The type may have
any accessibility. The methods of a service are highly domain-specific, so
this API specification cannot give concrete advice about their form or
function. However, there are two general guidelines:

- A service should declare as many methods as needed to allow service
providers to communicate their domain-specific properties and other
quality-of-implementation factors. An application which obtains a service
loader for the service may then invoke these methods on each instance of
a service provider, in order to choose the best provider for the
application.
- A service should express whether its service providers are intended
to be direct implementations of the service or to be an indirection
mechanism such as a "proxy" or a "factory". Service providers tend to be
indirection mechanisms when domain-specific objects are relatively
expensive to instantiate; in this case, the service should be designed
so that service providers are abstractions which create the "real"
implementation on demand. For example, the

CodecFactory

service
expresses through its name that its service providers are factories
for codecs, rather than codecs themselves, because it may be expensive
or complicated to produce certain codecs.

Developing service providers

A service provider is a single type, usually a concrete class. An
interface or abstract class is permitted because it may declare a static
provider method, discussed later. The type must be public and must not be
an inner class.

A service provider and its supporting code may be developed in a module,
which is then deployed on the application module path or in a modular
image. Alternatively, a service provider and its supporting code may be
packaged as a JAR file and deployed on the application class path. The
advantage of developing a service provider in a module is that the provider
can be fully encapsulated to hide all details of its implementation.

An application that obtains a service loader for a given service is
indifferent to whether providers of the service are deployed in modules or
packaged as JAR files. The application instantiates service providers via
the service loader's iterator, or via

Provider

objects in
the service loader's stream, without knowledge of the service providers'
locations.

Deploying service providers as modules

A service provider that is developed in a module must be specified in a

provides

directive in the module declaration. The provides directive
specifies both the service and the service provider; this helps to locate the
provider when another module, with a

uses

directive for the service,
obtains a service loader for the service. It is strongly recommended that the
module does not export the package containing the service provider. There is
no support for a module specifying, in a

provides

directive, a service
provider in another module.

A service provider that is developed in a module has no control over when
it is instantiated, since that occurs at the behest of the application, but it
does have control over how it is instantiated:

- If the service provider declares a provider method, then the service
loader invokes that method to obtain an instance of the service provider. A
provider method is a public static method named "provider" with no formal
parameters and a return type that is assignable to the service's interface
or class.

In this case, the service provider itself need not be assignable to the
service's interface or class.
- If the service provider does not declare a provider method, then the
service provider is instantiated directly, via its provider constructor. A
provider constructor is a public constructor with no formal parameters.

In this case, the service provider must be assignable to the service's
interface or class

A service provider that is deployed as an

automatic module

on
the application module path must have a provider constructor. There is no
support for a provider method in this case.

As an example, suppose a module specifies the following directives:

```java
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.StandardCodecs;
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory;
```

where

- com.example.CodecFactory

is the two-method service from
earlier.
- com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is a public class that implements

CodecFactory

and has a public no-args constructor.
- com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory

is a public class that
does not implement CodecFactory, but it declares a public static no-args
method named "provider" with a return type of

CodecFactory

.

A service loader will instantiate

StandardCodecs

via its
constructor, and will instantiate

ExtendedCodecsFactory

by invoking
its

provider

method. The requirement that the provider constructor or
provider method is public helps to document the intent that the class (that is,
the service provider) will be instantiated by an entity (that is, a service
loader) which is outside the class's package.

Deploying service providers on the class path

A service provider that is packaged as a JAR file for the class path is
identified by placing a

provider-configuration file

in the resource
directory

META-INF/services

. The name of the provider-configuration
file is the fully qualified binary name of the service. The provider-configuration
file contains a list of fully qualified binary names of service providers, one
per line.

For example, suppose the service provider

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is packaged in a JAR file for the
class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may
be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a
different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader
that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the

that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the
provider-configuration file.

Timing of provider discovery

Service providers are loaded and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand.
A service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so
far. Each invocation of the

iterator

method returns an

Iterator

that first yields all of the elements cached from previous iteration, in
instantiation order, and then lazily locates and instantiates any remaining
providers, adding each one to the cache in turn. Similarly, each invocation
of the stream method returns a

Stream

that first processes all
providers loaded by previous stream operations, in load order, and then lazily
locates any remaining providers. Caches are cleared via the

reload

method.

Errors

When using the service loader's

iterator

, the

hasNext

and

next

methods will
fail with

ServiceConfigurationError

if an error occurs locating,
loading or instantiating a service provider. When processing the service
loader's stream then

ServiceConfigurationError

may be thrown by any
method that causes a service provider to be located or loaded.

When loading or instantiating a service provider in a module,

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The service provider cannot be loaded.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and either
it is not assignable to the service's interface/class or does not have a
provider constructor.
- The service provider declares a public static no-args method named
"provider" with a return type that is not assignable to the service's
interface or class.
- The service provider class file has more than one public static
no-args method named "

provider

".
- The service provider declares a provider method and it fails by
returning

null

or throwing an exception.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and its
provider constructor fails by throwing an exception.

When reading a provider-configuration file, or loading or instantiating
a provider class named in a provider-configuration file, then

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The format of the provider-configuration file violates the

format

specified above;
- An

IOException

occurs while reading the
provider-configuration file;
- A service provider cannot be loaded;
- A service provider is not assignable to the service's interface or
class, or does not define a provider constructor, or cannot be
instantiated.

Security

Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller
of the iterator or stream methods and may also be restricted by the security
context of the caller that created the service loader.
Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and
the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged
security context.

Concurrency

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

Null handling

Unless otherwise specified, passing a

null

argument to any
method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

ServiceLoader<CodecFactory> loader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class);
Set<CodecFactory> pngFactories = loader
.stream() // Note a below
.filter(p -> p.type().isAnnotationPresent(PNG.class)) // Note b
.map(Provider::get) // Note c
.collect(Collectors.toSet());

A stream of

Provider<CodecFactory>

objects

p.type()

yields a

Class<CodecFactory>

get()

yields an instance of

#### Designing services

A service is a single type, usually an interface or abstract class. A
concrete class can be used, but this is not recommended. The type may have
any accessibility. The methods of a service are highly domain-specific, so
this API specification cannot give concrete advice about their form or
function. However, there are two general guidelines:

- A service should declare as many methods as needed to allow service
providers to communicate their domain-specific properties and other
quality-of-implementation factors. An application which obtains a service
loader for the service may then invoke these methods on each instance of
a service provider, in order to choose the best provider for the
application.
- A service should express whether its service providers are intended
to be direct implementations of the service or to be an indirection
mechanism such as a "proxy" or a "factory". Service providers tend to be
indirection mechanisms when domain-specific objects are relatively
expensive to instantiate; in this case, the service should be designed
so that service providers are abstractions which create the "real"
implementation on demand. For example, the

CodecFactory

service
expresses through its name that its service providers are factories
for codecs, rather than codecs themselves, because it may be expensive
or complicated to produce certain codecs.

Developing service providers

A service provider is a single type, usually a concrete class. An
interface or abstract class is permitted because it may declare a static
provider method, discussed later. The type must be public and must not be
an inner class.

A service provider and its supporting code may be developed in a module,
which is then deployed on the application module path or in a modular
image. Alternatively, a service provider and its supporting code may be
packaged as a JAR file and deployed on the application class path. The
advantage of developing a service provider in a module is that the provider
can be fully encapsulated to hide all details of its implementation.

An application that obtains a service loader for a given service is
indifferent to whether providers of the service are deployed in modules or
packaged as JAR files. The application instantiates service providers via
the service loader's iterator, or via

Provider

objects in
the service loader's stream, without knowledge of the service providers'
locations.

Deploying service providers as modules

A service provider that is developed in a module must be specified in a

provides

directive in the module declaration. The provides directive
specifies both the service and the service provider; this helps to locate the
provider when another module, with a

uses

directive for the service,
obtains a service loader for the service. It is strongly recommended that the
module does not export the package containing the service provider. There is
no support for a module specifying, in a

provides

directive, a service
provider in another module.

A service provider that is developed in a module has no control over when
it is instantiated, since that occurs at the behest of the application, but it
does have control over how it is instantiated:

- If the service provider declares a provider method, then the service
loader invokes that method to obtain an instance of the service provider. A
provider method is a public static method named "provider" with no formal
parameters and a return type that is assignable to the service's interface
or class.

In this case, the service provider itself need not be assignable to the
service's interface or class.
- If the service provider does not declare a provider method, then the
service provider is instantiated directly, via its provider constructor. A
provider constructor is a public constructor with no formal parameters.

In this case, the service provider must be assignable to the service's
interface or class

A service provider that is deployed as an

automatic module

on
the application module path must have a provider constructor. There is no
support for a provider method in this case.

As an example, suppose a module specifies the following directives:

```java
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.StandardCodecs;
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory;
```

where

- com.example.CodecFactory

is the two-method service from
earlier.
- com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is a public class that implements

CodecFactory

and has a public no-args constructor.
- com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory

is a public class that
does not implement CodecFactory, but it declares a public static no-args
method named "provider" with a return type of

CodecFactory

.

A service loader will instantiate

StandardCodecs

via its
constructor, and will instantiate

ExtendedCodecsFactory

by invoking
its

provider

method. The requirement that the provider constructor or
provider method is public helps to document the intent that the class (that is,
the service provider) will be instantiated by an entity (that is, a service
loader) which is outside the class's package.

Deploying service providers on the class path

A service provider that is packaged as a JAR file for the class path is
identified by placing a

provider-configuration file

in the resource
directory

META-INF/services

. The name of the provider-configuration
file is the fully qualified binary name of the service. The provider-configuration
file contains a list of fully qualified binary names of service providers, one
per line.

For example, suppose the service provider

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is packaged in a JAR file for the
class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may
be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a
different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader
that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the
provider-configuration file.

is a public class that implements

CodecFactory

and has a public no-args constructor.
- com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory

is a public class that
does not implement CodecFactory, but it declares a public static no-args
method named "provider" with a return type of

CodecFactory

.

A service loader will instantiate

StandardCodecs

via its
constructor, and will instantiate

ExtendedCodecsFactory

by invoking
its

provider

method. The requirement that the provider constructor or
provider method is public helps to document the intent that the class (that is,
the service provider) will be instantiated by an entity (that is, a service
loader) which is outside the class's package.

Deploying service providers on the class path

A service provider that is packaged as a JAR file for the class path is
identified by placing a

provider-configuration file

in the resource
directory

META-INF/services

. The name of the provider-configuration
file is the fully qualified binary name of the service. The provider-configuration
file contains a list of fully qualified binary names of service providers, one
per line.

For example, suppose the service provider

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is packaged in a JAR file for the
class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may
be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a
different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader
that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the
provider-configuration file.

Timing of provider discovery

Service providers are loaded and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand.
A service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so
far. Each invocation of the

iterator

method returns an

Iterator

that first yields all of the elements cached from previous iteration, in
instantiation order, and then lazily locates and instantiates any remaining
providers, adding each one to the cache in turn. Similarly, each invocation
of the stream method returns a

Stream

that first processes all
providers loaded by previous stream operations, in load order, and then lazily
locates any remaining providers. Caches are cleared via the

reload

method.

Errors

When using the service loader's

iterator

, the

hasNext

and

next

methods will
fail with

ServiceConfigurationError

if an error occurs locating,
loading or instantiating a service provider. When processing the service
loader's stream then

ServiceConfigurationError

may be thrown by any
method that causes a service provider to be located or loaded.

When loading or instantiating a service provider in a module,

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The service provider cannot be loaded.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and either
it is not assignable to the service's interface/class or does not have a
provider constructor.
- The service provider declares a public static no-args method named
"provider" with a return type that is not assignable to the service's
interface or class.
- The service provider class file has more than one public static
no-args method named "

provider

".
- The service provider declares a provider method and it fails by
returning

null

or throwing an exception.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and its
provider constructor fails by throwing an exception.

When reading a provider-configuration file, or loading or instantiating
a provider class named in a provider-configuration file, then

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The format of the provider-configuration file violates the

format

specified above;
- An

IOException

occurs while reading the
provider-configuration file;
- A service provider cannot be loaded;
- A service provider is not assignable to the service's interface or
class, or does not define a provider constructor, or cannot be
instantiated.

Security

Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller
of the iterator or stream methods and may also be restricted by the security
context of the caller that created the service loader.
Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and
the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged
security context.

Concurrency

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

Null handling

Unless otherwise specified, passing a

null

argument to any
method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

#### Deploying service providers as modules

A service provider that is developed in a module must be specified in a

provides

directive in the module declaration. The provides directive
specifies both the service and the service provider; this helps to locate the
provider when another module, with a

uses

directive for the service,
obtains a service loader for the service. It is strongly recommended that the
module does not export the package containing the service provider. There is
no support for a module specifying, in a

provides

directive, a service
provider in another module.

A service provider that is developed in a module has no control over when
it is instantiated, since that occurs at the behest of the application, but it
does have control over how it is instantiated:

- If the service provider declares a provider method, then the service
loader invokes that method to obtain an instance of the service provider. A
provider method is a public static method named "provider" with no formal
parameters and a return type that is assignable to the service's interface
or class.

In this case, the service provider itself need not be assignable to the
service's interface or class.
- If the service provider does not declare a provider method, then the
service provider is instantiated directly, via its provider constructor. A
provider constructor is a public constructor with no formal parameters.

In this case, the service provider must be assignable to the service's
interface or class

A service provider that is deployed as an

automatic module

on
the application module path must have a provider constructor. There is no
support for a provider method in this case.

As an example, suppose a module specifies the following directives:

```java
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.StandardCodecs;
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory;
```

where

- com.example.CodecFactory

is the two-method service from
earlier.
- com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is a public class that implements

CodecFactory

and has a public no-args constructor.
- com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory

is a public class that
does not implement CodecFactory, but it declares a public static no-args
method named "provider" with a return type of

CodecFactory

.

A service loader will instantiate

StandardCodecs

via its
constructor, and will instantiate

ExtendedCodecsFactory

by invoking
its

provider

method. The requirement that the provider constructor or
provider method is public helps to document the intent that the class (that is,
the service provider) will be instantiated by an entity (that is, a service
loader) which is outside the class's package.

Deploying service providers on the class path

A service provider that is packaged as a JAR file for the class path is
identified by placing a

provider-configuration file

in the resource
directory

META-INF/services

. The name of the provider-configuration
file is the fully qualified binary name of the service. The provider-configuration
file contains a list of fully qualified binary names of service providers, one
per line.

For example, suppose the service provider

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is packaged in a JAR file for the
class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may
be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a
different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader
that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the
provider-configuration file.

Timing of provider discovery

Service providers are loaded and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand.
A service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so

iterator

method returns an

Iterator

that first yields all of the elements cached from previous iteration, in

providers, adding each one to the cache in turn. Similarly, each invocation
of the stream method returns a

Stream

that first processes all
providers loaded by previous stream operations, in load order, and then lazily
locates any remaining providers. Caches are cleared via the

reload

method.

Errors

When using the service loader's

iterator

, the

hasNext

and

next

methods will
fail with

ServiceConfigurationError

if an error occurs locating,
loading or instantiating a service provider. When processing the service
loader's stream then

ServiceConfigurationError

may be thrown by any
method that causes a service provider to be located or loaded.

When loading or instantiating a service provider in a module,

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The service provider cannot be loaded.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and either
it is not assignable to the service's interface/class or does not have a
provider constructor.
- The service provider declares a public static no-args method named
"provider" with a return type that is not assignable to the service's
interface or class.
- The service provider class file has more than one public static
no-args method named "

provider

".
- The service provider declares a provider method and it fails by
returning

null

or throwing an exception.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and its
provider constructor fails by throwing an exception.

When reading a provider-configuration file, or loading or instantiating
a provider class named in a provider-configuration file, then

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The format of the provider-configuration file violates the

format

specified above;
- An

IOException

occurs while reading the
provider-configuration file;
- A service provider cannot be loaded;
- A service provider is not assignable to the service's interface or
class, or does not define a provider constructor, or cannot be
instantiated.

Security

Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller
of the iterator or stream methods and may also be restricted by the security
context of the caller that created the service loader.
Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and
the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged
security context.

Concurrency

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

Null handling

Unless otherwise specified, passing a

null

argument to any
method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

A service provider that is developed in a module has no control over when
it is instantiated, since that occurs at the behest of the application, but it
does have control over how it is instantiated:

- If the service provider declares a provider method, then the service
loader invokes that method to obtain an instance of the service provider. A
provider method is a public static method named "provider" with no formal
parameters and a return type that is assignable to the service's interface
or class.

In this case, the service provider itself need not be assignable to the
service's interface or class.
- If the service provider does not declare a provider method, then the
service provider is instantiated directly, via its provider constructor. A
provider constructor is a public constructor with no formal parameters.

In this case, the service provider must be assignable to the service's
interface or class

A service provider that is deployed as an

automatic module

on
the application module path must have a provider constructor. There is no
support for a provider method in this case.

As an example, suppose a module specifies the following directives:

```java
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.StandardCodecs;
provides com.example.CodecFactory with com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory;
```

where

- com.example.CodecFactory

is the two-method service from
earlier.
- com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is a public class that implements

CodecFactory

and has a public no-args constructor.
- com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory

is a public class that
does not implement CodecFactory, but it declares a public static no-args
method named "provider" with a return type of

CodecFactory

.

A service loader will instantiate

StandardCodecs

via its
constructor, and will instantiate

ExtendedCodecsFactory

by invoking
its

provider

method. The requirement that the provider constructor or
provider method is public helps to document the intent that the class (that is,
the service provider) will be instantiated by an entity (that is, a service
loader) which is outside the class's package.

Deploying service providers on the class path

A service provider that is packaged as a JAR file for the class path is

provider-configuration file

in the resource
directory

META-INF/services

. The name of the provider-configuration
file is the fully qualified binary name of the service. The provider-configuration
file contains a list of fully qualified binary names of service providers, one
per line.

For example, suppose the service provider

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is packaged in a JAR file for the
class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may
be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a
different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader
that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the
provider-configuration file.

if an error occurs locating,

may be thrown by any

When loading or instantiating a service provider in a module,

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The service provider cannot be loaded.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and either
it is not assignable to the service's interface/class or does not have a
provider constructor.
- The service provider declares a public static no-args method named
"provider" with a return type that is not assignable to the service's

- The service provider declares a provider method and it fails by
returning

null

or throwing an exception.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and its
provider constructor fails by throwing an exception.

When reading a provider-configuration file, or loading or instantiating
a provider class named in a provider-configuration file, then

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The format of the provider-configuration file violates the

format

specified above;
- An

IOException

occurs while reading the
provider-configuration file;
- A service provider cannot be loaded;
- A service provider is not assignable to the service's interface or

class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may
be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a
different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader
that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is
not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the
provider-configuration file.

Timing of provider discovery

Service providers are loaded and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand.
A service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so
far. Each invocation of the

iterator

method returns an

Iterator

that first yields all of the elements cached from previous iteration, in
instantiation order, and then lazily locates and instantiates any remaining
providers, adding each one to the cache in turn. Similarly, each invocation
of the stream method returns a

Stream

that first processes all
providers loaded by previous stream operations, in load order, and then lazily
locates any remaining providers. Caches are cleared via the

reload

method.

Errors

When using the service loader's

iterator

, the

hasNext

and

next

methods will
fail with

ServiceConfigurationError

if an error occurs locating,
loading or instantiating a service provider. When processing the service
loader's stream then

ServiceConfigurationError

may be thrown by any
method that causes a service provider to be located or loaded.

When loading or instantiating a service provider in a module,

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The service provider cannot be loaded.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and either
it is not assignable to the service's interface/class or does not have a
provider constructor.
- The service provider declares a public static no-args method named
"provider" with a return type that is not assignable to the service's
interface or class.
- The service provider class file has more than one public static
no-args method named "

provider

".
- The service provider declares a provider method and it fails by
returning

null

or throwing an exception.
- The service provider does not declare a provider method, and its
provider constructor fails by throwing an exception.

When reading a provider-configuration file, or loading or instantiating
a provider class named in a provider-configuration file, then

ServiceConfigurationError

can be thrown for the following reasons:

- The format of the provider-configuration file violates the

format

specified above;
- An

IOException

occurs while reading the
provider-configuration file;
- A service provider cannot be loaded;
- A service provider is not assignable to the service's interface or
class, or does not define a provider constructor, or cannot be
instantiated.

Security

Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller
of the iterator or stream methods and may also be restricted by the security
context of the caller that created the service loader.
Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and
the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged
security context.

Concurrency

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

Null handling

Unless otherwise specified, passing a

null

argument to any
method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

com.example.CodecFactory

is the two-method service from
earlier.

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is a public class that implements

CodecFactory

and has a public no-args constructor.

com.example.impl.ExtendedCodecsFactory

is a public class that
does not implement CodecFactory, but it declares a public static no-args
method named "provider" with a return type of

CodecFactory

.

A service loader will instantiate

StandardCodecs

via its
constructor, and will instantiate

ExtendedCodecsFactory

by invoking
its

provider

method. The requirement that the provider constructor or
provider method is public helps to document the intent that the class (that is,
the service provider) will be instantiated by an entity (that is, a service
loader) which is outside the class's package.

Deploying service providers on the class path

A service provider that is packaged as a JAR file for the class path is
identified by placing a

provider-configuration file

in the resource
directory

META-INF/services

. The name of the provider-configuration
file is the fully qualified binary name of the service. The provider-configuration
file contains a list of fully qualified binary names of service providers, one
per line.

For example, suppose the service provider

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs

is packaged in a JAR file for the
class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:

META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory

that contains the line:

com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs

The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as
blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

'&#92;u0023'

NUMBER SIGN

);
on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a
provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service
provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate
is ignored.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- iterator

```java
public
Iterator
<
S
> iterator()
```

Returns an iterator to lazily load and instantiate the available
providers of this loader's service.

To achieve laziness the actual work of locating and instantiating
providers is done by the iterator itself. Its

hasNext

and

next

methods can therefore throw a

ServiceConfigurationError

for any of the reasons specified in
the

Errors

section above. To write robust code it
is only necessary to catch

ServiceConfigurationError

when using
the iterator. If an error is thrown then subsequent invocations of the
iterator will make a best effort to locate and instantiate the next
available provider, but in general such recovery cannot be guaranteed.

Caching: The iterator returned by this method first yields all of
the elements of the provider cache, in the order that they were loaded.
It then lazily loads and instantiates any remaining service providers,
adding each one to the cache in turn. If this loader's provider caches are
cleared by invoking the

reload

method then existing
iterators for this service loader should be discarded.
The

hasNext

and

next

methods of the iterator throw

ConcurrentModificationException

if used after the provider cache has been cleared.

The iterator returned by this method does not support removal.
Invoking its

remove

method will
cause an

UnsupportedOperationException

to be thrown.

**Specified by:** iterator

in interface

Iterable

<

S

>
**API Note:** Throwing an error in these cases may seem extreme. The rationale
for this behavior is that a malformed provider-configuration file, like a
malformed class file, indicates a serious problem with the way the Java
virtual machine is configured or is being used. As such it is preferable
to throw an error rather than try to recover or, even worse, fail silently.
**Returns:** An iterator that lazily loads providers for this loader's
service

- stream

```java
public
Stream
<
ServiceLoader.Provider
<
S
>> stream()
```

Returns a stream to lazily load available providers of this loader's
service. The stream elements are of type

Provider

, the

Provider

's

get

method must be invoked to
get or instantiate the provider.

To achieve laziness the actual work of locating providers is done
when processing the stream. If a service provider cannot be loaded for any
of the reasons specified in the

Errors

section
above then

ServiceConfigurationError

is thrown by whatever method
caused the service provider to be loaded.

Caching: When processing the stream then providers that were previously
loaded by stream operations are processed first, in load order. It then
lazily loads any remaining service providers. If this loader's provider
caches are cleared by invoking the

reload

method then
existing streams for this service loader should be discarded. The returned
stream's source

spliterator

is

fail-fast

and
will throw

ConcurrentModificationException

if the provider cache
has been cleared.

The following examples demonstrate usage. The first example creates
a stream of

CodecFactory

objects, the second example is the same
except that it sorts the providers by provider class name (and so locate
all providers).

```java
Stream<CodecFactory> providers = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class)
.stream()
.map(Provider::get);

Stream<CodecFactory> providers = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class)
.stream()
.sorted(Comparator.comparing(p -> p.type().getName()))
.map(Provider::get);
```

**Returns:** A stream that lazily loads providers for this loader's service
**Since:** 9

- load

```java
public static <S>
ServiceLoader
<S> load​(
Class
<S> service,

ClassLoader
loader)
```

Creates a new service loader for the given service. The service loader
uses the given class loader as the starting point to locate service
providers for the service. The service loader's

iterator

and

stream

locate providers in both named
and unnamed modules, as follows:

- Step 1: Locate providers in named modules.

Service providers are located in all named modules of the class
loader or to any class loader reachable via parent delegation.

In addition, if the class loader is not the bootstrap or

platform class loader

, then service
providers may be located in the named modules of other class loaders.
Specifically, if the class loader, or any class loader reachable via
parent delegation, has a module in a

module
layer

, then service providers in all modules in the module layer are
located.

For example, suppose there is a module layer where each module is
in its own class loader (see

defineModulesWithManyLoaders

). If this

ServiceLoader.load

method
is invoked to locate providers using any of the class loaders created for
the module layer, then it will locate all of the providers in the module
layer, irrespective of their defining class loader.

Ordering: The service loader will first locate any service providers
in modules defined to the class loader, then its parent class loader,
its parent parent, and so on to the bootstrap class loader. If a class
loader has modules in a module layer then all providers in that module
layer are located (irrespective of their class loader) before the
providers in the parent class loader are located. The ordering of
modules in same class loader, or the ordering of modules in a module
layer, is not defined.

If a module declares more than one provider then the providers
are located in the order that its module descriptor

lists the
providers

. Providers added dynamically by instrumentation agents (see

redefineModule

)
are always located after providers declared by the module.
- Step 2: Locate providers in unnamed modules.

Service providers in unnamed modules are located if their class names
are listed in provider-configuration files located by the class loader's

getResources

method.

The ordering is based on the order that the class loader's

getResources

method finds the service configuration files and within
that, the order that the class names are listed in the file.

In a provider-configuration file, any mention of a service provider
that is deployed in a named module is ignored. This is to avoid
duplicates that would otherwise arise when a named module has both a

provides

directive and a provider-configuration file that mention
the same service provider.

The provider class must be visible to the class loader.

**API Note:** If the class path of the class loader includes remote network
URLs then those URLs may be dereferenced in the process of searching for
provider-configuration files.

This activity is normal, although it may cause puzzling entries to be
created in web-server logs. If a web server is not configured correctly,
however, then this activity may cause the provider-loading algorithm to fail
spuriously.

A web server should return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) response when a
requested resource does not exist. Sometimes, however, web servers are
erroneously configured to return an HTTP 200 (OK) response along with a
helpful HTML error page in such cases. This will cause a

ServiceConfigurationError

to be thrown when this class attempts to parse
the HTML page as a provider-configuration file. The best solution to this
problem is to fix the misconfigured web server to return the correct
response code (HTTP 404) along with the HTML error page.
**Type Parameters:** S

- the class of the service type
**Parameters:** service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service
**Parameters:** loader

- The class loader to be used to load provider-configuration files
and provider classes, or

null

if the system class
loader (or, failing that, the bootstrap class loader) is to be
used
**Returns:** A new service loader
**Throws:** ServiceConfigurationError

- if the service type is not accessible to the caller or the
caller is in an explicit module and its module descriptor does
not declare that it uses

service

- load

```java
public static <S>
ServiceLoader
<S> load​(
Class
<S> service)
```

Creates a new service loader for the given service type, using the
current thread's

context class loader

.

An invocation of this convenience method of the form

```java
ServiceLoader.load(service)
```

is equivalent to

```java
ServiceLoader.load(service, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader())
```

**API Note:** Service loader objects obtained with this method should not be
cached VM-wide. For example, different applications in the same VM may
have different thread context class loaders. A lookup by one application
may locate a service provider that is only visible via its thread
context class loader and so is not suitable to be located by the other
application. Memory leaks can also arise. A thread local may be suited
to some applications.
**Type Parameters:** S

- the class of the service type
**Parameters:** service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service
**Returns:** A new service loader
**Throws:** ServiceConfigurationError

- if the service type is not accessible to the caller or the
caller is in an explicit module and its module descriptor does
not declare that it uses

service

- loadInstalled

```java
public static <S>
ServiceLoader
<S> loadInstalled​(
Class
<S> service)
```

Creates a new service loader for the given service type, using the

platform class loader

.

This convenience method is equivalent to:

```java
ServiceLoader.load(service, ClassLoader.getPlatformClassLoader())
```

This method is intended for use when only installed providers are
desired. The resulting service will only find and load providers that
have been installed into the current Java virtual machine; providers on
the application's module path or class path will be ignored.

**Type Parameters:** S

- the class of the service type
**Parameters:** service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service
**Returns:** A new service loader
**Throws:** ServiceConfigurationError

- if the service type is not accessible to the caller or the
caller is in an explicit module and its module descriptor does
not declare that it uses

service

- load

```java
public static <S>
ServiceLoader
<S> load​(
ModuleLayer
layer,

Class
<S> service)
```

Creates a new service loader for the given service type to load service
providers from modules in the given module layer and its ancestors. It
does not locate providers in unnamed modules. The ordering that the service
loader's

iterator

and

stream

locate
providers and yield elements is as follows:

- Providers are located in a module layer before locating providers
in parent layers. Traversal of parent layers is depth-first with each
layer visited at most once. For example, suppose L0 is the boot layer, L1
and L2 are modules layers with L0 as their parent. Now suppose that L3 is
created with L1 and L2 as the parents (in that order). Using a service
loader to locate providers with L3 as the context will locate providers
in the following order: L3, L1, L0, L2.
- If a module declares more than one provider then the providers
are located in the order that its module descriptor

lists the providers

. Providers added dynamically by instrumentation
agents are always located after providers declared by the module.
- The ordering of modules in a module layer is not defined.

**API Note:** Unlike the other load methods defined here, the service type
is the second parameter. The reason for this is to avoid source
compatibility issues for code that uses

load(S, null)

.
**Type Parameters:** S

- the class of the service type
**Parameters:** layer

- The module layer
**Parameters:** service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service
**Returns:** A new service loader
**Throws:** ServiceConfigurationError

- if the service type is not accessible to the caller or the
caller is in an explicit module and its module descriptor does
not declare that it uses

service
**Since:** 9

- findFirst

```java
public
Optional
<
S
> findFirst()
```

Load the first available service provider of this loader's service. This
convenience method is equivalent to invoking the

iterator()

method and obtaining the first element. It therefore
returns the first element from the provider cache if possible, it
otherwise attempts to load and instantiate the first provider.

The following example loads the first available service provider. If
no service providers are located then it uses a default implementation.

```java
CodecFactory factory = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class)
.findFirst()
.orElse(DEFAULT_CODECSET_FACTORY);
```

**Returns:** The first service provider or empty

Optional

if no
service providers are located
**Throws:** ServiceConfigurationError

- If a provider class cannot be loaded for any of the reasons
specified in the

Errors

section above.
**Since:** 9

- reload

```java
public void reload()
```

Clear this loader's provider cache so that all providers will be
reloaded.

After invoking this method, subsequent invocations of the

iterator

or

stream

methods will lazily
locate providers (and instantiate in the case of

iterator

)
from scratch, just as is done by a newly-created service loader.

This method is intended for use in situations in which new service
providers can be installed into a running Java virtual machine.

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string describing this service.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** A descriptive string

Method Detail

- iterator

```java
public

```java

Returns a stream to lazily load available providers of this loader's
service. The stream elements are of type

Provider

, the

Provider

's

get

method must be invoked to
get or instantiate the provider.

To achieve laziness the actual work of locating providers is done
when processing the stream. If a service provider cannot be loaded for any
of the reasons specified in the

Errors

section
above then

ServiceConfigurationError

is thrown by whatever method
caused the service provider to be loaded.

Caching: When processing the stream then providers that were previously
loaded by stream operations are processed first, in load order. It then
lazily loads any remaining service providers. If this loader's provider
caches are cleared by invoking the

reload

method then
existing streams for this service loader should be discarded. The returned
stream's source

spliterator

is

**Since:** 9

- load

```java

**API Note:** Throwing an error in these cases may seem extreme. The rationale
for this behavior is that a malformed provider-configuration file, like a
malformed class file, indicates a serious problem with the way the Java
virtual machine is configured or is being used. As such it is preferable
to throw an error rather than try to recover or, even worse, fail silently.

Iterator

<

S

> iterator()

Returns an iterator to lazily load and instantiate the available
providers of this loader's service.

To achieve laziness the actual work of locating and instantiating
providers is done by the iterator itself. Its

hasNext

and

next

methods can therefore throw a

ServiceConfigurationError

for any of the reasons specified in
the

Errors

section above. To write robust code it
is only necessary to catch

ServiceConfigurationError

when using
the iterator. If an error is thrown then subsequent invocations of the
iterator will make a best effort to locate and instantiate the next
available provider, but in general such recovery cannot be guaranteed.

Caching: The iterator returned by this method first yields all of
the elements of the provider cache, in the order that they were loaded.
It then lazily loads and instantiates any remaining service providers,
adding each one to the cache in turn. If this loader's provider caches are
cleared by invoking the

reload

method then existing
iterators for this service loader should be discarded.
The

hasNext

and

next

methods of the iterator throw

ConcurrentModificationException

if used after the provider cache has been cleared.

The iterator returned by this method does not support removal.
Invoking its

remove

method will
cause an

UnsupportedOperationException

to be thrown.

stream

```java

```

Returns a stream to lazily load available providers of this loader's
service. The stream elements are of type

Provider

, the

Provider

's

get

method must be invoked to
get or instantiate the provider.

To achieve laziness the actual work of locating providers is done
when processing the stream. If a service provider cannot be loaded for any
of the reasons specified in the

Errors

section
above then

ServiceConfigurationError

is thrown by whatever method
caused the service provider to be loaded.

Caching: When processing the stream then providers that were previously
loaded by stream operations are processed first, in load order. It then
lazily loads any remaining service providers. If this loader's provider
caches are cleared by invoking the

reload

method then
existing streams for this service loader should be discarded. The returned
stream's source

spliterator

is

fail-fast

and
will throw

ConcurrentModificationException

if the provider cache
has been cleared.

The following examples demonstrate usage. The first example creates
a stream of

except that it sorts the providers by provider class name (and so locate
all providers).

```java

load

```java
public static <S>
ServiceLoader
<S> load​(
Class
<S> service,

ClassLoader
loader)
```

Creates a new service loader for the given service. The service loader
uses the given class loader as the starting point to locate service
providers for the service. The service loader's

iterator

and

stream

locate providers in both named
and unnamed modules, as follows:

- Step 1: Locate providers in named modules.

Service providers are located in all named modules of the class
loader or to any class loader reachable via parent delegation.

In addition, if the class loader is not the bootstrap or

platform class loader

, then service
providers may be located in the named modules of other class loaders.
Specifically, if the class loader, or any class loader reachable via
parent delegation, has a module in a

module
layer

, then service providers in all modules in the module layer are
located.

For example, suppose there is a module layer where each module is
in its own class loader (see

defineModulesWithManyLoaders

). If this

ServiceLoader.load

method
is invoked to locate providers using any of the class loaders created for
the module layer, then it will locate all of the providers in the module
layer, irrespective of their defining class loader.

Ordering: The service loader will first locate any service providers
in modules defined to the class loader, then its parent class loader,
its parent parent, and so on to the bootstrap class loader. If a class
loader has modules in a module layer then all providers in that module
layer are located (irrespective of their class loader) before the
providers in the parent class loader are located. The ordering of
modules in same class loader, or the ordering of modules in a module
layer, is not defined.

If a module declares more than one provider then the providers
are located in the order that its module descriptor

lists the
providers

. Providers added dynamically by instrumentation agents (see

redefineModule

)
are always located after providers declared by the module.
- Step 2: Locate providers in unnamed modules.

Service providers in unnamed modules are located if their class names
are listed in provider-configuration files located by the class loader's

getResources

method.

The ordering is based on the order that the class loader's

getResources

method finds the service configuration files and within
that, the order that the class names are listed in the file.

In a provider-configuration file, any mention of a service provider
that is deployed in a named module is ignored. This is to avoid
duplicates that would otherwise arise when a named module has both a

provides

directive and a provider-configuration file that mention
the same service provider.

The provider class must be visible to the class loader.

**API Note:** If the class path of the class loader includes remote network
URLs then those URLs may be dereferenced in the process of searching for
provider-configuration files.

This activity is normal, although it may cause puzzling entries to be
created in web-server logs. If a web server is not configured correctly,
however, then this activity may cause the provider-loading algorithm to fail
spuriously.

A web server should return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) response when a
requested resource does not exist. Sometimes, however, web servers are
erroneously configured to return an HTTP 200 (OK) response along with a
helpful HTML error page in such cases. This will cause a

ServiceConfigurationError

to be thrown when this class attempts to parse
the HTML page as a provider-configuration file. The best solution to this
problem is to fix the misconfigured web server to return the correct
response code (HTTP 404) along with the HTML error page.
**Type Parameters:** S

- the class of the service type
**Parameters:** service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service
**Parameters:** loader

- The class loader to be used to load provider-configuration files
and provider classes, or

null

if the system class
loader (or, failing that, the bootstrap class loader) is to be
used
**Returns:** A new service loader
**Throws:** ServiceConfigurationError

caller is in an explicit module and its module descriptor does
not declare that it uses

```

Creates a new service loader for the given service type, using the
current thread's

context class loader

.

An invocation of this convenience method of the form

```java
ServiceLoader.load(service)
```

is equivalent to

```java
ServiceLoader.load(service, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader())
```

**API Note:** Service loader objects obtained with this method should not be
cached VM-wide. For example, different applications in the same VM may
have different thread context class loaders. A lookup by one application
may locate a service provider that is only visible via its thread
context class loader and so is not suitable to be located by the other
application. Memory leaks can also arise. A thread local may be suited
to some applications.
**Type Parameters:** S

- the class of the service type
**Parameters:** service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service
**Returns:** A new service loader
**Throws:** ServiceConfigurationError

```

This method is intended for use when only installed providers are
desired. The resulting service will only find and load providers that
have been installed into the current Java virtual machine; providers on
the application's module path or class path will be ignored.

**Type Parameters:** S

- the class of the service type
**Parameters:** service

- The interface or abstract class representing the service
**Returns:** A new service loader
**Throws:** ServiceConfigurationError

Creates a new service loader for the given service type to load service
providers from modules in the given module layer and its ancestors. It
does not locate providers in unnamed modules. The ordering that the service
loader's

iterator

and

stream

locate
providers and yield elements is as follows:

- Providers are located in a module layer before locating providers
in parent layers. Traversal of parent layers is depth-first with each
layer visited at most once. For example, suppose L0 is the boot layer, L1
and L2 are modules layers with L0 as their parent. Now suppose that L3 is
created with L1 and L2 as the parents (in that order). Using a service
loader to locate providers with L3 as the context will locate providers
in the following order: L3, L1, L0, L2.
- If a module declares more than one provider then the providers
are located in the order that its module descriptor

lists the providers

. Providers added dynamically by instrumentation
agents are always located after providers declared by the module.
- The ordering of modules in a module layer is not defined.

**API Note:** Unlike the other load methods defined here, the service type
is the second parameter. The reason for this is to avoid source
compatibility issues for code that uses

Load the first available service provider of this loader's service. This
convenience method is equivalent to invoking the

method and obtaining the first element. It therefore
returns the first element from the provider cache if possible, it
otherwise attempts to load and instantiate the first provider.

The following example loads the first available service provider. If
no service providers are located then it uses a default implementation.

```java
CodecFactory factory = ServiceLoader.load(CodecFactory.class)
.findFirst()
.orElse(DEFAULT_CODECSET_FACTORY);
```

**Returns:** The first service provider or empty
