# Class Locale.LanguageRange

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Locale.LanguageRange.html`

### Class Description

```java
public static final class
Locale.LanguageRange

extends
Object
```

This class expresses a

Language Range

defined in

RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags

. A language range is an identifier which is used to
select language tag(s) meeting specific requirements by using the
mechanisms described in

Locale
Matching

. A list which represents a user's preferences and consists
of language ranges is called a

Language Priority List

.

There are two types of language ranges: basic and extended. In RFC
4647, the syntax of language ranges is expressed in

ABNF

as follows:

```java
basic-language-range = (1*8ALPHA *("-" 1*8alphanum)) / "*"
extended-language-range = (1*8ALPHA / "*")
*("-" (1*8alphanum / "*"))
alphanum = ALPHA / DIGIT
```

For example,

"en"

(English),

"ja-JP"

(Japanese, Japan),

"*"

(special language range which matches any language tag) are
basic language ranges, whereas

"*-CH"

(any languages,
Switzerland),

"es-*"

(Spanish, any regions), and

"zh-Hant-*"

(Traditional Chinese, any regions) are extended
language ranges.

**Enclosing class:** Locale

### Field Details

#### public static final double MAX_WEIGHT

A constant holding the maximum value of weight, 1.0, which indicates
that the language range is a good fit for the user.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### public static final double MIN_WEIGHT

A constant holding the minimum value of weight, 0.0, which indicates
that the language range is not a good fit for the user.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

### Constructor Details

#### public LanguageRange​(
String
range)

Constructs a

LanguageRange

using the given

range

.
Note that no validation is done against the IANA Language Subtag
Registry at time of construction.

This is equivalent to

LanguageRange(range, MAX_WEIGHT)

.

**Parameters:**
- range

- a language range

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the given

range

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the given

range

does not
comply with the syntax of the language range mentioned in RFC 4647

---

#### public LanguageRange​(
String
range,
double weight)

Constructs a

LanguageRange

using the given

range

and

weight

. Note that no validation is done against the IANA
Language Subtag Registry at time of construction.

**Parameters:**
- range

- a language range
- weight

- a weight value between

MIN_WEIGHT

and

MAX_WEIGHT

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the given

range

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the given

range

does not
comply with the syntax of the language range mentioned in RFC 4647
or if the given

weight

is less than

MIN_WEIGHT

or greater than

MAX_WEIGHT

---

### Method Details

#### public
String
getRange()

Returns the language range of this

LanguageRange

.

**Returns:**
- the language range.

---

#### public double getWeight()

Returns the weight of this

LanguageRange

.

**Returns:**
- the weight value.

---

#### public static
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> parse​(
String
ranges)

Parses the given

ranges

to generate a Language Priority List.

This method performs a syntactic check for each language range in
the given

ranges

but doesn't do validation using the IANA
Language Subtag Registry.

The

ranges

to be given can take one of the following
forms:

```java
"Accept-Language: ja,en;q=0.4" (weighted list with Accept-Language prefix)
"ja,en;q=0.4" (weighted list)
"ja,en" (prioritized list)
```

In a weighted list, each language range is given a weight value.
The weight value is identical to the "quality value" in

RFC 2616

, and it
expresses how much the user prefers the language. A weight value is
specified after a corresponding language range followed by

";q="

, and the default weight value is

MAX_WEIGHT

when it is omitted.

Unlike a weighted list, language ranges in a prioritized list
are sorted in the descending order based on its priority. The first
language range has the highest priority and meets the user's
preference most.

In either case, language ranges are sorted in descending order in
the Language Priority List based on priority or weight. If a
language range appears in the given

ranges

more than once,
only the first one is included on the Language Priority List.

The returned list consists of language ranges from the given

ranges

and their equivalents found in the IANA Language
Subtag Registry. For example, if the given

ranges

is

"Accept-Language: iw,en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3"

, the elements in
the list to be returned are:

```java
Range

Weight

"iw" (older tag for Hebrew) 1.0
"he" (new preferred code for Hebrew) 1.0
"en-us" (English, United States) 0.7
"en" (English) 0.3
```

Two language ranges,

"iw"

and

"he"

, have the same
highest priority in the list. By adding

"he"

to the user's
Language Priority List, locale-matching method can find Hebrew as a
matching locale (or language tag) even if the application or system
offers only

"he"

as a supported locale (or language tag).

**Parameters:**
- ranges

- a list of comma-separated language ranges or a list of
language ranges in the form of the "Accept-Language" header
defined in

RFC
2616

**Returns:**
- a Language Priority List consisting of language ranges
included in the given

ranges

and their equivalent
language ranges if available. The list is modifiable.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

ranges

is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if a language range or a weight
found in the given

ranges

is ill-formed

---

#### public static
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> parse​(
String
ranges,

Map
<
String
,​
List
<
String
>> map)

Parses the given

ranges

to generate a Language Priority
List, and then customizes the list using the given

map

.
This method is equivalent to

mapEquivalents(parse(ranges), map)

.

**Parameters:**
- ranges

- a list of comma-separated language ranges or a list
of language ranges in the form of the "Accept-Language" header
defined in

RFC
2616
- map

- a map containing information to customize language ranges

**Returns:**
- a Language Priority List with customization. The list is
modifiable.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

ranges

is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if a language range or a weight
found in the given

ranges

is ill-formed

**See Also:**
- parse(String)

,

mapEquivalents(java.util.List<java.util.Locale.LanguageRange>, java.util.Map<java.lang.String, java.util.List<java.lang.String>>)

#### public static
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> mapEquivalents​(
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> priorityList,

Map
<
String
,​
List
<
String
>> map)

Generates a new customized Language Priority List using the given

priorityList

and

map

. If the given

map

is
empty, this method returns a copy of the given

priorityList

.

In the map, a key represents a language range whereas a value is
a list of equivalents of it.

'*'

cannot be used in the map.
Each equivalent language range has the same weight value as its
original language range.

```java
An example of map:

Key

Value

"zh" (Chinese) "zh",
"zh-Hans"(Simplified Chinese)
"zh-HK" (Chinese, Hong Kong) "zh-HK"
"zh-TW" (Chinese, Taiwan) "zh-TW"
```

The customization is performed after modification using the IANA
Language Subtag Registry.

For example, if a user's Language Priority List consists of five
language ranges (

"zh"

,

"zh-CN"

,

"en"

,

"zh-TW"

, and

"zh-HK"

), the newly generated Language
Priority List which is customized using the above map example will
consists of

"zh"

,

"zh-Hans"

,

"zh-CN"

,

"zh-Hans-CN"

,

"en"

,

"zh-TW"

, and

"zh-HK"

.

"zh-HK"

and

"zh-TW"

aren't converted to

"zh-Hans-HK"

nor

"zh-Hans-TW"

even if they are
included in the Language Priority List. In this example, mapping
is used to clearly distinguish Simplified Chinese and Traditional
Chinese.

If the

"zh"

-to-

"zh"

mapping isn't included in the
map, a simple replacement will be performed and the customized list
won't include

"zh"

and

"zh-CN"

.

**Parameters:**
- priorityList

- user's Language Priority List
- map

- a map containing information to customize language ranges

**Returns:**
- a new Language Priority List with customization. The list is
modifiable.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

priorityList

is

null

**See Also:**
- parse(String, Map)

---

#### public int hashCode()

Returns a hash code value for the object.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a hash code value for this object.

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Compares this object to the specified object. The result is true if
and only if the argument is not

null

and is a

LanguageRange

object that contains the same

range

and

weight

values as this object.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to compare with

**Returns:**
- true

if this object's

range

and

weight

are the same as the

obj

's;

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- Method Detail

- getRange

```java
public
String
getRange()
```

Returns the language range of this

LanguageRange

.

**Returns:** the language range.

- getWeight

```java
public double getWeight()
```

Returns the weight of this

LanguageRange

.

**Returns:** the weight value.

- parse

```java
public static
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> parse​(
String
ranges)
```

Parses the given

ranges

to generate a Language Priority List.

This method performs a syntactic check for each language range in
the given

ranges

but doesn't do validation using the IANA
Language Subtag Registry.

The

ranges

to be given can take one of the following
forms:

```java
"Accept-Language: ja,en;q=0.4" (weighted list with Accept-Language prefix)
"ja,en;q=0.4" (weighted list)
"ja,en" (prioritized list)
```

In a weighted list, each language range is given a weight value.
The weight value is identical to the "quality value" in

RFC 2616

, and it
expresses how much the user prefers the language. A weight value is
specified after a corresponding language range followed by

";q="

, and the default weight value is

MAX_WEIGHT

when it is omitted.

Unlike a weighted list, language ranges in a prioritized list
are sorted in the descending order based on its priority. The first
language range has the highest priority and meets the user's
preference most.

In either case, language ranges are sorted in descending order in
the Language Priority List based on priority or weight. If a
language range appears in the given

ranges

more than once,
only the first one is included on the Language Priority List.

The returned list consists of language ranges from the given

ranges

and their equivalents found in the IANA Language
Subtag Registry. For example, if the given

ranges

is

"Accept-Language: iw,en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3"

, the elements in
the list to be returned are:

```java
Range

Weight

"iw" (older tag for Hebrew) 1.0
"he" (new preferred code for Hebrew) 1.0
"en-us" (English, United States) 0.7
"en" (English) 0.3
```

Two language ranges,

"iw"

and

"he"

, have the same
highest priority in the list. By adding

"he"

to the user's
Language Priority List, locale-matching method can find Hebrew as a
matching locale (or language tag) even if the application or system
offers only

"he"

as a supported locale (or language tag).

**Parameters:** ranges

- a list of comma-separated language ranges or a list of
language ranges in the form of the "Accept-Language" header
defined in

RFC
2616
**Returns:** a Language Priority List consisting of language ranges
included in the given

ranges

and their equivalent
language ranges if available. The list is modifiable.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

ranges

is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a language range or a weight
found in the given

ranges

is ill-formed

```java
public static
List
<

```

Parses the given

ranges

to generate a Language Priority
List, and then customizes the list using the given

map

.
This method is equivalent to

mapEquivalents(parse(ranges), map)

.

**Parameters:** ranges

- a list of comma-separated language ranges or a list
of language ranges in the form of the "Accept-Language" header
defined in

RFC
2616
**Parameters:** map

- a map containing information to customize language ranges
**Returns:** a Language Priority List with customization. The list is
modifiable.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

ranges

is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a language range or a weight
found in the given

ranges

is ill-formed

String
>> map)
```

Generates a new customized Language Priority List using the given

priorityList

and

map

. If the given

map

is
empty, this method returns a copy of the given

priorityList

.

In the map, a key represents a language range whereas a value is
a list of equivalents of it.

'*'

cannot be used in the map.
Each equivalent language range has the same weight value as its
original language range.

```java
An example of map:

Key

Value

"zh" (Chinese) "zh",
"zh-Hans"(Simplified Chinese)
"zh-HK" (Chinese, Hong Kong) "zh-HK"
"zh-TW" (Chinese, Taiwan) "zh-TW"
```

The customization is performed after modification using the IANA
Language Subtag Registry.

For example, if a user's Language Priority List consists of five
language ranges (

"zh"

,

"zh-CN"

,

"en"

,

"zh-TW"

, and

"zh-HK"

), the newly generated Language
Priority List which is customized using the above map example will
consists of

"zh"

,

"zh-Hans"

,

"zh-CN"

,

"zh-Hans-CN"

,

"en"

,

"zh-TW"

, and

"zh-HK"

.

"zh-HK"

Method Detail

- getRange

```java
public
String
getRange()
```

Returns the language range of this

LanguageRange

.

**Returns:** the language range.

- getWeight

```java
public double getWeight()
```

Returns the weight of this

LanguageRange

.

**Returns:** the weight value.

- parse

```java
public static
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> parse​(
String
ranges)
```

Parses the given

ranges

to generate a Language Priority List.

This method performs a syntactic check for each language range in
the given

ranges

but doesn't do validation using the IANA
Language Subtag Registry.

The

ranges

to be given can take one of the following
forms:

```java
"Accept-Language: ja,en;q=0.4" (weighted list with Accept-Language prefix)
"ja,en;q=0.4" (weighted list)
"ja,en" (prioritized list)
```

In a weighted list, each language range is given a weight value.
The weight value is identical to the "quality value" in

RFC 2616

, and it
expresses how much the user prefers the language. A weight value is
specified after a corresponding language range followed by

";q="

, and the default weight value is

MAX_WEIGHT

when it is omitted.

Unlike a weighted list, language ranges in a prioritized list
are sorted in the descending order based on its priority. The first
language range has the highest priority and meets the user's
preference most.

In either case, language ranges are sorted in descending order in
the Language Priority List based on priority or weight. If a
language range appears in the given

ranges

more than once,
only the first one is included on the Language Priority List.

The returned list consists of language ranges from the given

ranges

and their equivalents found in the IANA Language
Subtag Registry. For example, if the given

ranges

is

"Accept-Language: iw,en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3"

, the elements in
the list to be returned are:

```java
Range

Weight

"iw" (older tag for Hebrew) 1.0
"he" (new preferred code for Hebrew) 1.0
"en-us" (English, United States) 0.7
"en" (English) 0.3
```

Two language ranges,

"iw"

and

"he"

, have the same
highest priority in the list. By adding

"he"

to the user's
Language Priority List, locale-matching method can find Hebrew as a
matching locale (or language tag) even if the application or system
offers only

"he"

as a supported locale (or language tag).

**Parameters:** ranges

- a list of comma-separated language ranges or a list of
language ranges in the form of the "Accept-Language" header
defined in

RFC
2616
**Returns:** a Language Priority List consisting of language ranges
included in the given

ranges

and their equivalent
language ranges if available. The list is modifiable.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

ranges

is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a language range or a weight
found in the given

ranges

is ill-formed

- parse

```java
public static
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> parse​(
String
ranges,

Map
<
String
,​
List
<
String
>> map)
```

Parses the given

ranges

to generate a Language Priority
List, and then customizes the list using the given

map

.
This method is equivalent to

mapEquivalents(parse(ranges), map)

.

**Parameters:** ranges

- a list of comma-separated language ranges or a list
of language ranges in the form of the "Accept-Language" header
defined in

RFC
2616
**Parameters:** map

- a map containing information to customize language ranges
**Returns:** a Language Priority List with customization. The list is
modifiable.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

ranges

is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a language range or a weight
found in the given

ranges

is ill-formed
**See Also:** parse(String)

,

mapEquivalents(java.util.List<java.util.Locale.LanguageRange>, java.util.Map<java.lang.String, java.util.List<java.lang.String>>)

- mapEquivalents

```java
public static
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> mapEquivalents​(
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> priorityList,

Map
<
String
,​
List
<
String
>> map)
```

Generates a new customized Language Priority List using the given

priorityList

and

map

. If the given

map

is
empty, this method returns a copy of the given

priorityList

.

In the map, a key represents a language range whereas a value is
a list of equivalents of it.

'*'

cannot be used in the map.
Each equivalent language range has the same weight value as its
original language range.

```java
An example of map:

Key

Value

"zh" (Chinese) "zh",
"zh-Hans"(Simplified Chinese)
"zh-HK" (Chinese, Hong Kong) "zh-HK"
"zh-TW" (Chinese, Taiwan) "zh-TW"
```

The customization is performed after modification using the IANA
Language Subtag Registry.

For example, if a user's Language Priority List consists of five
language ranges (

"zh"

,

"zh-CN"

,

"en"

,

"zh-TW"

, and

"zh-HK"

), the newly generated Language
Priority List which is customized using the above map example will
consists of

"zh"

,

"zh-Hans"

,

"zh-CN"

,

"zh-Hans-CN"

,

"en"

,

"zh-TW"

, and

"zh-HK"

.

"zh-HK"

and

"zh-TW"

aren't converted to

"zh-Hans-HK"

nor

"zh-Hans-TW"

even if they are
included in the Language Priority List. In this example, mapping
is used to clearly distinguish Simplified Chinese and Traditional
Chinese.

If the

"zh"

-to-

"zh"

mapping isn't included in the
map, a simple replacement will be performed and the customized list
won't include

"zh"

and

"zh-CN"

.

**Parameters:** priorityList

- user's Language Priority List
**Parameters:** map

- a map containing information to customize language ranges
**Returns:** a new Language Priority List with customization. The list is
modifiable.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

priorityList

is

null
**See Also:** parse(String, Map)

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns a hash code value for the object.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** a hash code value for this object.
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(

obj)
```

Compares this object to the specified object. The result is true if
and only if the argument is not

null

and is a

LanguageRange

object that contains the same

range

and

weight

values as this object.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the object to compare with
**Returns:** true

if this object's

range

and

weight

are the same as the

obj

's;

false

otherwise.
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns an informative string representation of this

LanguageRange

object, consisting of language range and weight if the range is
weighted and the weight is less than the max weight.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of this

LanguageRange

object.

Parses the given

ranges

to generate a Language Priority
List, and then customizes the list using the given

map

.
This method is equivalent to

mapEquivalents(parse(ranges), map)

.

mapEquivalents

```java
public static
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> mapEquivalents​(
List
<
Locale.LanguageRange
> priorityList,

Map
<
String
,​
List
<
String
>> map)
```

Generates a new customized Language Priority List using the given

priorityList

and

map

. If the given

map

is
empty, this method returns a copy of the given

priorityList

.

In the map, a key represents a language range whereas a value is
a list of equivalents of it.

'*'

cannot be used in the map.
Each equivalent language range has the same weight value as its
original language range.

```java
An example of map:

Key

Value

"zh" (Chinese) "zh",
"zh-Hans"(Simplified Chinese)
"zh-HK" (Chinese, Hong Kong) "zh-HK"
"zh-TW" (Chinese, Taiwan) "zh-TW"
```

The customization is performed after modification using the IANA
Language Subtag Registry.

For example, if a user's Language Priority List consists of five
language ranges (

"zh"

,

"zh-CN"

,

"en"

,

"zh-TW"

, and

"zh-HK"

), the newly generated Language
Priority List which is customized using the above map example will
consists of

"zh"

,

"zh-Hans"

,

"zh-CN"

,

"zh-Hans-CN"

,

"en"

,

"zh-TW"

, and

"zh-HK"

.

"zh-HK"

and

"zh-TW"

aren't converted to

"zh-Hans-HK"

nor

"zh-Hans-TW"

even if they are
included in the Language Priority List. In this example, mapping
is used to clearly distinguish Simplified Chinese and Traditional
Chinese.

If the

"zh"

-to-

"zh"

mapping isn't included in the
map, a simple replacement will be performed and the customized list
won't include

"zh"

and

"zh-CN"

.

**Parameters:** priorityList

- user's Language Priority List
**Parameters:** map

- a map containing information to customize language ranges
**Returns:** a new Language Priority List with customization. The list is
modifiable.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

priorityList

is

null
