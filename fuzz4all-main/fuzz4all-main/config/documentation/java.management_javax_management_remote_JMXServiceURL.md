# Class JMXServiceURL

**Source:** `java.management\javax\management\remote\JMXServiceURL.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
JMXServiceURL

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

The address of a JMX API connector server. Instances of this class
are immutable.

The address is an

Abstract Service URL

for SLP, as
defined in RFC 2609 and amended by RFC 3111. It must look like
this:

service:jmx:

protocol

:

sap

Here,

protocol

is the transport
protocol to be used to connect to the connector server. It is
a string of one or more ASCII characters, each of which is a
letter, a digit, or one of the characters

+

or

-

. The first character must be a letter.
Uppercase letters are converted into lowercase ones.

sap

is the address at which the connector
server is found. This address uses a subset of the syntax defined
by RFC 2609 for IP-based protocols. It is a subset because the

user@host

syntax is not supported.

The other syntaxes defined by RFC 2609 are not currently
supported by this class.

The supported syntax is:

//

[host[

:

port]][url-path]

Square brackets

[]

indicate optional parts of
the address. Not all protocols will recognize all optional
parts.

The

host

is a host name, an IPv4 numeric
host address, or an IPv6 numeric address enclosed in square
brackets.

The

port

is a decimal port number. 0
means a default or anonymous port, depending on the protocol.

The

host

and

port

can be omitted. The

port

cannot be supplied
without a

host

.

The

url-path

, if any, begins with a slash
(

/

) or a semicolon (

;

) and continues to
the end of the address. It can contain attributes using the
semicolon syntax specified in RFC 2609. Those attributes are not
parsed by this class and incorrect attribute syntax is not
detected.

Although it is legal according to RFC 2609 to have a

url-path

that begins with a semicolon, not
all implementations of SLP allow it, so it is recommended to avoid
that syntax.

Case is not significant in the initial

service:jmx:

protocol

string or in the host
part of the address. Depending on the protocol, case can be
significant in the

url-path

.

### Constructor Details

#### public JMXServiceURL​(
String
serviceURL)
throws
MalformedURLException

Constructs a

JMXServiceURL

by parsing a Service URL
string.

**Parameters:**
- serviceURL

- the URL string to be parsed.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

serviceURL

is
null.
- MalformedURLException

- if

serviceURL

does not conform to the syntax for an Abstract Service URL or
if it is not a valid name for a JMX Remote API service. A

JMXServiceURL

must begin with the string

"service:jmx:"

(case-insensitive). It must not
contain any characters that are not printable ASCII characters.

---

#### public JMXServiceURL​(
String
protocol,

String
host,
int port)
throws
MalformedURLException

Constructs a

JMXServiceURL

with the given protocol,
host, and port. This constructor is equivalent to

JMXServiceURL(protocol, host, port, null)

.

**Parameters:**
- protocol

- the protocol part of the URL. If null, defaults
to

jmxmp

.
- host

- the host part of the URL. If host is null and if
local host name can be resolved to an IP, then host defaults
to local host name as determined by

InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()

. If host is null
and if local host name cannot be resolved to an IP, then host
defaults to numeric IP address of one of the active network interfaces.
If host is a numeric IPv6 address, it can optionally be enclosed in
square brackets

[]

.
- port

- the port part of the URL.

**Throws:**
- MalformedURLException

- if one of the parts is
syntactically incorrect, or if

host

is null and it
is not possible to find the local host name, or if

port

is negative.

---

#### public JMXServiceURL​(
String
protocol,

String
host,
int port,

String
urlPath)
throws
MalformedURLException

Constructs a

JMXServiceURL

with the given parts.

**Parameters:**
- protocol

- the protocol part of the URL. If null, defaults
to

jmxmp

.
- host

- the host part of the URL. If host is null and if
local host name can be resolved to an IP, then host defaults
to local host name as determined by

InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()

. If host is null
and if local host name cannot be resolved to an IP, then host
defaults to numeric IP address of one of the active network interfaces.
If host is a numeric IPv6 address, it can optionally be enclosed in
square brackets

[]

.
- port

- the port part of the URL.
- urlPath

- the URL path part of the URL. If null, defaults to
the empty string.

**Throws:**
- MalformedURLException

- if one of the parts is
syntactically incorrect, or if

host

is null and it
is not possible to find the local host name, or if

port

is negative.

---

### Method Details

#### public
String
getProtocol()

The protocol part of the Service URL.

**Returns:**
- the protocol part of the Service URL. This is never null.

---

#### public
String
getHost()

The host part of the Service URL. If the Service URL was
constructed with the constructor that takes a URL string
parameter, the result is the substring specifying the host in
that URL. If the Service URL was constructed with a
constructor that takes a separate host parameter, the result is
the string that was specified. If that string was null, the
result is

InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()

if local host name
can be resolved to an IP. Else numeric IP address of an active
network interface will be used.

In either case, if the host was specified using the

[...]

syntax for numeric IPv6 addresses, the
square brackets are not included in the return value here.

**Returns:**
- the host part of the Service URL. This is never null.

---

#### public int getPort()

The port of the Service URL. If no port was
specified, the returned value is 0.

**Returns:**
- the port of the Service URL, or 0 if none.

---

#### public
String
getURLPath()

The URL Path part of the Service URL. This is an empty
string, or a string beginning with a slash (

/

), or
a string beginning with a semicolon (

;

).

**Returns:**
- the URL Path part of the Service URL. This is never
null.

---

#### public
String
toString()

The string representation of this Service URL. If the value
returned by this method is supplied to the

JMXServiceURL

constructor, the resultant object is
equal to this one.

The

host

part of the returned string
is the value returned by

getHost()

. If that value
specifies a numeric IPv6 address, it is surrounded by square
brackets

[]

.

The

port

part of the returned string
is the value returned by

getPort()

in its shortest
decimal form. If the value is zero, it is omitted.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- the string representation of this Service URL.

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Indicates whether some other object is equal to this one.
This method returns true if and only if

obj

is an
instance of

JMXServiceURL

whose

getProtocol()

,

getHost()

,

getPort()

, and

getURLPath()

methods return the same values as for
this object. The values for

getProtocol()

and

getHost()

can differ in case without affecting equality.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the reference object with which to compare.

**Returns:**
- true

if this object is the same as the

obj

argument;

false

String
getURLPath()
```

The URL Path part of the Service URL. This is an empty
string, or a string beginning with a slash (

/

), or
a string beginning with a semicolon (

;

).

**Returns:** the URL Path part of the Service URL. This is never
null.

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

The string representation of this Service URL. If the value
returned by this method is supplied to the

JMXServiceURL

constructor, the resultant object is
equal to this one.

The

host

part of the returned string
is the value returned by

getHost()

. If that value
specifies a numeric IPv6 address, it is surrounded by square
brackets

[]

.

The

port

part of the returned string
is the value returned by

getPort()

in its shortest

- the host part of the URL. If host is null and if
local host name can be resolved to an IP, then host defaults
to local host name as determined by

InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()

. If host is null
and if local host name cannot be resolved to an IP, then host
defaults to numeric IP address of one of the active network interfaces.
If host is a numeric IPv6 address, it can optionally be enclosed in
square brackets

[]

.
**Parameters:** port

- the port part of the URL.
**Throws:** MalformedURLException

- if one of the parts is
syntactically incorrect, or if

host

is null and it
is not possible to find the local host name, or if

port

is negative.

Method Detail

- getProtocol

```java
public
String
getProtocol()
```

The protocol part of the Service URL.

**Returns:** the protocol part of the Service URL. This is never null.

- getHost

```java
public
String
getHost()
```

The host part of the Service URL. If the Service URL was
constructed with the constructor that takes a URL string
parameter, the result is the substring specifying the host in
that URL. If the Service URL was constructed with a
constructor that takes a separate host parameter, the result is
the string that was specified. If that string was null, the
result is

InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()

if local host name
can be resolved to an IP. Else numeric IP address of an active
network interface will be used.

In either case, if the host was specified using the

[...]

syntax for numeric IPv6 addresses, the
square brackets are not included in the return value here.

**Returns:** the host part of the Service URL. This is never null.

- getPort

```java
public int getPort()
```

The port of the Service URL. If no port was
specified, the returned value is 0.

**Returns:** the port of the Service URL, or 0 if none.

- getURLPath

```java
public
String
getURLPath()
```

The URL Path part of the Service URL. This is an empty
string, or a string beginning with a slash (

/

), or
a string beginning with a semicolon (

;

).

**Returns:** the URL Path part of the Service URL. This is never
null.

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

The string representation of this Service URL. If the value
returned by this method is supplied to the

JMXServiceURL

constructor, the resultant object is
equal to this one.

The

host

part of the returned string
is the value returned by

getHost()

. If that value
specifies a numeric IPv6 address, it is surrounded by square
brackets

[]

.

The

port

part of the returned string
is the value returned by

getPort()

in its shortest
decimal form. If the value is zero, it is omitted.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** the string representation of this Service URL.

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Indicates whether some other object is equal to this one.
This method returns true if and only if

obj

is an
instance of

JMXServiceURL

whose

getProtocol()

,

getHost()

,

getPort()

, and

getURLPath()

methods return the same values as for
this object. The values for

getProtocol()

and

getHost()

can differ in case without affecting equality.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the reference object with which to compare.
**Returns:** true

if this object is the same as the

obj

argument;

false

otherwise.
