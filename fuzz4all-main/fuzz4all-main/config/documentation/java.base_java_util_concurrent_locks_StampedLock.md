# Class StampedLock

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\concurrent\locks\StampedLock.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
StampedLock

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

A capability-based lock with three modes for controlling read/write
access. The state of a StampedLock consists of a version and mode.
Lock acquisition methods return a stamp that represents and
controls access with respect to a lock state; "try" versions of
these methods may instead return the special value zero to
represent failure to acquire access. Lock release and conversion
methods require stamps as arguments, and fail if they do not match
the state of the lock. The three modes are:

- Writing.

Method

writeLock()

possibly blocks
waiting for exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be used
in method

unlockWrite(long)

to release the lock. Untimed and
timed versions of

tryWriteLock

are also provided. When
the lock is held in write mode, no read locks may be obtained,
and all optimistic read validations will fail.

Reading.

Method

readLock()

possibly blocks
waiting for non-exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be
used in method

unlockRead(long)

to release the lock. Untimed
and timed versions of

tryReadLock

are also provided.

Optimistic Reading.

Method

tryOptimisticRead()

returns a non-zero stamp only if the lock is not currently held
in write mode. Method

validate(long)

returns true if the lock
has not been acquired in write mode since obtaining a given
stamp. This mode can be thought of as an extremely weak version
of a read-lock, that can be broken by a writer at any time. The
use of optimistic mode for short read-only code segments often
reduces contention and improves throughput. However, its use is
inherently fragile. Optimistic read sections should only read
fields and hold them in local variables for later use after
validation. Fields read while in optimistic mode may be wildly
inconsistent, so usage applies only when you are familiar enough
with data representations to check consistency and/or repeatedly
invoke method

validate()

. For example, such steps are
typically required when first reading an object or array
reference, and then accessing one of its fields, elements or
methods.

This class also supports methods that conditionally provide
conversions across the three modes. For example, method

tryConvertToWriteLock(long)

attempts to "upgrade" a mode, returning
a valid write stamp if (1) already in writing mode (2) in reading
mode and there are no other readers or (3) in optimistic mode and
the lock is available. The forms of these methods are designed to
help reduce some of the code bloat that otherwise occurs in
retry-based designs.

StampedLocks are designed for use as internal utilities in the
development of thread-safe components. Their use relies on
knowledge of the internal properties of the data, objects, and
methods they are protecting. They are not reentrant, so locked
bodies should not call other unknown methods that may try to
re-acquire locks (although you may pass a stamp to other methods
that can use or convert it). The use of read lock modes relies on
the associated code sections being side-effect-free. Unvalidated
optimistic read sections cannot call methods that are not known to
tolerate potential inconsistencies. Stamps use finite
representations, and are not cryptographically secure (i.e., a
valid stamp may be guessable). Stamp values may recycle after (no
sooner than) one year of continuous operation. A stamp held without
use or validation for longer than this period may fail to validate
correctly. StampedLocks are serializable, but always deserialize
into initial unlocked state, so they are not useful for remote
locking.

Like

Semaphore

, but unlike most

Lock

implementations, StampedLocks have no notion of ownership.
Locks acquired in one thread can be released or converted in another.

The scheduling policy of StampedLock does not consistently
prefer readers over writers or vice versa. All "try" methods are
best-effort and do not necessarily conform to any scheduling or
fairness policy. A zero return from any "try" method for acquiring
or converting locks does not carry any information about the state
of the lock; a subsequent invocation may succeed.

Because it supports coordinated usage across multiple lock
modes, this class does not directly implement the

Lock

or

ReadWriteLock

interfaces. However, a StampedLock may be
viewed

asReadLock()

,

asWriteLock()

, or

asReadWriteLock()

in applications requiring only the associated
set of functionality.

Sample Usage.

The following illustrates some usage idioms
in a class that maintains simple two-dimensional points. The sample
code illustrates some try/catch conventions even though they are
not strictly needed here because no exceptions can occur in their
bodies.

```java
class Point {
private double x, y;
private final StampedLock sl = new StampedLock();

// an exclusively locked method
void move(double deltaX, double deltaY) {
long stamp = sl.writeLock();
try {
x += deltaX;
y += deltaY;
} finally {
sl.unlockWrite(stamp);
}
}

// a read-only method
// upgrade from optimistic read to read lock
double distanceFromOrigin() {
long stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead();
try {
retryHoldingLock: for (;; stamp = sl.readLock()) {
if (stamp == 0L)
continue retryHoldingLock;
// possibly racy reads
double currentX = x;
double currentY = y;
if (!sl.validate(stamp))
continue retryHoldingLock;
return Math.hypot(currentX, currentY);
}
} finally {
if (StampedLock.isReadLockStamp(stamp))
sl.unlockRead(stamp);
}
}

// upgrade from optimistic read to write lock
void moveIfAtOrigin(double newX, double newY) {
long stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead();
try {
retryHoldingLock: for (;; stamp = sl.writeLock()) {
if (stamp == 0L)
continue retryHoldingLock;
// possibly racy reads
double currentX = x;
double currentY = y;
if (!sl.validate(stamp))
continue retryHoldingLock;
if (currentX != 0.0 || currentY != 0.0)
break;
stamp = sl.tryConvertToWriteLock(stamp);
if (stamp == 0L)
continue retryHoldingLock;
// exclusive access
x = newX;
y = newY;
return;
}
} finally {
if (StampedLock.isWriteLockStamp(stamp))
sl.unlockWrite(stamp);
}
}

// Upgrade read lock to write lock
void moveIfAtOrigin(double newX, double newY) {
long stamp = sl.readLock();
try {
while (x == 0.0 && y == 0.0) {
long ws = sl.tryConvertToWriteLock(stamp);
if (ws != 0L) {
stamp = ws;
x = newX;
y = newY;
break;
}
else {
sl.unlockRead(stamp);
stamp = sl.writeLock();
}
}
} finally {
sl.unlock(stamp);
}
}
}
```

A capability-based lock with three modes for controlling read/write
access. The state of a StampedLock consists of a version and mode.
Lock acquisition methods return a stamp that represents and
controls access with respect to a lock state; "try" versions of
these methods may instead return the special value zero to
represent failure to acquire access. Lock release and conversion
methods require stamps as arguments, and fail if they do not match
the state of the lock. The three modes are:

- Writing.

Method

writeLock()

possibly blocks
waiting for exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be used
in method

unlockWrite(long)

to release the lock. Untimed and
timed versions of

tryWriteLock

are also provided. When
the lock is held in write mode, no read locks may be obtained,
and all optimistic read validations will fail.

Reading.

Method

readLock()

possibly blocks
waiting for non-exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be
used in method

unlockRead(long)

to release the lock. Untimed
and timed versions of

tryReadLock

are also provided.

Optimistic Reading.

Method

tryOptimisticRead()

returns a non-zero stamp only if the lock is not currently held
in write mode. Method

validate(long)

returns true if the lock
has not been acquired in write mode since obtaining a given
stamp. This mode can be thought of as an extremely weak version
of a read-lock, that can be broken by a writer at any time. The

invoke method

validate()

. For example, such steps are
typically required when first reading an object or array
reference, and then accessing one of its fields, elements or
methods.

This class also supports methods that conditionally provide
conversions across the three modes. For example, method

tryConvertToWriteLock(long)

attempts to "upgrade" a mode, returning
a valid write stamp if (1) already in writing mode (2) in reading
mode and there are no other readers or (3) in optimistic mode and
the lock is available. The forms of these methods are designed to
help reduce some of the code bloat that otherwise occurs in
retry-based designs.

StampedLocks are designed for use as internal utilities in the

Writing.

Method

writeLock()

possibly blocks
waiting for exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be used
in method

unlockWrite(long)

to release the lock. Untimed and
timed versions of

tryWriteLock

are also provided. When
the lock is held in write mode, no read locks may be obtained,
and all optimistic read validations will fail.

Reading.

Method

readLock()

possibly blocks
waiting for non-exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be
used in method

unlockRead(long)

to release the lock. Untimed
and timed versions of

tryReadLock

are also provided.

Optimistic Reading.

Method

tryOptimisticRead()

returns a non-zero stamp only if the lock is not currently held
in write mode. Method

validate(long)

returns true if the lock
has not been acquired in write mode since obtaining a given
stamp. This mode can be thought of as an extremely weak version
of a read-lock, that can be broken by a writer at any time. The
use of optimistic mode for short read-only code segments often
reduces contention and improves throughput. However, its use is
inherently fragile. Optimistic read sections should only read
fields and hold them in local variables for later use after
validation. Fields read while in optimistic mode may be wildly
inconsistent, so usage applies only when you are familiar enough
with data representations to check consistency and/or repeatedly
invoke method

validate()

. For example, such steps are
typically required when first reading an object or array
reference, and then accessing one of its fields, elements or
methods.

This class also supports methods that conditionally provide
conversions across the three modes. For example, method

tryConvertToWriteLock(long)

attempts to "upgrade" a mode, returning
a valid write stamp if (1) already in writing mode (2) in reading
mode and there are no other readers or (3) in optimistic mode and
the lock is available. The forms of these methods are designed to
help reduce some of the code bloat that otherwise occurs in
retry-based designs.

StampedLocks are designed for use as internal utilities in the
development of thread-safe components. Their use relies on
knowledge of the internal properties of the data, objects, and
methods they are protecting. They are not reentrant, so locked
bodies should not call other unknown methods that may try to
re-acquire locks (although you may pass a stamp to other methods
that can use or convert it). The use of read lock modes relies on
the associated code sections being side-effect-free. Unvalidated
optimistic read sections cannot call methods that are not known to
tolerate potential inconsistencies. Stamps use finite
representations, and are not cryptographically secure (i.e., a
valid stamp may be guessable). Stamp values may recycle after (no
sooner than) one year of continuous operation. A stamp held without
use or validation for longer than this period may fail to validate
correctly. StampedLocks are serializable, but always deserialize
into initial unlocked state, so they are not useful for remote
locking.

Like

Semaphore

, but unlike most

Lock

implementations, StampedLocks have no notion of ownership.
Locks acquired in one thread can be released or converted in another.

The scheduling policy of StampedLock does not consistently
prefer readers over writers or vice versa. All "try" methods are
best-effort and do not necessarily conform to any scheduling or
fairness policy. A zero return from any "try" method for acquiring
or converting locks does not carry any information about the state
of the lock; a subsequent invocation may succeed.

Because it supports coordinated usage across multiple lock
modes, this class does not directly implement the

Lock

or

ReadWriteLock

interfaces. However, a StampedLock may be
viewed

asReadLock()

,

asWriteLock()

, or

asReadWriteLock()

in applications requiring only the associated
set of functionality.

Sample Usage.

The following illustrates some usage idioms
in a class that maintains simple two-dimensional points. The sample
code illustrates some try/catch conventions even though they are
not strictly needed here because no exceptions can occur in their
bodies.

```java
class Point {
private double x, y;
private final StampedLock sl = new StampedLock();

// an exclusively locked method
void move(double deltaX, double deltaY) {
long stamp = sl.writeLock();
try {
x += deltaX;
y += deltaY;
} finally {
sl.unlockWrite(stamp);
}
}

// a read-only method
// upgrade from optimistic read to read lock
double distanceFromOrigin() {
long stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead();
try {
retryHoldingLock: for (;; stamp = sl.readLock()) {
if (stamp == 0L)
continue retryHoldingLock;
// possibly racy reads
double currentX = x;
double currentY = y;
if (!sl.validate(stamp))
continue retryHoldingLock;
return Math.hypot(currentX, currentY);
}
} finally {
if (StampedLock.isReadLockStamp(stamp))
sl.unlockRead(stamp);
}
}

// upgrade from optimistic read to write lock
void moveIfAtOrigin(double newX, double newY) {
long stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead();
try {
retryHoldingLock: for (;; stamp = sl.writeLock()) {
if (stamp == 0L)
continue retryHoldingLock;
// possibly racy reads
double currentX = x;
double currentY = y;
if (!sl.validate(stamp))
continue retryHoldingLock;
if (currentX != 0.0 || currentY != 0.0)
break;
stamp = sl.tryConvertToWriteLock(stamp);
if (stamp == 0L)
continue retryHoldingLock;
// exclusive access
x = newX;
y = newY;
return;
}
} finally {
if (StampedLock.isWriteLockStamp(stamp))
sl.unlockWrite(stamp);
}
}

// Upgrade read lock to write lock
void moveIfAtOrigin(double newX, double newY) {
long stamp = sl.readLock();
try {
while (x == 0.0 && y == 0.0) {
long ws = sl.tryConvertToWriteLock(stamp);
if (ws != 0L) {
stamp = ws;
x = newX;

break;
}
