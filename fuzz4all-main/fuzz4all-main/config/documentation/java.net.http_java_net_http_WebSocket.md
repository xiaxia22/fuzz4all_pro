# Interface WebSocket

**Source:** `java.net.http\java\net\http\WebSocket.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
WebSocket
```

A WebSocket Client.

WebSocket

instances are created through

WebSocket.Builder

.

WebSocket has an input and an output side. These sides are independent
from each other. A side can either be open or closed. Once closed, the side
remains closed. WebSocket messages are sent through a

WebSocket

and
received through a

WebSocket.Listener

associated with it. Messages
can be sent until the WebSocket's output is closed, and received until the
WebSocket's input is closed.

A send method is any of the

sendText

,

sendBinary

,

sendPing

,

sendPong

and

sendClose

methods of

WebSocket

. A send method initiates a send operation and returns a

CompletableFuture

which completes once the operation has completed.
If the

CompletableFuture

completes normally the operation is
considered succeeded. If the

CompletableFuture

completes
exceptionally, the operation is considered failed. An operation that has been
initiated but not yet completed is considered pending.

A receive method is any of the

onText

,

onBinary

,

onPing

,

onPong

and

onClose

methods of

Listener

. WebSocket initiates a receive operation by invoking a
receive method on the listener. The listener then must return a

CompletionStage

which completes once the operation has completed.

To control receiving of messages, a WebSocket maintains an

internal counter

. This counter's value is a number of
times the WebSocket has yet to invoke a receive method. While this counter is
zero the WebSocket does not invoke receive methods. The counter is
incremented by

n

when

request(n)

is called. The counter is
decremented by one when the WebSocket invokes a receive method.

onOpen

and

onError

are not receive methods. WebSocket invokes

onOpen

prior to any other methods on the listener. WebSocket invokes

onOpen

at most once. WebSocket may invoke

onError

at any
given time. If the WebSocket invokes

onError

or

onClose

, then
no further listener's methods will be invoked, no matter the value of the
counter. For a newly built WebSocket the counter is zero.

Unless otherwise stated,

null

arguments will cause methods
of

WebSocket

to throw

NullPointerException

, similarly,

WebSocket

will not pass

null

arguments to methods of

Listener

. The state of a WebSocket is not changed by the invocations
that throw or return a

CompletableFuture

that completes with one of
the

NullPointerException

,

IllegalArgumentException

,

IllegalStateException

exceptions.

WebSocket

handles received Ping and Close messages automatically
(as per the WebSocket Protocol) by replying with Pong and Close messages. If
the listener receives Ping or Close messages, no mandatory actions from the
listener are required.

**API Note:** The relationship between a WebSocket and the associated Listener is
analogous to that of a Subscription and the associated Subscriber of type

Flow

.

### Field Details

#### static final int NORMAL_CLOSURE

The WebSocket Close message status code (

1000

),
indicating normal closure, meaning that the purpose for which the
connection was established has been fulfilled.

**See Also:**
- sendClose(int, String)

,

WebSocket.Listener.onClose(WebSocket, int, String)

,

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendText​(
CharSequence
data,
boolean last)

Sends textual data with characters from the given character sequence.

The character sequence must not be modified until the

CompletableFuture

returned from this method has completed.

A

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalStateException

-
if there is a pending text or binary send operation
or if the previous binary data does not complete the message

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

**Parameters:**
- data

- the data
- last

-

true

if this invocation completes the message,

false

otherwise

**Returns:**
- a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the data has been sent

**Implementation Note:**
- If

data

is a malformed UTF-16 sequence, the operation
will fail with

IOException

.

---

#### CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendBinary​(
ByteBuffer
data,
boolean last)

Sends binary data with bytes from the given buffer.

The data is located in bytes from the buffer's position to its limit.
Upon normal completion of a

CompletableFuture

returned from this
method the buffer will have no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be
accessed until after that.

The

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalStateException

-
if there is a pending text or binary send operation
or if the previous textual data does not complete the message

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

**Parameters:**
- data

- the data
- last

-

true

if this invocation completes the message,

false

otherwise

**Returns:**
- a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the data has been sent

---

#### CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendPing​(
ByteBuffer
message)

Sends a Ping message with bytes from the given buffer.

The message consists of not more than

125

bytes from the
buffer's position to its limit. Upon normal completion of a

CompletableFuture

returned from this method the buffer will
have no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be accessed until after that.

The

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalStateException

-
if there is a pending ping or pong send operation

IllegalArgumentException

-
if the message is too long

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

**Parameters:**
- message

- the message

**Returns:**
- a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the Ping message has been sent

---

#### CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendPong​(
ByteBuffer
message)

Sends a Pong message with bytes from the given buffer.

The message consists of not more than

125

bytes from the
buffer's position to its limit. Upon normal completion of a

CompletableFuture

returned from this method the buffer will have
no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be accessed until after that.

Given that the WebSocket implementation will automatically send a
reciprocal pong when a ping is received, it is rarely required to send a
pong message explicitly.

The

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalStateException

-
if there is a pending ping or pong send operation

IllegalArgumentException

-
if the message is too long

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

**Parameters:**
- message

- the message

**Returns:**
- a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the Pong message has been sent

---

#### CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendClose​(int statusCode,

String
reason)

Initiates an orderly closure of this WebSocket's output by
sending a Close message with the given status code and the reason.

The

statusCode

is an integer from the range

1000 <= code <= 4999

. Status codes

1002

,

1003

,

1006

,

1007

,

1009

,

1010

,

1012

,

1013

and

1015

are illegal. Behaviour in respect to other
status codes is implementation-specific. A legal

reason

is a
string that has a UTF-8 representation not longer than

123

bytes.

A

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalArgumentException

-
if

statusCode

is illegal, or
if

reason

is illegal

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

Unless the

CompletableFuture

returned from this method
completes with

IllegalArgumentException

, or the method throws

NullPointerException

, the output will be closed.

If not already closed, the input remains open until a Close message

received

, or

abort

is invoked, or an

error

occurs.

**Parameters:**
- statusCode

- the status code
- reason

- the reason

**Returns:**
- a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the Close message has been sent

**API Note:**
- Use the provided integer constant

NORMAL_CLOSURE

as a
status code and an empty string as a reason in a typical case:

```java
CompletableFuture<WebSocket> webSocket = ...
webSocket.thenCompose(ws -> ws.sendText("Hello, ", false))
.thenCompose(ws -> ws.sendText("world!", true))
.thenCompose(ws -> ws.sendClose(WebSocket.NORMAL_CLOSURE, ""))
.join();
```

The

sendClose

method does not close this WebSocket's input. It
merely closes this WebSocket's output by sending a Close message. To
enforce closing the input, invoke the

abort

method. Here is an
example of an application that sends a Close message, and then starts a
timer. Once no data has been received within the specified timeout, the
timer goes off and the alarm aborts

WebSocket

:

```java
MyAlarm alarm = new MyAlarm(webSocket::abort);
WebSocket.Listener listener = new WebSocket.Listener() {

public CompletionStage<?> onText(WebSocket webSocket,
CharSequence data,
boolean last) {
alarm.snooze();
...
}
...
};
...
Runnable startTimer = () -> {
MyTimer idleTimer = new MyTimer();
idleTimer.add(alarm, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
};
webSocket.sendClose(WebSocket.NORMAL_CLOSURE, "ok").thenRun(startTimer);
```

---

#### void request​(long n)

Increments the counter of invocations of receive methods.

This WebSocket will invoke

onText

,

onBinary

,

onPing

,

onPong

or

onClose

methods on the
associated listener (i.e. receive methods) up to

n

more times.

**Parameters:**
- n

- the number of invocations

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

n <= 0

**API Note:**
- The parameter of this method is the number of invocations being
requested from this WebSocket to the associated listener, not the number
of messages. Sometimes a message may be delivered to the listener in a
single invocation, but not always. For example, Ping, Pong and Close
messages are delivered in a single invocation of

onPing

,

onPong

and

onClose

methods respectively. However, whether
or not Text and Binary messages are delivered in a single invocation of

onText

and

onBinary

methods depends on the boolean
argument (

last

) of these methods. If

last

is

false

, then there is more to a message than has been delivered to
the invocation.

Here is an example of a listener that requests invocations, one at a
time, until a complete message has been accumulated, and then processes
the result:

```java
WebSocket.Listener listener = new WebSocket.Listener() {

StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

public CompletionStage<?> onText(WebSocket webSocket,
CharSequence message,
boolean last) {
text.append(message);
if (last) {
processCompleteTextMessage(text);
text = new StringBuilder();
}
webSocket.request(1);
return null;
}
...
}
```

---

#### String
getSubprotocol()

Returns the subprotocol used by this WebSocket.

**Returns:**
- the subprotocol, or an empty string if there's no subprotocol

---

#### boolean isOutputClosed()

Tells whether this WebSocket's output is closed.

If this method returns

true

, subsequent invocations will also
return

true

.

**Returns:**
- true

if closed,

false

otherwise

---

#### boolean isInputClosed()

Tells whether this WebSocket's input is closed.

If this method returns

true

, subsequent invocations will also
return

true

.

**Returns:**
- true

if closed,

false

otherwise

---

#### void abort()

Closes this WebSocket's input and output abruptly.

When this method returns both the input and the output will have been
closed. Any pending send operations will fail with

IOException

.
Subsequent invocations of

abort

will have no effect.

A WebSocket Client.

WebSocket

instances are created through

WebSocket.Builder

.

WebSocket has an input and an output side. These sides are independent
from each other. A side can either be open or closed. Once closed, the side
remains closed. WebSocket messages are sent through a

WebSocket

and
received through a

WebSocket.Listener

associated with it. Messages
can be sent until the WebSocket's output is closed, and received until the
WebSocket's input is closed.

A send method is any of the

sendText

,

sendBinary

,

sendPing

,

sendPong

and

sendClose

methods of

WebSocket

. A send method initiates a send operation and returns a

CompletableFuture

which completes once the operation has completed.
If the

CompletableFuture

completes normally the operation is
considered succeeded. If the

CompletableFuture

completes
exceptionally, the operation is considered failed. An operation that has been
initiated but not yet completed is considered pending.

A receive method is any of the

onText

,

onBinary

,

onPing

,

onPong

and

onClose

methods of

Listener

. WebSocket initiates a receive operation by invoking a
receive method on the listener. The listener then must return a

CompletionStage

which completes once the operation has completed.

To control receiving of messages, a WebSocket maintains an

internal counter

. This counter's value is a number of
times the WebSocket has yet to invoke a receive method. While this counter is
zero the WebSocket does not invoke receive methods. The counter is
incremented by

n

when

request(n)

is called. The counter is
decremented by one when the WebSocket invokes a receive method.

onOpen

and

onError

are not receive methods. WebSocket invokes

onOpen

prior to any other methods on the listener. WebSocket invokes

onOpen

at most once. WebSocket may invoke

onError

at any
given time. If the WebSocket invokes

onError

or

onClose

, then
no further listener's methods will be invoked, no matter the value of the
counter. For a newly built WebSocket the counter is zero.

Unless otherwise stated,

null

arguments will cause methods
of

WebSocket

to throw

NullPointerException

, similarly,

WebSocket

will not pass

null

arguments to methods of

Listener

. The state of a WebSocket is not changed by the invocations
that throw or return a

CompletableFuture

that completes with one of
the

NullPointerException

,

IllegalArgumentException

,

IllegalStateException

exceptions.

- Method Detail

- sendText

```java
CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendText​(
CharSequence
data,
boolean last)
```

Sends textual data with characters from the given character sequence.

The character sequence must not be modified until the

CompletableFuture

returned from this method has completed.

A

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalStateException

-
if there is a pending text or binary send operation
or if the previous binary data does not complete the message

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

**Implementation Note:** If

data

is a malformed UTF-16 sequence, the operation
will fail with

IOException

.
**Parameters:** data

- the data
**Parameters:** last

-

true

if this invocation completes the message,

false

otherwise
**Returns:** a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the data has been sent

- sendBinary

```java
CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendBinary​(
ByteBuffer
data,
boolean last)
```

Sends binary data with bytes from the given buffer.

The data is located in bytes from the buffer's position to its limit.
Upon normal completion of a

CompletableFuture

returned from this
method the buffer will have no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be
accessed until after that.

The

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalStateException

-
if there is a pending text or binary send operation
or if the previous textual data does not complete the message

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

**Parameters:** data

- the data
**Parameters:** last

-

true

if this invocation completes the message,

false

otherwise
**Returns:** a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the data has been sent

- sendPing

```java
CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendPing​(
ByteBuffer
message)
```

Sends a Ping message with bytes from the given buffer.

The message consists of not more than

125

bytes from the
buffer's position to its limit. Upon normal completion of a

CompletableFuture

returned from this method the buffer will
have no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be accessed until after that.

The

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalStateException

-
if there is a pending ping or pong send operation

IllegalArgumentException

-
if the message is too long

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

**Parameters:** message

- the message
**Returns:** a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the Ping message has been sent

- sendPong

```java
CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendPong​(
ByteBuffer
message)
```

Sends a Pong message with bytes from the given buffer.

The message consists of not more than

125

bytes from the
buffer's position to its limit. Upon normal completion of a

CompletableFuture

returned from this method the buffer will have
no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be accessed until after that.

Given that the WebSocket implementation will automatically send a
reciprocal pong when a ping is received, it is rarely required to send a
pong message explicitly.

The

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalStateException

-
if there is a pending ping or pong send operation

IllegalArgumentException

-
if the message is too long

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

**Parameters:** message

- the message
**Returns:** a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the Pong message has been sent

- sendClose

```java
CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendClose​(int statusCode,

String
reason)
```

Initiates an orderly closure of this WebSocket's output by
sending a Close message with the given status code and the reason.

The

statusCode

is an integer from the range

1000 <= code <= 4999

. Status codes

1002

,

1003

,

1006

,

1007

,

1009

,

1010

,

1012

,

1013

and

1015

are illegal. Behaviour in respect to other
status codes is implementation-specific. A legal

reason

is a
string that has a UTF-8 representation not longer than

123

bytes.

A

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalArgumentException

-
if

statusCode

is illegal, or
if

reason

is illegal

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

Unless the

CompletableFuture

returned from this method
completes with

IllegalArgumentException

, or the method throws

NullPointerException

, the output will be closed.

If not already closed, the input remains open until a Close message

received

, or

abort

is invoked, or an

error

occurs.

**API Note:** Use the provided integer constant

NORMAL_CLOSURE

as a
status code and an empty string as a reason in a typical case:

```java
CompletableFuture<WebSocket> webSocket = ...
webSocket.thenCompose(ws -> ws.sendText("Hello, ", false))
.thenCompose(ws -> ws.sendText("world!", true))
.thenCompose(ws -> ws.sendClose(WebSocket.NORMAL_CLOSURE, ""))
.join();
```

The

sendClose

method does not close this WebSocket's input. It
merely closes this WebSocket's output by sending a Close message. To
enforce closing the input, invoke the

abort

method. Here is an
example of an application that sends a Close message, and then starts a
timer. Once no data has been received within the specified timeout, the
timer goes off and the alarm aborts

WebSocket

:

```java
MyAlarm alarm = new MyAlarm(webSocket::abort);
WebSocket.Listener listener = new WebSocket.Listener() {

public CompletionStage<?> onText(WebSocket webSocket,
CharSequence data,
boolean last) {
alarm.snooze();
...
}
...
};
...
Runnable startTimer = () -> {
MyTimer idleTimer = new MyTimer();
idleTimer.add(alarm, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
};
webSocket.sendClose(WebSocket.NORMAL_CLOSURE, "ok").thenRun(startTimer);
```
**Parameters:** statusCode

- the status code
**Parameters:** reason

- the reason
**Returns:** a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the Close message has been sent

- request

```java
void request​(long n)
```

Increments the counter of invocations of receive methods.

This WebSocket will invoke

onText

,

onBinary

,

onPing

,

onPong

or

onClose

methods on the
associated listener (i.e. receive methods) up to

n

more times.

**API Note:** The parameter of this method is the number of invocations being
requested from this WebSocket to the associated listener, not the number
of messages. Sometimes a message may be delivered to the listener in a
single invocation, but not always. For example, Ping, Pong and Close
messages are delivered in a single invocation of

onPing

,

onPong

and

onClose

methods respectively. However, whether
or not Text and Binary messages are delivered in a single invocation of

onText

and

onBinary

methods depends on the boolean
argument (

last

) of these methods. If

last

is

false

, then there is more to a message than has been delivered to
the invocation.

Here is an example of a listener that requests invocations, one at a
time, until a complete message has been accumulated, and then processes
the result:

```java
WebSocket.Listener listener = new WebSocket.Listener() {

StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

public CompletionStage<?> onText(WebSocket webSocket,
CharSequence message,
boolean last) {
text.append(message);
if (last) {
processCompleteTextMessage(text);
text = new StringBuilder();
}
webSocket.request(1);
return null;
}
...
}
```
**Parameters:** n

- the number of invocations
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

n <= 0

- getSubprotocol

```java
String
getSubprotocol()
```

Returns the subprotocol used by this WebSocket.

**Returns:** the subprotocol, or an empty string if there's no subprotocol

- isOutputClosed

```java
boolean isOutputClosed()
```

Tells whether this WebSocket's output is closed.

If this method returns

true

, subsequent invocations will also
return

true

.

**Returns:** true

if closed,

false

otherwise

- isInputClosed

```java
boolean isInputClosed()
```

Tells whether this WebSocket's input is closed.

If this method returns

true

, subsequent invocations will also
return

true

.

**Returns:** true

if closed,

false

otherwise

- abort

```java
void abort()
```

Closes this WebSocket's input and output abruptly.

When this method returns both the input and the output will have been
closed. Any pending send operations will fail with

IOException

.
Subsequent invocations of

abort

will have no effect.

if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

The message consists of not more than

125

bytes from the
buffer's position to its limit. Upon normal completion of a

CompletableFuture

returned from this method the buffer will
have no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be accessed until after that.

The

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalStateException

-
if there is a pending ping or pong send operation

IllegalArgumentException

-
if the message is too long

sendPong

```java
CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendPong​(
ByteBuffer
message)
```

Sends a Pong message with bytes from the given buffer.

The message consists of not more than

125

bytes from the
buffer's position to its limit. Upon normal completion of a

CompletableFuture

returned from this method the buffer will have
no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be accessed until after that.

Given that the WebSocket implementation will automatically send a
reciprocal pong when a ping is received, it is rarely required to send a
pong message explicitly.

sendClose

```java
CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
> sendClose​(int statusCode,

String
reason)
```

Initiates an orderly closure of this WebSocket's output by
sending a Close message with the given status code and the reason.

The

statusCode

is an integer from the range

1000 <= code <= 4999

. Status codes

1002

,

1003

,

1006

,

1007

,

1009

,

1010

,

1012

,

1013

and

1015

are illegal. Behaviour in respect to other
status codes is implementation-specific. A legal

reason

is a
string that has a UTF-8 representation not longer than

123

bytes.

A

CompletableFuture

returned from this method can
complete exceptionally with:

- IllegalArgumentException

-
if

statusCode

is illegal, or
if

reason

is illegal

IOException

-
if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

Unless the

CompletableFuture

returned from this method
completes with

IllegalArgumentException

, or the method throws

NullPointerException

, the output will be closed.

If not already closed, the input remains open until a Close message

received

, or

abort

is invoked, or an

error

occurs.

**API Note:** Use the provided integer constant

NORMAL_CLOSURE

as a
status code and an empty string as a reason in a typical case:

```java
CompletableFuture<WebSocket> webSocket = ...
webSocket.thenCompose(ws -> ws.sendText("Hello, ", false))
.thenCompose(ws -> ws.sendText("world!", true))
.thenCompose(ws -> ws.sendClose(WebSocket.NORMAL_CLOSURE, ""))
.join();
```

The

sendClose

method does not close this WebSocket's input. It
merely closes this WebSocket's output by sending a Close message. To
enforce closing the input, invoke the

abort

method. Here is an
example of an application that sends a Close message, and then starts a
timer. Once no data has been received within the specified timeout, the
timer goes off and the alarm aborts

WebSocket

:

```java
MyAlarm alarm = new MyAlarm(webSocket::abort);
WebSocket.Listener listener = new WebSocket.Listener() {

public CompletionStage<?> onText(WebSocket webSocket,
CharSequence data,
boolean last) {
alarm.snooze();
...
}
...
};
...
Runnable startTimer = () -> {
MyTimer idleTimer = new MyTimer();
idleTimer.add(alarm, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
};
webSocket.sendClose(WebSocket.NORMAL_CLOSURE, "ok").thenRun(startTimer);
```
**Parameters:** statusCode

- the status code
**Parameters:** reason

- the reason
**Returns:** a

CompletableFuture

that completes, with this WebSocket,
when the Close message has been sent

request

```java
void request​(long n)
```

Increments the counter of invocations of receive methods.

This WebSocket will invoke

onText

,

onBinary

,

onPing

,

onPong

or

onClose

methods on the
associated listener (i.e. receive methods) up to

n

more times.

**API Note:** The parameter of this method is the number of invocations being
requested from this WebSocket to the associated listener, not the number
of messages. Sometimes a message may be delivered to the listener in a
single invocation, but not always. For example, Ping, Pong and Close
messages are delivered in a single invocation of

onPing

,

onPong

and

onClose

methods respectively. However, whether
or not Text and Binary messages are delivered in a single invocation of

onText

and

onBinary

methods depends on the boolean
argument (

last

) of these methods. If

last

is

false

, then there is more to a message than has been delivered to
the invocation.

Here is an example of a listener that requests invocations, one at a
time, until a complete message has been accumulated, and then processes
the result:

```java
WebSocket.Listener listener = new WebSocket.Listener() {

StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

public CompletionStage<?> onText(WebSocket webSocket,
CharSequence message,
boolean last) {
text.append(message);
if (last) {
processCompleteTextMessage(text);
text = new StringBuilder();
}
webSocket.request(1);
return null;
}
...
}
```
**Parameters:** n

- the number of invocations
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

n <= 0
