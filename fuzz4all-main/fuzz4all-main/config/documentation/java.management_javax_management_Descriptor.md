# Interface Descriptor

**Source:** `java.management\javax\management\Descriptor.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Descriptor

extends
Serializable
,
Cloneable
```

Additional metadata for a JMX element. A

Descriptor

is associated with a

MBeanInfo

,

MBeanAttributeInfo

, etc.
It consists of a collection of fields. A field is a name and an
associated value.

Field names are not case-sensitive. The names

descriptorType

,

descriptortype

, and

DESCRIPTORTYPE

are all equivalent.
However, the case that was used when the field was first set is preserved
in the result of the

getFields()

and

getFieldNames()

methods.

Not all field names and values are predefined.
New fields can be defined and added by any program.

A descriptor can be mutable or immutable.
An immutable descriptor, once created, never changes.
The

Descriptor

methods that could modify the contents
of the descriptor will throw an exception
for an immutable descriptor. Immutable descriptors are usually
instances of

ImmutableDescriptor

or a subclass. Mutable
descriptors are usually instances of

DescriptorSupport

or a subclass.

Certain fields are used by the JMX implementation. This means
either that the presence of the field may change the behavior of
the JMX API or that the field may be set in descriptors returned by
the JMX API. These fields appear in

italics

in the table
below, and each one has a corresponding constant in the

JMX

class. For example, the field

defaultValue

is represented
by the constant

JMX.DEFAULT_VALUE_FIELD

.

Certain other fields have conventional meanings described in the
table below but they are not required to be understood or set by
the JMX implementation.

Field names defined by the JMX specification in this and all
future versions will never contain a period (.). Users can safely
create their own fields by including a period in the name and be
sure that these names will not collide with any future version of
the JMX API. It is recommended to follow the Java package naming
convention to avoid collisions between field names from different
origins. For example, a field created by

example.com

might
have the name

com.example.interestLevel

.

Note that the values in the

defaultValue

,

legalValues

,

maxValue

, and

minValue

fields should
be consistent with the type returned by the

getType()

method for the associated

MBeanAttributeInfo

or

MBeanParameterInfo

. For MXBeans, this means that they should be
of the mapped Java type, called

opendata

(J) in the

MXBean type mapping rules

.

defaultValue

Object

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

Default value for an attribute or parameter. See

javax.management.openmbean

.

deprecated

String

Any

An indication that this element of the information model is no
longer recommended for use. A set of MBeans defined by an
application is collectively called an

information model

.
The convention is for the value of this field to contain a string
that is the version of the model in which the element was first
deprecated, followed by a space, followed by an explanation of the
deprecation, for example

"1.3 Replaced by the Capacity
attribute"

.

descriptionResource

BundleBaseName

String

Any

The base name for the

ResourceBundle

in which the key given in
the

descriptionResourceKey

field can be found, for example

"com.example.myapp.MBeanResources"

. The meaning of this
field is defined by this specification but the field is not set or
used by the JMX API itself.

descriptionResourceKey

String

Any

A resource key for the description of this element. In
conjunction with the

descriptionResourceBundleBaseName

,
this can be used to find a localized version of the description.
The meaning of this field is defined by this specification but the
field is not set or used by the JMX API itself.

enabled

String

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanNotificationInfo

MBeanOperationInfo

The string

"true"

or

"false"

according as this
item is enabled. When an attribute or operation is not enabled, it
exists but cannot currently be accessed. A user interface might
present it as a greyed-out item. For example, an attribute might
only be meaningful after the

start()

method of an MBean has
been called, and is otherwise disabled. Likewise, a notification
might be disabled if it cannot currently be emitted but could be in
other circumstances.

exceptions

String[]

MBeanAttributeInfo, MBeanConstructorInfo, MBeanOperationInfo

The class names of the exceptions that can be thrown when invoking a
constructor or operation, or getting an attribute. The meaning of this field
is defined by this specification but the field is not set or used by the
JMX API itself. Exceptions thrown when
setting an attribute are specified by the field

setExceptions

.

immutableInfo

String

MBeanInfo

The string

"true"

or

"false"

according as this
MBean's MBeanInfo is

immutable

. When this field is true,
the MBeanInfo for the given MBean is guaranteed not to change over
the lifetime of the MBean. Hence, a client can read it once and
cache the read value. When this field is false or absent, there is
no such guarantee, although that does not mean that the MBeanInfo
will necessarily change. See also the

"jmx.mbean.info.changed"

notification.

infoTimeout

String

Long

MBeanInfo

The time in milli-seconds that the MBeanInfo can reasonably be
expected to be unchanged. The value can be a

Long

or a
decimal string. This provides a hint from a DynamicMBean or any
MBean that does not define

immutableInfo

as

true

that the MBeanInfo is not likely to change within this period and
therefore can be cached. When this field is missing or has the
value zero, it is not recommended to cache the MBeanInfo unless it
has the

immutableInfo

set to

true

or it has

"jmx.mbean.info.changed"

in
its

MBeanNotificationInfo

array.

interfaceClassName

String

MBeanInfo

The Java interface name for a Standard MBean or MXBean, as
returned by

Class.getName()

. A Standard MBean or MXBean
registered directly in the MBean Server or created using the

StandardMBean

class will have this field in its MBeanInfo
Descriptor.

legalValues

Set<?>

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

Legal values for an attribute or parameter. See

javax.management.openmbean

.

locale

String

Any

The

locale

of the description in this

MBeanInfo

,

MBeanAttributeInfo

, etc, as returned
by

Locale.toString()

.

maxValue

Object

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

Maximum legal value for an attribute or parameter. See

javax.management.openmbean

.

metricType

String

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanOperationInfo

The type of a metric, one of the strings "counter" or "gauge".
A metric is a measurement exported by an MBean, usually an
attribute but sometimes the result of an operation. A metric that
is a

counter

has a value that never decreases except by
being reset to a starting value. Counter metrics are almost always
non-negative integers. An example might be the number of requests
received. A metric that is a

gauge

has a numeric value
that can increase or decrease. Examples might be the number of
open connections or a cache hit rate or a temperature reading.

minValue

Object

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

Minimum legal value for an attribute or parameter. See

javax.management.openmbean

.

mxbean

String

MBeanInfo

The string

"true"

or

"false"

according as this
MBean is an

MXBean

. A Standard MBean or MXBean registered
directly with the MBean Server or created using the

StandardMBean

class will have this field in its MBeanInfo
Descriptor.

openType

OpenType

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanOperationInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

The Open Type of this element. In the case of

MBeanAttributeInfo

and

MBeanParameterInfo

, this is the
Open Type of the attribute or parameter. In the case of

MBeanOperationInfo

, it is the Open Type of the return value. This
field is set in the Descriptor for all instances of

OpenMBeanAttributeInfoSupport

,

OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport

, and

OpenMBeanParameterInfoSupport

. It is also set for attributes,
operations, and parameters of MXBeans.

This field can be set for an

MBeanNotificationInfo

, in
which case it indicates the Open Type that the

user data

will have.

originalType

String

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanOperationInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

The original Java type of this element as it appeared in the

MXBean

interface method that produced this

MBeanAttributeInfo

(etc). For example, a method

public

MemoryUsage

getHeapMemoryUsage();

in an MXBean interface defines an attribute called

HeapMemoryUsage

of type

CompositeData

. The

originalType

field in the Descriptor for this attribute will have
the value

"java.lang.management.MemoryUsage"

.

The format of this string is described in the section

Type Names

of the MXBean
specification.

setExceptions

String[]

MBeanAttributeInfo

The class names of the exceptions that can be thrown when setting
an attribute. The meaning of this field
is defined by this specification but the field is not set or used by the
JMX API itself. Exceptions thrown when getting an attribute are specified
by the field

exceptions

.

severity

String

Integer

MBeanNotificationInfo

The severity of this notification. It can be 0 to mean
unknown severity or a value from 1 to 6 representing decreasing
levels of severity. It can be represented as a decimal string or
an

Integer

.

since

String

Any

The version of the information model in which this element
was introduced. A set of MBeans defined by an application is
collectively called an

information model

. The
application may also define versions of this model, and use the

"since"

field to record the version in which an element
first appeared.

units

String

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

MBeanOperationInfo

The units in which an attribute, parameter, or operation return
value is measured, for example

"bytes"

or

"seconds"

.

Some additional fields are defined by Model MBeans. See the
information for

ModelMBeanInfo

,

ModelMBeanAttributeInfo

,

ModelMBeanConstructorInfo

,

ModelMBeanNotificationInfo

, and

ModelMBeanOperationInfo

, as
well as the chapter "Model MBeans" of the

JMX
Specification

. The following table summarizes these fields. Note
that when the Type in this table is Number, a String that is the decimal
representation of a Long can also be used.

Nothing prevents the use of these fields in MBeans that are not Model
MBeans. The

displayName

,

severity

, and

visibility

fields are of
interest outside Model MBeans, for example. But only Model MBeans have
a predefined behavior for these fields.

### Method Details

#### Object
getFieldValue​(
String
fieldName)
throws
RuntimeOperationsException

Returns the value for a specific field name, or null if no value
is present for that name.

**Parameters:**
- fieldName

- the field name.

**Returns:**
- the corresponding value, or null if the field is not present.

**Throws:**
- RuntimeOperationsException

- if the field name is illegal.

---

#### void setField​(
String
fieldName,

Object
fieldValue)
throws
RuntimeOperationsException

Sets the value for a specific field name. This will
modify an existing field or add a new field.

The field value will be validated before it is set.
If it is not valid, then an exception will be thrown.
The meaning of validity is dependent on the descriptor
implementation.

**Parameters:**
- fieldName

- The field name to be set. Cannot be null or empty.
- fieldValue

- The field value to be set for the field
name. Can be null if that is a valid value for the field.

**Throws:**
- RuntimeOperationsException

- if the field name or field value
is illegal (wrapped exception is

IllegalArgumentException

); or
if the descriptor is immutable (wrapped exception is

UnsupportedOperationException

).

---

#### String
[] getFields()

Returns all of the fields contained in this descriptor as a string array.

**Returns:**
- String array of fields in the format

fieldName=fieldValue

If the value of a field is not a String, then the toString() method
will be called on it and the returned value, enclosed in parentheses,
used as the value for the field in the returned array. If the value
of a field is null, then the value of the field in the returned array
will be empty. If the descriptor is empty, you will get
an empty array.

**See Also:**
- setFields(java.lang.String[], java.lang.Object[])

---

#### String
[] getFieldNames()

Returns all the field names in the descriptor.

**Returns:**
- String array of field names. If the descriptor is empty,
you will get an empty array.

---

#### Object
[] getFieldValues​(
String
... fieldNames)

Returns all the field values in the descriptor as an array of Objects. The
returned values are in the same order as the

fieldNames

String array parameter.

**Parameters:**
- fieldNames

- String array of the names of the fields that
the values should be returned for. If the array is empty then
an empty array will be returned. If the array is null then all
values will be returned, as if the parameter were the array
returned by

getFieldNames()

. If a field name in the
array does not exist, including the case where it is null or
the empty string, then null is returned for the matching array
element being returned.

**Returns:**
- Object array of field values. If the list of

fieldNames

is empty, you will get an empty array.

---

#### void removeField​(
String
fieldName)

Removes a field from the descriptor.

**Parameters:**
- fieldName

- String name of the field to be removed.
If the field name is illegal or the field is not found,
no exception is thrown.

**Throws:**
- RuntimeOperationsException

- if a field of the given name
exists and the descriptor is immutable. The wrapped exception will
be an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

---

#### void setFields​(
String
[] fieldNames,

Object
[] fieldValues)
throws
RuntimeOperationsException

Sets all fields in the field names array to the new value with
the same index in the field values array. Array sizes must match.

The field value will be validated before it is set.
If it is not valid, then an exception will be thrown.
If the arrays are empty, then no change will take effect.

**Parameters:**
- fieldNames

- String array of field names. The array and array
elements cannot be null.
- fieldValues

- Object array of the corresponding field values.
The array cannot be null. Elements of the array can be null.

**Throws:**
- RuntimeOperationsException

- if the change fails for any reason.
Wrapped exception is

IllegalArgumentException

if

fieldNames

or

fieldValues

is null, or if
the arrays are of different lengths, or if there is an
illegal value in one of them.
Wrapped exception is

UnsupportedOperationException

if the descriptor is immutable, and the call would change
its contents.

**See Also:**
- getFields()

---

#### Object
clone()
throws
RuntimeOperationsException

Returns a descriptor which is equal to this descriptor.
Changes to the returned descriptor will have no effect on this
descriptor, and vice versa. If this descriptor is immutable,
it may fulfill this condition by returning itself.

**Returns:**
- A descriptor which is equal to this descriptor.

**Throws:**
- RuntimeOperationsException

- for illegal value for field names
or field values.
If the descriptor construction fails for any reason, this exception will
be thrown.

---

#### boolean isValid()
throws
RuntimeOperationsException

Returns true if all of the fields have legal values given their
names.

**Returns:**
- true if the values are legal.

**Throws:**
- RuntimeOperationsException

- If the validity checking fails for
any reason, this exception will be thrown.
The method returns false if the descriptor is not valid, but throws
this exception if the attempt to determine validity fails.

---

#### boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Compares this descriptor to the given object. The objects are equal if
the given object is also a Descriptor, and if the two Descriptors have
the same field names (possibly differing in case) and the same
associated values. The respective values for a field in the two
Descriptors are equal if the following conditions hold:

- If one value is null then the other must be too.
- If one value is a primitive array then the other must be a primitive
array of the same type with the same elements.
- If one value is an object array then the other must be too and

Arrays.deepEquals(Object[],Object[])

must return true.
- Otherwise

Object.equals(Object)

must return true.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to compare with.

**Returns:**
- true

if the objects are the same;

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this descriptor. The hash
code is computed as the sum of the hash codes for each field in
the descriptor. The hash code of a field with name

n

and value

v

is

n.toLowerCase().hashCode() ^ h

.
Here

h

is the hash code of

v

, computed as
follows:

- If

v

is null then

h

is 0.
- If

v

is a primitive array then

h

is computed using
the appropriate overloading of

java.util.Arrays.hashCode

.
- If

v

is an object array then

h

is computed using

Arrays.deepHashCode(Object[])

.
- Otherwise

h

is

v.hashCode()

.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- A hash code value for this object.

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

**Since:**
- 1.6

OpenMBeanParameterInfoSupport

. It is also set for attributes,
operations, and parameters of MXBeans.

This field can be set for an

MBeanNotificationInfo

, in
which case it indicates the Open Type that the

user data

will have.

originalType

String

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanOperationInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

The original Java type of this element as it appeared in the

MXBean

interface method that produced this

MBeanAttributeInfo

(etc). For example, a method

public

MemoryUsage

getHeapMemoryUsage();

in an MXBean interface defines an attribute called

HeapMemoryUsage

of type

CompositeData

. The

originalType

field in the Descriptor for this attribute will have
the value

"java.lang.management.MemoryUsage"

.

The format of this string is described in the section

Type Names

of the MXBean
specification.

setExceptions

String[]

MBeanAttributeInfo

The class names of the exceptions that can be thrown when setting
an attribute. The meaning of this field
is defined by this specification but the field is not set or used by the
JMX API itself. Exceptions thrown when getting an attribute are specified
by the field

exceptions

.

severity

String

Integer

MBeanNotificationInfo

The severity of this notification. It can be 0 to mean
unknown severity or a value from 1 to 6 representing decreasing
levels of severity. It can be represented as a decimal string or
an

Integer

.

since

String

Any

The version of the information model in which this element
was introduced. A set of MBeans defined by an application is
collectively called an

information model

. The
application may also define versions of this model, and use the

"since"

field to record the version in which an element
first appeared.

units

String

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

MBeanOperationInfo

The units in which an attribute, parameter, or operation return
value is measured, for example

"bytes"

or

"seconds"

.

Some additional fields are defined by Model MBeans. See the
information for

ModelMBeanInfo

,

ModelMBeanAttributeInfo

,

ModelMBeanConstructorInfo

,

ModelMBeanNotificationInfo

, and

ModelMBeanOperationInfo

, as
well as the chapter "Model MBeans" of the

JMX
Specification

. The following table summarizes these fields. Note
that when the Type in this table is Number, a String that is the decimal
representation of a Long can also be used.

Nothing prevents the use of these fields in MBeans that are not Model
MBeans. The

displayName

,

severity

, and

visibility

fields are of
interest outside Model MBeans, for example. But only Model MBeans have
a predefined behavior for these fields.

public interface

Descriptor

extends

Serializable

,

Cloneable

Additional metadata for a JMX element. A

Descriptor

is associated with a

MBeanInfo

,

MBeanAttributeInfo

, etc.
It consists of a collection of fields. A field is a name and an
associated value.

Field names are not case-sensitive. The names

descriptorType

,

descriptortype

, and

DESCRIPTORTYPE

are all equivalent.
However, the case that was used when the field was first set is preserved
in the result of the

getFields()

and

getFieldNames()

methods.

Not all field names and values are predefined.
New fields can be defined and added by any program.

A descriptor can be mutable or immutable.
An immutable descriptor, once created, never changes.
The

Descriptor

methods that could modify the contents
of the descriptor will throw an exception
for an immutable descriptor. Immutable descriptors are usually
instances of

ImmutableDescriptor

or a subclass. Mutable
descriptors are usually instances of

DescriptorSupport

or a subclass.

Certain fields are used by the JMX implementation. This means
either that the presence of the field may change the behavior of
the JMX API or that the field may be set in descriptors returned by
the JMX API. These fields appear in

italics

in the table
below, and each one has a corresponding constant in the

JMX

class. For example, the field

defaultValue

is represented
by the constant

JMX.DEFAULT_VALUE_FIELD

.

Certain other fields have conventional meanings described in the
table below but they are not required to be understood or set by
the JMX implementation.

Field names defined by the JMX specification in this and all
future versions will never contain a period (.). Users can safely
create their own fields by including a period in the name and be
sure that these names will not collide with any future version of
the JMX API. It is recommended to follow the Java package naming
convention to avoid collisions between field names from different
origins. For example, a field created by

example.com

might
have the name

com.example.interestLevel

.

Note that the values in the

defaultValue

,

legalValues

,

maxValue

, and

minValue

fields should
be consistent with the type returned by the

getType()

method for the associated

MBeanAttributeInfo

or

MBeanParameterInfo

. For MXBeans, this means that they should be
of the mapped Java type, called

opendata

(J) in the

MXBean type mapping rules

.

deprecated

String

Any

An indication that this element of the information model is no
longer recommended for use. A set of MBeans defined by an
application is collectively called an

information model

.
The convention is for the value of this field to contain a string
that is the version of the model in which the element was first
deprecated, followed by a space, followed by an explanation of the
deprecation, for example

"1.3 Replaced by the Capacity
attribute"

.

descriptionResource

BundleBaseName

String

Any

The base name for the

ResourceBundle

in which the key given in
the

descriptionResourceKey

field can be found, for example

"com.example.myapp.MBeanResources"

. The meaning of this
field is defined by this specification but the field is not set or
used by the JMX API itself.

descriptionResourceKey

String

Any

A resource key for the description of this element. In
conjunction with the

descriptionResourceBundleBaseName

,
this can be used to find a localized version of the description.
The meaning of this field is defined by this specification but the
field is not set or used by the JMX API itself.

enabled

String

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanNotificationInfo

MBeanOperationInfo

The string

"true"

or

"false"

according as this
item is enabled. When an attribute or operation is not enabled, it
exists but cannot currently be accessed. A user interface might
present it as a greyed-out item. For example, an attribute might
only be meaningful after the

start()

method of an MBean has
been called, and is otherwise disabled. Likewise, a notification
might be disabled if it cannot currently be emitted but could be in
other circumstances.

exceptions

String[]

MBeanAttributeInfo, MBeanConstructorInfo, MBeanOperationInfo

The class names of the exceptions that can be thrown when invoking a
constructor or operation, or getting an attribute. The meaning of this field
is defined by this specification but the field is not set or used by the
JMX API itself. Exceptions thrown when
setting an attribute are specified by the field

setExceptions

.

immutableInfo

String

MBeanInfo

The string

"true"

or

"false"

according as this
MBean's MBeanInfo is

immutable

. When this field is true,
the MBeanInfo for the given MBean is guaranteed not to change over
the lifetime of the MBean. Hence, a client can read it once and
cache the read value. When this field is false or absent, there is
no such guarantee, although that does not mean that the MBeanInfo
will necessarily change. See also the

"jmx.mbean.info.changed"

notification.

infoTimeout

String

Long

MBeanInfo

The time in milli-seconds that the MBeanInfo can reasonably be
expected to be unchanged. The value can be a

Long

or a
decimal string. This provides a hint from a DynamicMBean or any
MBean that does not define

immutableInfo

as

true

that the MBeanInfo is not likely to change within this period and
therefore can be cached. When this field is missing or has the
value zero, it is not recommended to cache the MBeanInfo unless it
has the

immutableInfo

set to

true

or it has

"jmx.mbean.info.changed"

in
its

MBeanNotificationInfo

array.

interfaceClassName

String

MBeanInfo

The Java interface name for a Standard MBean or MXBean, as
returned by

Maximum legal value for an attribute or parameter. See

javax.management.openmbean

.

metricType

String

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanOperationInfo

The type of a metric, one of the strings "counter" or "gauge".
A metric is a measurement exported by an MBean, usually an
attribute but sometimes the result of an operation. A metric that
is a

counter

has a value that never decreases except by
being reset to a starting value. Counter metrics are almost always
non-negative integers. An example might be the number of requests
received. A metric that is a

gauge

has a numeric value
that can increase or decrease. Examples might be the number of
open connections or a cache hit rate or a temperature reading.

minValue

Object

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

Minimum legal value for an attribute or parameter. See

javax.management.openmbean

.

mxbean

Certain fields are used by the JMX implementation. This means
either that the presence of the field may change the behavior of
the JMX API or that the field may be set in descriptors returned by
the JMX API. These fields appear in

italics

in the table
below, and each one has a corresponding constant in the

JMX

class. For example, the field

defaultValue

is represented
by the constant

JMX.DEFAULT_VALUE_FIELD

.

Certain other fields have conventional meanings described in the
table below but they are not required to be understood or set by
the JMX implementation.

Field names defined by the JMX specification in this and all
future versions will never contain a period (.). Users can safely
create their own fields by including a period in the name and be
sure that these names will not collide with any future version of
the JMX API. It is recommended to follow the Java package naming
convention to avoid collisions between field names from different
origins. For example, a field created by

example.com

might
have the name

com.example.interestLevel

.

Note that the values in the

defaultValue

,

legalValues

,

maxValue

, and

minValue

fields should
be consistent with the type returned by the

getType()

method for the associated

MBeanAttributeInfo

or

MBeanParameterInfo

. For MXBeans, this means that they should be
of the mapped Java type, called

opendata

(J) in the

MXBean type mapping rules

.

The Open Type of this element. In the case of

MBeanAttributeInfo

and

MBeanParameterInfo

, this is the
Open Type of the attribute or parameter. In the case of

MBeanOperationInfo

, it is the Open Type of the return value. This
field is set in the Descriptor for all instances of

OpenMBeanAttributeInfoSupport

,

OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport

, and

OpenMBeanParameterInfoSupport

. It is also set for attributes,
operations, and parameters of MXBeans.

This field can be set for an

MBeanNotificationInfo

, in
which case it indicates the Open Type that the

user data

will have.

The original Java type of this element as it appeared in the

MXBean

interface method that produced this

MBeanAttributeInfo

(etc). For example, a method

public

MemoryUsage

getHeapMemoryUsage();

in an MXBean interface defines an attribute called

HeapMemoryUsage

of type

CompositeData

. The

originalType

field in the Descriptor for this attribute will have
the value

"java.lang.management.MemoryUsage"

.

The format of this string is described in the section

Type Names

of the MXBean
specification.

setExceptions

String[]

MBeanAttributeInfo

The class names of the exceptions that can be thrown when setting
an attribute. The meaning of this field
is defined by this specification but the field is not set or used by the
JMX API itself. Exceptions thrown when getting an attribute are specified
by the field

exceptions

.

severity

String

Integer

MBeanNotificationInfo

The severity of this notification. It can be 0 to mean
unknown severity or a value from 1 to 6 representing decreasing
levels of severity. It can be represented as a decimal string or
an

Integer

.

since

String

Any

The version of the information model in which this element
was introduced. A set of MBeans defined by an application is
collectively called an

information model

. The
application may also define versions of this model, and use the

"since"

field to record the version in which an element
first appeared.

units

String

MBeanAttributeInfo

MBeanParameterInfo

MBeanOperationInfo

The units in which an attribute, parameter, or operation return
value is measured, for example

"bytes"

or

"seconds"

.

The format of this string is described in the section

Type Names

of the MXBean
specification.

Some additional fields are defined by Model MBeans. See the
information for

ModelMBeanInfo

,

ModelMBeanAttributeInfo

,

ModelMBeanConstructorInfo

,

ModelMBeanNotificationInfo

, and

ModelMBeanOperationInfo

, as
well as the chapter "Model MBeans" of the

JMX
Specification

. The following table summarizes these fields. Note
that when the Type in this table is Number, a String that is the decimal
representation of a Long can also be used.

Nothing prevents the use of these fields in MBeans that are not Model
MBeans. The

displayName

will be called on it and the returned value, enclosed in parentheses,
used as the value for the field in the returned array. If the value
of a field is null, then the value of the field in the returned array
will be empty. If the descriptor is empty, you will get
an empty array.

fieldNames

String array parameter.

**Parameters:** fieldNames

- String array of the names of the fields that
the values should be returned for. If the array is empty then
an empty array will be returned. If the array is null then all
values will be returned, as if the parameter were the array
returned by

getFieldNames()

. If a field name in the
array does not exist, including the case where it is null or
the empty string, then null is returned for the matching array
element being returned.
**Returns:** Object array of field values. If the list of

fieldNames

is empty, you will get an empty array.

---

#### getFieldValues

Object

[] getFieldValues​(

String

... fieldNames)

Returns all the field values in the descriptor as an array of Objects. The
returned values are in the same order as the

fieldNames

String array parameter.

removeField

```java
void removeField​(
String
fieldName)
```

Removes a field from the descriptor.

**Parameters:** fieldName

- String name of the field to be removed.
If the field name is illegal or the field is not found,
no exception is thrown.
**Throws:** RuntimeOperationsException

- if a field of the given name
exists and the descriptor is immutable. The wrapped exception will
be an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

---

#### removeField

void removeField​(

String

fieldName)

Removes a field from the descriptor.

setFields

```java
void setFields​(
String
[] fieldNames,

Object
[] fieldValues)
throws
RuntimeOperationsException
```

Sets all fields in the field names array to the new value with
the same index in the field values array. Array sizes must match.

The field value will be validated before it is set.
If it is not valid, then an exception will be thrown.
If the arrays are empty, then no change will take effect.

**Parameters:** fieldNames

- String array of field names. The array and array
elements cannot be null.
**Parameters:** fieldValues

- Object array of the corresponding field values.
The array cannot be null. Elements of the array can be null.
**Throws:** RuntimeOperationsException

- if the change fails for any reason.
Wrapped exception is

IllegalArgumentException

if

fieldNames

or

fieldValues

is null, or if
the arrays are of different lengths, or if there is an
illegal value in one of them.
Wrapped exception is

UnsupportedOperationException

if the descriptor is immutable, and the call would change
its contents.
**See Also:** getFields()

---

#### setFields

void setFields​(

String

[] fieldNames,

Object

[] fieldValues)
throws

RuntimeOperationsException

Sets all fields in the field names array to the new value with
the same index in the field values array. Array sizes must match.

The field value will be validated before it is set.
If it is not valid, then an exception will be thrown.
If the arrays are empty, then no change will take effect.

Sets all fields in the field names array to the new value with
the same index in the field values array. Array sizes must match.

The field value will be validated before it is set.
If it is not valid, then an exception will be thrown.
If the arrays are empty, then no change will take effect.

clone

```java
Object
clone()
throws
RuntimeOperationsException
```

Returns a descriptor which is equal to this descriptor.
Changes to the returned descriptor will have no effect on this
descriptor, and vice versa. If this descriptor is immutable,
it may fulfill this condition by returning itself.

**Returns:** A descriptor which is equal to this descriptor.
**Throws:** RuntimeOperationsException

- for illegal value for field names
or field values.
If the descriptor construction fails for any reason, this exception will
be thrown.

---

#### clone

Object

clone()
throws

RuntimeOperationsException

Returns a descriptor which is equal to this descriptor.
Changes to the returned descriptor will have no effect on this
descriptor, and vice versa. If this descriptor is immutable,
it may fulfill this condition by returning itself.

isValid

```java
boolean isValid()
throws
RuntimeOperationsException
```

Returns true if all of the fields have legal values given their
names.

**Returns:** true if the values are legal.
**Throws:** RuntimeOperationsException

- If the validity checking fails for
any reason, this exception will be thrown.
The method returns false if the descriptor is not valid, but throws
this exception if the attempt to determine validity fails.

---

#### isValid

boolean isValid()
throws

RuntimeOperationsException

Returns true if all of the fields have legal values given their
names.

equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Compares this descriptor to the given object. The objects are equal if
the given object is also a Descriptor, and if the two Descriptors have
the same field names (possibly differing in case) and the same
associated values. The respective values for a field in the two
Descriptors are equal if the following conditions hold:

- If one value is null then the other must be too.
- If one value is a primitive array then the other must be a primitive
array of the same type with the same elements.
- If one value is an object array then the other must be too and

Arrays.deepEquals(Object[],Object[])

must return true.
- Otherwise

Object.equals(Object)

must return true.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the object to compare with.
**Returns:** true

if the objects are the same;

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.6

hashCode

```java
int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this descriptor. The hash
code is computed as the sum of the hash codes for each field in
the descriptor. The hash code of a field with name

n

and value

v

is

n.toLowerCase().hashCode() ^ h

.
Here

h

is the hash code of

v

, computed as
follows:

- If

v

is null then

h

is 0.
- If

v

is a primitive array then

h

is computed using
the appropriate overloading of

java.util.Arrays.hashCode

.
- If

v

is an object array then

h

is computed using

Arrays.deepHashCode(Object[])

.
- Otherwise

h

is

v.hashCode()

.

**Overrides:** hashCode
