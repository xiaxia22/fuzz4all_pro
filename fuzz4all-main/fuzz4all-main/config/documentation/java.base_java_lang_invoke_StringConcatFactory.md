# Class StringConcatFactory

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\invoke\StringConcatFactory.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
StringConcatFactory

extends
Object
```

Methods to facilitate the creation of String concatenation methods, that
can be used to efficiently concatenate a known number of arguments of known
types, possibly after type adaptation and partial evaluation of arguments.
These methods are typically used as

bootstrap methods

for

invokedynamic

call sites, to support the

string concatenation

feature of the Java Programming Language.

Indirect access to the behavior specified by the provided

MethodHandle

proceeds in order through two phases:

- Linkage

occurs when the methods in this class are invoked.
They take as arguments a method type describing the concatenated arguments
count and types, and optionally the String

recipe

, plus the
constants that participate in the String concatenation. The details on
accepted recipe shapes are described further below. Linkage may involve
dynamically loading a new class that implements the expected concatenation
behavior. The

CallSite

holds the

MethodHandle

pointing to the
exact concatenation method. The concatenation methods may be shared among
different

CallSite

s, e.g. if linkage methods produce them as pure
functions.
- Invocation

occurs when a generated concatenation method is
invoked with the exact dynamic arguments. This may occur many times for a
single concatenation method. The method referenced by the behavior

MethodHandle

is invoked with the static arguments and any additional dynamic
arguments provided on invocation, as if by

MethodHandle.invoke(Object...)

.

This class provides two forms of linkage methods: a simple version
(

makeConcat(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup, String,
MethodType)

) using only the dynamic arguments, and an advanced version
(

makeConcatWithConstants(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup,
String, MethodType, String, Object...)

using the advanced forms of capturing
the constant arguments. The advanced strategy can produce marginally better
invocation bytecode, at the expense of exploding the number of shapes of
string concatenation methods present at runtime, because those shapes would
include constant static arguments as well.

**API Note:** There is a JVM limit (classfile structural constraint): no method
can call with more than 255 slots. This limits the number of static and
dynamic arguments one can pass to bootstrap method. Since there are potential
concatenation strategies that use

MethodHandle

combinators, we need
to reserve a few empty slots on the parameter lists to capture the
temporal results. This is why bootstrap methods in this factory do not accept
more than 200 argument slots. Users requiring more than 200 argument slots in
concatenation are expected to split the large concatenation in smaller
expressions.

### Method Details

#### public static
CallSite
makeConcat​(
MethodHandles.Lookup
lookup,

String
name,

MethodType
concatType)
throws
StringConcatException

Facilitates the creation of optimized String concatenation methods, that
can be used to efficiently concatenate a known number of arguments of
known types, possibly after type adaptation and partial evaluation of
arguments. Typically used as a

bootstrap method

for

invokedynamic

call sites, to support the

string concatenation

feature of the Java Programming Language.

When the target of the

CallSite

returned from this method is
invoked, it returns the result of String concatenation, taking all
function arguments passed to the linkage method as inputs for
concatenation. The target signature is given by

concatType

.
For a target accepting:

- zero inputs, concatenation results in an empty string;
- one input, concatenation results in the single
input converted as per JLS 5.1.11 "String Conversion"; otherwise
- two or more inputs, the inputs are concatenated as per
requirements stated in JLS 15.18.1 "String Concatenation Operator +".
The inputs are converted as per JLS 5.1.11 "String Conversion",
and combined from left to right.

Assume the linkage arguments are as follows:

- concatType

, describing the

CallSite

signature

Then the following linkage invariants must hold:

- The number of parameter slots in

concatType

is
less than or equal to 200
- The return type in

concatType

is assignable from

String

**Parameters:**
- lookup

- Represents a lookup context with the accessibility
privileges of the caller. Specifically, the lookup
context must have

private access

privileges.
When used with

invokedynamic

, this is stacked
automatically by the VM.
- name

- The name of the method to implement. This name is
arbitrary, and has no meaning for this linkage method.
When used with

invokedynamic

, this is provided by
the

NameAndType

of the

InvokeDynamic

structure and is stacked automatically by the VM.
- concatType

- The expected signature of the

CallSite

. The
parameter types represent the types of concatenation
arguments; the return type is always assignable from

String

. When used with

invokedynamic

,
this is provided by the

NameAndType

of the

InvokeDynamic

structure and is stacked automatically by
the VM.

**Returns:**
- a CallSite whose target can be used to perform String
concatenation, with dynamic concatenation arguments described by the given

concatType

.

**Throws:**
- StringConcatException

- If any of the linkage invariants described
here are violated, or the lookup context
does not have private access privileges.
- NullPointerException

- If any of the incoming arguments is null.
This will never happen when a bootstrap method
is called with invokedynamic.

throws
StringConcatException

Facilitates the creation of optimized String concatenation methods, that
can be used to efficiently concatenate a known number of arguments of
known types, possibly after type adaptation and partial evaluation of
arguments. Typically used as a

bootstrap method

for

invokedynamic

call sites, to support the

string concatenation

feature of the Java Programming Language.

When the target of the

CallSite

returned from this method is
invoked, it returns the result of String concatenation, taking all
function arguments and constants passed to the linkage method as inputs for
concatenation. The target signature is given by

concatType

, and
does not include constants.
For a target accepting:

- zero inputs, concatenation results in an empty string;
- one input, concatenation results in the single
input converted as per JLS 5.1.11 "String Conversion"; otherwise
- two or more inputs, the inputs are concatenated as per
requirements stated in JLS 15.18.1 "String Concatenation Operator +".
The inputs are converted as per JLS 5.1.11 "String Conversion",
and combined from left to right.

The concatenation

recipe

is a String description for the way to
construct a concatenated String from the arguments and constants. The
recipe is processed from left to right, and each character represents an
input to concatenation. Recipe characters mean:

- \1 (Unicode point 0001)

: an ordinary argument. This
input is passed through dynamic argument, and is provided during the
concatenation method invocation. This input can be null.
- \2 (Unicode point 0002):

a constant. This input passed
through static bootstrap argument. This constant can be any value
representable in constant pool. If necessary, the factory would call

toString

to perform a one-time String conversion.
- Any other char value:

a single character constant.

Assume the linkage arguments are as follows:

- concatType

, describing the

CallSite

signature
- recipe

, describing the String recipe
- constants

, the vararg array of constants

Then the following linkage invariants must hold:

- The number of parameter slots in

concatType

is less than
or equal to 200
- The parameter count in

concatType

equals to number of \1 tags
in

recipe
- The return type in

concatType

is assignable
from

String

, and matches the return type of the
returned

MethodHandle
- The number of elements in

constants

equals to number of \2
tags in

recipe

**Parameters:**
- lookup

- Represents a lookup context with the accessibility
privileges of the caller. Specifically, the lookup
context must have

private access

privileges.
When used with

invokedynamic

, this is stacked
automatically by the VM.
- name

- The name of the method to implement. This name is
arbitrary, and has no meaning for this linkage method.
When used with

invokedynamic

, this is provided
by the

NameAndType

of the

InvokeDynamic

structure and is stacked automatically by the VM.
- concatType

- The expected signature of the

CallSite

. The
parameter types represent the types of dynamic concatenation
arguments; the return type is always assignable from

String

. When used with

invokedynamic

, this is provided by the

NameAndType

of the

InvokeDynamic

structure and
is stacked automatically by the VM.
- recipe

- Concatenation recipe, described above.
- constants

- A vararg parameter representing the constants passed to
the linkage method.

**Returns:**
- a CallSite whose target can be used to perform String
concatenation, with dynamic concatenation arguments described by the given

concatType

.

**Throws:**
- StringConcatException

- If any of the linkage invariants described
here are violated, or the lookup context
does not have private access privileges.
- NullPointerException

- If any of the incoming arguments is null, or
any constant in

recipe

is null.
This will never happen when a bootstrap method
is called with invokedynamic.

**API Note:**
- Code generators have three distinct ways to process a constant
string operand S in a string concatenation expression. First, S can be
materialized as a reference (using ldc) and passed as an ordinary argument
(recipe '\1'). Or, S can be stored in the constant pool and passed as a
constant (recipe '\2') . Finally, if S contains neither of the recipe
tag characters ('\1', '\2') then S can be interpolated into the recipe
itself, causing its characters to be inserted into the result.

The concatenation

recipe

is a String description for the way to

concatenation method invocation. This input can be null.
- \2 (Unicode point 0002):

a constant. This input passed
through static bootstrap argument. This constant can be any value
representable in constant pool. If necessary, the factory would call

toString

to perform a one-time String conversion.
- Any other char value:

a single character constant.

Assume the linkage arguments are as follows:

- concatType

, describing the

CallSite

signature
- recipe

, describing the String recipe
- constants

```

Facilitates the creation of optimized String concatenation methods, that
can be used to efficiently concatenate a known number of arguments of
known types, possibly after type adaptation and partial evaluation of
arguments. Typically used as a

bootstrap method

for

invokedynamic

call sites, to support the

string concatenation

feature of the Java Programming Language.

When the target of the

CallSite

returned from this method is
invoked, it returns the result of String concatenation, taking all
function arguments and constants passed to the linkage method as inputs for
concatenation. The target signature is given by

concatType

, and
does not include constants.
For a target accepting:

- zero inputs, concatenation results in an empty string;
- one input, concatenation results in the single
input converted as per JLS 5.1.11 "String Conversion"; otherwise
- two or more inputs, the inputs are concatenated as per
requirements stated in JLS 15.18.1 "String Concatenation Operator +".
The inputs are converted as per JLS 5.1.11 "String Conversion",
and combined from left to right.

The concatenation

recipe

is a String description for the way to
construct a concatenated String from the arguments and constants. The
recipe is processed from left to right, and each character represents an
input to concatenation. Recipe characters mean:

- \1 (Unicode point 0001)

: an ordinary argument. This
input is passed through dynamic argument, and is provided during the
concatenation method invocation. This input can be null.
- \2 (Unicode point 0002):

a constant. This input passed
through static bootstrap argument. This constant can be any value
representable in constant pool. If necessary, the factory would call

toString

to perform a one-time String conversion.
- Any other char value:

a single character constant.

Assume the linkage arguments are as follows:

- concatType

, describing the

CallSite

signature
- recipe

, describing the String recipe
- constants

, the vararg array of constants

Then the following linkage invariants must hold:

- The number of parameter slots in

concatType

is less than
or equal to 200
- The parameter count in

concatType

equals to number of \1 tags
in

recipe
- The return type in

concatType

is assignable
from

String

, and matches the return type of the
returned

MethodHandle
- The number of elements in

constants

equals to number of \2
tags in

recipe

**API Note:** Code generators have three distinct ways to process a constant
string operand S in a string concatenation expression. First, S can be
materialized as a reference (using ldc) and passed as an ordinary argument
(recipe '\1'). Or, S can be stored in the constant pool and passed as a
constant (recipe '\2') . Finally, if S contains neither of the recipe
tag characters ('\1', '\2') then S can be interpolated into the recipe
itself, causing its characters to be inserted into the result.
