### Class Description

```java
public class
SctpStandardSocketOptions

extends
Object
```

### Field Details

#### public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Boolean
> SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS

Enables or disables message fragmentation.

The value of this socket option is a

Boolean

that represents
whether the option is enabled or disabled. If enabled no SCTP message
fragmentation will be performed. Instead if a message being sent
exceeds the current PMTU size, the message will NOT be sent and
an error will be indicated to the user.

It is implementation specific whether or not this option is
supported.

---

#### public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Boolean
> SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

Enables or disables explicit message completion.

The value of this socket option is a

Boolean

that represents
whether the option is enabled or disabled. When this option is enabled,
the

send

method may be invoked multiple times to a send message.
The

isComplete

parameter of the

MessageInfo

must only
be set to

true

for the final send to indicate that the message is
complete. If this option is disabled then each individual

send

invocation is considered complete.

The default value of the option is

false

indicating that the
option is disabled. It is implementation specific whether or not this
option is supported.

---

#### public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Integer
> SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

Fragmented interleave controls how the presentation of messages occur
for the message receiver. There are three levels of fragment interleave
defined. Two of the levels effect

SctpChannel

, while

SctpMultiChannel

is effected by all three levels.

This option takes an

Integer

value. It can be set to a value
of

0

,

1

or

2

.

Setting the three levels provides the following receiver
interactions:

level 0

- Prevents the interleaving of any messages. This
means that when a partial delivery begins, no other messages will be
received except the message being partially delivered. If another message
arrives on a different stream (or association) that could be delivered,
it will be blocked waiting for the user to read all of the partially
delivered message.

level 1

- Allows interleaving of messages that are from
different associations. For

SctpChannel

, level 0 and
level 1 have the same meaning since an

SctpChannel

always
receives messages from the same association. Note that setting an

SctpMultiChannel

to this level may cause multiple partial
delivers from different associations but for any given association, only
one message will be delivered until all parts of a message have been
delivered. This means that one large message, being read with an
association identification of "X", will block other messages from
association "X" from being delivered.

level 2

- Allows complete interleaving of messages. This
level requires that the sender carefully observe not only the peer

Association

but also must pay careful attention to the stream
number. With this option enabled a partially delivered message may begin
being delivered for association "X" stream "Y" and the next subsequent
receive may return a message from association "X" stream "Z". Note that
no other messages would be delivered for association "X" stream "Y"
until all of stream "Y"'s partially delivered message was read.
Note that this option effects both channel types. Also note that
for an

SctpMultiChannel

not only may another streams
message from the same association be delivered from the next receive,
some other associations message may be delivered upon the next receive.

It is implementation specific whether or not this option is
supported.

---

#### public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
SctpStandardSocketOptions.InitMaxStreams
> SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS

The maximum number of streams requested by the local endpoint during
association initialization.

The value of this socket option is an

InitMaxStreams

, that represents
the maximum number of inbound and outbound streams that an association
on the channel is prepared to support.

For an

SctpChannel

this option may only be used to
change the number of inbound/outbound streams prior to connecting.

For an

SctpMultiChannel

this option determines
the maximum number of inbound/outbound streams new associations setup
on the channel will be prepared to support.

For an

SctpServerChannel

this option determines the
maximum number of inbound/outbound streams accepted sockets will
negotiate with their connecting peer.

In all cases the value set by this option is used in the negotiation
of new associations setup on the channel's socket and the actual
maximum number of inbound/outbound streams that have been negotiated
with the peer can be retrieved from the appropriate

Association

. The

Association

can be retrieved from the

COMM_UP

AssociationChangeNotification

belonging to that association.

This value is bounded by the actual implementation. In other
words the user may be able to support more streams than the Operating
System. In such a case, the Operating System limit may override the
value requested by the user. The default value of 0 indicates to use
the endpoints default value.

---

#### public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Boolean
> SCTP_NODELAY

Enables or disables a Nagle-like algorithm.

The value of this socket option is a

Boolean

that represents
whether the option is enabled or disabled. SCTP uses an algorithm like

The Nagle Algorithm

to coalesce short segments and
improve network efficiency.

---

#### public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
SocketAddress
> SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR

Requests that the local SCTP stack use the given peer address as
the association primary.

The value of this socket option is a

SocketAddress

that represents the peer address that the local SCTP stack should use as
the association primary. The address must be one of the association
peer's addresses.

An

SctpMultiChannel

can control more than one
association, the association parameter must be given when setting or
retrieving this option.

Since

SctpChannel

only controls one association,
the association parameter is not required and this option can be
set or queried directly.

---

#### public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
SocketAddress
> SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR

Requests that the peer mark the enclosed address as the association
primary.

The value of this socket option is a

SocketAddress

that represents the local address that the peer should use as its
primary address. The given address must be one of the association's
locally bound addresses.

An

SctpMultiChannel

can control more than one
association, the association parameter must be given when setting or
retrieving this option.

Since

SctpChannel

only controls one association,
the association parameter is not required and this option can be
queried directly.

Note, this is a set only option and cannot be retrieved by

getOption

. It is implementation specific whether or not this
option is supported.

---

#### public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Integer
> SO_SNDBUF

The size of the socket send buffer.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that is the
size of the socket send buffer in bytes. The socket send buffer is an
output buffer used by the networking implementation. It may need to be
increased for high-volume connections. The value of the socket option is
a

hint

to the implementation to size the buffer and the actual
size may differ. The socket option can be queried to retrieve the actual
size.

For

SctpChannel

, this controls the amount of data
the SCTP stack may have waiting in internal buffers to be sent. This
option therefore bounds the maximum size of data that can be sent in a
single send call.

For

SctpMultiChannel

, the effect is the same as for

SctpChannel

, except that it applies to all associations. The option
applies to each association's window size separately.

An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the
socket is bound or connected. Whether an implementation allows the
socket send buffer to be changed after the socket is bound is system
dependent.

---

#### public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Integer
> SO_RCVBUF

The size of the socket receive buffer.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that is the
size of the socket receive buffer in bytes. The socket receive buffer is
an input buffer used by the networking implementation. It may need to be
increased for high-volume connections or decreased to limit the possible
backlog of incoming data. The value of the socket option is a

hint

to the implementation to size the buffer and the actual
size may differ.

For

SctpChannel

, this controls the receiver window size.

For

SctpMultiChannel

, the meaning is implementation
dependent. It might control the receive buffer for each association bound
to the socket descriptor or it might control the receive buffer for the
whole socket.

An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the
socket is bound or connected. Whether an implementation allows the
socket receive buffer to be changed after the socket is bound is system
dependent.

---

#### public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Integer
> SO_LINGER

Linger on close if data is present.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that controls
the action taken when unsent data is queued on the socket and a method
to close the socket is invoked. If the value of the socket option is zero
or greater, then it represents a timeout value, in seconds, known as the

linger interval

. The linger interval is the timeout for the

close

method to block while the operating system attempts to
transmit the unsent data or it decides that it is unable to transmit the
data. If the value of the socket option is less than zero then the option
is disabled. In that case the

close

method does not wait until
unsent data is transmitted; if possible the operating system will transmit
any unsent data before the connection is closed.

This socket option is intended for use with sockets that are configured
in

blocking

mode
only. The behavior of the

close

method when this option is
enabled on a non-blocking socket is not defined.

The initial value of this socket option is a negative value, meaning
that the option is disabled. The option may be enabled, or the linger
interval changed, at any time. The maximum value of the linger interval
is system dependent. Setting the linger interval to a value that is
greater than its maximum value causes the linger interval to be set to
its maximum value.

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Boolean
> SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS
```

Enables or disables message fragmentation.

The value of this socket option is a

Boolean

that represents
whether the option is enabled or disabled. If enabled no SCTP message
fragmentation will be performed. Instead if a message being sent
exceeds the current PMTU size, the message will NOT be sent and
an error will be indicated to the user.

It is implementation specific whether or not this option is
supported.

- SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

```java
public static final

```

Enables or disables explicit message completion.

The value of this socket option is a

Boolean

that represents
whether the option is enabled or disabled. When this option is enabled,
the

send

method may be invoked multiple times to a send message.
The

isComplete

parameter of the

MessageInfo

- SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
SctpStandardSocketOptions.InitMaxStreams
> SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS
```

The maximum number of streams requested by the local endpoint during
association initialization.

The value of this socket option is an

InitMaxStreams

, that represents
the maximum number of inbound and outbound streams that an association
on the channel is prepared to support.

For an

SctpChannel

this option may only be used to
change the number of inbound/outbound streams prior to connecting.

For an

SctpMultiChannel

this option determines
the maximum number of inbound/outbound streams new associations setup
on the channel will be prepared to support.

For an

SctpServerChannel

this option determines the
maximum number of inbound/outbound streams accepted sockets will
negotiate with their connecting peer.

In all cases the value set by this option is used in the negotiation
of new associations setup on the channel's socket and the actual
maximum number of inbound/outbound streams that have been negotiated
with the peer can be retrieved from the appropriate

Association

. The

Association

can be retrieved from the

COMM_UP

AssociationChangeNotification

belonging to that association.

This value is bounded by the actual implementation. In other
words the user may be able to support more streams than the Operating
System. In such a case, the Operating System limit may override the
value requested by the user. The default value of 0 indicates to use
the endpoints default value.

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<

Enables or disables a Nagle-like algorithm.

The value of this socket option is a

Boolean

that represents
whether the option is enabled or disabled. SCTP uses an algorithm like

The Nagle Algorithm

to coalesce short segments and
improve network efficiency.

- SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<

Requests that the local SCTP stack use the given peer address as
the association primary.

The value of this socket option is a

SocketAddress

that represents the peer address that the local SCTP stack should use as
the association primary. The address must be one of the association
peer's addresses.

An

SctpMultiChannel

can control more than one
association, the association parameter must be given when setting or
retrieving this option.

Since

SctpChannel

only controls one association,
the association parameter is not required and this option can be
set or queried directly.

- SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
SocketAddress
> SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR
```

Requests that the peer mark the enclosed address as the association
primary.

The value of this socket option is a

SocketAddress

that represents the local address that the peer should use as its
primary address. The given address must be one of the association's
locally bound addresses.

An

SctpMultiChannel

can control more than one
association, the association parameter must be given when setting or
retrieving this option.

Since

SctpChannel

only controls one association,
the association parameter is not required and this option can be

Note, this is a set only option and cannot be retrieved by

getOption

. It is implementation specific whether or not this

- SO_SNDBUF

```java
public static final

The size of the socket receive buffer.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that is the
size of the socket receive buffer in bytes. The socket receive buffer is
an input buffer used by the networking implementation. It may need to be
increased for high-volume connections or decreased to limit the possible
backlog of incoming data. The value of the socket option is a

```

Linger on close if data is present.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that controls
the action taken when unsent data is queued on the socket and a method
to close the socket is invoked. If the value of the socket option is zero
or greater, then it represents a timeout value, in seconds, known as the

The maximum number of streams requested by the local endpoint during
association initialization.

The value of this socket option is an

InitMaxStreams

, that represents
the maximum number of inbound and outbound streams that an association
on the channel is prepared to support.

For an

SctpChannel

this option may only be used to
change the number of inbound/outbound streams prior to connecting.

For an

SctpMultiChannel

this option determines
the maximum number of inbound/outbound streams new associations setup
on the channel will be prepared to support.

For an

SctpServerChannel

this option determines the
maximum number of inbound/outbound streams accepted sockets will
negotiate with their connecting peer.

In all cases the value set by this option is used in the negotiation
of new associations setup on the channel's socket and the actual
maximum number of inbound/outbound streams that have been negotiated
with the peer can be retrieved from the appropriate

Association

. The

Association

can be retrieved from the

COMM_UP

AssociationChangeNotification

belonging to that association.

This value is bounded by the actual implementation. In other
words the user may be able to support more streams than the Operating
System. In such a case, the Operating System limit may override the
value requested by the user. The default value of 0 indicates to use
the endpoints default value.

- SCTP_NODELAY

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Boolean
> SCTP_NODELAY
```

Enables or disables a Nagle-like algorithm.

The value of this socket option is a

Boolean

that represents
whether the option is enabled or disabled. SCTP uses an algorithm like

The Nagle Algorithm

to coalesce short segments and
improve network efficiency.

- SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
SocketAddress
> SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR
```

Requests that the local SCTP stack use the given peer address as
the association primary.

The value of this socket option is a

SocketAddress

that represents the peer address that the local SCTP stack should use as
the association primary. The address must be one of the association
peer's addresses.

An

SctpMultiChannel

can control more than one
association, the association parameter must be given when setting or
retrieving this option.

Since

SctpChannel

only controls one association,
the association parameter is not required and this option can be
set or queried directly.

- SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
SocketAddress
> SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR
```

Requests that the peer mark the enclosed address as the association
primary.

The value of this socket option is a

SocketAddress

that represents the local address that the peer should use as its
primary address. The given address must be one of the association's
locally bound addresses.

An

SctpMultiChannel

can control more than one
association, the association parameter must be given when setting or
retrieving this option.

Since

SctpChannel

only controls one association,
the association parameter is not required and this option can be
queried directly.

Note, this is a set only option and cannot be retrieved by

getOption

. It is implementation specific whether or not this
option is supported.

- SO_SNDBUF

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Integer
> SO_SNDBUF
```

The size of the socket send buffer.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that is the
size of the socket send buffer in bytes. The socket send buffer is an
output buffer used by the networking implementation. It may need to be
increased for high-volume connections. The value of the socket option is
a

hint

to the implementation to size the buffer and the actual
size may differ. The socket option can be queried to retrieve the actual
size.

For

SctpChannel

, this controls the amount of data
the SCTP stack may have waiting in internal buffers to be sent. This
option therefore bounds the maximum size of data that can be sent in a
single send call.

For

SctpMultiChannel

, the effect is the same as for

SctpChannel

, except that it applies to all associations. The option
applies to each association's window size separately.

An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the
socket is bound or connected. Whether an implementation allows the
socket send buffer to be changed after the socket is bound is system
dependent.

- SO_RCVBUF

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Integer
> SO_RCVBUF
```

The size of the socket receive buffer.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that is the
size of the socket receive buffer in bytes. The socket receive buffer is
an input buffer used by the networking implementation. It may need to be
increased for high-volume connections or decreased to limit the possible
backlog of incoming data. The value of the socket option is a

hint

to the implementation to size the buffer and the actual
size may differ.

For

SctpChannel

, this controls the receiver window size.

For

SctpMultiChannel

, the meaning is implementation
dependent. It might control the receive buffer for each association bound
to the socket descriptor or it might control the receive buffer for the
whole socket.

An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the
socket is bound or connected. Whether an implementation allows the
socket receive buffer to be changed after the socket is bound is system
dependent.

- SO_LINGER

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Integer
> SO_LINGER
```

Linger on close if data is present.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that controls
the action taken when unsent data is queued on the socket and a method
to close the socket is invoked. If the value of the socket option is zero
or greater, then it represents a timeout value, in seconds, known as the

linger interval

. The linger interval is the timeout for the

close

method to block while the operating system attempts to
transmit the unsent data or it decides that it is unable to transmit the
data. If the value of the socket option is less than zero then the option
is disabled. In that case the

close

method does not wait until
unsent data is transmitted; if possible the operating system will transmit
any unsent data before the connection is closed.

This socket option is intended for use with sockets that are configured
in

blocking

mode
only. The behavior of the

close

method when this option is
enabled on a non-blocking socket is not defined.

The initial value of this socket option is a negative value, meaning
that the option is disabled. The option may be enabled, or the linger
interval changed, at any time. The maximum value of the linger interval
is system dependent. Setting the linger interval to a value that is
greater than its maximum value causes the linger interval to be set to
its maximum value.

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Boolean

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Integer
> SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE
```

Fragmented interleave controls how the presentation of messages occur
for the message receiver. There are three levels of fragment interleave
defined. Two of the levels effect

SctpChannel

, while

SctpMultiChannel

is effected by all three levels.

This option takes an

Integer

value. It can be set to a value
of

0

,

1

or

2

.

Setting the three levels provides the following receiver
interactions:

level 0

- Prevents the interleaving of any messages. This
means that when a partial delivery begins, no other messages will be
received except the message being partially delivered. If another message
arrives on a different stream (or association) that could be delivered,
it will be blocked waiting for the user to read all of the partially
delivered message.

level 1

- Allows interleaving of messages that are from
different associations. For

SctpChannel

, level 0 and
level 1 have the same meaning since an

SctpChannel

always
receives messages from the same association. Note that setting an

SctpMultiChannel

to this level may cause multiple partial
delivers from different associations but for any given association, only
one message will be delivered until all parts of a message have been
delivered. This means that one large message, being read with an
association identification of "X", will block other messages from
association "X" from being delivered.

level 2

- Allows complete interleaving of messages. This
level requires that the sender carefully observe not only the peer

Association

but also must pay careful attention to the stream
number. With this option enabled a partially delivered message may begin
being delivered for association "X" stream "Y" and the next subsequent
receive may return a message from association "X" stream "Z". Note that
no other messages would be delivered for association "X" stream "Y"
until all of stream "Y"'s partially delivered message was read.
Note that this option effects both channel types. Also note that
for an

SctpMultiChannel

not only may another streams
message from the same association be delivered from the next receive,
some other associations message may be delivered upon the next receive.

It is implementation specific whether or not this option is
supported.

that represents the peer address that the local SCTP stack should use as
the association primary. The address must be one of the association
peer's addresses.

An

SctpMultiChannel

can control more than one
association, the association parameter must be given when setting or
retrieving this option.

Since

SctpChannel

only controls one association,
the association parameter is not required and this option can be
set or queried directly.

SO_SNDBUF

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Integer
> SO_SNDBUF
```

The size of the socket send buffer.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that is the
size of the socket send buffer in bytes. The socket send buffer is an
output buffer used by the networking implementation. It may need to be
increased for high-volume connections. The value of the socket option is
a

hint

to the implementation to size the buffer and the actual
size may differ. The socket option can be queried to retrieve the actual
size.

For

SctpChannel

, this controls the amount of data
the SCTP stack may have waiting in internal buffers to be sent. This
option therefore bounds the maximum size of data that can be sent in a
single send call.

For

SctpMultiChannel

, the effect is the same as for

SctpChannel

, except that it applies to all associations. The option
applies to each association's window size separately.

An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the
socket is bound or connected. Whether an implementation allows the
socket send buffer to be changed after the socket is bound is system
dependent.

```

The size of the socket receive buffer.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that is the
size of the socket receive buffer in bytes. The socket receive buffer is
an input buffer used by the networking implementation. It may need to be
increased for high-volume connections or decreased to limit the possible
backlog of incoming data. The value of the socket option is a

hint

to the implementation to size the buffer and the actual
size may differ.

For

SctpChannel

, this controls the receiver window size.

For

SctpMultiChannel

, the meaning is implementation

SO_LINGER

```java
public static final
SctpSocketOption
<
Integer
> SO_LINGER
```

Linger on close if data is present.

The value of this socket option is an

Integer

that controls
the action taken when unsent data is queued on the socket and a method
to close the socket is invoked. If the value of the socket option is zero
or greater, then it represents a timeout value, in seconds, known as the

linger interval

. The linger interval is the timeout for the

close

method to block while the operating system attempts to
transmit the unsent data or it decides that it is unable to transmit the
data. If the value of the socket option is less than zero then the option
is disabled. In that case the

close

method does not wait until
unsent data is transmitted; if possible the operating system will transmit
any unsent data before the connection is closed.

This socket option is intended for use with sockets that are configured
in

blocking

mode
only. The behavior of the

close

method when this option is
enabled on a non-blocking socket is not defined.

The initial value of this socket option is a negative value, meaning
that the option is disabled. The option may be enabled, or the linger
interval changed, at any time. The maximum value of the linger interval
is system dependent. Setting the linger interval to a value that is
greater than its maximum value causes the linger interval to be set to
its maximum value.
