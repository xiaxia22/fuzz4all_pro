# Class FilePermission

**Source:** `java.base\java\io\FilePermission.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
FilePermission

extends
Permission

implements
Serializable
```

This class represents access to a file or directory. A FilePermission consists
of a pathname and a set of actions valid for that pathname.

Pathname is the pathname of the file or directory granted the specified
actions. A pathname that ends in "/*" (where "/" is
the file separator character,

File.separatorChar

) indicates
all the files and directories contained in that directory. A pathname
that ends with "/-" indicates (recursively) all files
and subdirectories contained in that directory. Such a pathname is called
a wildcard pathname. Otherwise, it's a simple pathname.

A pathname consisting of the special token "<<ALL FILES>>"
matches

any

file.

Note: A pathname consisting of a single "*" indicates all the files
in the current directory, while a pathname consisting of a single "-"
indicates all the files in the current directory and
(recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in the current
directory.

The actions to be granted are passed to the constructor in a string containing
a list of one or more comma-separated keywords. The possible keywords are
"read", "write", "execute", "delete", and "readlink". Their meaning is
defined as follows:

The actions string is converted to lowercase before processing.

Be careful when granting FilePermissions. Think about the implications
of granting read and especially write access to various files and
directories. The "<<ALL FILES>>" permission with write action is
especially dangerous. This grants permission to write to the entire
file system. One thing this effectively allows is replacement of the
system binary, including the JVM runtime environment.

Please note: Code can always read a file from the same
directory it's in (or a subdirectory of that directory); it does not
need explicit permission to do so.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public FilePermission​(
String
path,

String
actions)

Creates a new FilePermission object with the specified actions.

path

is the pathname of a file or directory, and

actions

contains a comma-separated list of the desired actions granted on the
file or directory. Possible actions are
"read", "write", "execute", "delete", and "readlink".

A pathname that ends in "/*" (where "/" is
the file separator character,

File.separatorChar

)
indicates all the files and directories contained in that directory.
A pathname that ends with "/-" indicates (recursively) all files and
subdirectories contained in that directory. The special pathname
"<<ALL FILES>>" matches any file.

A pathname consisting of a single "*" indicates all the files
in the current directory, while a pathname consisting of a single "-"
indicates all the files in the current directory and
(recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in the current
directory.

A pathname containing an empty string represents an empty path.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the pathname of the file/directory.
- actions

- the action string.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If actions is

null

, empty or contains an action
other than the specified possible actions.

**Implementation Note:**
- In this implementation, the

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

system property dictates how
the

path

argument is processed and stored.

If the value of the system property is set to

true

,

path

is canonicalized and stored as a String object named

cpath

.
This means a relative path is converted to an absolute path, a Windows
DOS-style 8.3 path is expanded to a long path, and a symbolic link is
resolved to its target, etc.

If the value of the system property is set to

false

,

path

is converted to a

Path

object named

npath

after

normalization

. No canonicalization is
performed which means the underlying file system is not accessed.
If an

InvalidPathException

is thrown during the conversion,
this

FilePermission

will be labeled as invalid.

In either case, the "*" or "-" character at the end of a wildcard

path

is removed before canonicalization or normalization.
It is stored in a separate wildcard flag field.

The default value of the

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

system property is

false

in this implementation.

---

### Method Details

#### public boolean implies​(
Permission
p)

Checks if this FilePermission object "implies" the specified permission.

More specifically, this method returns true if:

- p

is an instanceof FilePermission,

p

's actions are a proper subset of this
object's actions, and

p

's pathname is implied by this object's
pathname. For example, "/tmp/*" implies "/tmp/foo", since
"/tmp/*" encompasses all files in the "/tmp" directory,
including the one named "foo".

Precisely, a simple pathname implies another simple pathname
if and only if they are equal. A simple pathname never implies
a wildcard pathname. A wildcard pathname implies another wildcard
pathname if and only if all simple pathnames implied by the latter
are implied by the former. A wildcard pathname implies a simple
pathname if and only if

- if the wildcard flag is "*", the simple pathname's path
must be right inside the wildcard pathname's path.

if the wildcard flag is "-", the simple pathname's path
must be recursively inside the wildcard pathname's path.

"<<ALL FILES>>" implies every other pathname. No pathname,
except for "<<ALL FILES>>" itself, implies
"<<ALL FILES>>".

**Specified by:**
- implies

in class

Permission

**Parameters:**
- p

- the permission to check against.

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified permission is not

null

and is implied by this object,

false

otherwise.

**Implementation Note:**
- If

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

is

true

, a
simple

cpath

is inside a wildcard

cpath

if and only if
after removing the base name (the last name in the pathname's name
sequence) from the former the remaining part equals to the latter,
a simple

cpath

is recursively inside a wildcard

cpath

if and only if the former starts with the latter.

If

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

is

false

, a
simple

npath

is inside a wildcard

npath

if and only if

simple_npath.relativize(wildcard_npath)

is exactly "..",
a simple

npath

is recursively inside a wildcard

npath

if and only if

simple_npath.relativize(wildcard_npath)

is a
series of one or more "..". This means "/-" implies "/foo" but not "foo".

An invalid

FilePermission

does not imply any object except for
itself. An invalid

FilePermission

is not implied by any object
except for itself or a

FilePermission

on
"<<ALL FILES>>" whose actions is a superset of this
invalid

FilePermission

. Even if two

FilePermission

are created with the same invalid path, one does not imply the other.

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Checks two FilePermission objects for equality. Checks that

obj

is
a FilePermission, and has the same pathname and actions as this object.

**Specified by:**
- equals

in class

Permission

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object we are testing for equality with this object.

**Returns:**
- true

if obj is a FilePermission, and has the same
pathname and actions as this FilePermission object,

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

**Implementation Note:**
- More specifically, two pathnames are the same if and only if
they have the same wildcard flag and their

cpath

(if

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

is

true

) or

npath

(if

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

is

false

) are equal. Or they are both "<<ALL FILES>>".

When

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

is

false

, an
invalid

FilePermission

does not equal to any object except
for itself, even if they are created using the same invalid path.

---

#### public int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this object.

**Specified by:**
- hashCode

in class

Permission

**Returns:**
- a hash code value for this object.

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public
String
getActions()

Returns the "canonical string representation" of the actions.
That is, this method always returns present actions in the following order:
read, write, execute, delete, readlink. For example, if this FilePermission
object allows both write and read actions, a call to

getActions

will return the string "read,write".

**Specified by:**
- getActions

in class

Permission

**Returns:**
- the canonical string representation of the actions.

---

#### public
PermissionCollection
newPermissionCollection()

Returns a new PermissionCollection object for storing FilePermission
objects.

FilePermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them
to be inserted into the collection in any order, but that also enables the
PermissionCollection

implies

method to be implemented in an efficient (and consistent) manner.

For example, if you have two FilePermissions:

- "/tmp/-", "read"

"/tmp/scratch/foo", "write"

and you are calling the

implies

method with the FilePermission:

```java
"/tmp/scratch/foo", "read,write",
```

then the

implies

function must
take into account both the "/tmp/-" and "/tmp/scratch/foo"
permissions, so the effective permission is "read,write",
and

implies

returns true. The "implies" semantics for
FilePermissions are handled properly by the PermissionCollection object
returned by this

newPermissionCollection

method.

**Overrides:**
- newPermissionCollection

in class

Permission

**Returns:**
- a new PermissionCollection object suitable for storing
FilePermissions.

Creates a new FilePermission object with the specified actions.

path

is the pathname of a file or directory, and

actions

contains a comma-separated list of the desired actions granted on the
file or directory. Possible actions are
"read", "write", "execute", "delete", and "readlink".

A pathname that ends in "/*" (where "/" is

File.separatorChar

)
indicates all the files and directories contained in that directory.
A pathname that ends with "/-" indicates (recursively) all files and
subdirectories contained in that directory. The special pathname
"<<ALL FILES>>" matches any file.

A pathname consisting of a single "*" indicates all the files
in the current directory, while a pathname consisting of a single "-"
indicates all the files in the current directory and
(recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in the current
directory.

A pathname containing an empty string represents an empty path.

**Implementation Note:** In this implementation, the

Method Detail

- implies

```java
public boolean implies​(
Permission
p)
```

Checks if this FilePermission object "implies" the specified permission.

More specifically, this method returns true if:

- p

is an instanceof FilePermission,

p

's actions are a proper subset of this
object's actions, and

p

's pathname is implied by this object's
pathname. For example, "/tmp/*" implies "/tmp/foo", since
"/tmp/*" encompasses all files in the "/tmp" directory,
including the one named "foo".

Precisely, a simple pathname implies another simple pathname
if and only if they are equal. A simple pathname never implies
a wildcard pathname. A wildcard pathname implies another wildcard
pathname if and only if all simple pathnames implied by the latter
are implied by the former. A wildcard pathname implies a simple
pathname if and only if

- if the wildcard flag is "*", the simple pathname's path
must be right inside the wildcard pathname's path.

if the wildcard flag is "-", the simple pathname's path
must be recursively inside the wildcard pathname's path.

"<<ALL FILES>>" implies every other pathname. No pathname,
except for "<<ALL FILES>>" itself, implies
"<<ALL FILES>>".

**Specified by:** implies

in class

Permission
**Implementation Note:** If

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

is

true

, a
simple

cpath

is inside a wildcard

cpath

if and only if
after removing the base name (the last name in the pathname's name
sequence) from the former the remaining part equals to the latter,
a simple

cpath

is recursively inside a wildcard

cpath

if and only if the former starts with the latter.

If

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

is

false

, a
simple

npath

is inside a wildcard

npath

if and only if

simple_npath.relativize(wildcard_npath)

is exactly "..",
a simple

npath

is recursively inside a wildcard

npath

if and only if

simple_npath.relativize(wildcard_npath)

is a
series of one or more "..". This means "/-" implies "/foo" but not "foo".

An invalid

FilePermission

does not imply any object except for
itself. An invalid

FilePermission

is not implied by any object
except for itself or a

FilePermission

on
"<<ALL FILES>>" whose actions is a superset of this
invalid

FilePermission

. Even if two

FilePermission

are created with the same invalid path, one does not imply the other.
**Parameters:** p

- the permission to check against.
**Returns:** true

if the specified permission is not

null

and is implied by this object,

false

otherwise.

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Checks two FilePermission objects for equality. Checks that

obj

is
a FilePermission, and has the same pathname and actions as this object.

**Specified by:** equals

in class

Permission
**Implementation Note:** More specifically, two pathnames are the same if and only if
they have the same wildcard flag and their

cpath

(if

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

is

true

) or

npath

(if

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

is

false

) are equal. Or they are both "<<ALL FILES>>".

When

jdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath

is

false

, an
invalid

FilePermission

does not equal to any object except
for itself, even if they are created using the same invalid path.
**Parameters:** obj

- the object we are testing for equality with this object.
**Returns:** true

if obj is a FilePermission, and has the same
pathname and actions as this FilePermission object,

false

otherwise.
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this object.

**Specified by:** hashCode

in class

Permission
**Returns:** a hash code value for this object.
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- getActions

```java
public
String
getActions()
```

Returns the "canonical string representation" of the actions.
That is, this method always returns present actions in the following order:
read, write, execute, delete, readlink. For example, if this FilePermission
object allows both write and read actions, a call to

getActions

will return the string "read,write".

**Specified by:** getActions

in class

Permission
**Returns:** the canonical string representation of the actions.

- newPermissionCollection

```java
public
PermissionCollection
newPermissionCollection()
```

Returns a new PermissionCollection object for storing FilePermission
objects.

FilePermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them
to be inserted into the collection in any order, but that also enables the
PermissionCollection

implies

method to be implemented in an efficient (and consistent) manner.

For example, if you have two FilePermissions:

- "/tmp/-", "read"

"/tmp/scratch/foo", "write"

and you are calling the

implies

method with the FilePermission:

```java
"/tmp/scratch/foo", "read,write",
```

then the

implies

function must
take into account both the "/tmp/-" and "/tmp/scratch/foo"
permissions, so the effective permission is "read,write",
and

implies

returns true. The "implies" semantics for
FilePermissions are handled properly by the PermissionCollection object
returned by this

newPermissionCollection

method.

**Overrides:** newPermissionCollection

in class

Permission
**Returns:** a new PermissionCollection object suitable for storing
FilePermissions.
