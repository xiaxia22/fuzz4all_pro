# Class ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\concurrent\ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor

extends
ThreadPoolExecutor

implements
ScheduledExecutorService
```

A

ThreadPoolExecutor

that can additionally schedule
commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically.
This class is preferable to

Timer

when multiple
worker threads are needed, or when the additional flexibility or
capabilities of

ThreadPoolExecutor

(which this class
extends) are required.

Delayed tasks execute no sooner than they are enabled, but
without any real-time guarantees about when, after they are
enabled, they will commence. Tasks scheduled for exactly the same
execution time are enabled in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order of
submission.

When a submitted task is cancelled before it is run, execution
is suppressed. By default, such a cancelled task is not
automatically removed from the work queue until its delay elapses.
While this enables further inspection and monitoring, it may also
cause unbounded retention of cancelled tasks. To avoid this, use

setRemoveOnCancelPolicy(boolean)

to cause tasks to be immediately
removed from the work queue at time of cancellation.

Successive executions of a periodic task scheduled via

scheduleAtFixedRate

or

scheduleWithFixedDelay

do not overlap. While different executions may be performed by
different threads, the effects of prior executions

happen-before

those of subsequent ones.

While this class inherits from

ThreadPoolExecutor

, a few
of the inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In
particular, because it acts as a fixed-sized pool using

corePoolSize

threads and an unbounded queue, adjustments
to

maximumPoolSize

have no useful effect. Additionally, it
is almost never a good idea to set

corePoolSize

to zero or
use

allowCoreThreadTimeOut

because this may leave the pool
without threads to handle tasks once they become eligible to run.

As with

ThreadPoolExecutor

, if not otherwise specified,
this class uses

Executors.defaultThreadFactory()

as the
default thread factory, and

ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy

as the default rejected execution handler.

Extension notes:

This class overrides the

execute

and

submit

methods to generate internal

ScheduledFuture

objects to
control per-task delays and scheduling. To preserve
functionality, any further overrides of these methods in
subclasses must invoke superclass versions, which effectively
disables additional task customization. However, this class
provides alternative protected extension method

decorateTask

(one version each for

Runnable

and

Callable

) that can be used to customize the concrete task
types used to execute commands entered via

execute

,

submit

,

schedule

,

scheduleAtFixedRate

,
and

scheduleWithFixedDelay

. By default, a

ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor

uses a task type extending

FutureTask

. However, this may be modified or replaced using
subclasses of the form:

```java
public class CustomScheduledExecutor extends ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor {

static class CustomTask<V> implements RunnableScheduledFuture<V> { ... }

protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(
Runnable r, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {
return new CustomTask<V>(r, task);
}

protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(
Callable<V> c, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {
return new CustomTask<V>(c, task);
}
// ... add constructors, etc.
}
```

#### public
ScheduledFuture
<?> scheduleAtFixedRate​(
Runnable
command,
long initialDelay,
long period,

TimeUnit
unit)

Submits a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the
given initial delay, and subsequently with the given period;
that is, executions will commence after

initialDelay

, then

initialDelay + period

, then

initialDelay + 2 * period

, and so on.

The sequence of task executions continues indefinitely until
one of the following exceptional completions occur:

- The task is

explicitly cancelled

via the returned future.

Method

shutdown()

is called and the

policy on
whether to continue after shutdown

is not set true, or method

shutdownNow()

is called; also resulting in task
cancellation.

An execution of the task throws an exception. In this case
calling

get

on the returned future will throw

ExecutionException

, holding the exception as its cause.

Subsequent executions are suppressed. Subsequent calls to

isDone()

on the returned future will
return

true

.

If any execution of this task takes longer than its period, then
subsequent executions may start late, but will not concurrently
execute.

- initialDelay

- the time to delay first execution
- period

- the period between successive executions
- unit

- the time unit of the initialDelay and period parameters

**Returns:**

method will never return normally,
and will throw an exception upon task cancellation or
abnormal termination of a task execution.

**Throws:**
- RejectedExecutionException

- if the task cannot be
scheduled for execution
- NullPointerException

- if command or unit is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if period less than or equal to zero

---

#### public
ScheduledFuture
<?> scheduleWithFixedDelay​(
Runnable
command,
long initialDelay,
long delay,

TimeUnit
unit)

Submits a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the
given initial delay, and subsequently with the given delay
between the termination of one execution and the commencement of
the next.

The sequence of task executions continues indefinitely until
one of the following exceptional completions occur:

- The task is

explicitly cancelled

via the returned future.

Method

shutdown()

is called and the

policy on
whether to continue after shutdown

is not set true, or method

shutdownNow()

is called; also resulting in task
cancellation.

An execution of the task throws an exception. In this case
calling

get

on the returned future will throw

ExecutionException

, holding the exception as its cause.

Subsequent executions are suppressed. Subsequent calls to

isDone()

on the returned future will
return

true

.

**Specified by:**
- scheduleWithFixedDelay

in interface

ScheduledExecutorService

**Parameters:**
- command

- the task to execute
- initialDelay

- the time to delay first execution
- delay

- the delay between the termination of one
execution and the commencement of the next
- unit

- the time unit of the initialDelay and delay parameters

**Returns:**
- a ScheduledFuture representing pending completion of
the series of repeated tasks. The future's

get()

method will never return normally,
and will throw an exception upon task cancellation or
abnormal termination of a task execution.

- if the task cannot be
scheduled for execution
- NullPointerException

- if command or unit is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if delay less than or equal to zero

---

#### public void execute​(
Runnable
command)

Executes

command

with zero required delay.
This has effect equivalent to

schedule(command, 0, anyUnit)

.
Note that inspections of the queue and of the list returned by

shutdownNow

will access the zero-delayed

ScheduledFuture

, not the

command

itself.

A consequence of the use of

ScheduledFuture

objects is
that

afterExecute

is always
called with a null second

Throwable

argument, even if the

command

terminated abruptly. Instead, the

Throwable

thrown by such a task can be obtained via

Future.get()

.

**Specified by:**

true

, continue after shutdown, else don't

**See Also:**
- getContinueExistingPeriodicTasksAfterShutdownPolicy()

---

#### public boolean getContinueExistingPeriodicTasksAfterShutdownPolicy()

Gets the policy on whether to continue executing existing
periodic tasks even when this executor has been

shutdown

.
In this case, executions will continue until

shutdownNow

or the policy is set to

false

when already shutdown.
This value is by default

false

.

**Returns:**
- true

if will continue after shutdown

**See Also:**
- setContinueExistingPeriodicTasksAfterShutdownPolicy(boolean)

---

#### public void setExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy​(boolean value)

Sets the policy on whether to execute existing delayed
tasks even when this executor has been

shutdown

.
In this case, these tasks will only terminate upon

shutdownNow

, or after setting the policy to

false

This value is by default

true

.

**Parameters:**
- value

- if

true

, execute after shutdown, else don't

**See Also:**
- getExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy()

---

#### public boolean getExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy()

Gets the policy on whether to execute existing delayed
tasks even when this executor has been

shutdown

.
In this case, these tasks will only terminate upon

shutdownNow

, or after setting the policy to

false

when already shutdown.
This value is by default

true

.

**Returns:**
- true

if will execute after shutdown

**See Also:**
- setExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy(boolean)

---

#### public void setRemoveOnCancelPolicy​(boolean value)

removed from the work queue at time of cancellation. This value is
by default

false

.

**Parameters:**
- value

- if

true

, remove on cancellation, else don't

**See Also:**
- getRemoveOnCancelPolicy()

removed from the work queue at time of cancellation. This value is
by default

false

.

**Returns:**
- true

if cancelled tasks are immediately removed
from the queue

**See Also:**
- setRemoveOnCancelPolicy(boolean)

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public void shutdown()

Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted
tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.
Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down.

This method does not wait for previously submitted tasks to
complete execution. Use

awaitTermination

to do that.

If the

ExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy

has been set

false

, existing delayed tasks whose delays
have not yet elapsed are cancelled. And unless the

ContinueExistingPeriodicTasksAfterShutdownPolicy

has been set

true

, future executions of existing periodic tasks will
be cancelled.

**Specified by:**
- shutdown

in interface

ExecutorService

**Overrides:**
- shutdown

in class

ThreadPoolExecutor

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and
shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
because it does not hold

RuntimePermission

("modifyThread")

,
or the security manager's

checkAccess

method
denies access.

---

#### public
List
<
Runnable
> shutdownNow()

Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the
processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks
that were awaiting execution. These tasks are drained (removed)
from the task queue upon return from this method.

This method does not wait for actively executing tasks to
terminate. Use

awaitTermination

to
do that.

There are no guarantees beyond best-effort attempts to stop
processing actively executing tasks. This implementation
interrupts tasks via

Thread.interrupt()

; any task that
fails to respond to interrupts may never terminate.

**Specified by:**
- shutdownNow

in interface

ExecutorService

**Overrides:**
- shutdownNow

in class

ThreadPoolExecutor

**Returns:**
- list of tasks that never commenced execution.
Each element of this list is a

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted via one of the

schedule

methods, the element will be identical to the returned

ScheduledFuture

. For tasks submitted using

execute

, the element will be a
zero-delay

ScheduledFuture

.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and
shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
because it does not hold

RuntimePermission

("modifyThread")

,
or the security manager's

checkAccess

method
denies access.

---

#### public
BlockingQueue
<
Runnable
> getQueue()

Returns the task queue used by this executor. Access to the
task queue is intended primarily for debugging and monitoring.
This queue may be in active use. Retrieving the task queue
does not prevent queued tasks from executing.

Each element of this queue is a

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted via one of the

schedule

methods, the
element will be identical to the returned

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted using

execute

, the element
will be a zero-delay

ScheduledFuture

.

Iteration over this queue is

not

guaranteed to traverse
tasks in the order in which they will execute.

**Overrides:**
- getQueue

in class

ThreadPoolExecutor

**Returns:**
- the task queue

While this enables further inspection and monitoring, it may also
cause unbounded retention of cancelled tasks. To avoid this, use

setRemoveOnCancelPolicy(boolean)

to cause tasks to be immediately
removed from the work queue at time of cancellation.

Successive executions of a periodic task scheduled via

scheduleAtFixedRate

or

scheduleWithFixedDelay

do not overlap. While different executions may be performed by
different threads, the effects of prior executions

happen-before

those of subsequent ones.

While this class inherits from

ThreadPoolExecutor

, a few
of the inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In
particular, because it acts as a fixed-sized pool using

corePoolSize

threads and an unbounded queue, adjustments
to

maximumPoolSize

have no useful effect. Additionally, it
is almost never a good idea to set

corePoolSize

to zero or
use

allowCoreThreadTimeOut

because this may leave the pool
without threads to handle tasks once they become eligible to run.

As with

ThreadPoolExecutor

, if not otherwise specified,
this class uses

Executors.defaultThreadFactory()

as the
default thread factory, and

ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy

as the default rejected execution handler.

Extension notes:

This class overrides the

execute

and

submit

methods to generate internal

ScheduledFuture

objects to
control per-task delays and scheduling. To preserve
functionality, any further overrides of these methods in
subclasses must invoke superclass versions, which effectively
disables additional task customization. However, this class
provides alternative protected extension method

decorateTask

(one version each for

Runnable

and

Callable

) that can be used to customize the concrete task
types used to execute commands entered via

execute

,

submit

,

schedule

,

scheduleAtFixedRate

,
and

scheduleWithFixedDelay

. By default, a

ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor

uses a task type extending

FutureTask

. However, this may be modified or replaced using
subclasses of the form:

```java
public class CustomScheduledExecutor extends ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor {

static class CustomTask<V> implements RunnableScheduledFuture<V> { ... }

protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(
Runnable r, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {
return new CustomTask<V>(r, task);
}

Callable<V> c, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {

Description copied from interface:

ScheduledExecutorService

Submits a value-returning one-shot task that becomes enabled
after the given delay.

**Specified by:** schedule

in interface

ScheduledExecutorService
**Type Parameters:** V

- the type of the callable's result
**Parameters:** callable

- the function to execute
**Parameters:** delay

- the time from now to delay execution
**Parameters:** unit

- the time unit of the delay parameter
**Returns:** a ScheduledFuture that can be used to extract result or cancel
**Throws:** RejectedExecutionException

scheduled for execution
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if callable or unit is null

- scheduleAtFixedRate

```java
public
ScheduledFuture
<?> scheduleAtFixedRate​(
Runnable
command,
long initialDelay,
long period,

TimeUnit
unit)
```

Submits a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the
given initial delay, and subsequently with the given period;
that is, executions will commence after

initialDelay

, then

initialDelay + period

, then

initialDelay + 2 * period

, and so on.

The sequence of task executions continues indefinitely until
one of the following exceptional completions occur:

- The task is

explicitly cancelled

via the returned future.

Method

shutdown()

is called and the

policy on
whether to continue after shutdown

is not set true, or method

shutdownNow()

is called; also resulting in task
cancellation.

An execution of the task throws an exception. In this case
calling

get

on the returned future will throw

ExecutionException

, holding the exception as its cause.

Subsequent executions are suppressed. Subsequent calls to

isDone()

on the returned future will
return

true

.

If any execution of this task takes longer than its period, then
subsequent executions may start late, but will not concurrently
execute.

**Specified by:** scheduleAtFixedRate

in interface

ScheduledExecutorService
**Parameters:** command

- the task to execute
**Parameters:** initialDelay

- the time to delay first execution
**Parameters:** period

- the period between successive executions
**Parameters:** unit

- the time unit of the initialDelay and period parameters
**Returns:** a ScheduledFuture representing pending completion of
the series of repeated tasks. The future's

get()

method will never return normally,
and will throw an exception upon task cancellation or
abnormal termination of a task execution.
**Throws:** RejectedExecutionException

- if the task cannot be
scheduled for execution
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if command or unit is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if period less than or equal to zero

- scheduleWithFixedDelay

```java
public
ScheduledFuture
<?> scheduleWithFixedDelay​(
Runnable
command,
long initialDelay,
long delay,

TimeUnit
unit)
```

Submits a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the
given initial delay, and subsequently with the given delay
between the termination of one execution and the commencement of
the next.

The sequence of task executions continues indefinitely until
one of the following exceptional completions occur:

- The task is

explicitly cancelled

via the returned future.

Method

shutdown()

is called and the

policy on
whether to continue after shutdown

is not set true, or method

shutdownNow()

is called; also resulting in task
cancellation.

An execution of the task throws an exception. In this case
calling

get

on the returned future will throw

ExecutionException

, holding the exception as its cause.

Subsequent executions are suppressed. Subsequent calls to

isDone()

on the returned future will
return

true

.

**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if command or unit is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- execute

```java
public void execute​(
Runnable
command)
```

Executes

command

with zero required delay.
This has effect equivalent to

schedule(command, 0, anyUnit)

.
Note that inspections of the queue and of the list returned by

shutdownNow

will access the zero-delayed

ScheduledFuture

, not the

command

itself.

A consequence of the use of

ScheduledFuture

objects is
that

afterExecute

is always
called with a null second

Throwable

argument, even if the

command

terminated abruptly. Instead, the

Throwable

thrown by such a task can be obtained via

Future.get()

.

shutdownNow

, or after setting the policy to

false

when already shutdown.
This value is by default

true

.

**Parameters:** value

- if

true

, execute after shutdown, else don't
**See Also:** getExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy()

- getExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy

removed from the work queue at time of cancellation. This value is
by default

false

.

**Parameters:** value

- if

true

, remove on cancellation, else don't
**Since:** 1.7

- shutdown

```java
public void shutdown()
```

Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted
tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.
Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down.

This method does not wait for previously submitted tasks to
complete execution. Use

awaitTermination

to do that.

If the

ExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy

has been set

false

, existing delayed tasks whose delays
have not yet elapsed are cancelled. And unless the

ContinueExistingPeriodicTasksAfterShutdownPolicy

has been set

true

, future executions of existing periodic tasks will
be cancelled.

**Specified by:** shutdown

in interface

ExecutorService
**Overrides:** shutdown

in class

ThreadPoolExecutor
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and
shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
because it does not hold

RuntimePermission

("modifyThread")

,
or the security manager's

checkAccess

method
denies access.

- shutdownNow

```java
public
List
<
Runnable
> shutdownNow()
```

Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the
processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks
that were awaiting execution. These tasks are drained (removed)
from the task queue upon return from this method.

This method does not wait for actively executing tasks to
terminate. Use

awaitTermination

to
do that.

There are no guarantees beyond best-effort attempts to stop
processing actively executing tasks. This implementation
interrupts tasks via

Thread.interrupt()

; any task that
fails to respond to interrupts may never terminate.

**Specified by:** shutdownNow

in interface

ExecutorService
**Overrides:** shutdownNow

in class

ThreadPoolExecutor
**Returns:** list of tasks that never commenced execution.
Each element of this list is a

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted via one of the

schedule

methods, the element will be identical to the returned

ScheduledFuture

. For tasks submitted using

execute

, the element will be a
zero-delay

ScheduledFuture

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and
shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
because it does not hold

RuntimePermission

("modifyThread")

,
or the security manager's

checkAccess

method
denies access.

- getQueue

```java
public
BlockingQueue
<
Runnable
> getQueue()
```

Returns the task queue used by this executor. Access to the
task queue is intended primarily for debugging and monitoring.
This queue may be in active use. Retrieving the task queue
does not prevent queued tasks from executing.

Each element of this queue is a

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted via one of the

schedule

methods, the
element will be identical to the returned

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted using

execute

, the element
will be a zero-delay

ScheduledFuture

.

Iteration over this queue is

not

guaranteed to traverse
tasks in the order in which they will execute.

**Overrides:** getQueue

tasks even when this executor has been

shutdown

.
In this case, these tasks will only terminate upon

shutdownNow

, or after setting the policy to

false

when already shutdown.
This value is by default

true

.

**Parameters:** value

- if

true

, execute after shutdown, else don't
**See Also:** getExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy()

- getExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy

```java
public boolean getExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy()
```

Gets the policy on whether to execute existing delayed
tasks even when this executor has been

shutdown

.
In this case, these tasks will only terminate upon

shutdownNow

, or after setting the policy to

false

when already shutdown.
This value is by default

true

.

**Returns:** true

if will execute after shutdown
**See Also:** setExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy(boolean)

- setRemoveOnCancelPolicy

```java
public void setRemoveOnCancelPolicy​(boolean value)
```

Sets the policy on whether cancelled tasks should be immediately
removed from the work queue at time of cancellation. This value is
by default

false

.

**Parameters:** value

- if

true

, remove on cancellation, else don't
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** getRemoveOnCancelPolicy()

- getRemoveOnCancelPolicy

```java
public boolean getRemoveOnCancelPolicy()
```

Gets the policy on whether cancelled tasks should be immediately
removed from the work queue at time of cancellation. This value is
by default

false

.

**Returns:** true

if cancelled tasks are immediately removed
from the queue
**Since:** 1.7

- shutdown

```java
public void shutdown()
```

Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted
tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.
Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down.

This method does not wait for previously submitted tasks to
complete execution. Use

awaitTermination

to do that.

If the

ExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy

has been set

false

, existing delayed tasks whose delays
have not yet elapsed are cancelled. And unless the

ContinueExistingPeriodicTasksAfterShutdownPolicy

has been set

true

, future executions of existing periodic tasks will
be cancelled.

**Specified by:** shutdown

in interface

ExecutorService
**Overrides:** shutdown

in class

ThreadPoolExecutor
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and
shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
because it does not hold

RuntimePermission

("modifyThread")

,
or the security manager's

checkAccess

method
denies access.

- shutdownNow

```java
public
List
<
Runnable
> shutdownNow()
```

Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the
processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks
that were awaiting execution. These tasks are drained (removed)
from the task queue upon return from this method.

This method does not wait for actively executing tasks to
terminate. Use

awaitTermination

to
do that.

There are no guarantees beyond best-effort attempts to stop
processing actively executing tasks. This implementation
interrupts tasks via

Thread.interrupt()

; any task that
fails to respond to interrupts may never terminate.

**Specified by:** shutdownNow

in interface

ExecutorService
**Overrides:** shutdownNow

in class

ThreadPoolExecutor
**Returns:** list of tasks that never commenced execution.
Each element of this list is a

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted via one of the

schedule

methods, the element will be identical to the returned

ScheduledFuture

. For tasks submitted using

execute

, the element will be a
zero-delay

ScheduledFuture

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and
shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
because it does not hold

RuntimePermission

("modifyThread")

,
or the security manager's

checkAccess

method
denies access.

- getQueue

```java
public
BlockingQueue
<
Runnable
> getQueue()
```

Returns the task queue used by this executor. Access to the
task queue is intended primarily for debugging and monitoring.
This queue may be in active use. Retrieving the task queue
does not prevent queued tasks from executing.

Each element of this queue is a

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted via one of the

schedule

methods, the
element will be identical to the returned

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted using

execute

, the element
will be a zero-delay

ScheduledFuture

.

Iteration over this queue is

not

guaranteed to traverse
tasks in the order in which they will execute.

**Overrides:** getQueue

in class

scheduleAtFixedRate

```java
public
ScheduledFuture
<?> scheduleAtFixedRate​(
Runnable
command,
long initialDelay,
long period,

TimeUnit
unit)
```

Submits a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the
given initial delay, and subsequently with the given period;
that is, executions will commence after

initialDelay

, then

The sequence of task executions continues indefinitely until
one of the following exceptional completions occur:

- The task is

explicitly cancelled

via the returned future.

Method

shutdown()

is called and the

policy on
whether to continue after shutdown

is not set true, or method

shutdownNow()

is called; also resulting in task
cancellation.

An execution of the task throws an exception. In this case

Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the
processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks
that were awaiting execution. These tasks are drained (removed)
from the task queue upon return from this method.

This method does not wait for actively executing tasks to
terminate. Use

awaitTermination

to
do that.

There are no guarantees beyond best-effort attempts to stop
processing actively executing tasks. This implementation
interrupts tasks via

Thread.interrupt()

; any task that
fails to respond to interrupts may never terminate.

**Specified by:** shutdownNow

in interface

ExecutorService
**Overrides:** shutdownNow

in class

ThreadPoolExecutor
**Returns:** list of tasks that never commenced execution.
Each element of this list is a

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted via one of the

schedule

methods, the element will be identical to the returned

ScheduledFuture

. For tasks submitted using

execute

, the element will be a
zero-delay

ScheduledFuture

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and
shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
because it does not hold

RuntimePermission

("modifyThread")

,
or the security manager's

checkAccess

method
denies access.

```

Returns the task queue used by this executor. Access to the
task queue is intended primarily for debugging and monitoring.
This queue may be in active use. Retrieving the task queue
does not prevent queued tasks from executing.

Each element of this queue is a

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted via one of the

schedule

methods, the
element will be identical to the returned

ScheduledFuture

.
For tasks submitted using

execute

, the element
will be a zero-delay

ScheduledFuture

.

Iteration over this queue is

not

guaranteed to traverse
tasks in the order in which they will execute.
