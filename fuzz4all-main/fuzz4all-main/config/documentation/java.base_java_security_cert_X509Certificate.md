# Class X509Certificate

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\cert\X509Certificate.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
X509Certificate

extends
Certificate

implements
X509Extension
```

Abstract class for X.509 certificates. This provides a standard
way to access all the attributes of an X.509 certificate.

In June of 1996, the basic X.509 v3 format was completed by
ISO/IEC and ANSI X9, which is described below in ASN.1:

```java
Certificate ::= SEQUENCE {
tbsCertificate TBSCertificate,
signatureAlgorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
signature BIT STRING }
```

These certificates are widely used to support authentication and
other functionality in Internet security systems. Common applications
include Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), Transport Layer Security (SSL),
code signing for trusted software distribution, and Secure Electronic
Transactions (SET).

These certificates are managed and vouched for by

Certificate
Authorities

(CAs). CAs are services which create certificates by
placing data in the X.509 standard format and then digitally signing
that data. CAs act as trusted third parties, making introductions
between principals who have no direct knowledge of each other.
CA certificates are either signed by themselves, or by some other
CA such as a "root" CA.

More information can be found in

RFC 5280: Internet X.509
Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile

.

The ASN.1 definition of

tbsCertificate

is:

```java
TBSCertificate ::= SEQUENCE {
version [0] EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,
serialNumber CertificateSerialNumber,
signature AlgorithmIdentifier,
issuer Name,
validity Validity,
subject Name,
subjectPublicKeyInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
issuerUniqueID [1] IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,
-- If present, version must be v2 or v3
subjectUniqueID [2] IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,
-- If present, version must be v2 or v3
extensions [3] EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL
-- If present, version must be v3
}
```

Certificates are instantiated using a certificate factory. The following is
an example of how to instantiate an X.509 certificate:

```java
try (InputStream inStream = new FileInputStream("fileName-of-cert")) {
CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(inStream);
}
```

### Method Details

#### public abstract void checkValidity()
throws
CertificateExpiredException
,

CertificateNotYetValidException

Checks that the certificate is currently valid. It is if
the current date and time are within the validity period given in the
certificate.

The validity period consists of two date/time values:
the first and last dates (and times) on which the certificate
is valid. It is defined in
ASN.1 as:

```java
validity Validity

Validity ::= SEQUENCE {
notBefore CertificateValidityDate,
notAfter CertificateValidityDate }

CertificateValidityDate ::= CHOICE {
utcTime UTCTime,
generalTime GeneralizedTime }
```

**Throws:**
- CertificateExpiredException

- if the certificate has expired.
- CertificateNotYetValidException

- if the certificate is not
yet valid.

---

#### public abstract void checkValidity​(
Date
date)
throws
CertificateExpiredException
,

CertificateNotYetValidException

Checks that the given date is within the certificate's
validity period. In other words, this determines whether the
certificate would be valid at the given date/time.

**Parameters:**
- date

- the Date to check against to see if this certificate
is valid at that date/time.

**Throws:**
- CertificateExpiredException

- if the certificate has expired
with respect to the

date

supplied.
- CertificateNotYetValidException

- if the certificate is not
yet valid with respect to the

date

supplied.

**See Also:**
- checkValidity()

---

```

**Returns:**
- the version number, i.e. 1, 2 or 3.

---

#### public abstract
BigInteger
getSerialNumber()

Gets the

serialNumber

value from the certificate.
The serial number is an integer assigned by the certification
authority to each certificate. It must be unique for each
certificate issued by a given CA (i.e., the issuer name and
serial number identify a unique certificate).

getIssuerX500Principal()

. This method returns the

issuer

as an implementation specific Principal object, which should not be
relied upon by portable code.

Gets the

issuer

(issuer distinguished name) value from
the certificate. The issuer name identifies the entity that signed (and
issued) the certificate.

The issuer name field contains an
X.500 distinguished name (DN).
The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
issuer Name

Name ::= CHOICE { RDNSequence }
RDNSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedName
RelativeDistinguishedName ::=
SET OF AttributeValueAssertion

describes a hierarchical name composed of
attributes,
such as country name, and corresponding values, such as US.
The type of the

AttributeValue

component is determined by
the

AttributeType

; in general it will be a

directoryString

. A

directoryString

is usually
one of

```java
signature BIT STRING
```

**Returns:**
- the signature.

---

#### public abstract
String
getSigAlgName()

Gets the signature algorithm name for the certificate
signature algorithm. An example is the string "SHA256withRSA".
The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
signatureAlgorithm AlgorithmIdentifier

AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }
-- contains a value of the type
-- registered for use with the
-- algorithm object identifier value
```

The algorithm name is determined from the

algorithm

OID string.

by periods.
For example, the string "1.2.840.10040.4.3" identifies the SHA-1
with DSA signature algorithm defined in

RFC 3279: Algorithms and
Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
and CRL Profile

.

See

getSigAlgName

for
relevant ASN.1 definitions.

**Returns:**
- the signature algorithm OID string.

---

#### public abstract byte[] getSigAlgParams()

Gets the DER-encoded signature algorithm parameters from this
certificate's signature algorithm. In most cases, the signature
algorithm parameters are null; the parameters are usually
supplied with the certificate's public key.
If access to individual parameter values is needed then use

AlgorithmParameters

and instantiate with the name returned by

getSigAlgName

.

See

getSigAlgName

for
relevant ASN.1 definitions.

**Returns:**
- the DER-encoded signature algorithm parameters, or
null if no parameters are present.

---

#### public abstract boolean[] getIssuerUniqueID()

Gets the

issuerUniqueID

value from the certificate.
The issuer unique identifier is present in the certificate
to handle the possibility of reuse of issuer names over time.
RFC 5280 recommends that names not be reused and that
conforming certificates not make use of unique identifiers.
Applications conforming to that profile should be capable of
parsing unique identifiers and making comparisons.

The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
issuerUniqueID [1] IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL

UniqueIdentifier ::= BIT STRING
```

**Returns:**
- the issuer unique identifier or null if it is not
present in the certificate.

---

#### public abstract boolean[] getSubjectUniqueID()

Gets the

subjectUniqueID

value from the certificate.

The ASN.1 definition for this is:

UniqueIdentifier ::= BIT STRING
```

**Returns:**
- the subject unique identifier or null if it is not
present in the certificate.

---

#### public abstract boolean[] getKeyUsage()

Gets a boolean array representing bits of
the

KeyUsage

extension, (OID = 2.5.29.15).
The key usage extension defines the purpose (e.g., encipherment,
signature, certificate signing) of the key contained in the
certificate.
The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
KeyUsage ::= BIT STRING {
digitalSignature (0),
nonRepudiation (1),
keyEncipherment (2),
dataEncipherment (3),
keyAgreement (4),
keyCertSign (5),
cRLSign (6),
encipherOnly (7),
decipherOnly (8) }
```

RFC 5280 recommends that when used, this be marked
as a critical extension.

**Returns:**
- the KeyUsage extension of this certificate, represented as
an array of booleans. The order of KeyUsage values in the array is
the same as in the above ASN.1 definition. The array will contain a
value for each KeyUsage defined above. If the KeyUsage list encoded
in the certificate is longer than the above list, it will not be
truncated. Returns null if this certificate does not
contain a KeyUsage extension.

---

#### public
List
<
String
> getExtendedKeyUsage()
throws
CertificateParsingException

Gets an unmodifiable list of Strings representing the OBJECT
IDENTIFIERs of the

ExtKeyUsageSyntax

field of the
extended key usage extension, (OID = 2.5.29.37). It indicates
one or more purposes for which the certified public key may be
used, in addition to or in place of the basic purposes
indicated in the key usage extension field. The ASN.1
definition for this is:

```java
ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
```

Key purposes may be defined by any organization with a
need. Object identifiers used to identify key purposes shall be
assigned in accordance with IANA or ITU-T Rec. X.660 |
ISO/IEC/ITU 9834-1.

This method was added to version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform Standard
Edition. In order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing
service providers, this method is not

abstract

and it provides a default implementation. Subclasses
should override this method with a correct implementation.

**Returns:**
- the ExtendedKeyUsage extension of this certificate,
as an unmodifiable list of object identifiers represented
as Strings. Returns null if this certificate does not
contain an ExtendedKeyUsage extension.

**Throws:**
- CertificateParsingException

- if the extension cannot be decoded

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public abstract int getBasicConstraints()

Gets the certificate constraints path length from the
critical

BasicConstraints

extension, (OID = 2.5.29.19).

The basic constraints extension identifies whether the subject
of the certificate is a Certificate Authority (CA) and
how deep a certification path may exist through that CA. The

pathLenConstraint

field (see below) is meaningful
only if

cA

is set to TRUE. In this case, it gives the
maximum number of CA certificates that may follow this certificate in a
certification path. A value of zero indicates that only an end-entity
certificate may follow in the path.

The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
BasicConstraints ::= SEQUENCE {
cA BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
pathLenConstraint INTEGER (0..MAX) OPTIONAL }
```

**Returns:**
- the value of

pathLenConstraint

if the
BasicConstraints extension is present in the certificate and the
subject of the certificate is a CA, otherwise -1.
If the subject of the certificate is a CA and

pathLenConstraint

does not appear,

Integer.MAX_VALUE

is returned to indicate that there is no
limit to the allowed length of the certification path.

---

#### public
Collection
<
List
<?>> getSubjectAlternativeNames()
throws
CertificateParsingException

Gets an immutable collection of subject alternative names from the

SubjectAltName

extension, (OID = 2.5.29.17).

The ASN.1 definition of the

SubjectAltName

extension is:

```java
SubjectAltName ::= GeneralNames

GeneralNames :: = SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralName

GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
otherName [0] OtherName,
rfc822Name [1] IA5String,
dNSName [2] IA5String,
x400Address [3] ORAddress,
directoryName [4] Name,
ediPartyName [5] EDIPartyName,
uniformResourceIdentifier [6] IA5String,
iPAddress [7] OCTET STRING,
registeredID [8] OBJECT IDENTIFIER}
```

If this certificate does not contain a

SubjectAltName

extension,

null

is returned. Otherwise, a

Collection

is returned with an entry representing each

GeneralName

included in the extension. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in string or ASN.1 DER encoded form,
respectively).

RFC 822

, DNS, and URI
names are returned as

String

s,
using the well-established string formats for those types (subject to
the restrictions included in RFC 5280). IPv4 address names are
returned using dotted quad notation. IPv6 address names are returned
in the form "a1:a2:...:a8", where a1-a8 are hexadecimal values
representing the eight 16-bit pieces of the address. OID names are
returned as

String

s represented as a series of nonnegative
integers separated by periods. And directory names (distinguished names)
are returned in

RFC 2253

string format. No standard string format is
defined for otherNames, X.400 names, EDI party names, or any
other type of names. They are returned as byte arrays
containing the ASN.1 DER encoded form of the name.

Note that the

Collection

returned may contain more
than one name of the same type. Also, note that the returned

Collection

is immutable and any entries containing byte
arrays are cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

This method was added to version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform Standard
Edition. In order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing
service providers, this method is not

abstract

and it provides a default implementation. Subclasses
should override this method with a correct implementation.

**Returns:**
- an immutable

Collection

of subject alternative
names (or

null

)

**Throws:**
- CertificateParsingException

- if the extension cannot be decoded

**Since:**
- 1.4

IssuerAltName

extension, (OID = 2.5.29.18).

The ASN.1 definition of the

IssuerAltName

extension is:

```java
IssuerAltName ::= GeneralNames
```

The ASN.1 definition of

GeneralNames

is defined
in

getSubjectAlternativeNames

.

If this certificate does not contain an

IssuerAltName

extension,

null

is returned. Otherwise, a

Collection

is returned with an entry representing each

GeneralName

included in the extension. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in string or ASN.1 DER encoded form,
respectively). For more details about the formats used for each
name type, see the

getSubjectAlternativeNames

method.

Note that the

Collection

returned may contain more
than one name of the same type. Also, note that the returned

Collection

is immutable and any entries containing byte
arrays are cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

This method was added to version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform Standard
Edition. In order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing
service providers, this method is not

abstract

and it provides a default implementation. Subclasses
should override this method with a correct implementation.

**Returns:**

Certificates are instantiated using a certificate factory. The following is
an example of how to instantiate an X.509 certificate:

```java
try (InputStream inStream = new FileInputStream("fileName-of-cert")) {
CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(inStream);
}
```

```

Constructor for X.509 certificates.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- checkValidity

```java
public abstract void checkValidity()
throws
CertificateExpiredException
,

CertificateNotYetValidException
```

Checks that the certificate is currently valid. It is if
the current date and time are within the validity period given in the
certificate.

The validity period consists of two date/time values:
the first and last dates (and times) on which the certificate
is valid. It is defined in
ASN.1 as:

```java
validity Validity

Validity ::= SEQUENCE {
notBefore CertificateValidityDate,
notAfter CertificateValidityDate }

CertificateValidityDate ::= CHOICE {
utcTime UTCTime,
generalTime GeneralizedTime }
```

**Throws:** CertificateExpiredException

- if the certificate has expired.
**Throws:** CertificateNotYetValidException

- if the certificate is not
yet valid.

- checkValidity

```java
public abstract void checkValidity​(
Date
date)
throws
CertificateExpiredException
,

CertificateNotYetValidException
```

Checks that the given date is within the certificate's
validity period. In other words, this determines whether the
certificate would be valid at the given date/time.

**Parameters:** date

- the Date to check against to see if this certificate
is valid at that date/time.
**Throws:** CertificateExpiredException

- if the certificate has expired
with respect to the

date

supplied.
**Throws:** CertificateNotYetValidException

- if the certificate is not
yet valid with respect to the

date

supplied.
**See Also:** checkValidity()

- getVersion

```java
public abstract int getVersion()
```

Gets the

version

(version number) value from the
certificate.
The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
version [0] EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1

Version ::= INTEGER { v1(0), v2(1), v3(2) }
```

**Returns:** the version number, i.e. 1, 2 or 3.

- getSerialNumber

```java
public abstract
BigInteger
getSerialNumber()
```

Gets the

serialNumber

value from the certificate.
The serial number is an integer assigned by the certification
authority to each certificate. It must be unique for each
certificate issued by a given CA (i.e., the issuer name and
serial number identify a unique certificate).
The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
serialNumber CertificateSerialNumber

CertificateSerialNumber ::= INTEGER
```

**Returns:** the serial number.

- getIssuerDN

```java
public abstract
Principal
getIssuerDN()
```

Denigrated

, replaced by

getIssuerX500Principal()

. This method returns the

issuer

as an implementation specific Principal object, which should not be
relied upon by portable code.

Gets the

issuer

(issuer distinguished name) value from
the certificate. The issuer name identifies the entity that signed (and
issued) the certificate.

The issuer name field contains an
X.500 distinguished name (DN).
The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
issuer Name

Name ::= CHOICE { RDNSequence }
RDNSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedName
RelativeDistinguishedName ::=
SET OF AttributeValueAssertion

AttributeValueAssertion ::= SEQUENCE {
AttributeType,
AttributeValue }
AttributeType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
AttributeValue ::= ANY
```

The

Name

describes a hierarchical name composed of
attributes,
such as country name, and corresponding values, such as US.
The type of the

AttributeValue

component is determined by
the

AttributeType

; in general it will be a

directoryString

. A

directoryString

is usually
one of

PrintableString

,

TeletexString

or

UniversalString

.

**Returns:** a Principal whose name is the issuer distinguished name.

- getIssuerX500Principal

```java
public
X500Principal
getIssuerX500Principal()
```

Returns the issuer (issuer distinguished name) value from the
certificate as an

X500Principal

.

It is recommended that subclasses override this method.

**Returns:** an

X500Principal

representing the issuer
distinguished name
**Since:** 1.4

- getSubjectDN

```java
public abstract
Principal
getSubjectDN()
```

Denigrated

, replaced by

getSubjectX500Principal()

. This method returns the

subject

as an implementation specific Principal object, which should not be
relied upon by portable code.

Gets the

subject

(subject distinguished name) value
from the certificate. If the

subject

value is empty,
then the

getName()

method of the returned

Principal

object returns an empty string ("").

The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
subject Name
```

See

getIssuerDN

for

Name

and other relevant definitions.

**Returns:** a Principal whose name is the subject name.

- getSubjectX500Principal

```java
public
X500Principal
getSubjectX500Principal()
```

Returns the subject (subject distinguished name) value from the
certificate as an

X500Principal

. If the subject value
is empty, then the

getName()

method of the returned

X500Principal

object returns an empty string ("").

It is recommended that subclasses override this method.

**Returns:** an

X500Principal

representing the subject
distinguished name
**Since:** 1.4

- getNotBefore

```java
public abstract
Date
getNotBefore()
```

Gets the

notBefore

date from the validity period of
the certificate.
The relevant ASN.1 definitions are:

```java
validity Validity

Validity ::= SEQUENCE {
notBefore CertificateValidityDate,
notAfter CertificateValidityDate }

CertificateValidityDate ::= CHOICE {
utcTime UTCTime,
generalTime GeneralizedTime }
```

**Returns:** the start date of the validity period.
**See Also:** checkValidity()

tbsCertificate

from this certificate.
This can be used to verify the signature independently.

**Returns:** the DER-encoded certificate information.
**Throws:** CertificateEncodingException

- if an encoding error occurs.

- getSignature

```java
public abstract byte[] getSignature()
```

Gets the

signature

value (the raw signature bits) from
the certificate.
The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
signature BIT STRING
```

**Returns:** the signature.

- getSigAlgName

```java
public abstract
String
getSigAlgName()
```

Gets the signature algorithm name for the certificate
signature algorithm. An example is the string "SHA256withRSA".
The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
signatureAlgorithm AlgorithmIdentifier

AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }
-- contains a value of the type
-- registered for use with the
-- algorithm object identifier value
```

The algorithm name is determined from the

algorithm

OID string.

**Returns:** the signature algorithm name.

- getSigAlgOID

```java
public abstract
String
getSigAlgOID()
```

Gets the signature algorithm OID string from the certificate.
An OID is represented by a set of nonnegative whole numbers separated
by periods.
For example, the string "1.2.840.10040.4.3" identifies the SHA-1
with DSA signature algorithm defined in

RFC 3279: Algorithms and
Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
and CRL Profile

.

See

getSigAlgName

for
relevant ASN.1 definitions.

**Returns:** the signature algorithm OID string.

- getSigAlgParams

```java
public abstract byte[] getSigAlgParams()
```

Gets the DER-encoded signature algorithm parameters from this
certificate's signature algorithm. In most cases, the signature
algorithm parameters are null; the parameters are usually
supplied with the certificate's public key.
If access to individual parameter values is needed then use

AlgorithmParameters

and instantiate with the name returned by

getSigAlgName

.

See

getSigAlgName

for
relevant ASN.1 definitions.

**Returns:** the DER-encoded signature algorithm parameters, or
null if no parameters are present.

- getIssuerUniqueID

```java
public abstract boolean[] getIssuerUniqueID()
```

Gets the

issuerUniqueID

value from the certificate.
The issuer unique identifier is present in the certificate
to handle the possibility of reuse of issuer names over time.
RFC 5280 recommends that names not be reused and that
conforming certificates not make use of unique identifiers.
Applications conforming to that profile should be capable of
parsing unique identifiers and making comparisons.

The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
issuerUniqueID [1] IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL

UniqueIdentifier ::= BIT STRING
```

**Returns:** the issuer unique identifier or null if it is not
present in the certificate.

- getSubjectUniqueID

```java
public abstract boolean[] getSubjectUniqueID()
```

Gets the

subjectUniqueID

value from the certificate.

The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
subjectUniqueID [2] IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL

UniqueIdentifier ::= BIT STRING
```

**Returns:** the subject unique identifier or null if it is not
present in the certificate.

- getKeyUsage

```java
public abstract boolean[] getKeyUsage()
```

Gets a boolean array representing bits of
the

KeyUsage

extension, (OID = 2.5.29.15).
The key usage extension defines the purpose (e.g., encipherment,
signature, certificate signing) of the key contained in the
certificate.
The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
KeyUsage ::= BIT STRING {
digitalSignature (0),
nonRepudiation (1),
keyEncipherment (2),
dataEncipherment (3),
keyAgreement (4),
keyCertSign (5),
cRLSign (6),
encipherOnly (7),
decipherOnly (8) }
```

RFC 5280 recommends that when used, this be marked
as a critical extension.

**Returns:** the KeyUsage extension of this certificate, represented as
an array of booleans. The order of KeyUsage values in the array is
the same as in the above ASN.1 definition. The array will contain a
value for each KeyUsage defined above. If the KeyUsage list encoded
in the certificate is longer than the above list, it will not be
truncated. Returns null if this certificate does not
contain a KeyUsage extension.

- getExtendedKeyUsage

```java
public
List
<
String
> getExtendedKeyUsage()
throws
CertificateParsingException
```

Gets an unmodifiable list of Strings representing the OBJECT
IDENTIFIERs of the

ExtKeyUsageSyntax

field of the
extended key usage extension, (OID = 2.5.29.37). It indicates
one or more purposes for which the certified public key may be
used, in addition to or in place of the basic purposes
indicated in the key usage extension field. The ASN.1
definition for this is:

```java
ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
```

Key purposes may be defined by any organization with a
need. Object identifiers used to identify key purposes shall be
assigned in accordance with IANA or ITU-T Rec. X.660 |
ISO/IEC/ITU 9834-1.

This method was added to version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform Standard
Edition. In order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing
service providers, this method is not

abstract

and it provides a default implementation. Subclasses
should override this method with a correct implementation.

**Returns:** the ExtendedKeyUsage extension of this certificate,
as an unmodifiable list of object identifiers represented
as Strings. Returns null if this certificate does not
contain an ExtendedKeyUsage extension.
**Throws:** CertificateParsingException

- if the extension cannot be decoded
**Since:** 1.4

- getBasicConstraints

```java
public abstract int getBasicConstraints()
```

Gets the certificate constraints path length from the
critical

BasicConstraints

extension, (OID = 2.5.29.19).

The basic constraints extension identifies whether the subject
of the certificate is a Certificate Authority (CA) and
how deep a certification path may exist through that CA. The

pathLenConstraint

field (see below) is meaningful
only if

cA

is set to TRUE. In this case, it gives the
maximum number of CA certificates that may follow this certificate in a
certification path. A value of zero indicates that only an end-entity
certificate may follow in the path.

The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
BasicConstraints ::= SEQUENCE {
cA BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
pathLenConstraint INTEGER (0..MAX) OPTIONAL }
```

**Returns:** the value of

pathLenConstraint

if the
BasicConstraints extension is present in the certificate and the
subject of the certificate is a CA, otherwise -1.
If the subject of the certificate is a CA and

pathLenConstraint

does not appear,

Integer.MAX_VALUE

is returned to indicate that there is no
limit to the allowed length of the certification path.

- getSubjectAlternativeNames

```java
public
Collection
<
List
<?>> getSubjectAlternativeNames()
throws
CertificateParsingException
```

Gets an immutable collection of subject alternative names from the

SubjectAltName

extension, (OID = 2.5.29.17).

The ASN.1 definition of the

SubjectAltName

extension is:

```java
SubjectAltName ::= GeneralNames

GeneralNames :: = SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralName

GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
otherName [0] OtherName,
rfc822Name [1] IA5String,
dNSName [2] IA5String,
x400Address [3] ORAddress,
directoryName [4] Name,
ediPartyName [5] EDIPartyName,

If this certificate does not contain a

SubjectAltName

extension,

null

is returned. Otherwise, a

Collection

is returned with an entry representing each

GeneralName

included in the extension. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in string or ASN.1 DER encoded form,
respectively).

RFC 822

, DNS, and URI
names are returned as

String

s,
using the well-established string formats for those types (subject to
the restrictions included in RFC 5280). IPv4 address names are
returned using dotted quad notation. IPv6 address names are returned
in the form "a1:a2:...:a8", where a1-a8 are hexadecimal values
representing the eight 16-bit pieces of the address. OID names are
returned as

String

s represented as a series of nonnegative
integers separated by periods. And directory names (distinguished names)
are returned in

RFC 2253

string format. No standard string format is
defined for otherNames, X.400 names, EDI party names, or any
other type of names. They are returned as byte arrays
containing the ASN.1 DER encoded form of the name.

Note that the

Collection

returned may contain more
than one name of the same type. Also, note that the returned

Collection

is immutable and any entries containing byte
arrays are cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

public abstract boolean[] getIssuerUniqueID()
```

Gets the

issuerUniqueID

value from the certificate.
The issuer unique identifier is present in the certificate
to handle the possibility of reuse of issuer names over time.
RFC 5280 recommends that names not be reused and that
conforming certificates not make use of unique identifiers.
Applications conforming to that profile should be capable of
parsing unique identifiers and making comparisons.

The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
issuerUniqueID [1] IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL

UniqueIdentifier ::= BIT STRING
```

**Returns:** the issuer unique identifier or null if it is not
present in the certificate.

- getSubjectUniqueID

```java
public abstract boolean[] getSubjectUniqueID()

present in the certificate.

- getKeyUsage

```java
public abstract boolean[] getKeyUsage()
```

Gets a boolean array representing bits of
the

KeyUsage

extension, (OID = 2.5.29.15).
The key usage extension defines the purpose (e.g., encipherment,
signature, certificate signing) of the key contained in the
certificate.
The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
KeyUsage ::= BIT STRING {
digitalSignature (0),
nonRepudiation (1),
keyEncipherment (2),
dataEncipherment (3),
keyAgreement (4),
keyCertSign (5),
cRLSign (6),
encipherOnly (7),
decipherOnly (8) }
```

RFC 5280 recommends that when used, this be marked
as a critical extension.

**Returns:** the KeyUsage extension of this certificate, represented as
an array of booleans. The order of KeyUsage values in the array is
the same as in the above ASN.1 definition. The array will contain a
value for each KeyUsage defined above. If the KeyUsage list encoded
in the certificate is longer than the above list, it will not be
truncated. Returns null if this certificate does not
contain a KeyUsage extension.

- getExtendedKeyUsage

```java
public
List
<
String
> getExtendedKeyUsage()
throws
CertificateParsingException
```

Gets an unmodifiable list of Strings representing the OBJECT
IDENTIFIERs of the

ExtKeyUsageSyntax

field of the
extended key usage extension, (OID = 2.5.29.37). It indicates
one or more purposes for which the certified public key may be
used, in addition to or in place of the basic purposes
indicated in the key usage extension field. The ASN.1
definition for this is:

```java
ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
```

Key purposes may be defined by any organization with a
need. Object identifiers used to identify key purposes shall be
assigned in accordance with IANA or ITU-T Rec. X.660 |
ISO/IEC/ITU 9834-1.

This method was added to version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform Standard
Edition. In order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing
service providers, this method is not

abstract

and it provides a default implementation. Subclasses
should override this method with a correct implementation.

**Returns:** the ExtendedKeyUsage extension of this certificate,
as an unmodifiable list of object identifiers represented
as Strings. Returns null if this certificate does not
contain an ExtendedKeyUsage extension.
**Throws:** CertificateParsingException

- if the extension cannot be decoded
**Since:** 1.4

- getBasicConstraints

```java
public abstract int getBasicConstraints()
```

Gets the certificate constraints path length from the
critical

BasicConstraints

extension, (OID = 2.5.29.19).

The basic constraints extension identifies whether the subject
of the certificate is a Certificate Authority (CA) and
how deep a certification path may exist through that CA. The

pathLenConstraint

field (see below) is meaningful
only if

cA

is set to TRUE. In this case, it gives the
maximum number of CA certificates that may follow this certificate in a
certification path. A value of zero indicates that only an end-entity
certificate may follow in the path.

The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
BasicConstraints ::= SEQUENCE {
cA BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
pathLenConstraint INTEGER (0..MAX) OPTIONAL }
```

**Returns:** the value of

pathLenConstraint

if the
BasicConstraints extension is present in the certificate and the
subject of the certificate is a CA, otherwise -1.
If the subject of the certificate is a CA and

pathLenConstraint

does not appear,

Integer.MAX_VALUE

is returned to indicate that there is no
limit to the allowed length of the certification path.

Collection
<
List
<?>> getSubjectAlternativeNames()
throws
CertificateParsingException
```

Gets an immutable collection of subject alternative names from the

SubjectAltName

extension, (OID = 2.5.29.17).

The ASN.1 definition of the

SubjectAltName

extension is:

SubjectAltName ::= GeneralNames

GeneralNames :: = SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralName

GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
otherName [0] OtherName,
rfc822Name [1] IA5String,
dNSName [2] IA5String,
x400Address [3] ORAddress,
directoryName [4] Name,
ediPartyName [5] EDIPartyName,
uniformResourceIdentifier [6] IA5String,

registeredID [8] OBJECT IDENTIFIER}
```

If this certificate does not contain a

SubjectAltName

extension,

null

is returned. Otherwise, a

Collection

is returned with an entry representing each

GeneralName

included in the extension. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

returned may contain more
than one name of the same type. Also, note that the returned

Collection

is immutable and any entries containing byte
arrays are cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

respectively).

RFC 822

, DNS, and URI
names are returned as

String

s,
using the well-established string formats for those types (subject to
the restrictions included in RFC 5280). IPv4 address names are
returned using dotted quad notation. IPv6 address names are returned
in the form "a1:a2:...:a8", where a1-a8 are hexadecimal values
representing the eight 16-bit pieces of the address. OID names are
returned as

String

s represented as a series of nonnegative
integers separated by periods. And directory names (distinguished names)
are returned in
