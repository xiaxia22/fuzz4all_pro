### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public SSLSocketFactory()

Constructor is used only by subclasses.

---

### Method Details

#### public static
SocketFactory
getDefault()

Returns the default SSL socket factory.

The first time this method is called, the security property
"ssl.SocketFactory.provider" is examined. If it is non-null, a class by
that name is loaded and instantiated. If that is successful and the
object is an instance of SSLSocketFactory, it is made the default SSL
socket factory.

Otherwise, this method returns

SSLContext.getDefault().getSocketFactory()

. If that
call fails, an inoperative factory is returned.

**Returns:**
- the default

SocketFactory

**See Also:**
- SSLContext.getDefault()

---

#### public abstract
String
[] getDefaultCipherSuites()

Returns the list of cipher suites which are enabled by default.
Unless a different list is enabled, handshaking on an SSL connection
will use one of these cipher suites. The minimum quality of service
for these defaults requires confidentiality protection and server
authentication (that is, no anonymous cipher suites).

The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
cipher suite names in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation, and may also
include other cipher suites that the provider supports.

**Returns:**
- array of the cipher suites enabled by default

**See Also:**
- getSupportedCipherSuites()

---

#### public abstract
String
[] getSupportedCipherSuites()

Returns the names of the cipher suites which could be enabled for use
on an SSL connection. Normally, only a subset of these will actually
be enabled by default, since this list may include cipher suites which
do not meet quality of service requirements for those defaults. Such
cipher suites are useful in specialized applications.

The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
cipher suite names in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation, and may also
include other cipher suites that the provider supports.

**Returns:**
- an array of cipher suite names

**See Also:**
- getDefaultCipherSuites()

#### public abstract
Socket
createSocket​(
Socket
s,

String
host,
int port,
boolean autoClose)
throws
IOException

Returns a socket layered over an existing socket connected to the named
host, at the given port. This constructor can be used when tunneling SSL
through a proxy or when negotiating the use of SSL over an existing
socket. The host and port refer to the logical peer destination.
This socket is configured using the socket options established for
this factory.

**Parameters:**
- s

- the existing socket
- host

- the server host
- port

- the server port
- autoClose

- close the underlying socket when this socket is closed

**Returns:**
- a socket connected to the specified host and port

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when creating the socket
- NullPointerException

- if the parameter s is null

---

#### public
Socket
createSocket​(
Socket
s,

InputStream
consumed,
boolean autoClose)
throws
IOException

Creates a server mode

Socket

layered over an
existing connected socket, and is able to read data which has
already been consumed/removed from the

Socket

's
underlying

InputStream

.

This method can be used by a server application that needs to
observe the inbound data but still create valid SSL/TLS
connections: for example, inspection of Server Name Indication
(SNI) extensions (See section 3 of

TLS Extensions
(RFC6066)

). Data that has been already removed from the
underlying

InputStream

should be loaded into the

consumed

stream before this method is called, perhaps
using a

ByteArrayInputStream

. When this

Socket

begins handshaking, it will read all of the data in

consumed

until it reaches

EOF

, then all further
data is read from the underlying

InputStream

as
usual.

The returned socket is configured using the socket options
established for this factory, and is set to use server mode when
handshaking (see

SSLSocket.setUseClientMode(boolean)

).

**Parameters:**
- s

- the existing socket
- consumed

- the consumed inbound network data that has already been
removed from the existing

Socket

InputStream

. This parameter may be

null

if no data has been removed.
- autoClose

- close the underlying socket when this socket is closed.

**Returns:**
- the

Socket

compliant with the socket options
established for this factory

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when creating the socket
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation
- NullPointerException

- if

s

is

null

**Since:**
- 1.8
