# Class SAXParser

**Source:** `java.xml\javax\xml\parsers\SAXParser.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
SAXParser

extends
Object
```

Defines the API that wraps an

XMLReader

implementation class. In JAXP 1.0, this class wrapped the

Parser

interface, however this interface was
replaced by the

XMLReader

. For ease
of transition, this class continues to support the same name
and interface as well as supporting new methods.

An instance of this class can be obtained from the

SAXParserFactory.newSAXParser()

method.
Once an instance of this class is obtained, XML can be parsed from
a variety of input sources. These input sources are InputStreams,
Files, URLs, and SAX InputSources.

This static method creates a new factory instance based
on a system property setting or uses the platform default
if no property has been defined.

The system property that controls which Factory implementation
to create is named

"javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory"

.
This property names a class that is a concrete subclass of this
abstract class. If no property is defined, a platform default
will be used.

As the content is parsed by the underlying parser, methods of the
given

HandlerBase

or the

DefaultHandler

are called.

Implementors of this class which wrap an underlying implementation
can consider using the

ParserAdapter

class to initially adapt their SAX1 implementation to work under
this revised class.

**Since:** 1.4

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected SAXParser()

Protected constructor to prevent instantiation.
Use

SAXParserFactory.newSAXParser()

.

---

### Method Details

#### public void reset()

Reset this

SAXParser

to its original configuration.

SAXParser

is reset to the same state as when it was created with

SAXParserFactory.newSAXParser()

.

reset()

is designed to allow the reuse of existing

SAXParser

s
thus saving resources associated with the creation of new

SAXParser

s.

The reset

SAXParser

is not guaranteed to have the same

Schema

Object

, e.g.

Object.equals(Object obj)

. It is guaranteed to have a functionally equal

Schema

.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- When Implementations do not
override this method

**Since:**
- 1.5

setProperty

```java
public abstract void setProperty​(
String
name,

Object
value)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Sets the particular property in the underlying implementation of

XMLReader

.
A list of the core features and properties can be found at

http://sax.sourceforge.net/?selected=get-set

.

All implementations that implement JAXP 1.5 or newer are required to
support the

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD

and

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA

properties.

- Setting the

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD

property
restricts the access to external DTDs, external Entity References to
the protocols specified by the property. If access is denied during parsing
due to the restriction of this property,

SAXException

will be thrown by the parse methods defined by

SAXParser

.

Setting the

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA

property
restricts the access to external Schema set by the schemaLocation attribute to
the protocols specified by the property. If access is denied during parsing
due to the restriction of this property,

SAXException

will be thrown by the parse methods defined by the

SAXParser

.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the property to be set.
**Parameters:** value

- The value of the property to be set.
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- When the underlying XMLReader does
not recognize the property name.
**Throws:** SAXNotSupportedException

- When the underlying XMLReader
recognizes the property name but doesn't support the property.
