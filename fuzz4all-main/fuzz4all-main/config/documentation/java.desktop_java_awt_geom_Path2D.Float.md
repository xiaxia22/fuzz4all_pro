pi,
boolean connect)

Appends the geometry of the specified

PathIterator

object
to the path, possibly connecting the new geometry to the existing
path segments with a line segment.
If the

connect

parameter is

true

and the
path is not empty then any initial

moveTo

in the
geometry of the appended

Shape

is turned into a

lineTo

segment.
If the destination coordinates of such a connecting

lineTo

segment match the ending coordinates of a currently open
subpath then the segment is omitted as superfluous.
The winding rule of the specified

Shape

is ignored
and the appended geometry is governed by the winding
rule specified for this path.

**Specified by:**
- append

in class

Path2D

**Parameters:**
- pi

- the

PathIterator

whose geometry is appended to
this path

---

#### public final
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Specified by:**
- getBounds2D

in interface

Shape

**Returns:**
- an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

Shape

.

**See Also:**
- Shape.getBounds()

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public final
PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at)

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the

Shape

boundary and provides access to the geometry of the

Shape

outline. If an optional

AffineTransform

is specified, the coordinates returned in the iteration are
transformed accordingly.

Each call to this method returns a fresh

PathIterator

object that traverses the geometry of the

Shape

object
independently from any other

PathIterator

objects in use
at the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

Shape

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe,
which means that the

Path2D

class does not
guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this

Path2D

object do not affect any iterations of
that geometry that are already in process.

**Specified by:**
- getPathIterator

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- at

- an optional

AffineTransform

to be applied to the
coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or

null

if untransformed coordinates are desired

**Returns:**
- a new

PathIterator

object, which independently
traverses the geometry of the

Shape

.

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public final
Object
clone()

Creates a new object of the same class as this object.

**Specified by:**
- clone

in class

Path2D

**Returns:**
- a clone of this instance.

**Throws:**
- OutOfMemoryError

- if there is not enough memory.

**See Also:**
- Cloneable

**Since:**
- 1.6

```java
public final void append​(
PathIterator
pi,
boolean connect)
```

Appends the geometry of the specified

PathIterator

object
to the path, possibly connecting the new geometry to the existing
path segments with a line segment.
If the

connect

parameter is

true

and the
path is not empty then any initial

moveTo

geometry of the appended

Shape

is turned into a

lineTo

segment.
If the destination coordinates of such a connecting

lineTo

segment match the ending coordinates of a currently open
subpath then the segment is omitted as superfluous.
The winding rule of the specified

Shape

Path2D
**Parameters:** at

- the

AffineTransform

used to transform the area
**Since:** 1.6

- getBounds2D

```java
public final
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()
```

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Specified by:** getBounds2D

in interface

Shape
**Returns:** an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

Shape

.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** Shape.getBounds()

- getPathIterator

```java
public final
PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at)
```

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the

Shape

boundary and provides access to the geometry of the

Shape

outline. If an optional

AffineTransform

is specified, the coordinates returned in the iteration are
transformed accordingly.

Each call to this method returns a fresh

PathIterator

object that traverses the geometry of the

Shape

object
independently from any other

PathIterator

objects in use
at the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

Shape

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe,
which means that the

Path2D

class does not
guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this

Path2D

object do not affect any iterations of
that geometry that are already in process.

**Specified by:** getPathIterator

in interface

Shape
**Parameters:** at

- an optional

AffineTransform

to be applied to the
coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or

Appends the geometry of the specified

PathIterator

object
to the path, possibly connecting the new geometry to the existing
path segments with a line segment.
If the

connect

parameter is

true

and the
path is not empty then any initial

is turned into a

lineTo

segment.
If the destination coordinates of such a connecting

lineTo

segment match the ending coordinates of a currently open
subpath then the segment is omitted as superfluous.
The winding rule of the specified

Shape

is ignored
and the appended geometry is governed by the winding
rule specified for this path.

**Specified by:** append

getBounds2D

```java
public final
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()
```

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

getPathIterator

```java
public final

at)
```

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the

Shape

boundary and provides access to the geometry of the

Shape

outline. If an optional

AffineTransform

is specified, the coordinates returned in the iteration are
transformed accordingly.

Each call to this method returns a fresh

PathIterator

object that traverses the geometry of the

Shape

object
independently from any other

PathIterator

objects in use
at the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

Shape

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe,
which means that the

Path2D

guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this

Path2D

object do not affect any iterations of
that geometry that are already in process.

**Specified by:** getPathIterator

in interface
