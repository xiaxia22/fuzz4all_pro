# Class Locale

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Locale.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
Locale

extends
Object

implements
Cloneable
,
Serializable
```

A

Locale

object represents a specific geographical, political,
or cultural region. An operation that requires a

Locale

to perform
its task is called

locale-sensitive

and uses the

Locale

to tailor information for the user. For example, displaying a number
is a locale-sensitive operation— the number should be formatted
according to the customs and conventions of the user's native country,
region, or culture.

The

Locale

class implements IETF BCP 47 which is composed of

RFC 4647 "Matching of Language
Tags"

and

RFC 5646 "Tags
for Identifying Languages"

with support for the LDML (UTS#35, "Unicode
Locale Data Markup Language") BCP 47-compatible extensions for locale data
exchange.

A

Locale

object logically consists of the fields
described below.

**language:** ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or registered
language subtags up to 8 alpha letters (for future enhancements).
When a language has both an alpha-2 code and an alpha-3 code, the
alpha-2 code must be used. You can find a full list of valid
language codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for
"Type: language"). The language field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to lower case.
**language:** Well-formed language values have the form

[a-zA-Z]{2,8}

. Note that this is not the full
BCP47 language production, since it excludes extlang. They are
not needed since modern three-letter language codes replace
them.
**language:** Example: "en" (English), "ja" (Japanese), "kok" (Konkani)
**script:** ISO 15924 alpha-4 script code. You can find a full list of
valid script codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search
for "Type: script"). The script field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to title case (the first
letter is upper case and the rest of the letters are lower
case).
**script:** Well-formed script values have the form

[a-zA-Z]{4}
**script:** Example: "Latn" (Latin), "Cyrl" (Cyrillic)
**country (region):** ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or UN M.49 numeric-3 area code.
You can find a full list of valid country and region codes in the
IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: region"). The
country (region) field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to upper case.
**country (region):** Well-formed country/region values have
the form

[a-zA-Z]{2} | [0-9]{3}
**country (region):** Example: "US" (United States), "FR" (France), "029"
(Caribbean)
**variant:** Any arbitrary value used to indicate a variation of a

Locale

. Where there are two or more variant values
each indicating its own semantics, these values should be ordered
by importance, with most important first, separated by
underscore('_'). The variant field is case sensitive.
**variant:** Note: IETF BCP 47 places syntactic restrictions on variant
subtags. Also BCP 47 subtags are strictly used to indicate
additional variations that define a language or its dialects that
are not covered by any combinations of language, script and
region subtags. You can find a full list of valid variant codes
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: variant").

However, the variant field in

Locale

has
historically been used for any kind of variation, not just
language variations. For example, some supported variants
available in Java SE Runtime Environments indicate alternative
cultural behaviors such as calendar type or number script. In
BCP 47 this kind of information, which does not identify the
language, is supported by extension subtags or private use
subtags.
**variant:** Well-formed variant values have the form

SUBTAG
(('_'|'-') SUBTAG)*

where

SUBTAG =
[0-9][0-9a-zA-Z]{3} | [0-9a-zA-Z]{5,8}

. (Note: BCP 47 only
uses hyphen ('-') as a delimiter, this is more lenient).
**variant:** Example: "polyton" (Polytonic Greek), "POSIX"
**extensions:** A map from single character keys to string values, indicating
extensions apart from language identification. The extensions in

Locale

implement the semantics and syntax of BCP 47
extension subtags and private use subtags. The extensions are
case insensitive, but

Locale

canonicalizes all
extension keys and values to lower case. Note that extensions
cannot have empty values.
**extensions:** Well-formed keys are single characters from the set

[0-9a-zA-Z]

. Well-formed values have the form

SUBTAG ('-' SUBTAG)*

where for the key 'x'

SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

and for other keys

SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{2,8}

(that is, 'x' allows
single-character subtags).
**extensions:** Example: key="u"/value="ca-japanese" (Japanese Calendar),
key="x"/value="java-1-7"

Note:

Although BCP 47 requires field values to be registered
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry, the

Locale

class
does not provide any validation features. The

Builder

only checks if an individual field satisfies the syntactic
requirement (is well-formed), but does not validate the value
itself. See

Locale.Builder

for details.

Unicode locale/language extension

UTS#35, "Unicode Locale Data Markup Language" defines optional
attributes and keywords to override or refine the default behavior
associated with a locale. A keyword is represented by a pair of
key and type. For example, "nu-thai" indicates that Thai local
digits (value:"thai") should be used for formatting numbers
(key:"nu").

The keywords are mapped to a BCP 47 extension value using the
extension key 'u' (

UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION

). The above
example, "nu-thai", becomes the extension "u-nu-thai".

Thus, when a

Locale

object contains Unicode locale
attributes and keywords,

getExtension(UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)

will return a
String representing this information, for example, "nu-thai". The

Locale

class also provides

getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()

,

getUnicodeLocaleKeys()

, and

getUnicodeLocaleType(java.lang.String)

which allow you to access Unicode
locale attributes and key/type pairs directly. When represented as
a string, the Unicode Locale Extension lists attributes
alphabetically, followed by key/type sequences with keys listed
alphabetically (the order of subtags comprising a key's type is
fixed when the type is defined)

A well-formed locale key has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{2}

. A well-formed locale type has the
form

"" | [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8} ('-' [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8})*

(it
can be empty, or a series of subtags 3-8 alphanums in length). A
well-formed locale attribute has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8}

(it is a single subtag with the same
form as a locale type subtag).

The Unicode locale extension specifies optional behavior in
locale-sensitive services. Although the LDML specification defines
various keys and values, actual locale-sensitive service
implementations in a Java Runtime Environment might not support any
particular Unicode locale attributes or key/type pairs.

Creating a Locale

There are several different ways to create a

Locale

object.

Builder

Using

Locale.Builder

you can construct a

Locale

object
that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.

Constructors

The

Locale

class provides three constructors:

```java
Locale(String language)

Locale(String language, String country)

Locale(String language, String country, String variant)
```

These constructors allow you to create a

Locale

object
with language, country and variant, but you cannot specify
script or extensions.

Factory Methods

The method

forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

creates a

Locale

object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.

Locale Constants

The

Locale

class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to create

Locale

objects for commonly used
locales. For example, the following creates a

Locale

object
for the United States:

```java
Locale.US
```

Locale Matching

If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
locale matching documentation.

In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
tags,

RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags

defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.

Filtering

is used to get all matching locales, whereas

lookup

is to choose the best matching locale.
Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
in the following sections.

A user's preference is called a

Language Priority List

and is
expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
language ranges: basic and extended. See

Locale.LanguageRange

for details.

Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

### Constructor Details

#### public Locale​(
String
language,

String
country,

String
variant)

Construct a locale from language, country and variant.
This constructor normalizes the language value to lowercase and
the country value to uppercase.

Note:

- ISO 639 is not a stable standard; some of the language codes it defines
(specifically "iw", "ji", and "in") have changed. This constructor accepts both the
old codes ("iw", "ji", and "in") and the new codes ("he", "yi", and "id"), but all other
API on Locale will return only the OLD codes.

For backward compatibility reasons, this constructor does not make
any syntactic checks on the input.

The two cases ("ja", "JP", "JP") and ("th", "TH", "TH") are handled specially,
see

Special Cases

for more information.

**Parameters:**
- language

- An ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or a language subtag
up to 8 characters in length. See the

Locale

class description about
valid language values.
- country

- An ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or a UN M.49 numeric-3 area code.
See the

Locale

class description about valid country values.
- variant

- Any arbitrary value used to indicate a variation of a

Locale

.
See the

Locale

class description for the details.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- thrown if any argument is null.

---

#### public Locale​(
String
language,

String
country)

Construct a locale from language and country.
This constructor normalizes the language value to lowercase and
the country value to uppercase.

Note:

- ISO 639 is not a stable standard; some of the language codes it defines
(specifically "iw", "ji", and "in") have changed. This constructor accepts both the
old codes ("iw", "ji", and "in") and the new codes ("he", "yi", and "id"), but all other
API on Locale will return only the OLD codes.

For backward compatibility reasons, this constructor does not make
any syntactic checks on the input.

### Method Details

#### public static
Locale
getDefault()

Gets the current value of the default locale for this instance
of the Java Virtual Machine.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
methods if no locale is explicitly specified.
It can be changed using the

setDefault

method.

**Returns:**
- the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine

---

#### public static
Locale
getDefault​(
Locale.Category
category)

Gets the current value of the default locale for the specified Category
for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup based
on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive methods
if no locale is explicitly specified. It can be changed using the
setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale) method.

**Parameters:**
- category

- - the specified category to get the default locale

**Returns:**
- the default locale for the specified Category for this instance
of the Java Virtual Machine

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if category is null

**See Also:**
- setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale)

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public static void setDefault​(
Locale
newLocale)

Sets the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
This does not affect the host locale.

If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

PropertyPermission("user.language", "write")

permission before the default locale is changed.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
methods if no locale is explicitly specified.

Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas
of functionality, this method should only be used if the caller
is prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running
within the same Java Virtual Machine.

By setting the default locale with this method, all of the default
locales for each Category are also set to the specified default locale.

**Parameters:**
- newLocale

- the new default locale

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the operation.
- NullPointerException

- if

newLocale

is null

**See Also:**
- SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

PropertyPermission

of the Java Virtual Machine. This does not affect the host locale.

If there is a security manager, its checkPermission method is called
with a PropertyPermission("user.language", "write") permission before
the default locale is changed.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup based
on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive methods
if no locale is explicitly specified.

Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas of
functionality, this method should only be used if the caller is
prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running within the
same Java Virtual Machine.

**Parameters:**
- category

- - the specified category to set the default locale
- newLocale

- - the new default locale

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its
checkPermission method doesn't allow the operation.

#### public static
Locale
[] getAvailableLocales()

Returns an array of all installed locales.
The returned array represents the union of locales supported
by the Java runtime environment and by installed

LocaleServiceProvider

implementations. It must contain at least a

Locale

instance equal to

Locale.US

.

**Returns:**
- An array of installed locales.

---

#### public static
String
[] getISOCountries()

Returns a list of all 2-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166.
Can be used to create Locales.
This method is equivalent to

getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode type)

with

type

Locale.IsoCountryCode.PART1_ALPHA2

.

Note:

The

Locale

class also supports other codes for
country (region), such as 3-letter numeric UN M.49 area codes.
Therefore, the list returned by this method does not contain ALL valid
codes that can be used to create Locales.

Note that this method does not return obsolete 2-letter country codes.
ISO3166-3 codes which designate country codes for those obsolete codes,
can be retrieved from

getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode type)

with

type

Locale.IsoCountryCode.PART3

.

**Returns:**
- An array of ISO 3166 two-letter country codes.

---

#### public static
Set
<
String
> getISOCountries​(
Locale.IsoCountryCode
type)

Returns a

Set

of ISO3166 country codes for the specified type.

**Parameters:**
- type

-

Locale.IsoCountryCode

specified ISO code type.

**Returns:**
- a

Set

of ISO country codes for the specified type.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if type is null

**See Also:**
- Locale.IsoCountryCode

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public static
String
[] getISOLanguages()

Returns a list of all 2-letter language codes defined in ISO 639.
Can be used to create Locales.

Note:

- ISO 639 is not a stable standard— some languages' codes have changed.
The list this function returns includes both the new and the old codes for the
languages whose codes have changed.

The

Locale

class also supports language codes up to
8 characters in length. Therefore, the list returned by this method does
not contain ALL valid codes that can be used to create Locales.

**Returns:**
- An array of ISO 639 two-letter language codes.

---

#### public
String
getLanguage()

Returns the language code of this Locale.

Note:

ISO 639 is not a stable standard— some languages' codes have changed.
Locale's constructor recognizes both the new and the old codes for the languages
whose codes have changed, but this function always returns the old code. If you
want to check for a specific language whose code has changed, don't do

```java
if (locale.getLanguage().equals("he")) // BAD!
...
```

Instead, do

```java
if (locale.getLanguage().equals(new Locale("he").getLanguage()))
...
```

**Returns:**
- The language code, or the empty string if none is defined.

**See Also:**
- getDisplayLanguage()

---

#### public
String
getScript()

Returns the script for this locale, which should
either be the empty string or an ISO 15924 4-letter script
code. The first letter is uppercase and the rest are
lowercase, for example, 'Latn', 'Cyrl'.

**Returns:**
- The script code, or the empty string if none is defined.

**See Also:**
- getDisplayScript()

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public
String
getCountry()

Returns the country/region code for this locale, which should
either be the empty string, an uppercase ISO 3166 2-letter code,
or a UN M.49 3-digit code.

**Returns:**
- The country/region code, or the empty string if none is defined.

**See Also:**
- getDisplayCountry()

---

#### public
String
getVariant()

Returns the variant code for this locale.

**Returns:**
- The variant code, or the empty string if none is defined.

#### public final
String
toString()

Returns a string representation of this

Locale

object, consisting of language, country, variant, script,
and extensions as below:

language + "_" + country + "_" + (variant + "_#" | "#") + script + "_" + extensions

Language is always lower case, country is always upper case, script is always title
case, and extensions are always lower case. Extensions and private use subtags
will be in canonical order as explained in

toLanguageTag()

.

When the locale has neither script nor extensions, the result is the same as in
Java 6 and prior.

If both the language and country fields are missing, this function will return
the empty string, even if the variant, script, or extensions field is present (you
can't have a locale with just a variant, the variant must accompany a well-formed
language or country code).

If script or extensions are present and variant is missing, no underscore is
added before the "#".

This behavior is designed to support debugging and to be compatible with
previous uses of

toString

that expected language, country, and variant
fields only. To represent a Locale as a String for interchange purposes, use

toLanguageTag()

.

Examples:

- en
- de_DE
- _GB
- en_US_WIN
- de__POSIX
- zh_CN_#Hans
- zh_TW_#Hant_x-java
- th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- A string representation of the Locale, for debugging.

toLanguageTag()

---

#### public
String
toLanguageTag()

Returns a well-formed IETF BCP 47 language tag representing
this locale.

If this

Locale

has a language, country, or
variant that does not satisfy the IETF BCP 47 language tag
syntax requirements, this method handles these fields as
described below:

Language:

If language is empty, or not

well-formed

(for example "a" or
"e2"), it will be emitted as "und" (Undetermined).

Country:

If country is not

well-formed

(for example "12" or "USA"),
it will be omitted.

Variant:

If variant

is

well-formed

, each sub-segment
(delimited by '-' or '_') is emitted as a subtag. Otherwise:

- if all sub-segments match

[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

(for example "WIN" or "Oracle_JDK_Standard_Edition"), the first
ill-formed sub-segment and all following will be appended to
the private use subtag. The first appended subtag will be
"lvariant", followed by the sub-segments in order, separated by
hyphen. For example, "x-lvariant-WIN",
"Oracle-x-lvariant-JDK-Standard-Edition".

if any sub-segment does not match

[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

, the variant will be truncated
and the problematic sub-segment and all following sub-segments
will be omitted. If the remainder is non-empty, it will be
emitted as a private use subtag as above (even if the remainder
turns out to be well-formed). For example,
"Solaris_isjustthecoolestthing" is emitted as
"x-lvariant-Solaris", not as "solaris".

Special Conversions:

Java supports some old locale
representations, including deprecated ISO language codes,
for compatibility. This method performs the following
conversions:

- Deprecated ISO language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are
converted to "he", "yi", and "id", respectively.

A locale with language "no", country "NO", and variant
"NY", representing Norwegian Nynorsk (Norway), is converted
to a language tag "nn-NO".

Note:

Although the language tag created by this
method is well-formed (satisfies the syntax requirements
defined by the IETF BCP 47 specification), it is not
necessarily a valid BCP 47 language tag. For example,

```java
new Locale("xx", "YY").toLanguageTag();
```

will return "xx-YY", but the language subtag "xx" and the
region subtag "YY" are invalid because they are not registered
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.

**Returns:**
- a BCP47 language tag representing the locale

**See Also:**
- forLanguageTag(String)

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public static
Locale
forLanguageTag​(
String
languageTag)

Returns a locale for the specified IETF BCP 47 language tag string.

If the specified language tag contains any ill-formed subtags,
the first such subtag and all following subtags are ignored. Compare
to

Locale.Builder.setLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

which throws an exception
in this case.

The following

conversions

are performed:

- The language code "und" is mapped to language "".

The language codes "he", "yi", and "id" are mapped to "iw",
"ji", and "in" respectively. (This is the same canonicalization
that's done in Locale's constructors.)

The portion of a private use subtag prefixed by "lvariant",
if any, is removed and appended to the variant field in the
result locale (without case normalization). If it is then
empty, the private use subtag is discarded:

```java
Locale loc;
loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("en-US-x-lvariant-POSIX");
loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX"
loc.getExtension('x'); // returns null

loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("de-POSIX-x-URP-lvariant-Abc-Def");
loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX_Abc_Def"
loc.getExtension('x'); // returns "urp"
```

When the languageTag argument contains an extlang subtag,
the first such subtag is used as the language, and the primary
language subtag and other extlang subtags are ignored:

```java
Locale.forLanguageTag("ar-aao").getLanguage(); // returns "aao"
Locale.forLanguageTag("en-abc-def-us").toString(); // returns "abc_US"
```

Case is normalized except for variant tags, which are left
unchanged. Language is normalized to lower case, script to
title case, country to upper case, and extensions to lower
case.

If, after processing, the locale would exactly match either
ja_JP_JP or th_TH_TH with no extensions, the appropriate
extensions are added as though the constructor had been called:

```java
Locale.forLanguageTag("ja-JP-x-lvariant-JP").toLanguageTag();
// returns "ja-JP-u-ca-japanese-x-lvariant-JP"
Locale.forLanguageTag("th-TH-x-lvariant-TH").toLanguageTag();
// returns "th-TH-u-nu-thai-x-lvariant-TH"
```

This implements the 'Language-Tag' production of BCP47, and
so supports legacy (regular and irregular, referred to as
"Type: grandfathered" in BCP47) as well as
private use language tags. Stand alone private use tags are
represented as empty language and extension 'x-whatever',
and legacy tags are converted to their canonical replacements
where they exist.

Legacy tags with canonical replacements are as follows:

A

Locale

object represents a specific geographical, political,
or cultural region. An operation that requires a

Locale

to perform
its task is called

locale-sensitive

and uses the

Locale

to tailor information for the user. For example, displaying a number
is a locale-sensitive operation— the number should be formatted
according to the customs and conventions of the user's native country,
region, or culture.

The

Locale

class implements IETF BCP 47 which is composed of

RFC 4647 "Matching of Language
Tags"

and

RFC 5646 "Tags
for Identifying Languages"

with support for the LDML (UTS#35, "Unicode
Locale Data Markup Language") BCP 47-compatible extensions for locale data
exchange.

A

Locale

object logically consists of the fields
described below.

**language:** ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or registered
language subtags up to 8 alpha letters (for future enhancements).
When a language has both an alpha-2 code and an alpha-3 code, the
alpha-2 code must be used. You can find a full list of valid
language codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for
"Type: language"). The language field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to lower case.
**language:** Well-formed language values have the form

[a-zA-Z]{2,8}

. Note that this is not the full
BCP47 language production, since it excludes extlang. They are
not needed since modern three-letter language codes replace
them.
**language:** Example: "en" (English), "ja" (Japanese), "kok" (Konkani)
**script:** ISO 15924 alpha-4 script code. You can find a full list of
valid script codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search
for "Type: script"). The script field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to title case (the first
letter is upper case and the rest of the letters are lower
case).
**script:** Well-formed script values have the form

[a-zA-Z]{4}
**script:** Example: "Latn" (Latin), "Cyrl" (Cyrillic)
**country (region):** ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or UN M.49 numeric-3 area code.
You can find a full list of valid country and region codes in the
IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: region"). The
country (region) field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to upper case.
**country (region):** Well-formed country/region values have
the form

[a-zA-Z]{2} | [0-9]{3}
**country (region):** Example: "US" (United States), "FR" (France), "029"
(Caribbean)
**variant:** Any arbitrary value used to indicate a variation of a

Locale

. Where there are two or more variant values
each indicating its own semantics, these values should be ordered
by importance, with most important first, separated by
underscore('_'). The variant field is case sensitive.
**variant:** Note: IETF BCP 47 places syntactic restrictions on variant
subtags. Also BCP 47 subtags are strictly used to indicate
additional variations that define a language or its dialects that
are not covered by any combinations of language, script and
region subtags. You can find a full list of valid variant codes
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: variant").

However, the variant field in

Locale

has
historically been used for any kind of variation, not just
language variations. For example, some supported variants
available in Java SE Runtime Environments indicate alternative
cultural behaviors such as calendar type or number script. In
BCP 47 this kind of information, which does not identify the
language, is supported by extension subtags or private use
subtags.
**variant:** Well-formed variant values have the form

SUBTAG
(('_'|'-') SUBTAG)*

where

SUBTAG =
[0-9][0-9a-zA-Z]{3} | [0-9a-zA-Z]{5,8}

. (Note: BCP 47 only
uses hyphen ('-') as a delimiter, this is more lenient).
**variant:** Example: "polyton" (Polytonic Greek), "POSIX"
**extensions:** A map from single character keys to string values, indicating
extensions apart from language identification. The extensions in

Locale

implement the semantics and syntax of BCP 47
extension subtags and private use subtags. The extensions are
case insensitive, but

Locale

canonicalizes all
extension keys and values to lower case. Note that extensions
cannot have empty values.
**extensions:** Well-formed keys are single characters from the set

[0-9a-zA-Z]

. Well-formed values have the form

SUBTAG ('-' SUBTAG)*

where for the key 'x'

SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

and for other keys

SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{2,8}

(that is, 'x' allows
single-character subtags).
**extensions:** Example: key="u"/value="ca-japanese" (Japanese Calendar),
key="x"/value="java-1-7"

Note:

Although BCP 47 requires field values to be registered
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry, the

Locale

class
does not provide any validation features. The

Builder

only checks if an individual field satisfies the syntactic
requirement (is well-formed), but does not validate the value
itself. See

Locale.Builder

for details.

Unicode locale/language extension

UTS#35, "Unicode Locale Data Markup Language" defines optional
attributes and keywords to override or refine the default behavior
associated with a locale. A keyword is represented by a pair of
key and type. For example, "nu-thai" indicates that Thai local
digits (value:"thai") should be used for formatting numbers
(key:"nu").

The keywords are mapped to a BCP 47 extension value using the
extension key 'u' (

UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION

). The above
example, "nu-thai", becomes the extension "u-nu-thai".

Thus, when a

Locale

object contains Unicode locale
attributes and keywords,

getExtension(UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)

will return a
String representing this information, for example, "nu-thai". The

Locale

class also provides

getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()

,

getUnicodeLocaleKeys()

, and

getUnicodeLocaleType(java.lang.String)

which allow you to access Unicode
locale attributes and key/type pairs directly. When represented as
a string, the Unicode Locale Extension lists attributes
alphabetically, followed by key/type sequences with keys listed
alphabetically (the order of subtags comprising a key's type is
fixed when the type is defined)

A well-formed locale key has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{2}

. A well-formed locale type has the
form

"" | [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8} ('-' [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8})*

(it
can be empty, or a series of subtags 3-8 alphanums in length). A
well-formed locale attribute has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8}

(it is a single subtag with the same
form as a locale type subtag).

The Unicode locale extension specifies optional behavior in
locale-sensitive services. Although the LDML specification defines
various keys and values, actual locale-sensitive service
implementations in a Java Runtime Environment might not support any
particular Unicode locale attributes or key/type pairs.

Creating a Locale

There are several different ways to create a

Locale

object.

Builder

Using

Locale.Builder

you can construct a

Locale

object
that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.

Constructors

The

Locale

class provides three constructors:

```java
Locale(String language)

Locale(String language, String country)

Locale(String language, String country, String variant)
```

These constructors allow you to create a

Locale

object
with language, country and variant, but you cannot specify
script or extensions.

Factory Methods

The method

forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

creates a

Locale

object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.

Locale Constants

The

Locale

class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to create

Locale

objects for commonly used
locales. For example, the following creates a

Locale

object
for the United States:

```java
Locale.US
```

Locale Matching

If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
locale matching documentation.

In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
tags,

RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags

defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.

Filtering

is used to get all matching locales, whereas

lookup

is to choose the best matching locale.
Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
in the following sections.

A user's preference is called a

Language Priority List

and is
expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
language ranges: basic and extended. See

Locale.LanguageRange

for details.

Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

A

Locale

object represents a specific geographical, political,
or cultural region. An operation that requires a

Locale

to perform
its task is called

locale-sensitive

and uses the

Locale

to tailor information for the user. For example, displaying a number
is a locale-sensitive operation— the number should be formatted
according to the customs and conventions of the user's native country,
region, or culture.

The

Locale

class implements IETF BCP 47 which is composed of

RFC 4647 "Matching of Language
Tags"

and

RFC 5646 "Tags
for Identifying Languages"

with support for the LDML (UTS#35, "Unicode
Locale Data Markup Language") BCP 47-compatible extensions for locale data
exchange.

A

Locale

object logically consists of the fields
described below.

**language:** ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or registered
language subtags up to 8 alpha letters (for future enhancements).
When a language has both an alpha-2 code and an alpha-3 code, the
alpha-2 code must be used. You can find a full list of valid
language codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for
"Type: language"). The language field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to lower case.
**language:** Well-formed language values have the form

[a-zA-Z]{2,8}

. Note that this is not the full
BCP47 language production, since it excludes extlang. They are
not needed since modern three-letter language codes replace
them.
**language:** Example: "en" (English), "ja" (Japanese), "kok" (Konkani)
**script:** ISO 15924 alpha-4 script code. You can find a full list of
valid script codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search
for "Type: script"). The script field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to title case (the first
letter is upper case and the rest of the letters are lower
case).
**script:** Well-formed script values have the form

[a-zA-Z]{4}
**script:** Example: "Latn" (Latin), "Cyrl" (Cyrillic)
**country (region):** ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or UN M.49 numeric-3 area code.
You can find a full list of valid country and region codes in the
IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: region"). The
country (region) field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to upper case.
**country (region):** Well-formed country/region values have
the form

[a-zA-Z]{2} | [0-9]{3}
**country (region):** Example: "US" (United States), "FR" (France), "029"
(Caribbean)
**variant:** Any arbitrary value used to indicate a variation of a

Locale

. Where there are two or more variant values
each indicating its own semantics, these values should be ordered
by importance, with most important first, separated by
underscore('_'). The variant field is case sensitive.
**variant:** Note: IETF BCP 47 places syntactic restrictions on variant
subtags. Also BCP 47 subtags are strictly used to indicate
additional variations that define a language or its dialects that
are not covered by any combinations of language, script and
region subtags. You can find a full list of valid variant codes
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: variant").

However, the variant field in

Locale

has
historically been used for any kind of variation, not just
language variations. For example, some supported variants
available in Java SE Runtime Environments indicate alternative
cultural behaviors such as calendar type or number script. In
BCP 47 this kind of information, which does not identify the
language, is supported by extension subtags or private use
subtags.
**variant:** Well-formed variant values have the form

SUBTAG
(('_'|'-') SUBTAG)*

where

SUBTAG =
[0-9][0-9a-zA-Z]{3} | [0-9a-zA-Z]{5,8}

. (Note: BCP 47 only
uses hyphen ('-') as a delimiter, this is more lenient).
**variant:** Example: "polyton" (Polytonic Greek), "POSIX"
**extensions:** A map from single character keys to string values, indicating
extensions apart from language identification. The extensions in

Locale

implement the semantics and syntax of BCP 47
extension subtags and private use subtags. The extensions are
case insensitive, but

Locale

canonicalizes all
extension keys and values to lower case. Note that extensions
cannot have empty values.
**extensions:** Well-formed keys are single characters from the set

[0-9a-zA-Z]

. Well-formed values have the form

SUBTAG ('-' SUBTAG)*

where for the key 'x'

SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

and for other keys

SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{2,8}

(that is, 'x' allows
single-character subtags).
**extensions:** Example: key="u"/value="ca-japanese" (Japanese Calendar),
key="x"/value="java-1-7"

Note:

Although BCP 47 requires field values to be registered
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry, the

Locale

class
does not provide any validation features. The

Builder

only checks if an individual field satisfies the syntactic
requirement (is well-formed), but does not validate the value
itself. See

Locale.Builder

for details.

Unicode locale/language extension

UTS#35, "Unicode Locale Data Markup Language" defines optional
attributes and keywords to override or refine the default behavior
associated with a locale. A keyword is represented by a pair of
key and type. For example, "nu-thai" indicates that Thai local
digits (value:"thai") should be used for formatting numbers
(key:"nu").

The keywords are mapped to a BCP 47 extension value using the
extension key 'u' (

UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION

). The above
example, "nu-thai", becomes the extension "u-nu-thai".

Thus, when a

Locale

object contains Unicode locale
attributes and keywords,

getExtension(UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)

will return a
String representing this information, for example, "nu-thai". The

Locale

class also provides

getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()

,

getUnicodeLocaleKeys()

, and

getUnicodeLocaleType(java.lang.String)

which allow you to access Unicode
locale attributes and key/type pairs directly. When represented as
a string, the Unicode Locale Extension lists attributes
alphabetically, followed by key/type sequences with keys listed
alphabetically (the order of subtags comprising a key's type is
fixed when the type is defined)

A well-formed locale key has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{2}

. A well-formed locale type has the
form

"" | [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8} ('-' [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8})*

(it
can be empty, or a series of subtags 3-8 alphanums in length). A
well-formed locale attribute has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8}

(it is a single subtag with the same
form as a locale type subtag).

The Unicode locale extension specifies optional behavior in
locale-sensitive services. Although the LDML specification defines
various keys and values, actual locale-sensitive service
implementations in a Java Runtime Environment might not support any
particular Unicode locale attributes or key/type pairs.

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

toLanguageTag

cannot

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

The

Locale

class implements IETF BCP 47 which is composed of

RFC 4647 "Matching of Language
Tags"

and

RFC 5646 "Tags
for Identifying Languages"

with support for the LDML (UTS#35, "Unicode
Locale Data Markup Language") BCP 47-compatible extensions for locale data
exchange.

A

Locale

object logically consists of the fields
described below.

**language:** ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or registered
language subtags up to 8 alpha letters (for future enhancements).
When a language has both an alpha-2 code and an alpha-3 code, the
alpha-2 code must be used. You can find a full list of valid
language codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for
"Type: language"). The language field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to lower case.
**language:** Well-formed language values have the form

[a-zA-Z]{2,8}

. Note that this is not the full
BCP47 language production, since it excludes extlang. They are
not needed since modern three-letter language codes replace
them.
**language:** Example: "en" (English), "ja" (Japanese), "kok" (Konkani)
**script:** ISO 15924 alpha-4 script code. You can find a full list of
valid script codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search
for "Type: script"). The script field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to title case (the first
letter is upper case and the rest of the letters are lower
case).
**script:** Well-formed script values have the form

[a-zA-Z]{4}
**script:** Example: "Latn" (Latin), "Cyrl" (Cyrillic)
**country (region):** ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or UN M.49 numeric-3 area code.
You can find a full list of valid country and region codes in the
IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: region"). The
country (region) field is case insensitive, but

Locale

always canonicalizes to upper case.
**country (region):** Well-formed country/region values have
the form

[a-zA-Z]{2} | [0-9]{3}
**country (region):** Example: "US" (United States), "FR" (France), "029"
(Caribbean)
**variant:** Any arbitrary value used to indicate a variation of a

Locale

. Where there are two or more variant values
each indicating its own semantics, these values should be ordered
by importance, with most important first, separated by
underscore('_'). The variant field is case sensitive.
**variant:** Note: IETF BCP 47 places syntactic restrictions on variant
subtags. Also BCP 47 subtags are strictly used to indicate
additional variations that define a language or its dialects that
are not covered by any combinations of language, script and
region subtags. You can find a full list of valid variant codes
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: variant").

However, the variant field in

Locale

has
historically been used for any kind of variation, not just
language variations. For example, some supported variants
available in Java SE Runtime Environments indicate alternative
cultural behaviors such as calendar type or number script. In
BCP 47 this kind of information, which does not identify the
language, is supported by extension subtags or private use
subtags.
**variant:** Well-formed variant values have the form

SUBTAG
(('_'|'-') SUBTAG)*

where

SUBTAG =
[0-9][0-9a-zA-Z]{3} | [0-9a-zA-Z]{5,8}

. (Note: BCP 47 only
uses hyphen ('-') as a delimiter, this is more lenient).
**variant:** Example: "polyton" (Polytonic Greek), "POSIX"
**extensions:** A map from single character keys to string values, indicating
extensions apart from language identification. The extensions in

Locale

implement the semantics and syntax of BCP 47
extension subtags and private use subtags. The extensions are
case insensitive, but

Locale

canonicalizes all
extension keys and values to lower case. Note that extensions
cannot have empty values.
**extensions:** Well-formed keys are single characters from the set

[0-9a-zA-Z]

. Well-formed values have the form

SUBTAG ('-' SUBTAG)*

where for the key 'x'

SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

and for other keys

SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{2,8}

(that is, 'x' allows
single-character subtags).
**extensions:** Example: key="u"/value="ca-japanese" (Japanese Calendar),
key="x"/value="java-1-7"

Note:

Although BCP 47 requires field values to be registered
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry, the

Locale

class
does not provide any validation features. The

Builder

only checks if an individual field satisfies the syntactic
requirement (is well-formed), but does not validate the value
itself. See

Locale.Builder

for details.

Unicode locale/language extension

UTS#35, "Unicode Locale Data Markup Language" defines optional
attributes and keywords to override or refine the default behavior
associated with a locale. A keyword is represented by a pair of
key and type. For example, "nu-thai" indicates that Thai local
digits (value:"thai") should be used for formatting numbers
(key:"nu").

The keywords are mapped to a BCP 47 extension value using the
extension key 'u' (

UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION

). The above
example, "nu-thai", becomes the extension "u-nu-thai".

Thus, when a

Locale

object contains Unicode locale
attributes and keywords,

getExtension(UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)

will return a
String representing this information, for example, "nu-thai". The

Locale

class also provides

getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()

,

getUnicodeLocaleKeys()

, and

getUnicodeLocaleType(java.lang.String)

which allow you to access Unicode
locale attributes and key/type pairs directly. When represented as
a string, the Unicode Locale Extension lists attributes
alphabetically, followed by key/type sequences with keys listed
alphabetically (the order of subtags comprising a key's type is
fixed when the type is defined)

A well-formed locale key has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{2}

. A well-formed locale type has the
form

"" | [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8} ('-' [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8})*

(it
can be empty, or a series of subtags 3-8 alphanums in length). A
well-formed locale attribute has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8}

(it is a single subtag with the same
form as a locale type subtag).

The Unicode locale extension specifies optional behavior in
locale-sensitive services. Although the LDML specification defines
various keys and values, actual locale-sensitive service
implementations in a Java Runtime Environment might not support any
particular Unicode locale attributes or key/type pairs.

Creating a Locale

There are several different ways to create a

Locale

object.

Builder

Using

Locale.Builder

you can construct a

Locale

object
that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.

Constructors

The

Locale

class provides three constructors:

```java
Locale(String language)

Locale(String language, String country)

Locale(String language, String country, String variant)
```

These constructors allow you to create a

Locale

object
with language, country and variant, but you cannot specify
script or extensions.

Factory Methods

The method

forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

creates a

Locale

object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.

Locale Constants

The

Locale

class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to create

Locale

objects for commonly used
locales. For example, the following creates a

Locale

object
for the United States:

```java
Locale.US
```

Locale Matching

If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
locale matching documentation.

In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
tags,

RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags

defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.

Filtering

is used to get all matching locales, whereas

lookup

is to choose the best matching locale.
Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
in the following sections.

A user's preference is called a

Language Priority List

and is
expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
language ranges: basic and extended. See

Locale.LanguageRange

for details.

Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

the form

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

However, the variant field in

Locale

has
historically been used for any kind of variation, not just
language variations. For example, some supported variants
available in Java SE Runtime Environments indicate alternative
cultural behaviors such as calendar type or number script. In
BCP 47 this kind of information, which does not identify the
language, is supported by extension subtags or private use
subtags.

---

#### Unicode locale/language extension

UTS#35, "Unicode Locale Data Markup Language" defines optional
attributes and keywords to override or refine the default behavior
associated with a locale. A keyword is represented by a pair of
key and type. For example, "nu-thai" indicates that Thai local
digits (value:"thai") should be used for formatting numbers
(key:"nu").

The keywords are mapped to a BCP 47 extension value using the
extension key 'u' (

UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION

). The above
example, "nu-thai", becomes the extension "u-nu-thai".

Thus, when a

Locale

object contains Unicode locale
attributes and keywords,

getExtension(UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)

will return a
String representing this information, for example, "nu-thai". The

Locale

class also provides

getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()

,

getUnicodeLocaleKeys()

, and

getUnicodeLocaleType(java.lang.String)

which allow you to access Unicode
locale attributes and key/type pairs directly. When represented as
a string, the Unicode Locale Extension lists attributes
alphabetically, followed by key/type sequences with keys listed
alphabetically (the order of subtags comprising a key's type is
fixed when the type is defined)

A well-formed locale key has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{2}

. A well-formed locale type has the
form

"" | [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8} ('-' [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8})*

(it
can be empty, or a series of subtags 3-8 alphanums in length). A
well-formed locale attribute has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8}

(it is a single subtag with the same
form as a locale type subtag).

The Unicode locale extension specifies optional behavior in
locale-sensitive services. Although the LDML specification defines
various keys and values, actual locale-sensitive service
implementations in a Java Runtime Environment might not support any
particular Unicode locale attributes or key/type pairs.

Creating a Locale

There are several different ways to create a

Locale

object.

Builder

Using

Locale.Builder

you can construct a

Locale

object
that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.

Constructors

The

Locale

class provides three constructors:

```java
Locale(String language)

Locale(String language, String country)

Locale(String language, String country, String variant)
```

These constructors allow you to create a

Locale

object
with language, country and variant, but you cannot specify
script or extensions.

Factory Methods

The method

forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

creates a

Locale

object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.

Locale Constants

The

Locale

class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to create

Locale

objects for commonly used
locales. For example, the following creates a

Locale

object
for the United States:

```java
Locale.US
```

Locale Matching

If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
locale matching documentation.

In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
tags,

RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags

defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.

Filtering

is used to get all matching locales, whereas

lookup

is to choose the best matching locale.
Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
in the following sections.

A user's preference is called a

Language Priority List

and is
expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
language ranges: basic and extended. See

Locale.LanguageRange

for details.

Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or

country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For

constraint.

The keywords are mapped to a BCP 47 extension value using the
extension key 'u' (

UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION

). The above
example, "nu-thai", becomes the extension "u-nu-thai".

Thus, when a

Locale

object contains Unicode locale
attributes and keywords,

getExtension(UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)

will return a
String representing this information, for example, "nu-thai". The

Locale

class also provides

getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()

which allow you to access Unicode
locale attributes and key/type pairs directly. When represented as

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

A well-formed locale key has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{2}

. A well-formed locale type has the
form

"" | [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8} ('-' [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8})*

(it
can be empty, or a series of subtags 3-8 alphanums in length). A
well-formed locale attribute has the form

[0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8}

(it is a single subtag with the same
form as a locale type subtag).

The Unicode locale extension specifies optional behavior in
locale-sensitive services. Although the LDML specification defines
various keys and values, actual locale-sensitive service
implementations in a Java Runtime Environment might not support any
particular Unicode locale attributes or key/type pairs.

Creating a Locale

There are several different ways to create a

Locale

object.

Builder

Using

Locale.Builder

you can construct a

Locale

object
that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.

Constructors

The

Locale

class provides three constructors:

```java
Locale(String language)

Locale(String language, String country)

Locale(String language, String country, String variant)
```

These constructors allow you to create a

Locale

object
with language, country and variant, but you cannot specify
script or extensions.

Factory Methods

The method

forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

creates a

Locale

object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.

Locale Constants

The

Locale

class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to create

Locale

objects for commonly used
locales. For example, the following creates a

Locale

object
for the United States:

```java
Locale.US
```

Locale Matching

If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
locale matching documentation.

In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
tags,

RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags

defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.

Filtering

is used to get all matching locales, whereas

lookup

is to choose the best matching locale.
Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
in the following sections.

A user's preference is called a

Language Priority List

and is
expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
language ranges: basic and extended. See

Locale.LanguageRange

for details.

Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's

be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

#### Creating a Locale

There are several different ways to create a

Locale

object.

Builder

Using

Locale.Builder

you can construct a

Locale

object
that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.

Constructors

The

Locale

class provides three constructors:

```java
Locale(String language)

Locale(String language, String country)

Locale(String language, String country, String variant)
```

These constructors allow you to create a

Locale

object
with language, country and variant, but you cannot specify
script or extensions.

Factory Methods

The method

forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

creates a

Locale

object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.

Locale Constants

The

Locale

class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to create

Locale

objects for commonly used
locales. For example, the following creates a

Locale

object
for the United States:

```java
Locale.US
```

Locale Matching

If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
locale matching documentation.

In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
tags,

RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags

defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.

Filtering

is used to get all matching locales, whereas

lookup

is to choose the best matching locale.
Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
in the following sections.

A user's preference is called a

Language Priority List

and is
expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
language ranges: basic and extended. See

Locale.LanguageRange

for details.

Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

Using

Locale.Builder

you can construct a

Locale

object
that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.

Constructors

The

Locale

class provides three constructors:

```java
Locale(String language)

Locale(String language, String country)

Locale(String language, String country, String variant)
```

These constructors allow you to create a

Locale

object
with language, country and variant, but you cannot specify
script or extensions.

Factory Methods

The method

forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

creates a

Locale

object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.

Locale Constants

The

Locale

class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to create

Locale

objects for commonly used
locales. For example, the following creates a

Locale

object
for the United States:

```java
Locale.US
```

Locale Matching

If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
locale matching documentation.

In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
tags,

RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags

defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.

Filtering

is used to get all matching locales, whereas

lookup

is to choose the best matching locale.
Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
in the following sections.

A user's preference is called a

Language Priority List

and is
expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
language ranges: basic and extended. See

Locale.LanguageRange

for details.

Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

The

Locale

class provides three constructors:

```java
Locale(String language)

Locale(String language, String country)

Locale(String language, String country, String variant)
```

These constructors allow you to create a

Locale

object
with language, country and variant, but you cannot specify
script or extensions.

Factory Methods

The method

forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

creates a

Locale

object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.

Locale Constants

The

Locale

class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to create

Locale

objects for commonly used
locales. For example, the following creates a

Locale

object
for the United States:

```java
Locale.US
```

Locale Matching

If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
locale matching documentation.

In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
tags,

RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags

defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.

Filtering

is used to get all matching locales, whereas

lookup

is to choose the best matching locale.
Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
in the following sections.

A user's preference is called a

Language Priority List

and is
expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
language ranges: basic and extended. See

Locale.LanguageRange

for details.

Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

Locale(String language)

Locale(String language, String country)

Locale(String language, String country, String variant)

The method

forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

creates a

Locale

object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.

Locale Constants

The

Locale

class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to create

Locale

objects for commonly used
locales. For example, the following creates a

Locale

object
for the United States:

```java
Locale.US
```

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the

you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave

representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

The

Locale

class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to create

Locale

objects for commonly used
locales. For example, the following creates a

Locale

object
for the United States:

```java
Locale.US

for details.

Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

#### Locale Matching

If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
locale matching documentation.

In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
tags,

RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags

defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.

Filtering

is used to get all matching locales, whereas

lookup

is to choose the best matching locale.
Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
in the following sections.

A user's preference is called a

Language Priority List

and is
expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
language ranges: basic and extended. See

Locale.LanguageRange

for details.

Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.

Locale.FilteringMode

is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,

"zh-Hant-TW"

and

"en-US"

, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.

```java
1. zh-Hant-TW
2. zh-Hant
3. zh
4. en-US
5. en
```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

1. zh-Hant-TW

"*"

is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by

over a

of language tags is treated as

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

You can use

you can use

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag

'*'

included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an

Iterator

over a

Collection

of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

Use of Locale

Once you've created a

Locale

you can query it for information
about itself. Use

getCountry

to get the country (or region)
code and

getLanguage

to get the language code.
You can use

getDisplayCountry

to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use

getDisplayLanguage

to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the

getDisplayXXX

methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default

DISPLAY

locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the

NumberFormat

class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as

NumberFormat

have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the

NumberFormat

class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default

NumberFormat

object:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance()
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default

FORMAT

locale:

```java
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
```

A

Locale

is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(

NumberFormat

) that you would like to get. The locale is

just

a mechanism for identifying objects,

not

a container for the objects themselves.

Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the

toString

method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus

toLanguageTag

cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the

forLanguageTag

and

Locale.Builder

APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on

toLanguageTag

for this purpose.

Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are

ja_JP_JP

and

th_TH_TH

. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave

to represent Thai as used in

a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output

for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms:

he

maps to

iw

,

yi

maps to

ji

, and

id

maps to

in

. This continues to be the case, in order to not break
backwards compatibility.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that

getLanguage

and

toString

reflect the old
code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that

toLanguageTag

reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

Java has used

ja_JP_JP

to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key

ca

(for "calendar") and type

japanese

. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used

th_TH_TH

to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key

nu

(for "number") and value

thai

. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in

Special Cases

, only
for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- Locale

```java
public Locale​(
String
language,

String
country,

String
variant)
```

Construct a locale from language, country and variant.
This constructor normalizes the language value to lowercase and
the country value to uppercase.

Note:

- ISO 639 is not a stable standard; some of the language codes it defines
(specifically "iw", "ji", and "in") have changed. This constructor accepts both the
old codes ("iw", "ji", and "in") and the new codes ("he", "yi", and "id"), but all other
API on Locale will return only the OLD codes.

For backward compatibility reasons, this constructor does not make
any syntactic checks on the input.

The two cases ("ja", "JP", "JP") and ("th", "TH", "TH") are handled specially,
see

Special Cases

for more information.

**Parameters:** language

- An ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or a language subtag
up to 8 characters in length. See the

Locale

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getDefault

```java
public static
Locale
getDefault()
```

Gets the current value of the default locale for this instance
of the Java Virtual Machine.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
methods if no locale is explicitly specified.
It can be changed using the

setDefault

method.

**Returns:** the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine

- getDefault

```java
public static
Locale
getDefault​(
Locale.Category
category)
```

Gets the current value of the default locale for the specified Category
for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup based
on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive methods
if no locale is explicitly specified. It can be changed using the
setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale) method.

**Parameters:** category

- - the specified category to get the default locale
**Returns:** the default locale for the specified Category for this instance
of the Java Virtual Machine
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if category is null
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale)

- setDefault

```java
public static void setDefault​(
Locale
newLocale)
```

Sets the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
This does not affect the host locale.

If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

PropertyPermission("user.language", "write")

permission before the default locale is changed.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
methods if no locale is explicitly specified.

Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas
of functionality, this method should only be used if the caller
is prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running
within the same Java Virtual Machine.

By setting the default locale with this method, all of the default
locales for each Category are also set to the specified default locale.

**Parameters:** newLocale

- the new default locale
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the operation.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

newLocale

is null
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

PropertyPermission

- setDefault

```java
public static void setDefault​(
Locale.Category
category,

Locale
newLocale)
```

Sets the default locale for the specified Category for this instance
of the Java Virtual Machine. This does not affect the host locale.

If there is a security manager, its checkPermission method is called
with a PropertyPermission("user.language", "write") permission before
the default locale is changed.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup based
on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive methods
if no locale is explicitly specified.

Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas of
functionality, this method should only be used if the caller is
prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running within the
same Java Virtual Machine.

**Parameters:** category

- - the specified category to set the default locale
**Parameters:** newLocale

- - the new default locale
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its
checkPermission method doesn't allow the operation.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if category and/or newLocale is null
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

getDefault(Locale.Category)

- getAvailableLocales

```java
public static
Locale
[] getAvailableLocales()
```

Returns an array of all installed locales.
The returned array represents the union of locales supported
by the Java runtime environment and by installed

LocaleServiceProvider

implementations. It must contain at least a

Locale

instance equal to

Locale.US

.

**Returns:** An array of installed locales.

- getISOCountries

```java
public static
String
[] getISOCountries()
```

Returns a list of all 2-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166.
Can be used to create Locales.
This method is equivalent to

getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode type)

with

type

Locale.IsoCountryCode.PART1_ALPHA2

.

Note:

The

Locale

class also supports other codes for
country (region), such as 3-letter numeric UN M.49 area codes.
Therefore, the list returned by this method does not contain ALL valid
codes that can be used to create Locales.

Note that this method does not return obsolete 2-letter country codes.
ISO3166-3 codes which designate country codes for those obsolete codes,
can be retrieved from

getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode type)

with

type

Locale.IsoCountryCode.PART3

.

**Returns:** An array of ISO 3166 two-letter country codes.

- getISOCountries

```java
public static
Set
<
String
> getISOCountries​(
Locale.IsoCountryCode
type)
```

Returns a

Set

of ISO3166 country codes for the specified type.

**Parameters:** type

-

Locale.IsoCountryCode

specified ISO code type.
**Returns:** a

Set

of ISO country codes for the specified type.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if type is null
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** Locale.IsoCountryCode

- getISOLanguages

```java
public static
String
[] getISOLanguages()
```

Returns a list of all 2-letter language codes defined in ISO 639.
Can be used to create Locales.

Note:

- ISO 639 is not a stable standard— some languages' codes have changed.
The list this function returns includes both the new and the old codes for the
languages whose codes have changed.

The

Locale

class also supports language codes up to
8 characters in length. Therefore, the list returned by this method does
not contain ALL valid codes that can be used to create Locales.

**Returns:** An array of ISO 639 two-letter language codes.

- getLanguage

```java
public
String
getLanguage()
```

Returns the language code of this Locale.

Note:

ISO 639 is not a stable standard— some languages' codes have changed.
Locale's constructor recognizes both the new and the old codes for the languages
whose codes have changed, but this function always returns the old code. If you
want to check for a specific language whose code has changed, don't do

```java
if (locale.getLanguage().equals("he")) // BAD!
...
```

Instead, do

```java
if (locale.getLanguage().equals(new Locale("he").getLanguage()))
...
```

**Returns:** The language code, or the empty string if none is defined.
**See Also:** getDisplayLanguage()

- getScript

```java
public
String
getScript()
```

Returns the script for this locale, which should
either be the empty string or an ISO 15924 4-letter script
code. The first letter is uppercase and the rest are
lowercase, for example, 'Latn', 'Cyrl'.

**Returns:** The script code, or the empty string if none is defined.
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** getDisplayScript()

- getCountry

```java
public
String
getCountry()
```

Returns the country/region code for this locale, which should
either be the empty string, an uppercase ISO 3166 2-letter code,
or a UN M.49 3-digit code.

**Returns:** The country/region code, or the empty string if none is defined.
**See Also:** getDisplayCountry()

- getVariant

```java
public
String
getVariant()
```

Returns the variant code for this locale.

**Returns:** The variant code, or the empty string if none is defined.
**See Also:** getDisplayVariant()

- hasExtensions

```java
public boolean hasExtensions()
```

Returns

true

if this

Locale

has any

extensions

.

**Returns:** true

if this

Locale

has any extensions
**Since:** 1.8

- stripExtensions

```java
public
Locale
stripExtensions()
```

Returns a copy of this

Locale

with no

extensions

. If this

Locale

has no extensions, this

Locale

is returned.

**Returns:** a copy of this

Locale

with no extensions, or

this

if

this

has no extensions
**Since:** 1.8

- getExtension

```java
public
String
getExtension​(char key)
```

Returns the extension (or private use) value associated with
the specified key, or null if there is no extension
associated with the key. To be well-formed, the key must be one
of

[0-9A-Za-z]

. Keys are case-insensitive, so
for example 'z' and 'Z' represent the same extension.

**Parameters:** key

- the extension key
**Returns:** The extension, or null if this locale defines no
extension for the specified key.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if key is not well-formed
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** PRIVATE_USE_EXTENSION

,

UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION

- getExtensionKeys

```java
public
Set
<
Character
> getExtensionKeys()
```

Returns the set of extension keys associated with this locale, or the
empty set if it has no extensions. The returned set is unmodifiable.
The keys will all be lower-case.

**Returns:** The set of extension keys, or the empty set if this locale has
no extensions.
**Since:** 1.7

- getUnicodeLocaleAttributes

```java
public
Set
<
String
> getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()
```

Returns the set of unicode locale attributes associated with
this locale, or the empty set if it has no attributes. The
returned set is unmodifiable.

**Returns:** The set of attributes.
**Since:** 1.7

- getUnicodeLocaleType

```java
public
String
getUnicodeLocaleType​(
String
key)
```

Returns the Unicode locale type associated with the specified Unicode locale key
for this locale. Returns the empty string for keys that are defined with no type.
Returns null if the key is not defined. Keys are case-insensitive. The key must
be two alphanumeric characters ([0-9a-zA-Z]), or an IllegalArgumentException is
thrown.

**Parameters:** key

- the Unicode locale key
**Returns:** The Unicode locale type associated with the key, or null if the
locale does not define the key.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the key is not well-formed
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

key

is null
**Since:** 1.7

- getUnicodeLocaleKeys

```java
public
Set
<
String
> getUnicodeLocaleKeys()
```

Returns the set of Unicode locale keys defined by this locale, or the empty set if
this locale has none. The returned set is immutable. Keys are all lower case.

**Returns:** The set of Unicode locale keys, or the empty set if this locale has
no Unicode locale keywords.
**Since:** 1.7

- toString

```java
public final
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

Locale

object, consisting of language, country, variant, script,
and extensions as below:

language + "_" + country + "_" + (variant + "_#" | "#") + script + "_" + extensions

Language is always lower case, country is always upper case, script is always title
case, and extensions are always lower case. Extensions and private use subtags
will be in canonical order as explained in

toLanguageTag()

.

When the locale has neither script nor extensions, the result is the same as in
Java 6 and prior.

If both the language and country fields are missing, this function will return
the empty string, even if the variant, script, or extensions field is present (you
can't have a locale with just a variant, the variant must accompany a well-formed
language or country code).

If script or extensions are present and variant is missing, no underscore is
added before the "#".

This behavior is designed to support debugging and to be compatible with
previous uses of

toString

that expected language, country, and variant
fields only. To represent a Locale as a String for interchange purposes, use

toLanguageTag()

.

Examples:

- en
- de_DE
- _GB
- en_US_WIN
- de__POSIX
- zh_CN_#Hans
- zh_TW_#Hant_x-java
- th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** A string representation of the Locale, for debugging.
**See Also:** getDisplayName()

,

toLanguageTag()

- toLanguageTag

```java
public
String
toLanguageTag()
```

Returns a well-formed IETF BCP 47 language tag representing
this locale.

If this

Locale

has a language, country, or
variant that does not satisfy the IETF BCP 47 language tag
syntax requirements, this method handles these fields as
described below:

Language:

If language is empty, or not

well-formed

(for example "a" or
"e2"), it will be emitted as "und" (Undetermined).

Country:

If country is not

well-formed

(for example "12" or "USA"),
it will be omitted.

Variant:

If variant

is

well-formed

, each sub-segment
(delimited by '-' or '_') is emitted as a subtag. Otherwise:

- if all sub-segments match

[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

(for example "WIN" or "Oracle_JDK_Standard_Edition"), the first
ill-formed sub-segment and all following will be appended to
the private use subtag. The first appended subtag will be
"lvariant", followed by the sub-segments in order, separated by
hyphen. For example, "x-lvariant-WIN",
"Oracle-x-lvariant-JDK-Standard-Edition".

if any sub-segment does not match

[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

, the variant will be truncated
and the problematic sub-segment and all following sub-segments
will be omitted. If the remainder is non-empty, it will be
emitted as a private use subtag as above (even if the remainder
turns out to be well-formed). For example,
"Solaris_isjustthecoolestthing" is emitted as
"x-lvariant-Solaris", not as "solaris".

Special Conversions:

Java supports some old locale
representations, including deprecated ISO language codes,
for compatibility. This method performs the following
conversions:

- Deprecated ISO language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are
converted to "he", "yi", and "id", respectively.

A locale with language "no", country "NO", and variant
"NY", representing Norwegian Nynorsk (Norway), is converted
to a language tag "nn-NO".

Note:

Although the language tag created by this
method is well-formed (satisfies the syntax requirements
defined by the IETF BCP 47 specification), it is not
necessarily a valid BCP 47 language tag. For example,

```java
new Locale("xx", "YY").toLanguageTag();
```

will return "xx-YY", but the language subtag "xx" and the
region subtag "YY" are invalid because they are not registered
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.

**Returns:** a BCP47 language tag representing the locale
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** forLanguageTag(String)

- forLanguageTag

```java
public static
Locale
forLanguageTag​(
String
languageTag)
```

Returns a locale for the specified IETF BCP 47 language tag string.

If the specified language tag contains any ill-formed subtags,
the first such subtag and all following subtags are ignored. Compare
to

Locale.Builder.setLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

which throws an exception
in this case.

The following

conversions

are performed:

- The language code "und" is mapped to language "".

The language codes "he", "yi", and "id" are mapped to "iw",
"ji", and "in" respectively. (This is the same canonicalization
that's done in Locale's constructors.)

The portion of a private use subtag prefixed by "lvariant",
if any, is removed and appended to the variant field in the
result locale (without case normalization). If it is then
empty, the private use subtag is discarded:

```java
Locale loc;
loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("en-US-x-lvariant-POSIX");
loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX"
loc.getExtension('x'); // returns null

loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("de-POSIX-x-URP-lvariant-Abc-Def");
loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX_Abc_Def"
loc.getExtension('x'); // returns "urp"
```

When the languageTag argument contains an extlang subtag,
the first such subtag is used as the language, and the primary
language subtag and other extlang subtags are ignored:

```java
Locale.forLanguageTag("ar-aao").getLanguage(); // returns "aao"
Locale.forLanguageTag("en-abc-def-us").toString(); // returns "abc_US"
```

Case is normalized except for variant tags, which are left
unchanged. Language is normalized to lower case, script to
title case, country to upper case, and extensions to lower
case.

If, after processing, the locale would exactly match either
ja_JP_JP or th_TH_TH with no extensions, the appropriate
extensions are added as though the constructor had been called:

```java
Locale.forLanguageTag("ja-JP-x-lvariant-JP").toLanguageTag();
// returns "ja-JP-u-ca-japanese-x-lvariant-JP"
Locale.forLanguageTag("th-TH-x-lvariant-TH").toLanguageTag();
// returns "th-TH-u-nu-thai-x-lvariant-TH"
```

This implements the 'Language-Tag' production of BCP47, and
so supports legacy (regular and irregular, referred to as
"Type: grandfathered" in BCP47) as well as
private use language tags. Stand alone private use tags are
represented as empty language and extension 'x-whatever',
and legacy tags are converted to their canonical replacements
where they exist.

Legacy tags with canonical replacements are as follows:

Locale.Builder.setLanguageTag(String)

- getISO3Language

```java
public
String
getISO3Language()
throws
MissingResourceException
```

Returns a three-letter abbreviation of this locale's language.
If the language matches an ISO 639-1 two-letter code, the
corresponding ISO 639-2/T three-letter lowercase code is
returned. The ISO 639-2 language codes can be found on-line,
see "Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages Part 2:
Alpha-3 Code". If the locale specifies a three-letter
language, the language is returned as is. If the locale does
not specify a language the empty string is returned.

**Returns:** A three-letter abbreviation of this locale's language.
**Throws:** MissingResourceException

- Throws MissingResourceException if
three-letter language abbreviation is not available for this locale.

- getISO3Country

```java
public
String
getISO3Country()
throws
MissingResourceException
```

Returns a three-letter abbreviation for this locale's country.
If the country matches an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, the
corresponding ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 uppercase code is returned.
If the locale doesn't specify a country, this will be the empty
string.

The ISO 3166-1 codes can be found on-line.

**Returns:** A three-letter abbreviation of this locale's country.
**Throws:** MissingResourceException

- Throws MissingResourceException if the
three-letter country abbreviation is not available for this locale.

- getDisplayLanguage

```java
public final
String
getDisplayLanguage()
```

Returns a name for the locale's language that is appropriate for display to the
user.
If possible, the name returned will be localized for the default

locale.
For example, if the locale is fr_FR and the default

DISPLAY

locale
is en_US, getDisplayLanguage() will return "French"; if the locale is en_US and
the default

DISPLAY

locale is fr_FR,
getDisplayLanguage() will return "anglais".
If the name returned cannot be localized for the default

DISPLAY

locale,
(say, we don't have a Japanese name for Croatian),
this function falls back on the English name, and uses the ISO code as a last-resort
value. If the locale doesn't specify a language, this function returns the empty string.

**Returns:** The name of the display language.

- getDisplayLanguage

```java
public
String
getDisplayLanguage​(
Locale
inLocale)
```

inLocale is fr_FR, getDisplayLanguage() will return "anglais".
If the name returned cannot be localized according to inLocale,
(say, we don't have a Japanese name for Croatian),
this function falls back on the English name, and finally
on the ISO code as a last-resort value. If the locale doesn't specify a language,

Constructor Detail

- Locale

```java
public Locale​(
String
language,

String
country,

String
variant)
```

Construct a locale from language, country and variant.
This constructor normalizes the language value to lowercase and
the country value to uppercase.

Note:

- ISO 639 is not a stable standard; some of the language codes it defines
(specifically "iw", "ji", and "in") have changed. This constructor accepts both the
old codes ("iw", "ji", and "in") and the new codes ("he", "yi", and "id"), but all other
API on Locale will return only the OLD codes.

For backward compatibility reasons, this constructor does not make
any syntactic checks on the input.

The two cases ("ja", "JP", "JP") and ("th", "TH", "TH") are handled specially,
see

Special Cases

for more information.

**Parameters:** language

- An ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or a language subtag
up to 8 characters in length. See the

Locale

class description about
valid language values.
**Parameters:** country

- An ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or a UN M.49 numeric-3 area code.
See the

Locale

class description about valid country values.
**Parameters:** variant

- Any arbitrary value used to indicate a variation of a

Locale

.
See the

Locale

class description for the details.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- thrown if any argument is null.

Method Detail

- getDefault

```java
public static
Locale
getDefault()
```

Gets the current value of the default locale for this instance
of the Java Virtual Machine.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
methods if no locale is explicitly specified.
It can be changed using the

setDefault

method.

**Returns:** the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine

- getDefault

```java
public static
Locale
getDefault​(
Locale.Category
category)
```

Gets the current value of the default locale for the specified Category
for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup based
on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive methods
if no locale is explicitly specified. It can be changed using the
setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale) method.

**Parameters:** category

- - the specified category to get the default locale
**Returns:** the default locale for the specified Category for this instance
of the Java Virtual Machine
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if category is null
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale)

- setDefault

```java
public static void setDefault​(
Locale
newLocale)
```

Sets the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
This does not affect the host locale.

If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

PropertyPermission("user.language", "write")

permission before the default locale is changed.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
methods if no locale is explicitly specified.

Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas
of functionality, this method should only be used if the caller
is prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running
within the same Java Virtual Machine.

By setting the default locale with this method, all of the default
locales for each Category are also set to the specified default locale.

**Parameters:** newLocale

- the new default locale
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow the operation.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

newLocale

is null
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

PropertyPermission

- setDefault

```java
public static void setDefault​(
Locale.Category
category,

Locale
newLocale)
```

Sets the default locale for the specified Category for this instance
of the Java Virtual Machine. This does not affect the host locale.

If there is a security manager, its checkPermission method is called
with a PropertyPermission("user.language", "write") permission before
the default locale is changed.

The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup based
on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive methods
if no locale is explicitly specified.

Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas of
functionality, this method should only be used if the caller is
prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running within the

**Parameters:** category

- - the specified category to set the default locale
**Parameters:** newLocale

- - the new default locale
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its
checkPermission method doesn't allow the operation.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if category and/or newLocale is null
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

getDefault(Locale.Category)

- getAvailableLocales

```java
public static
Locale
[] getAvailableLocales()
```

Returns an array of all installed locales.
The returned array represents the union of locales supported
by the Java runtime environment and by installed

LocaleServiceProvider

implementations. It must contain at least a

Locale

instance equal to

Locale.US

.

**Returns:** An array of installed locales.

- getISOCountries

```java
public static
String
[] getISOCountries()
```

Returns a list of all 2-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166.
Can be used to create Locales.
This method is equivalent to

getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode type)

with

type

Locale.IsoCountryCode.PART1_ALPHA2

.

Note:

The

Locale

class also supports other codes for
country (region), such as 3-letter numeric UN M.49 area codes.
Therefore, the list returned by this method does not contain ALL valid
codes that can be used to create Locales.

Note that this method does not return obsolete 2-letter country codes.
ISO3166-3 codes which designate country codes for those obsolete codes,
can be retrieved from

getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode type)

with

type

Locale.IsoCountryCode.PART3

.

**Returns:** An array of ISO 3166 two-letter country codes.

- getISOCountries

```java
public static
Set
<
String
> getISOCountries​(
Locale.IsoCountryCode
type)
```

Returns a

Set

of ISO3166 country codes for the specified type.

**Parameters:** type

-

Locale.IsoCountryCode

specified ISO code type.
**Returns:** a

Set

of ISO country codes for the specified type.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if type is null
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** Locale.IsoCountryCode

- getISOLanguages

```java
public static
String
[] getISOLanguages()
```

Returns a list of all 2-letter language codes defined in ISO 639.
Can be used to create Locales.

Note:

- ISO 639 is not a stable standard— some languages' codes have changed.
The list this function returns includes both the new and the old codes for the
languages whose codes have changed.

The

Locale

class also supports language codes up to
8 characters in length. Therefore, the list returned by this method does
not contain ALL valid codes that can be used to create Locales.

**Returns:** An array of ISO 639 two-letter language codes.

- getLanguage

```java
public
String
getLanguage()
```

Returns the language code of this Locale.

Note:

ISO 639 is not a stable standard— some languages' codes have changed.
Locale's constructor recognizes both the new and the old codes for the languages
whose codes have changed, but this function always returns the old code. If you
want to check for a specific language whose code has changed, don't do

```java
if (locale.getLanguage().equals("he")) // BAD!
...
```

Instead, do

```java
if (locale.getLanguage().equals(new Locale("he").getLanguage()))
...
```

**Returns:** The language code, or the empty string if none is defined.
**See Also:** getDisplayLanguage()

- getScript

```java
public
String
getScript()
```

Returns the script for this locale, which should
either be the empty string or an ISO 15924 4-letter script
code. The first letter is uppercase and the rest are
lowercase, for example, 'Latn', 'Cyrl'.

**Returns:** The script code, or the empty string if none is defined.
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** getDisplayScript()

- getCountry

```java
public
String
getCountry()
```

Returns the country/region code for this locale, which should
either be the empty string, an uppercase ISO 3166 2-letter code,
or a UN M.49 3-digit code.

**Returns:** The country/region code, or the empty string if none is defined.
**See Also:** getDisplayCountry()

- getVariant

```java
public
String
getVariant()
```

Returns the variant code for this locale.

**Returns:** The variant code, or the empty string if none is defined.
**See Also:** getDisplayVariant()

- hasExtensions

```java
public boolean hasExtensions()
```

Returns

true

if this

Locale

has any

extensions

.

**Returns:** true

if this

Locale

has any extensions
**Since:** 1.8

- stripExtensions

```java
public
Locale
stripExtensions()
```

Returns a copy of this

Locale

with no

extensions

. If this

Locale

has no extensions, this

Locale

is returned.

**Returns:** a copy of this

Locale

with no extensions, or

this

if

this

has no extensions
**Since:** 1.8

- getExtension

```java
public
String
getExtension​(char key)
```

Returns the extension (or private use) value associated with
the specified key, or null if there is no extension
associated with the key. To be well-formed, the key must be one
of

[0-9A-Za-z]

. Keys are case-insensitive, so
for example 'z' and 'Z' represent the same extension.

**Parameters:** key

- the extension key
**Returns:** The extension, or null if this locale defines no
extension for the specified key.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if key is not well-formed
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** PRIVATE_USE_EXTENSION

,

UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION

- getExtensionKeys

```java
public
Set
<
Character
> getExtensionKeys()
```

Returns the set of extension keys associated with this locale, or the
empty set if it has no extensions. The returned set is unmodifiable.
The keys will all be lower-case.

**Returns:** The set of extension keys, or the empty set if this locale has
no extensions.
**Since:** 1.7

- getUnicodeLocaleAttributes

```java
public
Set
<
String
> getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()
```

Returns the set of unicode locale attributes associated with
this locale, or the empty set if it has no attributes. The
returned set is unmodifiable.

**Returns:** The set of attributes.
**Since:** 1.7

- getUnicodeLocaleType

```java
public
String
getUnicodeLocaleType​(
String
key)
```

Returns the Unicode locale type associated with the specified Unicode locale key
for this locale. Returns the empty string for keys that are defined with no type.
Returns null if the key is not defined. Keys are case-insensitive. The key must
be two alphanumeric characters ([0-9a-zA-Z]), or an IllegalArgumentException is
thrown.

**Parameters:** key

- the Unicode locale key
**Returns:** The Unicode locale type associated with the key, or null if the
locale does not define the key.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the key is not well-formed
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

key

is null
**Since:** 1.7

- getUnicodeLocaleKeys

```java
public
Set
<
String
> getUnicodeLocaleKeys()
```

Returns the set of Unicode locale keys defined by this locale, or the empty set if
this locale has none. The returned set is immutable. Keys are all lower case.

**Returns:** The set of Unicode locale keys, or the empty set if this locale has
no Unicode locale keywords.
**Since:** 1.7

- toString

```java
public final
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

Locale

object, consisting of language, country, variant, script,
and extensions as below:

language + "_" + country + "_" + (variant + "_#" | "#") + script + "_" + extensions

Language is always lower case, country is always upper case, script is always title
case, and extensions are always lower case. Extensions and private use subtags
will be in canonical order as explained in

toLanguageTag()

.

When the locale has neither script nor extensions, the result is the same as in
Java 6 and prior.

If both the language and country fields are missing, this function will return
the empty string, even if the variant, script, or extensions field is present (you
can't have a locale with just a variant, the variant must accompany a well-formed
language or country code).

If script or extensions are present and variant is missing, no underscore is
added before the "#".

This behavior is designed to support debugging and to be compatible with
previous uses of

toString

that expected language, country, and variant
fields only. To represent a Locale as a String for interchange purposes, use

toLanguageTag()

.

Examples:

- en
- de_DE
- _GB
- en_US_WIN
- de__POSIX
- zh_CN_#Hans
- zh_TW_#Hant_x-java
- th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** A string representation of the Locale, for debugging.
**See Also:** getDisplayName()

,

toLanguageTag()

- toLanguageTag

```java
public
String
toLanguageTag()
```

Returns a well-formed IETF BCP 47 language tag representing
this locale.

If this

Locale

has a language, country, or
variant that does not satisfy the IETF BCP 47 language tag
syntax requirements, this method handles these fields as
described below:

Language:

If language is empty, or not

well-formed

(for example "a" or
"e2"), it will be emitted as "und" (Undetermined).

Country:

If country is not

well-formed

(for example "12" or "USA"),
it will be omitted.

Variant:

If variant

is

well-formed

, each sub-segment
(delimited by '-' or '_') is emitted as a subtag. Otherwise:

- if all sub-segments match

[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

(for example "WIN" or "Oracle_JDK_Standard_Edition"), the first
ill-formed sub-segment and all following will be appended to
the private use subtag. The first appended subtag will be
"lvariant", followed by the sub-segments in order, separated by
hyphen. For example, "x-lvariant-WIN",
"Oracle-x-lvariant-JDK-Standard-Edition".

if any sub-segment does not match

[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

, the variant will be truncated
and the problematic sub-segment and all following sub-segments
will be omitted. If the remainder is non-empty, it will be
emitted as a private use subtag as above (even if the remainder
turns out to be well-formed). For example,
"Solaris_isjustthecoolestthing" is emitted as
"x-lvariant-Solaris", not as "solaris".

Special Conversions:

Java supports some old locale
representations, including deprecated ISO language codes,
for compatibility. This method performs the following
conversions:

- Deprecated ISO language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are
converted to "he", "yi", and "id", respectively.

A locale with language "no", country "NO", and variant
"NY", representing Norwegian Nynorsk (Norway), is converted
to a language tag "nn-NO".

Note:

Although the language tag created by this
method is well-formed (satisfies the syntax requirements
defined by the IETF BCP 47 specification), it is not
necessarily a valid BCP 47 language tag. For example,

```java
new Locale("xx", "YY").toLanguageTag();
```

will return "xx-YY", but the language subtag "xx" and the
region subtag "YY" are invalid because they are not registered
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.

**Returns:** a BCP47 language tag representing the locale
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** forLanguageTag(String)

- forLanguageTag

```java
public static
Locale
forLanguageTag​(
String
languageTag)
```

Returns a locale for the specified IETF BCP 47 language tag string.

If the specified language tag contains any ill-formed subtags,
the first such subtag and all following subtags are ignored. Compare
to

Locale.Builder.setLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

which throws an exception
in this case.

The following

conversions

are performed:

- The language code "und" is mapped to language "".

The language codes "he", "yi", and "id" are mapped to "iw",
"ji", and "in" respectively. (This is the same canonicalization
that's done in Locale's constructors.)

The portion of a private use subtag prefixed by "lvariant",
if any, is removed and appended to the variant field in the
result locale (without case normalization). If it is then
empty, the private use subtag is discarded:

```java
Locale loc;
loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("en-US-x-lvariant-POSIX");
loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX"
loc.getExtension('x'); // returns null

loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("de-POSIX-x-URP-lvariant-Abc-Def");
loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX_Abc_Def"
loc.getExtension('x'); // returns "urp"
```

When the languageTag argument contains an extlang subtag,
the first such subtag is used as the language, and the primary
language subtag and other extlang subtags are ignored:

```java
Locale.forLanguageTag("ar-aao").getLanguage(); // returns "aao"
Locale.forLanguageTag("en-abc-def-us").toString(); // returns "abc_US"
```

Case is normalized except for variant tags, which are left
unchanged. Language is normalized to lower case, script to
title case, country to upper case, and extensions to lower
case.

If, after processing, the locale would exactly match either
ja_JP_JP or th_TH_TH with no extensions, the appropriate
extensions are added as though the constructor had been called:

```java
Locale.forLanguageTag("ja-JP-x-lvariant-JP").toLanguageTag();
// returns "ja-JP-u-ca-japanese-x-lvariant-JP"
Locale.forLanguageTag("th-TH-x-lvariant-TH").toLanguageTag();
// returns "th-TH-u-nu-thai-x-lvariant-TH"
```

This implements the 'Language-Tag' production of BCP47, and
so supports legacy (regular and irregular, referred to as
"Type: grandfathered" in BCP47) as well as
private use language tags. Stand alone private use tags are
represented as empty language and extension 'x-whatever',
and legacy tags are converted to their canonical replacements
where they exist.

Legacy tags with canonical replacements are as follows:

If the language matches an ISO 639-1 two-letter code, the
corresponding ISO 639-2/T three-letter lowercase code is
returned. The ISO 639-2 language codes can be found on-line,
see "Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages Part 2:
Alpha-3 Code". If the locale specifies a three-letter
language, the language is returned as is. If the locale does

getLanguage()

Returns the language code of this Locale.

Note:

ISO 639 is not a stable standard— some languages' codes have changed.
Locale's constructor recognizes both the new and the old codes for the languages
whose codes have changed, but this function always returns the old code. If you
want to check for a specific language whose code has changed, don't do

```java
if (locale.getLanguage().equals("he")) // BAD!
...
```

Instead, do

```java
if (locale.getLanguage().equals(new Locale("he").getLanguage()))

toString

```java
public final
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

Locale

object, consisting of language, country, variant, script,
and extensions as below:

language + "_" + country + "_" + (variant + "_#" | "#") + script + "_" + extensions

Language is always lower case, country is always upper case, script is always title
case, and extensions are always lower case. Extensions and private use subtags
will be in canonical order as explained in

toLanguageTag()

.

When the locale has neither script nor extensions, the result is the same as in
Java 6 and prior.

If both the language and country fields are missing, this function will return
the empty string, even if the variant, script, or extensions field is present (you
can't have a locale with just a variant, the variant must accompany a well-formed
language or country code).

If script or extensions are present and variant is missing, no underscore is
added before the "#".

This behavior is designed to support debugging and to be compatible with
previous uses of

toString

that expected language, country, and variant
fields only. To represent a Locale as a String for interchange purposes, use

toLanguageTag()

.

Examples:

- en

toLanguageTag

```java
public
String
toLanguageTag()
```

Returns a well-formed IETF BCP 47 language tag representing
this locale.

If this

Locale

has a language, country, or
variant that does not satisfy the IETF BCP 47 language tag
syntax requirements, this method handles these fields as
described below:

Language:

If language is empty, or not

well-formed

(for example "a" or
"e2"), it will be emitted as "und" (Undetermined).

Country:

If country is not

well-formed

(for example "12" or "USA"),
it will be omitted.

Variant:

If variant

is

well-formed

, each sub-segment
(delimited by '-' or '_') is emitted as a subtag. Otherwise:

- if all sub-segments match

[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

(for example "WIN" or "Oracle_JDK_Standard_Edition"), the first
ill-formed sub-segment and all following will be appended to
the private use subtag. The first appended subtag will be
"lvariant", followed by the sub-segments in order, separated by
hyphen. For example, "x-lvariant-WIN",
"Oracle-x-lvariant-JDK-Standard-Edition".

if any sub-segment does not match

[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}

, the variant will be truncated
and the problematic sub-segment and all following sub-segments
will be omitted. If the remainder is non-empty, it will be
emitted as a private use subtag as above (even if the remainder
turns out to be well-formed). For example,
"Solaris_isjustthecoolestthing" is emitted as
"x-lvariant-Solaris", not as "solaris".

Special Conversions:

Java supports some old locale
representations, including deprecated ISO language codes,
for compatibility. This method performs the following
conversions:

- Deprecated ISO language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are
converted to "he", "yi", and "id", respectively.

A locale with language "no", country "NO", and variant
"NY", representing Norwegian Nynorsk (Norway), is converted
to a language tag "nn-NO".

Note:

Although the language tag created by this
method is well-formed (satisfies the syntax requirements
defined by the IETF BCP 47 specification), it is not
necessarily a valid BCP 47 language tag. For example,

```java
new Locale("xx", "YY").toLanguageTag();
```

will return "xx-YY", but the language subtag "xx" and the
region subtag "YY" are invalid because they are not registered
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.

Deprecated ISO language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are
converted to "he", "yi", and "id", respectively.

A locale with language "no", country "NO", and variant
"NY", representing Norwegian Nynorsk (Norway), is converted
to a language tag "nn-NO".

Note:

Although the language tag created by this
method is well-formed (satisfies the syntax requirements
defined by the IETF BCP 47 specification), it is not
necessarily a valid BCP 47 language tag. For example,

```java
new Locale("xx", "YY").toLanguageTag();
```

will return "xx-YY", but the language subtag "xx" and the
region subtag "YY" are invalid because they are not registered
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.

new Locale("xx", "YY").toLanguageTag();

forLanguageTag

```java
public static
Locale
forLanguageTag​(
String
languageTag)
```

Returns a locale for the specified IETF BCP 47 language tag string.

If the specified language tag contains any ill-formed subtags,
the first such subtag and all following subtags are ignored. Compare
to

Locale.Builder.setLanguageTag(java.lang.String)

which throws an exception
in this case.

The following

conversions

are performed:

- The language code "und" is mapped to language "".

The language codes "he", "yi", and "id" are mapped to "iw",
"ji", and "in" respectively. (This is the same canonicalization
that's done in Locale's constructors.)

The portion of a private use subtag prefixed by "lvariant",
if any, is removed and appended to the variant field in the
result locale (without case normalization). If it is then
empty, the private use subtag is discarded:

```java
Locale loc;
loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("en-US-x-lvariant-POSIX");
loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX"
loc.getExtension('x'); // returns null

loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("de-POSIX-x-URP-lvariant-Abc-Def");
loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX_Abc_Def"
loc.getExtension('x'); // returns "urp"
```

When the languageTag argument contains an extlang subtag,
the first such subtag is used as the language, and the primary
language subtag and other extlang subtags are ignored:

```java
Locale.forLanguageTag("ar-aao").getLanguage(); // returns "aao"
Locale.forLanguageTag("en-abc-def-us").toString(); // returns "abc_US"
```

Case is normalized except for variant tags, which are left
unchanged. Language is normalized to lower case, script to
title case, country to upper case, and extensions to lower
case.

If, after processing, the locale would exactly match either
ja_JP_JP or th_TH_TH with no extensions, the appropriate
extensions are added as though the constructor had been called:

```java
Locale.forLanguageTag("ja-JP-x-lvariant-JP").toLanguageTag();
// returns "ja-JP-u-ca-japanese-x-lvariant-JP"
Locale.forLanguageTag("th-TH-x-lvariant-TH").toLanguageTag();
// returns "th-TH-u-nu-thai-x-lvariant-TH"
```

This implements the 'Language-Tag' production of BCP47, and
so supports legacy (regular and irregular, referred to as
"Type: grandfathered" in BCP47) as well as
private use language tags. Stand alone private use tags are
represented as empty language and extension 'x-whatever',
and legacy tags are converted to their canonical replacements
where they exist.
