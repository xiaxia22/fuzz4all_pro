# Interface ChronoLocalDate

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\chrono\ChronoLocalDate.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ChronoLocalDate

extends
Temporal
,
TemporalAdjuster
,
Comparable
<
ChronoLocalDate
>
```

A date without time-of-day or time-zone in an arbitrary chronology, intended
for advanced globalization use cases.

Most applications should declare method signatures, fields and variables
as

LocalDate

, not this interface.

A

ChronoLocalDate

is the abstract representation of a date where the

Chronology chronology

, or calendar system, is pluggable.
The date is defined in terms of fields expressed by

TemporalField

,
where most common implementations are defined in

ChronoField

.
The chronology defines how the calendar system operates and the meaning of
the standard fields.

When to use this interface

The design of the API encourages the use of

LocalDate

rather than this
interface, even in the case where the application needs to deal with multiple
calendar systems.

This concept can seem surprising at first, as the natural way to globalize an
application might initially appear to be to abstract the calendar system.
However, as explored below, abstracting the calendar system is usually the wrong
approach, resulting in logic errors and hard to find bugs.
As such, it should be considered an application-wide architectural decision to choose
to use this interface as opposed to

LocalDate

.

Architectural issues to consider

These are some of the points that must be considered before using this interface
throughout an application.

1) Applications using this interface, as opposed to using just

LocalDate

,
face a significantly higher probability of bugs. This is because the calendar system
in use is not known at development time. A key cause of bugs is where the developer
applies assumptions from their day-to-day knowledge of the ISO calendar system
to code that is intended to deal with any arbitrary calendar system.
The section below outlines how those assumptions can cause problems
The primary mechanism for reducing this increased risk of bugs is a strong code review process.
This should also be considered a extra cost in maintenance for the lifetime of the code.

2) This interface does not enforce immutability of implementations.
While the implementation notes indicate that all implementations must be immutable
there is nothing in the code or type system to enforce this. Any method declared
to accept a

ChronoLocalDate

could therefore be passed a poorly or
maliciously written mutable implementation.

3) Applications using this interface must consider the impact of eras.

LocalDate

shields users from the concept of eras, by ensuring that

getYear()

returns the proleptic year. That decision ensures that developers can think of

LocalDate

instances as consisting of three fields - year, month-of-year and day-of-month.
By contrast, users of this interface must think of dates as consisting of four fields -
era, year-of-era, month-of-year and day-of-month. The extra era field is frequently
forgotten, yet it is of vital importance to dates in an arbitrary calendar system.
For example, in the Japanese calendar system, the era represents the reign of an Emperor.
Whenever one reign ends and another starts, the year-of-era is reset to one.

4) The only agreed international standard for passing a date between two systems
is the ISO-8601 standard which requires the ISO calendar system. Using this interface
throughout the application will inevitably lead to the requirement to pass the date
across a network or component boundary, requiring an application specific protocol or format.

5) Long term persistence, such as a database, will almost always only accept dates in the
ISO-8601 calendar system (or the related Julian-Gregorian). Passing around dates in other
calendar systems increases the complications of interacting with persistence.

6) Most of the time, passing a

ChronoLocalDate

throughout an application
is unnecessary, as discussed in the last section below.

False assumptions causing bugs in multi-calendar system code

As indicated above, there are many issues to consider when try to use and manipulate a
date in an arbitrary calendar system. These are some of the key issues.

Code that queries the day-of-month and assumes that the value will never be more than
31 is invalid. Some calendar systems have more than 31 days in some months.

Code that adds 12 months to a date and assumes that a year has been added is invalid.
Some calendar systems have a different number of months, such as 13 in the Coptic or Ethiopic.

Code that adds one month to a date and assumes that the month-of-year value will increase
by one or wrap to the next year is invalid. Some calendar systems have a variable number
of months in a year, such as the Hebrew.

Code that adds one month, then adds a second one month and assumes that the day-of-month
will remain close to its original value is invalid. Some calendar systems have a large difference
between the length of the longest month and the length of the shortest month.
For example, the Coptic or Ethiopic have 12 months of 30 days and 1 month of 5 days.

Code that adds seven days and assumes that a week has been added is invalid.
Some calendar systems have weeks of other than seven days, such as the French Revolutionary.

Code that assumes that because the year of

date1

is greater than the year of

date2

then

date1

is after

date2

is invalid. This is invalid for all calendar systems
when referring to the year-of-era, and especially untrue of the Japanese calendar system
where the year-of-era restarts with the reign of every new Emperor.

Code that treats month-of-year one and day-of-month one as the start of the year is invalid.
Not all calendar systems start the year when the month value is one.

In general, manipulating a date, and even querying a date, is wide open to bugs when the
calendar system is unknown at development time. This is why it is essential that code using
this interface is subjected to additional code reviews. It is also why an architectural
decision to avoid this interface type is usually the correct one.

Using LocalDate instead

The primary alternative to using this interface throughout your application is as follows.

- Declare all method signatures referring to dates in terms of

LocalDate

.

Either store the chronology (calendar system) in the user profile or lookup
the chronology from the user locale

Convert the ISO

LocalDate

to and from the user's preferred calendar system during
printing and parsing

This approach treats the problem of globalized calendar systems as a localization issue
and confines it to the UI layer. This approach is in keeping with other localization
issues in the java platform.

As discussed above, performing calculations on a date where the rules of the calendar system
are pluggable requires skill and is not recommended.
Fortunately, the need to perform calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system
is extremely rare. For example, it is highly unlikely that the business rules of a library
book rental scheme will allow rentals to be for one month, where meaning of the month
is dependent on the user's preferred calendar system.

A key use case for calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system is producing
a month-by-month calendar for display and user interaction. Again, this is a UI issue,
and use of this interface solely within a few methods of the UI layer may be justified.

In any other part of the system, where a date must be manipulated in a calendar system
other than ISO, the use case will generally specify the calendar system to use.
For example, an application may need to calculate the next Islamic or Hebrew holiday
which may require manipulating the date.
This kind of use case can be handled as follows:

- start from the ISO

LocalDate

being passed to the method

convert the date to the alternate calendar system, which for this use case is known
rather than arbitrary

perform the calculation

convert back to

LocalDate

Developers writing low-level frameworks or libraries should also avoid this interface.
Instead, one of the two general purpose access interfaces should be used.
Use

TemporalAccessor

if read-only access is required, or use

Temporal

if read-write access is required.

### Method Details

#### static
Comparator
<
ChronoLocalDate
> timeLineOrder()

Gets a comparator that compares

ChronoLocalDate

in
time-line order ignoring the chronology.

This comparator differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the position of the date on the local time-line.
The underlying comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-day.

**Returns:**
- a comparator that compares in time-line order ignoring the chronology

**See Also:**
- isAfter(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

,

isBefore(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

,

isEqual(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

---

#### static
ChronoLocalDate
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)

Obtains an instance of

ChronoLocalDate

from a temporal object.

This obtains a local date based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ChronoLocalDate

.

The conversion extracts and combines the chronology and the date
from the temporal object. The behavior is equivalent to using

Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)

with the extracted chronology.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ChronoLocalDate::from

.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null

**Returns:**
- the date, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

ChronoLocalDate

**See Also:**
- Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)

---

#### Chronology
getChronology()

Gets the chronology of this date.

The

Chronology

represents the calendar system in use.
The era and other fields in

ChronoField

are defined by the chronology.

**Returns:**
- the chronology, not null

---

#### default
Era
getEra()

Gets the era, as defined by the chronology.

The era is, conceptually, the largest division of the time-line.
Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time-line into two eras.
However, some have multiple eras, such as one for the reign of each leader.
The exact meaning is determined by the

Chronology

.

All correctly implemented

Era

classes are singletons, thus it
is valid code to write

date.getEra() == SomeChrono.ERA_NAME)

.

This default implementation uses

Chronology.eraOf(int)

.

**Returns:**
- the chronology specific era constant applicable at this date, not null

---

#### default boolean isLeapYear()

Checks if the year is a leap year, as defined by the calendar system.

A leap-year is a year of a longer length than normal.
The exact meaning is determined by the chronology with the constraint that
a leap-year must imply a year-length longer than a non leap-year.

This default implementation uses

Chronology.isLeapYear(long)

.

**Returns:**
- true if this date is in a leap year, false otherwise

---

#### int lengthOfMonth()

Returns the length of the month represented by this date, as defined by the calendar system.

This returns the length of the month in days.

**Returns:**
- the length of the month in days

---

#### default int lengthOfYear()

Returns the length of the year represented by this date, as defined by the calendar system.

This returns the length of the year in days.

The default implementation uses

isLeapYear()

and returns 365 or 366.

**Returns:**
- the length of the year in days

---

#### default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if the specified field can be queried on this date.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported fields is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoField

date fields.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:**
- isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if the field can be queried, false if not

---

#### default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to or subtracted from this date.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported units is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoUnit

date units except

FOREVER

.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:**
- isSupported

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- unit

- the unit to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDate
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDate
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to set in the result, not null
- newValue

- the new value of the field in the result

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDate
plus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:**
- plus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amount

- the amount to add, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the addition cannot be made
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDate
plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:**
- plus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amountToAdd

- the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
- unit

- the unit of the amount to add, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be added
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDate
minus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:**
- minus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amount

- the amount to subtract, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the subtraction cannot be made
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDate
minus​(long amountToSubtract,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period subtracted.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:**
- minus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amountToSubtract

- the amount of the specified unit to subtract, may be negative
- unit

- the unit of the amount to subtract, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified period subtracted, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be subtracted
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)

Queries this date using the specified query.

This queries this date using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:**
- query

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- query

- the query to invoke, not null

**Returns:**
- the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

**Type Parameters:**
- R

- the type of the result

---

#### default
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same date as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the date changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

passing

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

as the field.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalDate.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalDate);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null

**Returns:**
- the adjusted object, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Calculates the amount of time until another date in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

ChronoLocalDate

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

ChronoLocalDate

using

Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)

.
The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two dates.
For example, the amount in days between two dates can be calculated
using

startDate.until(endDate, DAYS)

.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

DAYS

,

WEEKS

,

MONTHS

,

YEARS

,

DECADES

,

CENTURIES

,

MILLENNIA

and

ERAS

should be supported by all implementations.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- until

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- endExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a

ChronoLocalDate

in the same chronology, not null
- unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null

**Returns:**
- the amount of time between this date and the end date

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to a

ChronoLocalDate
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### ChronoPeriod
until​(
ChronoLocalDate
endDateExclusive)

Calculates the period between this date and another date as a

ChronoPeriod

.

This calculates the period between two dates. All supplied chronologies
calculate the period using years, months and days, however the

ChronoPeriod

API allows the period to be represented using other units.

The start and end points are

this

and the specified date.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The negative sign will be the same in each of year, month and day.

The calculation is performed using the chronology of this date.
If necessary, the input date will be converted to match.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:**
- endDateExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which may be in any chronology, not null

**Returns:**
- the period between this date and the end date, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the period cannot be calculated
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)

Formats this date using the specified formatter.

This date will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

The default implementation must behave as follows:

```java
return formatter.format(this);
```

**Parameters:**
- formatter

- the formatter to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the formatted date string, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> atTime​(
LocalTime
localTime)

Combines this date with a time to create a

ChronoLocalDateTime

.

This returns a

ChronoLocalDateTime

formed from this date at the specified time.
All possible combinations of date and time are valid.

**Parameters:**
- localTime

- the local time to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the local date-time formed from this date and the specified time, not null

---

#### default long toEpochDay()

Converts this date to the Epoch Day.

The

Epoch Day count

is a simple
incrementing count of days where day 0 is 1970-01-01 (ISO).
This definition is the same for all chronologies, enabling conversion.

This default implementation queries the

EPOCH_DAY

field.

**Returns:**
- the Epoch Day equivalent to this date

---

#### default int compareTo​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)

Compares this date to another date, including the chronology.

The comparison is based first on the underlying time-line date, then
on the chronology.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2012-12-03 (ISO)
- 2012-12-04 (ISO)
- 2555-12-04 (ThaiBuddhist)
- 2012-12-05 (ISO)

Values #2 and #3 represent the same date on the time-line.
When two values represent the same date, the chronology ID is compared to distinguish them.
This step is needed to make the ordering "consistent with equals".

If all the date objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
additional chronology stage is not required and only the local date is used.
To compare the dates of two

TemporalAccessor

instances, including dates
in two different chronologies, use

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

as a comparator.

This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

ChronoLocalDate

>

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

---

#### default boolean isAfter​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)

Checks if this date is after the specified date ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.
This is equivalent to using

date1.toEpochDay() > date2.toEpochDay()

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this is after the specified date

---

#### default boolean isBefore​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)

Checks if this date is before the specified date ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.
This is equivalent to using

date1.toEpochDay() < date2.toEpochDay()

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this is before the specified date

---

#### default boolean isEqual​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)

Checks if this date is equal to the specified date ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.
This is equivalent to using

date1.toEpochDay() == date2.toEpochDay()

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if the underlying date is equal to the specified date

---

#### boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Checks if this date is equal to another date, including the chronology.

Compares this date with another ensuring that the date and chronology are the same.

To compare the dates of two

TemporalAccessor

instances, including dates
in two different chronologies, use

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

as a comparator.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if this is equal to the other date

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### int hashCode()

A hash code for this date.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a suitable hash code

**See Also:**

```

A date without time-of-day or time-zone in an arbitrary chronology, intended
for advanced globalization use cases.

Most applications should declare method signatures, fields and variables
as

LocalDate

, not this interface.

A

ChronoLocalDate

is the abstract representation of a date where the

Chronology chronology

, or calendar system, is pluggable.
The date is defined in terms of fields expressed by

TemporalField

,
where most common implementations are defined in

ChronoField

.
The chronology defines how the calendar system operates and the meaning of
the standard fields.

When to use this interface

The design of the API encourages the use of

LocalDate

rather than this
interface, even in the case where the application needs to deal with multiple
calendar systems.

This concept can seem surprising at first, as the natural way to globalize an
application might initially appear to be to abstract the calendar system.
However, as explored below, abstracting the calendar system is usually the wrong
approach, resulting in logic errors and hard to find bugs.
As such, it should be considered an application-wide architectural decision to choose
to use this interface as opposed to

LocalDate

.

Architectural issues to consider

These are some of the points that must be considered before using this interface
throughout an application.

1) Applications using this interface, as opposed to using just

LocalDate

,
face a significantly higher probability of bugs. This is because the calendar system
in use is not known at development time. A key cause of bugs is where the developer
applies assumptions from their day-to-day knowledge of the ISO calendar system
to code that is intended to deal with any arbitrary calendar system.
The section below outlines how those assumptions can cause problems
The primary mechanism for reducing this increased risk of bugs is a strong code review process.
This should also be considered a extra cost in maintenance for the lifetime of the code.

2) This interface does not enforce immutability of implementations.
While the implementation notes indicate that all implementations must be immutable
there is nothing in the code or type system to enforce this. Any method declared
to accept a

ChronoLocalDate

could therefore be passed a poorly or
maliciously written mutable implementation.

3) Applications using this interface must consider the impact of eras.

LocalDate

shields users from the concept of eras, by ensuring that

getYear()

returns the proleptic year. That decision ensures that developers can think of

LocalDate

instances as consisting of three fields - year, month-of-year and day-of-month.
By contrast, users of this interface must think of dates as consisting of four fields -
era, year-of-era, month-of-year and day-of-month. The extra era field is frequently
forgotten, yet it is of vital importance to dates in an arbitrary calendar system.
For example, in the Japanese calendar system, the era represents the reign of an Emperor.
Whenever one reign ends and another starts, the year-of-era is reset to one.

4) The only agreed international standard for passing a date between two systems
is the ISO-8601 standard which requires the ISO calendar system. Using this interface
throughout the application will inevitably lead to the requirement to pass the date
across a network or component boundary, requiring an application specific protocol or format.

5) Long term persistence, such as a database, will almost always only accept dates in the
ISO-8601 calendar system (or the related Julian-Gregorian). Passing around dates in other
calendar systems increases the complications of interacting with persistence.

6) Most of the time, passing a

ChronoLocalDate

throughout an application
is unnecessary, as discussed in the last section below.

False assumptions causing bugs in multi-calendar system code

As indicated above, there are many issues to consider when try to use and manipulate a
date in an arbitrary calendar system. These are some of the key issues.

Code that queries the day-of-month and assumes that the value will never be more than
31 is invalid. Some calendar systems have more than 31 days in some months.

Code that adds 12 months to a date and assumes that a year has been added is invalid.
Some calendar systems have a different number of months, such as 13 in the Coptic or Ethiopic.

Code that adds one month to a date and assumes that the month-of-year value will increase
by one or wrap to the next year is invalid. Some calendar systems have a variable number
of months in a year, such as the Hebrew.

Code that adds one month, then adds a second one month and assumes that the day-of-month
will remain close to its original value is invalid. Some calendar systems have a large difference
between the length of the longest month and the length of the shortest month.
For example, the Coptic or Ethiopic have 12 months of 30 days and 1 month of 5 days.

Code that adds seven days and assumes that a week has been added is invalid.
Some calendar systems have weeks of other than seven days, such as the French Revolutionary.

Code that assumes that because the year of

date1

is greater than the year of

date2

then

date1

is after

date2

is invalid. This is invalid for all calendar systems
when referring to the year-of-era, and especially untrue of the Japanese calendar system
where the year-of-era restarts with the reign of every new Emperor.

Code that treats month-of-year one and day-of-month one as the start of the year is invalid.
Not all calendar systems start the year when the month value is one.

In general, manipulating a date, and even querying a date, is wide open to bugs when the
calendar system is unknown at development time. This is why it is essential that code using
this interface is subjected to additional code reviews. It is also why an architectural
decision to avoid this interface type is usually the correct one.

Using LocalDate instead

The primary alternative to using this interface throughout your application is as follows.

- Declare all method signatures referring to dates in terms of

LocalDate

.

Either store the chronology (calendar system) in the user profile or lookup
the chronology from the user locale

Convert the ISO

LocalDate

to and from the user's preferred calendar system during
printing and parsing

This approach treats the problem of globalized calendar systems as a localization issue
and confines it to the UI layer. This approach is in keeping with other localization
issues in the java platform.

As discussed above, performing calculations on a date where the rules of the calendar system
are pluggable requires skill and is not recommended.
Fortunately, the need to perform calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system
is extremely rare. For example, it is highly unlikely that the business rules of a library
book rental scheme will allow rentals to be for one month, where meaning of the month
is dependent on the user's preferred calendar system.

A key use case for calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system is producing
a month-by-month calendar for display and user interaction. Again, this is a UI issue,
and use of this interface solely within a few methods of the UI layer may be justified.

In any other part of the system, where a date must be manipulated in a calendar system
other than ISO, the use case will generally specify the calendar system to use.
For example, an application may need to calculate the next Islamic or Hebrew holiday
which may require manipulating the date.
This kind of use case can be handled as follows:

- start from the ISO

LocalDate

being passed to the method

convert the date to the alternate calendar system, which for this use case is known
rather than arbitrary

perform the calculation

convert back to

LocalDate

Developers writing low-level frameworks or libraries should also avoid this interface.
Instead, one of the two general purpose access interfaces should be used.
Use

TemporalAccessor

if read-only access is required, or use

Temporal

if read-write access is required.

**Implementation Requirements:** This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.

Additional calendar systems may be added to the system.

returns the proleptic year. That decision ensures that developers can think of

LocalDate

instances as consisting of three fields - year, month-of-year and day-of-month.
By contrast, users of this interface must think of dates as consisting of four fields -
era, year-of-era, month-of-year and day-of-month. The extra era field is frequently
forgotten, yet it is of vital importance to dates in an arbitrary calendar system.
For example, in the Japanese calendar system, the era represents the reign of an Emperor.
Whenever one reign ends and another starts, the year-of-era is reset to one.

4) The only agreed international standard for passing a date between two systems
is the ISO-8601 standard which requires the ISO calendar system. Using this interface
throughout the application will inevitably lead to the requirement to pass the date
across a network or component boundary, requiring an application specific protocol or format.

5) Long term persistence, such as a database, will almost always only accept dates in the
ISO-8601 calendar system (or the related Julian-Gregorian). Passing around dates in other

False assumptions causing bugs in multi-calendar system code

As indicated above, there are many issues to consider when try to use and manipulate a
date in an arbitrary calendar system. These are some of the key issues.

Code that queries the day-of-month and assumes that the value will never be more than
31 is invalid. Some calendar systems have more than 31 days in some months.

Code that adds 12 months to a date and assumes that a year has been added is invalid.
Some calendar systems have a different number of months, such as 13 in the Coptic or Ethiopic.

Code that adds one month to a date and assumes that the month-of-year value will increase
by one or wrap to the next year is invalid. Some calendar systems have a variable number
of months in a year, such as the Hebrew.

Code that adds one month, then adds a second one month and assumes that the day-of-month
will remain close to its original value is invalid. Some calendar systems have a large difference
between the length of the longest month and the length of the shortest month.
For example, the Coptic or Ethiopic have 12 months of 30 days and 1 month of 5 days.

Code that adds seven days and assumes that a week has been added is invalid.
Some calendar systems have weeks of other than seven days, such as the French Revolutionary.

Code that assumes that because the year of

date1

is greater than the year of

date2

then

date1

is after

date2

is invalid. This is invalid for all calendar systems
when referring to the year-of-era, and especially untrue of the Japanese calendar system
where the year-of-era restarts with the reign of every new Emperor.

Code that treats month-of-year one and day-of-month one as the start of the year is invalid.
Not all calendar systems start the year when the month value is one.

In general, manipulating a date, and even querying a date, is wide open to bugs when the
calendar system is unknown at development time. This is why it is essential that code using
this interface is subjected to additional code reviews. It is also why an architectural
decision to avoid this interface type is usually the correct one.

Using LocalDate instead

The primary alternative to using this interface throughout your application is as follows.

- Declare all method signatures referring to dates in terms of

LocalDate

.

Either store the chronology (calendar system) in the user profile or lookup
the chronology from the user locale

Convert the ISO

LocalDate

to and from the user's preferred calendar system during
printing and parsing

This approach treats the problem of globalized calendar systems as a localization issue
and confines it to the UI layer. This approach is in keeping with other localization
issues in the java platform.

As discussed above, performing calculations on a date where the rules of the calendar system
are pluggable requires skill and is not recommended.
Fortunately, the need to perform calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system
is extremely rare. For example, it is highly unlikely that the business rules of a library
book rental scheme will allow rentals to be for one month, where meaning of the month
is dependent on the user's preferred calendar system.

A key use case for calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system is producing
a month-by-month calendar for display and user interaction. Again, this is a UI issue,
and use of this interface solely within a few methods of the UI layer may be justified.

In any other part of the system, where a date must be manipulated in a calendar system
other than ISO, the use case will generally specify the calendar system to use.
For example, an application may need to calculate the next Islamic or Hebrew holiday
which may require manipulating the date.
This kind of use case can be handled as follows:

- start from the ISO

LocalDate

being passed to the method

convert the date to the alternate calendar system, which for this use case is known
rather than arbitrary

perform the calculation

convert back to

LocalDate

Developers writing low-level frameworks or libraries should also avoid this interface.
Instead, one of the two general purpose access interfaces should be used.
Use

TemporalAccessor

if read-only access is required, or use

Temporal

if read-write access is required.

---

#### Architectural issues to consider

1) Applications using this interface, as opposed to using just

LocalDate

,
face a significantly higher probability of bugs. This is because the calendar system
in use is not known at development time. A key cause of bugs is where the developer
applies assumptions from their day-to-day knowledge of the ISO calendar system
to code that is intended to deal with any arbitrary calendar system.
The section below outlines how those assumptions can cause problems
The primary mechanism for reducing this increased risk of bugs is a strong code review process.
This should also be considered a extra cost in maintenance for the lifetime of the code.

2) This interface does not enforce immutability of implementations.
While the implementation notes indicate that all implementations must be immutable
there is nothing in the code or type system to enforce this. Any method declared
to accept a

ChronoLocalDate

could therefore be passed a poorly or
maliciously written mutable implementation.

3) Applications using this interface must consider the impact of eras.

LocalDate

shields users from the concept of eras, by ensuring that

getYear()

returns the proleptic year. That decision ensures that developers can think of

LocalDate

instances as consisting of three fields - year, month-of-year and day-of-month.
By contrast, users of this interface must think of dates as consisting of four fields -
era, year-of-era, month-of-year and day-of-month. The extra era field is frequently
forgotten, yet it is of vital importance to dates in an arbitrary calendar system.
For example, in the Japanese calendar system, the era represents the reign of an Emperor.
Whenever one reign ends and another starts, the year-of-era is reset to one.

4) The only agreed international standard for passing a date between two systems
is the ISO-8601 standard which requires the ISO calendar system. Using this interface
throughout the application will inevitably lead to the requirement to pass the date
across a network or component boundary, requiring an application specific protocol or format.

5) Long term persistence, such as a database, will almost always only accept dates in the
ISO-8601 calendar system (or the related Julian-Gregorian). Passing around dates in other
calendar systems increases the complications of interacting with persistence.

6) Most of the time, passing a

ChronoLocalDate

is unnecessary, as discussed in the last section below.

by one or wrap to the next year is invalid. Some calendar systems have a variable number
of months in a year, such as the Hebrew.

Code that adds one month, then adds a second one month and assumes that the day-of-month
will remain close to its original value is invalid. Some calendar systems have a large difference
between the length of the longest month and the length of the shortest month.
For example, the Coptic or Ethiopic have 12 months of 30 days and 1 month of 5 days.

Code that adds seven days and assumes that a week has been added is invalid.
Some calendar systems have weeks of other than seven days, such as the French Revolutionary.

Code that assumes that because the year of

date1

is greater than the year of

date2

then

date1

is after

date2

is invalid. This is invalid for all calendar systems
when referring to the year-of-era, and especially untrue of the Japanese calendar system
where the year-of-era restarts with the reign of every new Emperor.

Code that treats month-of-year one and day-of-month one as the start of the year is invalid.
Not all calendar systems start the year when the month value is one.

In general, manipulating a date, and even querying a date, is wide open to bugs when the
calendar system is unknown at development time. This is why it is essential that code using
this interface is subjected to additional code reviews. It is also why an architectural
decision to avoid this interface type is usually the correct one.

Using LocalDate instead

The primary alternative to using this interface throughout your application is as follows.

- Declare all method signatures referring to dates in terms of

LocalDate

.

Either store the chronology (calendar system) in the user profile or lookup
the chronology from the user locale

Convert the ISO

LocalDate

to and from the user's preferred calendar system during
printing and parsing

This approach treats the problem of globalized calendar systems as a localization issue
and confines it to the UI layer. This approach is in keeping with other localization
issues in the java platform.

As discussed above, performing calculations on a date where the rules of the calendar system
are pluggable requires skill and is not recommended.
Fortunately, the need to perform calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system
is extremely rare. For example, it is highly unlikely that the business rules of a library
book rental scheme will allow rentals to be for one month, where meaning of the month
is dependent on the user's preferred calendar system.

A key use case for calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system is producing
a month-by-month calendar for display and user interaction. Again, this is a UI issue,
and use of this interface solely within a few methods of the UI layer may be justified.

In any other part of the system, where a date must be manipulated in a calendar system
other than ISO, the use case will generally specify the calendar system to use.
For example, an application may need to calculate the next Islamic or Hebrew holiday
which may require manipulating the date.
This kind of use case can be handled as follows:

- start from the ISO

LocalDate

being passed to the method

convert the date to the alternate calendar system, which for this use case is known
rather than arbitrary

perform the calculation

convert back to

LocalDate

Developers writing low-level frameworks or libraries should also avoid this interface.
Instead, one of the two general purpose access interfaces should be used.
Use

TemporalAccessor

if read-only access is required, or use

Temporal

if read-write access is required.

#### False assumptions causing bugs in multi-calendar system code

Code that queries the day-of-month and assumes that the value will never be more than
31 is invalid. Some calendar systems have more than 31 days in some months.

Some calendar systems have a different number of months, such as 13 in the Coptic or Ethiopic.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- timeLineOrder

```java
static
Comparator
<
ChronoLocalDate
> timeLineOrder()
```

Gets a comparator that compares

ChronoLocalDate

in
time-line order ignoring the chronology.

This comparator differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the position of the date on the local time-line.
The underlying comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-day.

**Returns:** a comparator that compares in time-line order ignoring the chronology
**See Also:** isAfter(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

,

isBefore(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

,

isEqual(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

- from

```java
static
ChronoLocalDate
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

ChronoLocalDate

from a temporal object.

This obtains a local date based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ChronoLocalDate

.

The conversion extracts and combines the chronology and the date
from the temporal object. The behavior is equivalent to using

Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)

with the extracted chronology.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ChronoLocalDate::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the date, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

ChronoLocalDate
**See Also:** Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)

- getChronology

```java
Chronology
getChronology()
```

Gets the chronology of this date.

The

Chronology

represents the calendar system in use.
The era and other fields in

ChronoField

are defined by the chronology.

**Returns:** the chronology, not null

- getEra

```java
default
Era
getEra()
```

Gets the era, as defined by the chronology.

The era is, conceptually, the largest division of the time-line.
Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time-line into two eras.
However, some have multiple eras, such as one for the reign of each leader.
The exact meaning is determined by the

Chronology

.

All correctly implemented

Era

classes are singletons, thus it
is valid code to write

date.getEra() == SomeChrono.ERA_NAME)

.

This default implementation uses

Chronology.eraOf(int)

.

**Returns:** the chronology specific era constant applicable at this date, not null

- isLeapYear

```java
default boolean isLeapYear()
```

Checks if the year is a leap year, as defined by the calendar system.

A leap-year is a year of a longer length than normal.
The exact meaning is determined by the chronology with the constraint that
a leap-year must imply a year-length longer than a non leap-year.

This default implementation uses

Chronology.isLeapYear(long)

.

**Returns:** true if this date is in a leap year, false otherwise

- lengthOfMonth

```java
int lengthOfMonth()
```

Returns the length of the month represented by this date, as defined by the calendar system.

This returns the length of the month in days.

**Returns:** the length of the month in days

- lengthOfYear

```java
default int lengthOfYear()
```

Returns the length of the year represented by this date, as defined by the calendar system.

This returns the length of the year in days.

The default implementation uses

isLeapYear()

and returns 365 or 366.

**Returns:** the length of the year in days

- isSupported

```java
default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if the specified field can be queried on this date.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported fields is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoField

date fields.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the field can be queried, false if not

- isSupported

```java
default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to or subtracted from this date.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported units is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoUnit

date units except

FOREVER

.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

- with

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** field

- the field to set in the result, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field in the result
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
plus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the addition cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToAdd

- the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be added
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
minus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the subtraction cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
minus​(long amountToSubtract,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period subtracted.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToSubtract

- the amount of the specified unit to subtract, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period subtracted, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be subtracted
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- query

```java
default <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this date using the specified query.

This queries this date using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

- adjustInto

```java
default
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)
```

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same date as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the date changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

passing

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

as the field.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalDate.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalDate);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another date in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

ChronoLocalDate

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

ChronoLocalDate

using

Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)

.
The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two dates.
For example, the amount in days between two dates can be calculated
using

startDate.until(endDate, DAYS)

.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

DAYS

,

WEEKS

,

MONTHS

,

YEARS

,

DECADES

,

CENTURIES

,

MILLENNIA

and

ERAS

should be supported by all implementations.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** until

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** endExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a

ChronoLocalDate

in the same chronology, not null
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null
**Returns:** the amount of time between this date and the end date
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to a

ChronoLocalDate
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
ChronoPeriod
until​(
ChronoLocalDate
endDateExclusive)
```

Calculates the period between this date and another date as a

ChronoPeriod

.

This calculates the period between two dates. All supplied chronologies
calculate the period using years, months and days, however the

ChronoPeriod

API allows the period to be represented using other units.

The start and end points are

this

and the specified date.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The negative sign will be the same in each of year, month and day.

The calculation is performed using the chronology of this date.
If necessary, the input date will be converted to match.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** endDateExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which may be in any chronology, not null
**Returns:** the period between this date and the end date, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the period cannot be calculated
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- format

```java
default
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Formats this date using the specified formatter.

This date will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

The default implementation must behave as follows:

```java
return formatter.format(this);
```

**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the formatted date string, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

- atTime

```java
default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> atTime​(
LocalTime
localTime)
```

Combines this date with a time to create a

ChronoLocalDateTime

.

This returns a

ChronoLocalDateTime

formed from this date at the specified time.
All possible combinations of date and time are valid.

**Parameters:** localTime

- the local time to use, not null
**Returns:** the local date-time formed from this date and the specified time, not null

- toEpochDay

```java
default long toEpochDay()
```

Converts this date to the Epoch Day.

The

Epoch Day count

is a simple
incrementing count of days where day 0 is 1970-01-01 (ISO).
This definition is the same for all chronologies, enabling conversion.

This default implementation queries the

EPOCH_DAY

field.

**Returns:** the Epoch Day equivalent to this date

- compareTo

```java
default int compareTo​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)
```

Compares this date to another date, including the chronology.

The comparison is based first on the underlying time-line date, then
on the chronology.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2012-12-03 (ISO)
- 2012-12-04 (ISO)
- 2555-12-04 (ThaiBuddhist)
- 2012-12-05 (ISO)

Values #2 and #3 represent the same date on the time-line.
When two values represent the same date, the chronology ID is compared to distinguish them.
This step is needed to make the ordering "consistent with equals".

If all the date objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
additional chronology stage is not required and only the local date is used.
To compare the dates of two

TemporalAccessor

instances, including dates
in two different chronologies, use

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

as a comparator.

This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

ChronoLocalDate

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other date to compare to, not null
**Returns:** the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

- isAfter

```java
default boolean isAfter​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)
```

Checks if this date is after the specified date ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.
This is equivalent to using

date1.toEpochDay() > date2.toEpochDay()

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is after the specified date

- isBefore

```java
default boolean isBefore​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)
```

Checks if this date is before the specified date ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.
This is equivalent to using

date1.toEpochDay() < date2.toEpochDay()

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is before the specified date

- isEqual

```java
default boolean isEqual​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)
```

Checks if this date is equal to the specified date ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.
This is equivalent to using

date1.toEpochDay() == date2.toEpochDay()

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if the underlying date is equal to the specified date

- equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Checks if this date is equal to another date, including the chronology.

Compares this date with another ensuring that the date and chronology are the same.

To compare the dates of two

TemporalAccessor

instances, including dates
in two different chronologies, use

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

as a comparator.

Method Detail

- timeLineOrder

```java
static
Comparator
<
ChronoLocalDate
> timeLineOrder()
```

Gets a comparator that compares

ChronoLocalDate

in
time-line order ignoring the chronology.

This comparator differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the position of the date on the local time-line.
The underlying comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-day.

**Returns:** a comparator that compares in time-line order ignoring the chronology
**See Also:** isAfter(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

,

isBefore(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

,

isEqual(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

- from

```java
static
ChronoLocalDate
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

ChronoLocalDate

from a temporal object.

This obtains a local date based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ChronoLocalDate

.

The conversion extracts and combines the chronology and the date
from the temporal object. The behavior is equivalent to using

Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)

with the extracted chronology.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ChronoLocalDate::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the date, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

ChronoLocalDate
**See Also:** Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)

- getChronology

```java
Chronology
getChronology()
```

Gets the chronology of this date.

The

Chronology

represents the calendar system in use.
The era and other fields in

ChronoField

are defined by the chronology.

**Returns:** the chronology, not null

- getEra

```java
default
Era
getEra()
```

Gets the era, as defined by the chronology.

The era is, conceptually, the largest division of the time-line.
Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time-line into two eras.
However, some have multiple eras, such as one for the reign of each leader.
The exact meaning is determined by the

Chronology

.

All correctly implemented

Era

classes are singletons, thus it
is valid code to write

date.getEra() == SomeChrono.ERA_NAME)

.

This default implementation uses

Chronology.eraOf(int)

.

**Returns:** the chronology specific era constant applicable at this date, not null

- isLeapYear

```java
default boolean isLeapYear()
```

Checks if the year is a leap year, as defined by the calendar system.

A leap-year is a year of a longer length than normal.
The exact meaning is determined by the chronology with the constraint that
a leap-year must imply a year-length longer than a non leap-year.

This default implementation uses

Chronology.isLeapYear(long)

.

**Returns:** true if this date is in a leap year, false otherwise

- lengthOfMonth

```java
int lengthOfMonth()
```

Returns the length of the month represented by this date, as defined by the calendar system.

This returns the length of the month in days.

**Returns:** the length of the month in days

- lengthOfYear

```java
default int lengthOfYear()
```

Returns the length of the year represented by this date, as defined by the calendar system.

This returns the length of the year in days.

The default implementation uses

isLeapYear()

and returns 365 or 366.

**Returns:** the length of the year in days

- isSupported

```java
default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if the specified field can be queried on this date.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported fields is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoField

date fields.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the field can be queried, false if not

- isSupported

```java
default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to or subtracted from this date.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported units is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoUnit

date units except

FOREVER

.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

- with

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** field

- the field to set in the result, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field in the result
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
plus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the addition cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToAdd

- the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be added
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
minus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the subtraction cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
minus​(long amountToSubtract,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period subtracted.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToSubtract

- the amount of the specified unit to subtract, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period subtracted, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be subtracted
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- query

```java
default <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this date using the specified query.

This queries this date using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

- adjustInto

```java
default
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)
```

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same date as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the date changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

passing

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

as the field.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalDate.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalDate);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another date in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

ChronoLocalDate

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

ChronoLocalDate

using

Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)

.
The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two dates.
For example, the amount in days between two dates can be calculated
using

startDate.until(endDate, DAYS)

.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

DAYS

,

WEEKS

,

MONTHS

,

YEARS

,

DECADES

,

CENTURIES

,

MILLENNIA

and

ERAS

should be supported by all implementations.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** until

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** endExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a

ChronoLocalDate

in the same chronology, not null
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null
**Returns:** the amount of time between this date and the end date
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to a

ChronoLocalDate
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
ChronoPeriod
until​(
ChronoLocalDate
endDateExclusive)
```

Calculates the period between this date and another date as a

ChronoPeriod

.

This calculates the period between two dates. All supplied chronologies
calculate the period using years, months and days, however the

ChronoPeriod

API allows the period to be represented using other units.

The start and end points are

this

and the specified date.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The negative sign will be the same in each of year, month and day.

The calculation is performed using the chronology of this date.
If necessary, the input date will be converted to match.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** endDateExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which may be in any chronology, not null
**Returns:** the period between this date and the end date, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the period cannot be calculated
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- format

```java
default
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Formats this date using the specified formatter.

This date will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

The default implementation must behave as follows:

```java
return formatter.format(this);
```

**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the formatted date string, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

- atTime

```java
default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> atTime​(
LocalTime
localTime)
```

Combines this date with a time to create a

ChronoLocalDateTime

.

This returns a

ChronoLocalDateTime

formed from this date at the specified time.
All possible combinations of date and time are valid.

**Parameters:** localTime

- the local time to use, not null
**Returns:** the local date-time formed from this date and the specified time, not null

- toEpochDay

```java
default long toEpochDay()
```

Converts this date to the Epoch Day.

The

Epoch Day count

is a simple
incrementing count of days where day 0 is 1970-01-01 (ISO).
This definition is the same for all chronologies, enabling conversion.

This default implementation queries the

EPOCH_DAY

field.

**Returns:** the Epoch Day equivalent to this date

- compareTo

```java
default int compareTo​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)
```

Compares this date to another date, including the chronology.

The comparison is based first on the underlying time-line date, then
on the chronology.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2012-12-03 (ISO)
- 2012-12-04 (ISO)
- 2555-12-04 (ThaiBuddhist)
- 2012-12-05 (ISO)

Values #2 and #3 represent the same date on the time-line.
When two values represent the same date, the chronology ID is compared to distinguish them.
This step is needed to make the ordering "consistent with equals".

If all the date objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
additional chronology stage is not required and only the local date is used.
To compare the dates of two

TemporalAccessor

instances, including dates
in two different chronologies, use

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

as a comparator.

This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

ChronoLocalDate

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other date to compare to, not null
**Returns:** the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

- isAfter

```java
default boolean isAfter​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)
```

Checks if this date is after the specified date ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.
This is equivalent to using

date1.toEpochDay() > date2.toEpochDay()

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is after the specified date

- isBefore

```java
default boolean isBefore​(
ChronoLocalDate
other)
```

Checks if this date is before the specified date ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based

represents the calendar system in use.
The era and other fields in

ChronoField

are defined by the chronology.

getEra

```java
default
Era
getEra()
```

Gets the era, as defined by the chronology.

The era is, conceptually, the largest division of the time-line.
Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time-line into two eras.
However, some have multiple eras, such as one for the reign of each leader.
The exact meaning is determined by the

Chronology

.

All correctly implemented

Era

classes are singletons, thus it
is valid code to write

date.getEra() == SomeChrono.ERA_NAME)

.

This default implementation uses

Chronology.eraOf(int)

.

**Returns:** the chronology specific era constant applicable at this date, not null

with

```java
default
ChronoLocalDate
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek

#### adjustInto

default

Temporal

adjustInto​(

Temporal

temporal)

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same date as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the date changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

passing

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

as the field.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalDate.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalDate);
```

```

Calculates the amount of time until another date in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

ChronoLocalDate

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

ChronoLocalDate

using

Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)

.
The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two dates.
For example, the amount in days between two dates can be calculated
using

startDate.until(endDate, DAYS)

.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

compareTo

```java
default int compareTo​(

other)
```

Compares this date to another date, including the chronology.

The comparison is based first on the underlying time-line date, then
on the chronology.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2012-12-03 (ISO)
- 2012-12-04 (ISO)
- 2555-12-04 (ThaiBuddhist)
- 2012-12-05 (ISO)

Values #2 and #3 represent the same date on the time-line.
When two values represent the same date, the chronology ID is compared to distinguish them.
This step is needed to make the ordering "consistent with equals".

If all the date objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
additional chronology stage is not required and only the local date is used.
