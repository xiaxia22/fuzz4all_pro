# Interface HttpRequest.BodyPublisher

**Source:** `java.net.http\java\net\http\HttpRequest.BodyPublisher.html`

### Class Description

```java
public static interface
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher

extends
Flow.Publisher
<
ByteBuffer
>
```

A

BodyPublisher

converts high-level Java objects into a flow of
byte buffers suitable for sending as a request body. The class

BodyPublishers

provides implementations of many
common publishers.

The

BodyPublisher

interface extends

Flow.Publisher<ByteBuffer>

, which means that a

BodyPublisher

acts as a publisher of

byte buffers

.

When sending a request that contains a body, the HTTP Client
subscribes to the request's

BodyPublisher

in order to receive the
flow of outgoing request body data. The normal semantics of

Flow.Subscriber

and

Flow.Publisher

are implemented by the HTTP
Client and are expected from

BodyPublisher

implementations. Each
outgoing request results in one HTTP Client

Subscriber

subscribing to the

BodyPublisher

in order to provide the sequence
of byte buffers containing the request body. Instances of

ByteBuffer

published by the publisher must be allocated by the
publisher, and must not be accessed after being published to the HTTP
Client. These subscriptions complete normally when the request body is
fully sent, and can be canceled or terminated early through error. If a
request needs to be resent for any reason, then a new subscription is
created which is expected to generate the same data as before.

A

BodyPublisher

that reports a

content length

of

0

may not be subscribed to by the HTTP Client,
as it has effectively no data to publish.

ByteBuffer

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### long contentLength()

Returns the content length for this request body. May be zero
if no request body being sent, greater than zero for a fixed
length content, or less than zero for an unknown content length.

This method may be invoked before the publisher is subscribed to.
This method may be invoked more than once by the HTTP client
implementation, and MUST return the same constant value each time.

**Returns:**
- the content length for this request body, if known
