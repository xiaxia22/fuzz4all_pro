# Class UIManager

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\UIManager.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
UIManager

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

UIManager

manages the current look and feel, the set of
available look and feels,

PropertyChangeListeners

that
are notified when the look and feel changes, look and feel defaults, and
convenience methods for obtaining various default values.

Specifying the look and feel

The look and feel can be specified in two distinct ways: by
specifying the fully qualified name of the class for the look and
feel, or by creating an instance of

LookAndFeel

and passing
it to

setLookAndFeel

. The following example illustrates
setting the look and feel to the system look and feel:

```java
UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
```

The following example illustrates setting the look and feel based on
class name:

```java
UIManager.setLookAndFeel("javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel");
```

Once the look and feel has been changed it is imperative to invoke

updateUI

on all

JComponents

. The method

SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(java.awt.Component)

makes it easy to apply

updateUI

to a containment hierarchy. Refer to it for
details. The exact behavior of not invoking

updateUI

after changing the look and feel is
unspecified. It is very possible to receive unexpected exceptions,
painting problems, or worse.

Default look and feel

The class used for the default look and feel is chosen in the following
manner:

- If the system property

swing.defaultlaf

is

non-null

, use its value as the default look and feel class
name.

If the

Properties

file

swing.properties

exists and contains the key

swing.defaultlaf

,
use its value as the default look and feel class name. The location
that is checked for

swing.properties

may vary depending
upon the implementation of the Java platform. Typically the

swing.properties

file is located in the

conf

subdirectory of the Java installation directory.
Refer to the release notes of the implementation being used for
further details.

Otherwise use the cross platform look and feel.

Defaults

UIManager

manages three sets of

UIDefaults

. In order, they
are:

- Developer defaults. With few exceptions Swing does not
alter the developer defaults; these are intended to be modified
and used by the developer.

Look and feel defaults. The look and feel defaults are
supplied by the look and feel at the time it is installed as the
current look and feel (

setLookAndFeel()

is invoked). The
look and feel defaults can be obtained using the

getLookAndFeelDefaults()

method.

System defaults. The system defaults are provided by Swing.

Invoking any of the various

get

methods
results in checking each of the defaults, in order, returning
the first

non-null

value. For example, invoking

UIManager.getString("Table.foreground")

results in first
checking developer defaults. If the developer defaults contain
a value for

"Table.foreground"

it is returned, otherwise
the look and feel defaults are checked, followed by the system defaults.

It's important to note that

getDefaults

returns a custom
instance of

UIDefaults

with this resolution logic built into it.
For example,

UIManager.getDefaults().getString("Table.foreground")

is equivalent to

UIManager.getString("Table.foreground")

. Both
resolve using the algorithm just described. In many places the
documentation uses the word defaults to refer to the custom instance
of

UIDefaults

with the resolution logic as previously described.

When the look and feel is changed,

UIManager

alters only the
look and feel defaults; the developer and system defaults are not
altered by the

UIManager

in any way.

The set of defaults a particular look and feel supports is defined
and documented by that look and feel. In addition, each look and
feel, or

ComponentUI

provided by a look and feel, may
access the defaults at different times in their life cycle. Some
look and feels may aggressively look up defaults, so that changing a
default may not have an effect after installing the look and feel.
Other look and feels may lazily access defaults so that a change to
the defaults may effect an existing look and feel. Finally, other look
and feels might not configure themselves from the defaults table in
any way. None-the-less it is usually the case that a look and feel
expects certain defaults, so that in general
a

ComponentUI

provided by one look and feel will not
work with another look and feel.

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.

*No description found.*

---

### Method Details

#### public static
UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo
[] getInstalledLookAndFeels()

Returns an array of

LookAndFeelInfo

s representing the

LookAndFeel

implementations currently available. The

LookAndFeelInfo

objects can be used by an
application to construct a menu of look and feel options for
the user, or to determine which look and feel to set at startup
time. To avoid the penalty of creating numerous

LookAndFeel

objects,

LookAndFeelInfo

maintains the
class name of the

LookAndFeel

class, not the actual

LookAndFeel

instance.

The following example illustrates setting the current look and feel
from an instance of

LookAndFeelInfo

:

```java
UIManager.setLookAndFeel(info.getClassName());
```

**Returns:**
- an array of

LookAndFeelInfo

objects

**See Also:**
- setLookAndFeel(javax.swing.LookAndFeel)

---

#### public static void setInstalledLookAndFeels​(
UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo
[] infos)
throws
SecurityException

Sets the set of available look and feels. While this method does
not check to ensure all of the

LookAndFeelInfos

are

non-null

, it is strongly recommended that only

non-null

values are supplied in the

infos

array.

**Parameters:**
- infos

- set of

LookAndFeelInfo

objects specifying
the available look and feels

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

infos

is

null
- SecurityException

**See Also:**
- getInstalledLookAndFeels()

---

#### public static void installLookAndFeel​(
UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo
info)

Adds the specified look and feel to the set of available look
and feels. While this method allows a

null

info

,
it is strongly recommended that a

non-null

value be used.

**Parameters:**
- info

- a

LookAndFeelInfo

object that names the
look and feel and identifies the class that implements it

**See Also:**
- setInstalledLookAndFeels(javax.swing.UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo[])

---

#### public static void installLookAndFeel​(
String
name,

String
className)

Adds the specified look and feel to the set of available look
and feels. While this method does not check the
arguments in any way, it is strongly recommended that

non-null

values be supplied.

**Parameters:**
- name

- descriptive name of the look and feel
- className

- name of the class that implements the look and feel

**See Also:**
- setInstalledLookAndFeels(javax.swing.UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo[])

---

#### public static
LookAndFeel
getLookAndFeel()

Returns the current look and feel or

null

.

**Returns:**
- current look and feel, or

null

**See Also:**
- setLookAndFeel(javax.swing.LookAndFeel)

---

#### public static
LookAndFeel
createLookAndFeel​(
String
name)
throws
UnsupportedLookAndFeelException

Creates a supported built-in Java

LookAndFeel

specified
by the given

L&F name

name.

**Parameters:**
- name

- a

String

specifying the name of the built-in
look and feel

**Returns:**
- the built-in

LookAndFeel

object

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null
- UnsupportedLookAndFeelException

- if the built-in Java

L&F

is not found for the given name or it is not supported by the
underlying platform

**See Also:**
- LookAndFeel.getName()

,

LookAndFeel.isSupportedLookAndFeel()

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public static void setLookAndFeel​(
LookAndFeel
newLookAndFeel)
throws
UnsupportedLookAndFeelException

Sets the current look and feel to

newLookAndFeel

.
If the current look and feel is

non-null

uninitialize

is invoked on it. If

newLookAndFeel

is

non-null

,

initialize

is invoked on it followed
by

getDefaults

. The defaults returned from

newLookAndFeel.getDefaults()

replace those of the defaults
from the previous look and feel. If the

newLookAndFeel

is

null

, the look and feel defaults are set to

null

.

A value of

null

can be used to set the look and feel
to

null

. As the

LookAndFeel

is required for
most of Swing to function, setting the

LookAndFeel

to

null

is strongly discouraged.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:**
- newLookAndFeel

-

LookAndFeel

to install

getLookAndFeelDefaults()

Returns the

UIDefaults

from the current look and feel,
that were obtained at the time the look and feel was installed.

In general, developers should use the

UIDefaults

returned from

. As the current look and feel may expect
certain values to exist, altering the

UIDefaults

returned
from this method could have unexpected results.

**Returns:**
- UIDefaults

from the current look and feel

The auxiliary look and feels tell the multiplexing look and feel what
other

LookAndFeel

classes for a component instance are to be used
in addition to the default

LookAndFeel

class when creating a
multiplexing UI. The change will only take effect when a new
UI class is created or when the default look and feel is changed
on a component instance.

Note these are not the same as the installed look and feels.

**Parameters:**
- laf

- the

LookAndFeel

object

other

LookAndFeel

classes for a component instance are to be used
in addition to the default

LookAndFeel

class when creating a
multiplexing UI. The change will only take effect when a new
UI class is created or when the default look and feel is changed
on a component instance.

Note these are not the same as the installed look and feels.

### Additional Sections

#### Class UIManager

java.lang.Object

- javax.swing.UIManager

javax.swing.UIManager

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

```java
public class
UIManager

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

UIManager

manages the current look and feel, the set of
available look and feels,

PropertyChangeListeners

that
are notified when the look and feel changes, look and feel defaults, and
convenience methods for obtaining various default values.

Specifying the look and feel

The look and feel can be specified in two distinct ways: by
specifying the fully qualified name of the class for the look and
feel, or by creating an instance of

LookAndFeel

and passing
it to

setLookAndFeel

. The following example illustrates
setting the look and feel to the system look and feel:

```java
UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
```

The following example illustrates setting the look and feel based on
class name:

```java
UIManager.setLookAndFeel("javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel");
```

Once the look and feel has been changed it is imperative to invoke

updateUI

on all

JComponents

. The method

SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(java.awt.Component)

makes it easy to apply

updateUI

to a containment hierarchy. Refer to it for
details. The exact behavior of not invoking

updateUI

after changing the look and feel is
unspecified. It is very possible to receive unexpected exceptions,
painting problems, or worse.

Default look and feel

The class used for the default look and feel is chosen in the following
manner:

- If the system property

swing.defaultlaf

is

non-null

, use its value as the default look and feel class
name.

If the

Properties

file

swing.properties

exists and contains the key

swing.defaultlaf

,
use its value as the default look and feel class name. The location
that is checked for

swing.properties

may vary depending
upon the implementation of the Java platform. Typically the

swing.properties

file is located in the

conf

subdirectory of the Java installation directory.
Refer to the release notes of the implementation being used for
further details.

Otherwise use the cross platform look and feel.

Defaults

UIManager

manages three sets of

UIDefaults

. In order, they
are:

- Developer defaults. With few exceptions Swing does not
alter the developer defaults; these are intended to be modified
and used by the developer.

Look and feel defaults. The look and feel defaults are
supplied by the look and feel at the time it is installed as the
current look and feel (

setLookAndFeel()

is invoked). The
look and feel defaults can be obtained using the

getLookAndFeelDefaults()

method.

System defaults. The system defaults are provided by Swing.

Invoking any of the various

get

methods
results in checking each of the defaults, in order, returning
the first

non-null

value. For example, invoking

UIManager.getString("Table.foreground")

results in first
checking developer defaults. If the developer defaults contain
a value for

"Table.foreground"

it is returned, otherwise
the look and feel defaults are checked, followed by the system defaults.

It's important to note that

getDefaults

returns a custom
instance of

UIDefaults

with this resolution logic built into it.
For example,

UIManager.getDefaults().getString("Table.foreground")

is equivalent to

UIManager.getString("Table.foreground")

. Both
resolve using the algorithm just described. In many places the
documentation uses the word defaults to refer to the custom instance
of

UIDefaults

with the resolution logic as previously described.

When the look and feel is changed,

UIManager

alters only the
look and feel defaults; the developer and system defaults are not
altered by the

UIManager

in any way.

The set of defaults a particular look and feel supports is defined
and documented by that look and feel. In addition, each look and
feel, or

ComponentUI

provided by a look and feel, may
access the defaults at different times in their life cycle. Some
look and feels may aggressively look up defaults, so that changing a
default may not have an effect after installing the look and feel.
Other look and feels may lazily access defaults so that a change to
the defaults may effect an existing look and feel. Finally, other look
and feels might not configure themselves from the defaults table in
any way. None-the-less it is usually the case that a look and feel
expects certain defaults, so that in general
a

ComponentUI

provided by one look and feel will not
work with another look and feel.

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.
Please see

XMLEncoder

**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Serialized Form

public class

UIManager

extends

Object

implements

Serializable

UIManager

manages the current look and feel, the set of
available look and feels,

PropertyChangeListeners

that
are notified when the look and feel changes, look and feel defaults, and
convenience methods for obtaining various default values.

Specifying the look and feel

The look and feel can be specified in two distinct ways: by
specifying the fully qualified name of the class for the look and
feel, or by creating an instance of

LookAndFeel

and passing
it to

setLookAndFeel

. The following example illustrates
setting the look and feel to the system look and feel:

```java
UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
```

The following example illustrates setting the look and feel based on
class name:

```java
UIManager.setLookAndFeel("javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel");
```

Once the look and feel has been changed it is imperative to invoke

updateUI

on all

JComponents

. The method

SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(java.awt.Component)

makes it easy to apply

updateUI

to a containment hierarchy. Refer to it for
details. The exact behavior of not invoking

updateUI

after changing the look and feel is
unspecified. It is very possible to receive unexpected exceptions,
painting problems, or worse.

Default look and feel

The class used for the default look and feel is chosen in the following
manner:

- If the system property

swing.defaultlaf

is

non-null

, use its value as the default look and feel class
name.

file

swing.properties

exists and contains the key

swing.defaultlaf

,
use its value as the default look and feel class name. The location
that is checked for

swing.properties

may vary depending
upon the implementation of the Java platform. Typically the

swing.properties

file is located in the

conf

subdirectory of the Java installation directory.

- Method Detail

- getInstalledLookAndFeels

```java
public static
UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo
[] getInstalledLookAndFeels()
```

Returns an array of

LookAndFeelInfo

s representing the

LookAndFeel

implementations currently available. The

LookAndFeelInfo

objects can be used by an
application to construct a menu of look and feel options for
the user, or to determine which look and feel to set at startup
time. To avoid the penalty of creating numerous

LookAndFeel

objects,

LookAndFeelInfo

maintains the
class name of the

LookAndFeel

class, not the actual

LookAndFeel

instance.

The following example illustrates setting the current look and feel
from an instance of

LookAndFeelInfo

:

```java
UIManager.setLookAndFeel(info.getClassName());
```

**Returns:** an array of

LookAndFeelInfo

objects
**See Also:** setLookAndFeel(javax.swing.LookAndFeel)

- setInstalledLookAndFeels

```java
public static void setInstalledLookAndFeels​(
UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo
[] infos)
throws
SecurityException
```

Sets the set of available look and feels. While this method does
not check to ensure all of the

LookAndFeelInfos

are

non-null

, it is strongly recommended that only

non-null

values are supplied in the

infos

array.

**Parameters:** infos

- set of

LookAndFeelInfo

objects specifying
the available look and feels
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

infos

is

null
**Throws:** SecurityException
**See Also:** getInstalledLookAndFeels()

- installLookAndFeel

```java
public static void installLookAndFeel​(
UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo
info)
```

Adds the specified look and feel to the set of available look
and feels. While this method allows a

null

info

,
it is strongly recommended that a

non-null

value be used.

**Parameters:** info

- a

LookAndFeelInfo

object that names the
look and feel and identifies the class that implements it
**See Also:** setInstalledLookAndFeels(javax.swing.UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo[])

- installLookAndFeel

```java
public static void installLookAndFeel​(
String
name,

String
className)
```

Adds the specified look and feel to the set of available look
and feels. While this method does not check the
arguments in any way, it is strongly recommended that

non-null

values be supplied.

**Parameters:** name

- descriptive name of the look and feel
**Parameters:** className

- name of the class that implements the look and feel
**See Also:** setInstalledLookAndFeels(javax.swing.UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo[])

- getLookAndFeel

```java
public static
LookAndFeel
getLookAndFeel()
```

Returns the current look and feel or

null

.

**Returns:** current look and feel, or

null

LookAndFeel

specified
by the given

L&F name

name.

**Parameters:** name

- a

String

specifying the name of the built-in
look and feel
**Returns:** the built-in

LookAndFeel

object
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

is

null
**Throws:** UnsupportedLookAndFeelException

- if the built-in Java

L&F

is not found for the given name or it is not supported by the
underlying platform
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** LookAndFeel.getName()

,

LookAndFeel.isSupportedLookAndFeel()

- setLookAndFeel

```java
public static void setLookAndFeel​(
LookAndFeel
newLookAndFeel)
throws
UnsupportedLookAndFeelException
```

Sets the current look and feel to

newLookAndFeel

.
If the current look and feel is

non-null

uninitialize

is invoked on it. If

newLookAndFeel

is

non-null

,

initialize

is invoked on it followed
by

getDefaults

. The defaults returned from

newLookAndFeel.getDefaults()

replace those of the defaults
from the previous look and feel. If the

newLookAndFeel

is

null

, the look and feel defaults are set to

null

.

A value of

null

can be used to set the look and feel
to

null

. As the

LookAndFeel

is required for
most of Swing to function, setting the

LookAndFeel

to

null

is strongly discouraged.

certain values to exist, altering the

UIDefaults

returned
from this method could have unexpected results.

**Returns:** UIDefaults

from the current look and feel
**See Also:** getDefaults()

,

The auxiliary look and feels tell the multiplexing look and feel what
other

LookAndFeel

classes for a component instance are to be used
in addition to the default

LookAndFeel

class when creating a
multiplexing UI. The change will only take effect when a new
UI class is created or when the default look and feel is changed
on a component instance.

Note these are not the same as the installed look and feels.

#### Method Detail

getInstalledLookAndFeels

```java
public static
UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo
[] getInstalledLookAndFeels()
```

Returns an array of

LookAndFeelInfo

s representing the

LookAndFeel

implementations currently available. The

LookAndFeelInfo

objects can be used by an
application to construct a menu of look and feel options for
the user, or to determine which look and feel to set at startup
time. To avoid the penalty of creating numerous

LookAndFeel

objects,

LookAndFeelInfo

maintains the
class name of the

LookAndFeel

class, not the actual

LookAndFeel

instance.

The following example illustrates setting the current look and feel
from an instance of

LookAndFeelInfo

:

```java
UIManager.setLookAndFeel(info.getClassName());
```

**Returns:** an array of

LookAndFeelInfo

objects
**See Also:** setLookAndFeel(javax.swing.LookAndFeel)
