# Interface AnnotatedElement

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\reflect\AnnotatedElement.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
AnnotatedElement
```

Represents an annotated element of the program currently running in this
VM. This interface allows annotations to be read reflectively. All
annotations returned by methods in this interface are immutable and
serializable. The arrays returned by methods of this interface may be modified
by callers without affecting the arrays returned to other callers.

The

getAnnotationsByType(Class)

and

getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class)

methods support multiple
annotations of the same type on an element. If the argument to
either method is a repeatable annotation type (JLS 9.6), then the
method will "look through" a container annotation (JLS 9.7), if
present, and return any annotations inside the container. Container
annotations may be generated at compile-time to wrap multiple
annotations of the argument type.

The terms

directly present

,

indirectly present

,

present

, and

associated

are used throughout this
interface to describe precisely which annotations are returned by
methods:

- An annotation

A

is

directly present

on an
element

E

if

E

has a

RuntimeVisibleAnnotations

or

RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations

or

RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations

attribute, and the attribute
contains

A

.

An annotation

A

is

indirectly present

on an
element

E

if

E

has a

RuntimeVisibleAnnotations

or

RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations

or

RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations

attribute, and

A

's type is repeatable, and the attribute contains
exactly one annotation whose value element contains

A

and whose
type is the containing annotation type of

A

's type.

An annotation

A

is present on an element

E

if either:

- A

is directly present on

E

; or

No annotation of

A

's type is directly present on

E

, and

E

is a class, and

A

's type is
inheritable, and

A

is present on the superclass of

E

.

An annotation

A

is

associated

with an element

E

if either:

- A

is directly or indirectly present on

E

; or

No annotation of

A

's type is directly or indirectly
present on

E

, and

E

is a class, and

A

's type
is inheritable, and

A

is associated with the superclass of

E

.

The table below summarizes which kind of annotation presence
different methods in this interface examine.

For an invocation of

get[Declared]AnnotationsByType( Class <
T >)

, the order of annotations which are directly or indirectly
present on an element

E

is computed as if indirectly present
annotations on

E

are directly present on

E

in place
of their container annotation, in the order in which they appear in
the value element of the container annotation.

There are several compatibility concerns to keep in mind if an
annotation type

T

is originally

not

repeatable and
later modified to be repeatable.

The containing annotation type for

T

is

TC

.

- Modifying

T

to be repeatable is source and binary
compatible with existing uses of

T

and with existing uses
of

TC

.

That is, for source compatibility, source code with annotations of
type

T

or of type

TC

will still compile. For binary
compatibility, class files with annotations of type

T

or of
type

TC

(or with other kinds of uses of type

T

or of
type

TC

) will link against the modified version of

T

if they linked against the earlier version.

(An annotation type

TC

may informally serve as an acting
containing annotation type before

T

is modified to be
formally repeatable. Alternatively, when

T

is made
repeatable,

TC

can be introduced as a new type.)

If an annotation type

TC

is present on an element, and

T

is modified to be repeatable with

TC

as its
containing annotation type then:

- The change to

T

is behaviorally compatible with respect
to the

get[Declared]Annotation(Class<T>)

(called with an
argument of

T

or

TC

) and

get[Declared]Annotations()

methods because the results of the
methods will not change due to

TC

becoming the containing
annotation type for

T

.

The change to

T

changes the results of the

get[Declared]AnnotationsByType(Class<T>)

methods called with an
argument of

T

, because those methods will now recognize an
annotation of type

TC

as a container annotation for

T

and will "look through" it to expose annotations of type

T

.

If an annotation of type

T

is present on an
element and

T

is made repeatable and more annotations of
type

T

are added to the element:

- The addition of the annotations of type

T

is both
source compatible and binary compatible.

The addition of the annotations of type

T

changes the results
of the

get[Declared]Annotation(Class<T>)

methods and

get[Declared]Annotations()

methods, because those methods will now
only see a container annotation on the element and not see an
annotation of type

T

.

The addition of the annotations of type

T

changes the
results of the

get[Declared]AnnotationsByType(Class<T>)

methods, because their results will expose the additional
annotations of type

T

whereas previously they exposed only a
single annotation of type

T

.

If an annotation returned by a method in this interface contains
(directly or indirectly) a

Class

-valued member referring to
a class that is not accessible in this VM, attempting to read the class
by calling the relevant Class-returning method on the returned annotation
will result in a

TypeNotPresentException

.

Similarly, attempting to read an enum-valued member will result in
a

EnumConstantNotPresentException

if the enum constant in the
annotation is no longer present in the enum type.

If an annotation type

T

is (meta-)annotated with an

@Repeatable

annotation whose value element indicates a type

TC

, but

TC

does not declare a

value()

method
with a return type of

T

[]

, then an exception of type

AnnotationFormatError

is thrown.

Finally, attempting to read a member whose definition has evolved
incompatibly will result in a

AnnotationTypeMismatchException

or an

IncompleteAnnotationException

.

### Method Details

#### default boolean isAnnotationPresent​(
Class
<? extends
Annotation
> annotationClass)

Returns true if an annotation for the specified type
is

present

on this element, else false. This method
is designed primarily for convenient access to marker annotations.

The truth value returned by this method is equivalent to:

getAnnotation(annotationClass) != null

The body of the default method is specified to be the code
above.

**Parameters:**
- annotationClass

- the Class object corresponding to the
annotation type

**Returns:**
- true if an annotation for the specified annotation
type is present on this element, else false

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the given annotation class is null

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### <T extends
Annotation
> T getAnnotation​(
Class
<T> annotationClass)

Returns this element's annotation for the specified type if
such an annotation is

present

, else null.

**Parameters:**
- annotationClass

- the Class object corresponding to the
annotation type

**Returns:**
- this element's annotation for the specified annotation type if
present on this element, else null

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the given annotation class is null

**Since:**
- 1.5

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the type of the annotation to query for and return if present

---

#### Annotation
[] getAnnotations()

Returns annotations that are

present

on this element.

If there are no annotations

present

on this element, the return
value is an array of length 0.

The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

**Returns:**
- annotations present on this element

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### default <T extends
Annotation
> T[] getAnnotationsByType​(
Class
<T> annotationClass)

Returns annotations that are

associated

with this element.

If there are no annotations

associated

with this element, the return
value is an array of length 0.

The difference between this method and

getAnnotation(Class)

is that this method detects if its argument is a

repeatable
annotation type

(JLS 9.6), and if so, attempts to find one or
more annotations of that type by "looking through" a container
annotation.

The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

**Parameters:**
- annotationClass

- the Class object corresponding to the
annotation type

**Returns:**
- all this element's annotations for the specified annotation type if
associated with this element, else an array of length zero

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the given annotation class is null

**Since:**
- 1.8

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation first calls

getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class)

passing

annotationClass

as the argument. If the returned array has
length greater than zero, the array is returned. If the returned
array is zero-length and this

AnnotatedElement

is a
class and the argument type is an inheritable annotation type,
and the superclass of this

AnnotatedElement

is non-null,
then the returned result is the result of calling

getAnnotationsByType(Class)

on the superclass with

annotationClass

as the argument. Otherwise, a zero-length
array is returned.

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the type of the annotation to query for and return if present

---

#### default <T extends
Annotation
> T getDeclaredAnnotation​(
Class
<T> annotationClass)

Returns this element's annotation for the specified type if
such an annotation is

directly present

, else null.

This method ignores inherited annotations. (Returns null if no
annotations are directly present on this element.)

**Parameters:**
- annotationClass

- the Class object corresponding to the
annotation type

**Returns:**
- this element's annotation for the specified annotation type if
directly present on this element, else null

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the given annotation class is null

**Since:**
- 1.8

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation first performs a null check
and then loops over the results of

getDeclaredAnnotations()

returning the first annotation whose
annotation type matches the argument type.

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the type of the annotation to query for and return if directly present

---

#### default <T extends
Annotation
> T[] getDeclaredAnnotationsByType​(
Class
<T> annotationClass)

Returns this element's annotation(s) for the specified type if
such annotations are either

directly present

or

indirectly present

. This method ignores inherited
annotations.

If there are no specified annotations directly or indirectly
present on this element, the return value is an array of length
0.

The difference between this method and

getDeclaredAnnotation(Class)

is that this method detects if its
argument is a

repeatable annotation type

(JLS 9.6), and if so,
attempts to find one or more annotations of that type by "looking
through" a container annotation if one is present.

The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

**Parameters:**
- annotationClass

- the Class object corresponding to the
annotation type

**Returns:**
- all this element's annotations for the specified annotation type if
directly or indirectly present on this element, else an array of length zero

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the given annotation class is null

**Since:**
- 1.8

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation may call

getDeclaredAnnotation(Class)

one or more times to find a
directly present annotation and, if the annotation type is
repeatable, to find a container annotation. If annotations of
the annotation type

annotationClass

are found to be both
directly and indirectly present, then

getDeclaredAnnotations()

will get called to determine the
order of the elements in the returned array.

Alternatively, the default implementation may call

getDeclaredAnnotations()

a single time and the returned array
examined for both directly and indirectly present
annotations. The results of calling

getDeclaredAnnotations()

are assumed to be consistent with the
results of calling

getDeclaredAnnotation(Class)

.

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the type of the annotation to query for and return
if directly or indirectly present

---

#### Annotation
[] getDeclaredAnnotations()

Returns annotations that are

directly present

on this element.
This method ignores inherited annotations.

If there are no annotations

directly present

on this element,
the return value is an array of length 0.

The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

**Returns:**
- annotations directly present on this element

**Since:**
- 1.5

For an invocation of

get[Declared]AnnotationsByType( Class <

, the order of annotations which are directly or indirectly
present on an element

E

is computed as if indirectly present
annotations on

E

are directly present on

E

in place
of their container annotation, in the order in which they appear in
the value element of the container annotation.

There are several compatibility concerns to keep in mind if an
annotation type

T

is originally

not

repeatable and
later modified to be repeatable.

The containing annotation type for

T

is

TC

.

- Modifying

T

to be repeatable is source and binary
compatible with existing uses of

T

and with existing uses
of

TC

.

That is, for source compatibility, source code with annotations of
type

T

or of type

TC

will still compile. For binary
compatibility, class files with annotations of type

T

or of
type

TC

(or with other kinds of uses of type

T

or of
type

TC

) will link against the modified version of

T

if they linked against the earlier version.

(An annotation type

TC

may informally serve as an acting
containing annotation type before

T

is modified to be
formally repeatable. Alternatively, when

T

is made
repeatable,

TC

can be introduced as a new type.)

If an annotation type

TC

is present on an element, and

T

is modified to be repeatable with

TC

as its
containing annotation type then:

- The change to

T

is behaviorally compatible with respect
to the

get[Declared]Annotation(Class<T>)

(called with an
argument of

T

or

TC

) and

get[Declared]Annotations()

methods because the results of the
methods will not change due to

TC

becoming the containing
annotation type for

T

.

The change to

T

changes the results of the

get[Declared]AnnotationsByType(Class<T>)

methods called with an
argument of

T

, because those methods will now recognize an
annotation of type

TC

as a container annotation for

T

and will "look through" it to expose annotations of type

T

.

If an annotation of type

T

is present on an
element and

T

is made repeatable and more annotations of
type

T

are added to the element:

- The addition of the annotations of type

T

is both
source compatible and binary compatible.

The addition of the annotations of type

T

changes the results
of the

get[Declared]Annotation(Class<T>)

methods and

get[Declared]Annotations()

methods, because those methods will now
only see a container annotation on the element and not see an
annotation of type

T

.

The addition of the annotations of type

T

changes the
results of the

get[Declared]AnnotationsByType(Class<T>)

methods, because their results will expose the additional
annotations of type

T

whereas previously they exposed only a
single annotation of type

T

.

If an annotation returned by a method in this interface contains
(directly or indirectly) a

Class

-valued member referring to
a class that is not accessible in this VM, attempting to read the class
by calling the relevant Class-returning method on the returned annotation
will result in a

TypeNotPresentException

.

Similarly, attempting to read an enum-valued member will result in
a

EnumConstantNotPresentException

if the enum constant in the
annotation is no longer present in the enum type.

If an annotation type

T

is (meta-)annotated with an

@Repeatable

annotation whose value element indicates a type

TC

, but

TC

does not declare a

value()

method
with a return type of

T

[]

, then an exception of type

AnnotationFormatError

is thrown.

Finally, attempting to read a member whose definition has evolved
incompatibly will result in a

AnnotationTypeMismatchException

or an

IncompleteAnnotationException

.

The terms

directly present

,

indirectly present

,

present

, and

associated

are used throughout this
interface to describe precisely which annotations are returned by
methods:

- An annotation

A

is

directly present

on an
element

E

if

E

has a

RuntimeVisibleAnnotations

or

RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations

or

RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations

attribute, and the attribute
contains

A

.

An annotation

A

is

indirectly present

on an
element

E

if

E

has a

RuntimeVisibleAnnotations

or

RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations

or

RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations

attribute, and

A

's type is repeatable, and the attribute contains
exactly one annotation whose value element contains

A

and whose
type is the containing annotation type of

A

's type.

An annotation

A

is present on an element

E

if either:

- A

is directly present on

E

; or

No annotation of

A

's type is directly present on

E

, and

E

is a class, and

A

's type is
inheritable, and

A

is present on the superclass of

An annotation

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- isAnnotationPresent

```java
default boolean isAnnotationPresent​(
Class
<? extends
Annotation
> annotationClass)
```

Returns true if an annotation for the specified type
is

present

on this element, else false. This method
is designed primarily for convenient access to marker annotations.

The truth value returned by this method is equivalent to:

getAnnotation(annotationClass) != null

The body of the default method is specified to be the code
above.

**Parameters:** annotationClass

- the Class object corresponding to the
annotation type
**Returns:** true if an annotation for the specified annotation
type is present on this element, else false
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the given annotation class is null
**Since:** 1.5

- getAnnotation

```java
<T extends
Annotation
> T getAnnotation​(
Class
<T> annotationClass)
```

Returns this element's annotation for the specified type if
such an annotation is

present

, else null.

**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the annotation to query for and return if present
**Parameters:** annotationClass

- the Class object corresponding to the
annotation type
**Returns:** this element's annotation for the specified annotation type if
present on this element, else null
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the given annotation class is null
**Since:** 1.5

- getAnnotations

```java
Annotation
[] getAnnotations()
```

Returns annotations that are

present

on this element.

If there are no annotations

present

on this element, the return
value is an array of length 0.

The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

**Returns:** annotations present on this element
**Since:** 1.5

- getAnnotationsByType

```java
default <T extends
Annotation
> T[] getAnnotationsByType​(
Class
<T> annotationClass)
```

Returns annotations that are

associated

with this element.

If there are no annotations

associated

with this element, the return
value is an array of length 0.

The difference between this method and

getAnnotation(Class)

is that this method detects if its argument is a

repeatable
annotation type

(JLS 9.6), and if so, attempts to find one or
more annotations of that type by "looking through" a container
annotation.

The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation first calls

getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class)

passing

annotationClass

as the argument. If the returned array has
length greater than zero, the array is returned. If the returned
array is zero-length and this

AnnotatedElement

is a
class and the argument type is an inheritable annotation type,
and the superclass of this

AnnotatedElement

is non-null,
then the returned result is the result of calling

getAnnotationsByType(Class)

on the superclass with

annotationClass

as the argument. Otherwise, a zero-length
array is returned.
**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the annotation to query for and return if present
**Parameters:** annotationClass

- the Class object corresponding to the
annotation type
**Returns:** all this element's annotations for the specified annotation type if
associated with this element, else an array of length zero
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the given annotation class is null
**Since:** 1.8

- getDeclaredAnnotation

```java
default <T extends
Annotation
> T getDeclaredAnnotation​(
Class
<T> annotationClass)
```

Returns this element's annotation for the specified type if
such an annotation is

directly present

, else null.

This method ignores inherited annotations. (Returns null if no
annotations are directly present on this element.)

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation first performs a null check
and then loops over the results of

getDeclaredAnnotations()

returning the first annotation whose
annotation type matches the argument type.
**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the annotation to query for and return if directly present
**Parameters:** annotationClass

- the Class object corresponding to the
annotation type
**Returns:** this element's annotation for the specified annotation type if
directly present on this element, else null
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the given annotation class is null
**Since:** 1.8

- getDeclaredAnnotationsByType

```java
default <T extends
Annotation
> T[] getDeclaredAnnotationsByType​(
Class
<T> annotationClass)
```

Returns this element's annotation(s) for the specified type if
such annotations are either

directly present

or

indirectly present

. This method ignores inherited
annotations.

If there are no specified annotations directly or indirectly
present on this element, the return value is an array of length
0.

The difference between this method and

getDeclaredAnnotation(Class)

is that this method detects if its
argument is a

repeatable annotation type

(JLS 9.6), and if so,
attempts to find one or more annotations of that type by "looking
through" a container annotation if one is present.

The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation may call

getDeclaredAnnotation(Class)

one or more times to find a
directly present annotation and, if the annotation type is
repeatable, to find a container annotation. If annotations of
the annotation type

annotationClass

are found to be both
directly and indirectly present, then

getDeclaredAnnotations()

will get called to determine the
order of the elements in the returned array.

Alternatively, the default implementation may call

getDeclaredAnnotations()

a single time and the returned array
examined for both directly and indirectly present
annotations. The results of calling

getDeclaredAnnotations()

are assumed to be consistent with the
results of calling

getDeclaredAnnotation(Class)

.
**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the annotation to query for and return
if directly or indirectly present
**Parameters:** annotationClass

- the Class object corresponding to the
annotation type
**Returns:** all this element's annotations for the specified annotation type if
directly or indirectly present on this element, else an array of length zero
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the given annotation class is null
**Since:** 1.8

- getDeclaredAnnotations

```java
Annotation
[] getDeclaredAnnotations()
```

Returns annotations that are

directly present

on this element.
This method ignores inherited annotations.

If there are no annotations

directly present

on this element,
the return value is an array of length 0.

The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

**Returns:** annotations directly present on this element
**Since:** 1.5
