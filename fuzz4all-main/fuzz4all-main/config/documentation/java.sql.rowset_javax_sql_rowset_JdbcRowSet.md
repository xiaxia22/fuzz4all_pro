# Interface JdbcRowSet

**Source:** `java.sql.rowset\javax\sql\rowset\JdbcRowSet.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
JdbcRowSet

extends
RowSet
,
Joinable
```

The standard interface that all standard implementations of

JdbcRowSet

must implement.

1.0 Overview

A wrapper around a

ResultSet

object that makes it possible
to use the result set as a JavaBeans™
component. Thus, a

JdbcRowSet

object can be one of the Beans that
a tool makes available for composing an application. Because
a

JdbcRowSet

is a connected rowset, that is, it continually
maintains its connection to a database using a JDBC technology-enabled
driver, it also effectively makes the driver a JavaBeans component.

Because it is always connected to its database, an instance of

JdbcRowSet

can simply take calls invoked on it and in turn call them on its

ResultSet

object. As a consequence, a result set can, for
example, be a component in a Swing application.

Another advantage of a

JdbcRowSet

object is that it can be
used to make a

ResultSet

object scrollable and updatable. All

RowSet

objects are by default scrollable and updatable. If
the driver and database being used do not support scrolling and/or updating
of result sets, an application can populate a

JdbcRowSet

object
with the data of a

ResultSet

object and then operate on the

JdbcRowSet

object as if it were the

ResultSet

object.

2.0 Creating a

JdbcRowSet

Object

The reference implementation of the

JdbcRowSet

interface,

JdbcRowSetImpl

, provides an implementation of
the default constructor. A new instance is initialized with
default values, which can be set with new values as needed. A
new instance is not really functional until its

execute

method is called. In general, this method does the following:

- establishes a connection with a database

creates a

PreparedStatement

object and sets any of its
placeholder parameters

executes the statement to create a

ResultSet

object

If the

execute

method is successful, it will set the
appropriate private

JdbcRowSet

fields with the following:

- a

Connection

object -- the connection between the rowset
and the database

a

PreparedStatement

object -- the query that produces
the result set

a

ResultSet

object -- the result set that the rowset's
command produced and that is being made, in effect, a JavaBeans
component

If these fields have not been set, meaning that the

execute

method has not executed successfully, no methods other than

execute

and

close

may be called on the
rowset. All other public methods will throw an exception.

Before calling the

execute

method, however, the command
and properties needed for establishing a connection must be set.
The following code fragment creates a

JdbcRowSetImpl

object,
sets the command and connection properties, sets the placeholder parameter,
and then invokes the method

execute

.

```java
JdbcRowSetImpl jrs = new JdbcRowSetImpl();
jrs.setCommand("SELECT * FROM TITLES WHERE TYPE = ?");
jrs.setURL("jdbc:myDriver:myAttribute");
jrs.setUsername("cervantes");
jrs.setPassword("sancho");
jrs.setString(1, "BIOGRAPHY");
jrs.execute();
```

The variable

jrs

now represents an instance of

JdbcRowSetImpl

that is a thin wrapper around the

ResultSet

object containing all the rows in the
table

TITLES

where the type of book is biography.
At this point, operations called on

jrs

will
affect the rows in the result set, which is effectively a JavaBeans
component.

The implementation of the

RowSet

method

execute

in the

JdbcRowSet

reference implementation differs from that in the

CachedRowSet

™
reference implementation to account for the different
requirements of connected and disconnected

RowSet

objects.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### boolean getShowDeleted()
throws
SQLException

Retrieves a

boolean

indicating whether rows marked
for deletion appear in the set of current rows. If

true

is
returned, deleted rows are visible with the current rows. If

false

is returned, rows are not visible with the set of
current rows. The default value is

false

.

Standard rowset implementations may choose to restrict this behavior
for security considerations or for certain deployment
scenarios. The visibility of deleted rows is implementation-defined
and does not represent standard behavior.

Note: Allowing deleted rows to remain visible complicates the behavior
of some standard JDBC

RowSet

implementations methods.
However, most rowset users can simply ignore this extra detail because
only very specialized applications will likely want to take advantage of
this feature.

**Returns:**
- true

if deleted rows are visible;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a rowset implementation is unable to
to determine whether rows marked for deletion remain visible

**See Also:**
- setShowDeleted(boolean)

---

#### void setShowDeleted​(boolean b)
throws
SQLException

Sets the property

showDeleted

to the given

boolean

value. This property determines whether
rows marked for deletion continue to appear in the set of current rows.
If the value is set to

true

, deleted rows are immediately
visible with the set of current rows. If the value is set to

false

, the deleted rows are set as invisible with the
current set of rows.

Standard rowset implementations may choose to restrict this behavior
for security considerations or for certain deployment
scenarios. This is left as implementation-defined and does not
represent standard behavior.

**Parameters:**
- b

-

true

if deleted rows should be shown;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a rowset implementation is unable to
to reset whether deleted rows should be visible

**See Also:**
- getShowDeleted()

---

#### RowSetWarning
getRowSetWarnings()
throws
SQLException

Retrieves the first warning reported by calls on this

JdbcRowSet

object.
If a second warning was reported on this

JdbcRowSet

object,
it will be chained to the first warning and can be retrieved by
calling the method

RowSetWarning.getNextWarning

on the
first warning. Subsequent warnings on this

JdbcRowSet

object will be chained to the

RowSetWarning

objects
returned by the method

RowSetWarning.getNextWarning

.

The warning chain is automatically cleared each time a new row is read.
This method may not be called on a

RowSet

object
that has been closed;
doing so will cause an

SQLException

to be thrown.

Because it is always connected to its data source, a

JdbcRowSet

object can rely on the presence of active

Statement

,

Connection

, and

ResultSet

instances. This means that applications can obtain additional

SQLWarning

notifications by calling the

getNextWarning

methods that
they provide.
Disconnected

Rowset

objects, such as a

CachedRowSet

object, do not have access to
these

getNextWarning

methods.

**Returns:**
- the first

RowSetWarning

object reported on this

JdbcRowSet

object
or

null

if there are none

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if this method is called on a closed

JdbcRowSet

object

**See Also:**
- RowSetWarning

---

#### void commit()
throws
SQLException

Each

JdbcRowSet

contains a

Connection

object from
the

ResultSet

or JDBC properties passed to it's constructors.
This method wraps the

Connection

commit method to allow flexible
auto commit or non auto commit transactional control support.

Makes all changes made since the previous commit/rollback permanent
and releases any database locks currently held by this Connection
object. This method should be used only when auto-commit mode has
been disabled.

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or this
Connection object within this

JdbcRowSet

is in auto-commit mode

**See Also:**
- Connection.setAutoCommit(boolean)

---

#### boolean getAutoCommit()
throws
SQLException

Each

JdbcRowSet

contains a

Connection

object from
the original

ResultSet

or JDBC properties passed to it. This
method wraps the

Connection

's

getAutoCommit

method
to allow an application to determine the

JdbcRowSet

transaction
behavior.

Sets this connection's auto-commit mode to the given state. If a
connection is in auto-commit mode, then all its SQL statements will
be executed and committed as individual transactions. Otherwise, its
SQL statements are grouped into transactions that are terminated by a
call to either the method commit or the method rollback. By default,
new connections are in auto-commit mode.

**Returns:**
- true

if auto-commit is enabled;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs

**See Also:**
- Connection.getAutoCommit()

---

#### void setAutoCommit​(boolean autoCommit)
throws
SQLException

Each

JdbcRowSet

contains a

Connection

object from
the original

ResultSet

or JDBC properties passed to it. This
method wraps the

Connection

's

getAutoCommit

method
to allow an application to set the

JdbcRowSet

transaction behavior.

Sets the current auto-commit mode for this

Connection

object.

**Parameters:**
- autoCommit

-

true

to enable auto-commit;

false

to
disable auto-commit

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs

**See Also:**
- Connection.setAutoCommit(boolean)

---

#### void rollback()
throws
SQLException

Each

JdbcRowSet

contains a

Connection

object from
the original

ResultSet

or JDBC properties passed to it.
Undoes all changes made in the current transaction and releases any
database locks currently held by this

Connection

object. This method
should be used only when auto-commit mode has been disabled.

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or this

Connection

object within this

JdbcRowSet

is in auto-commit mode.

**See Also:**
- rollback(Savepoint)

---

#### void rollback​(
Savepoint
s)
throws
SQLException

Each

JdbcRowSet

contains a

Connection

object from
the original

ResultSet

or JDBC properties passed to it.
Undoes all changes made in the current transaction to the last set savepoint
and releases any database locks currently held by this

Connection

object. This method should be used only when auto-commit mode has been disabled.

**Parameters:**
- s

- The

Savepoint

to rollback to

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or this

Connection

object within this

JdbcRowSet

is in auto-commit mode.

**See Also:**
- rollback()

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getShowDeleted

```java
boolean getShowDeleted()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves a

boolean

indicating whether rows marked
for deletion appear in the set of current rows. If

true

is
returned, deleted rows are visible with the current rows. If

false

is returned, rows are not visible with the set of
current rows. The default value is

false

.

Standard rowset implementations may choose to restrict this behavior
for security considerations or for certain deployment
scenarios. The visibility of deleted rows is implementation-defined
and does not represent standard behavior.

Note: Allowing deleted rows to remain visible complicates the behavior
of some standard JDBC

RowSet

implementations methods.
However, most rowset users can simply ignore this extra detail because
only very specialized applications will likely want to take advantage of
this feature.

**Returns:** true

if deleted rows are visible;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a rowset implementation is unable to
to determine whether rows marked for deletion remain visible
**See Also:** setShowDeleted(boolean)

- setShowDeleted

```java
void setShowDeleted​(boolean b)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the property

showDeleted

to the given

boolean

value. This property determines whether
rows marked for deletion continue to appear in the set of current rows.
If the value is set to

true

, deleted rows are immediately
visible with the set of current rows. If the value is set to

false

, the deleted rows are set as invisible with the
current set of rows.

Standard rowset implementations may choose to restrict this behavior
for security considerations or for certain deployment
scenarios. This is left as implementation-defined and does not
represent standard behavior.

**Parameters:** b

-

true

if deleted rows should be shown;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a rowset implementation is unable to
to reset whether deleted rows should be visible
**See Also:** getShowDeleted()

- getRowSetWarnings

```java
RowSetWarning
getRowSetWarnings()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves the first warning reported by calls on this

JdbcRowSet

object.
If a second warning was reported on this

JdbcRowSet

object,
it will be chained to the first warning and can be retrieved by
calling the method

RowSetWarning.getNextWarning

on the
first warning. Subsequent warnings on this

JdbcRowSet

object will be chained to the

Method Detail

- getShowDeleted

```java
boolean getShowDeleted()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves a

boolean

indicating whether rows marked
for deletion appear in the set of current rows. If

true

is
returned, deleted rows are visible with the current rows. If

false

is returned, rows are not visible with the set of
current rows. The default value is

false

.

Standard rowset implementations may choose to restrict this behavior
for security considerations or for certain deployment
scenarios. The visibility of deleted rows is implementation-defined
and does not represent standard behavior.

Note: Allowing deleted rows to remain visible complicates the behavior
of some standard JDBC

RowSet

implementations methods.
However, most rowset users can simply ignore this extra detail because
only very specialized applications will likely want to take advantage of
this feature.

**Returns:** true

if deleted rows are visible;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a rowset implementation is unable to
to determine whether rows marked for deletion remain visible

to the given

boolean

value. This property determines whether
rows marked for deletion continue to appear in the set of current rows.
If the value is set to

true

, deleted rows are immediately
visible with the set of current rows. If the value is set to

false

, the deleted rows are set as invisible with the
current set of rows.

Standard rowset implementations may choose to restrict this behavior
