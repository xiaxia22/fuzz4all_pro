### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
ForkJoinTask<V>

extends
Object

implements
Future
<V>,
Serializable
```

Abstract base class for tasks that run within a

ForkJoinPool

.
A

ForkJoinTask

is a thread-like entity that is much
lighter weight than a normal thread. Huge numbers of tasks and
subtasks may be hosted by a small number of actual threads in a
ForkJoinPool, at the price of some usage limitations.

A "main"

ForkJoinTask

begins execution when it is
explicitly submitted to a

ForkJoinPool

, or, if not already
engaged in a ForkJoin computation, commenced in the

ForkJoinPool.commonPool()

via

fork()

,

invoke()

, or
related methods. Once started, it will usually in turn start other
subtasks. As indicated by the name of this class, many programs
using

ForkJoinTask

employ only methods

fork()

and

join()

, or derivatives such as

invokeAll

. However, this class also
provides a number of other methods that can come into play in
advanced usages, as well as extension mechanics that allow support
of new forms of fork/join processing.

A

ForkJoinTask

is a lightweight form of

Future

.
The efficiency of

ForkJoinTask

s stems from a set of
restrictions (that are only partially statically enforceable)
reflecting their main use as computational tasks calculating pure
functions or operating on purely isolated objects. The primary
coordination mechanisms are

fork()

, that arranges
asynchronous execution, and

join()

, that doesn't proceed
until the task's result has been computed. Computations should
ideally avoid

synchronized

methods or blocks, and should
minimize other blocking synchronization apart from joining other
tasks or using synchronizers such as Phasers that are advertised to
cooperate with fork/join scheduling. Subdividable tasks should also
not perform blocking I/O, and should ideally access variables that
are completely independent of those accessed by other running
tasks. These guidelines are loosely enforced by not permitting
checked exceptions such as

IOExceptions

to be
thrown. However, computations may still encounter unchecked
exceptions, that are rethrown to callers attempting to join
them. These exceptions may additionally include

RejectedExecutionException

stemming from internal resource
exhaustion, such as failure to allocate internal task
queues. Rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as regular
exceptions, but, when possible, contain stack traces (as displayed
for example using

ex.printStackTrace()

) of both the thread
that initiated the computation as well as the thread actually
encountering the exception; minimally only the latter.

It is possible to define and use ForkJoinTasks that may block,
but doing so requires three further considerations: (1) Completion
of few if any

other

tasks should be dependent on a task
that blocks on external synchronization or I/O. Event-style async
tasks that are never joined (for example, those subclassing

CountedCompleter

) often fall into this category. (2) To minimize
resource impact, tasks should be small; ideally performing only the
(possibly) blocking action. (3) Unless the

ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker

API is used, or the number of possibly
blocked tasks is known to be less than the pool's

ForkJoinPool.getParallelism()

level, the pool cannot guarantee that
enough threads will be available to ensure progress or good
performance.

The primary method for awaiting completion and extracting
results of a task is

join()

, but there are several variants:
The

Future.get()

methods support interruptible and/or timed
waits for completion and report results using

Future

conventions. Method

invoke()

is semantically
equivalent to

fork(); join()

but always attempts to begin
execution in the current thread. The "

quiet

" forms of
these methods do not extract results or report exceptions. These
may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed, and you need
to delay processing of results or exceptions until all complete.
Method

invokeAll

(available in multiple versions)
performs the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set
of tasks and joining them all.

In the most typical usages, a fork-join pair act like a call
(fork) and return (join) from a parallel recursive function. As is
the case with other forms of recursive calls, returns (joins)
should be performed innermost-first. For example,

a.fork();
b.fork(); b.join(); a.join();

is likely to be substantially more
efficient than joining

a

before

b

.

The execution status of tasks may be queried at several levels
of detail:

Future.isDone()

is true if a task completed in any way
(including the case where a task was cancelled without executing);

isCompletedNormally()

is true if a task completed without
cancellation or encountering an exception;

Future.isCancelled()

is
true if the task was cancelled (in which case

getException()

returns a

CancellationException

); and

isCompletedAbnormally()

is true if a task was either
cancelled or encountered an exception, in which case

getException()

will return either the encountered exception or

CancellationException

.

The ForkJoinTask class is not usually directly subclassed.
Instead, you subclass one of the abstract classes that support a
particular style of fork/join processing, typically

RecursiveAction

for most computations that do not return results,

RecursiveTask

for those that do, and

CountedCompleter

for those in which completed actions trigger
other actions. Normally, a concrete ForkJoinTask subclass declares
fields comprising its parameters, established in a constructor, and
then defines a

compute

method that somehow uses the control
methods supplied by this base class.

Method

join()

and its variants are appropriate for use
only when completion dependencies are acyclic; that is, the
parallel computation can be described as a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Otherwise, executions may encounter a form of deadlock as
tasks cyclically wait for each other. However, this framework
supports other methods and techniques (for example the use of

Phaser

,

helpQuiesce()

, and

complete(V)

) that
may be of use in constructing custom subclasses for problems that
are not statically structured as DAGs. To support such usages, a
ForkJoinTask may be atomically

tagged

with a

short

value using

setForkJoinTaskTag(short)

or

compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag(short, short)

and checked using

getForkJoinTaskTag()

. The ForkJoinTask implementation does not use
these

protected

methods or tags for any purpose, but they
may be of use in the construction of specialized subclasses. For
example, parallel graph traversals can use the supplied methods to
avoid revisiting nodes/tasks that have already been processed.
(Method names for tagging are bulky in part to encourage definition
of methods that reflect their usage patterns.)

Most base support methods are

final

, to prevent
overriding of implementations that are intrinsically tied to the
underlying lightweight task scheduling framework. Developers
creating new basic styles of fork/join processing should minimally
implement

protected

methods

exec()

,

setRawResult(V)

, and

getRawResult()

, while also introducing
an abstract computational method that can be implemented in its
subclasses, possibly relying on other

protected

methods
provided by this class.

ForkJoinTasks should perform relatively small amounts of
computation. Large tasks should be split into smaller subtasks,
usually via recursive decomposition. As a very rough rule of thumb,
a task should perform more than 100 and less than 10000 basic
computational steps, and should avoid indefinite looping. If tasks
are too big, then parallelism cannot improve throughput. If too
small, then memory and internal task maintenance overhead may
overwhelm processing.

This class provides

adapt

methods for

Runnable

and

Callable

, that may be of use when mixing execution of

ForkJoinTasks

with other kinds of tasks. When all tasks are
of this form, consider using a pool constructed in

asyncMode

.

ForkJoinTasks are

Serializable

, which enables them to be
used in extensions such as remote execution frameworks. It is
sensible to serialize tasks only before or after, but not during,
execution. Serialization is not relied on during execution itself.

### Constructor Details

#### public ForkJoinTask()

*No description found.*

---

### Method Details

#### public final
ForkJoinTask
<
V
> fork()

Arranges to asynchronously execute this task in the pool the
current task is running in, if applicable, or using the

ForkJoinPool.commonPool()

if not

inForkJoinPool()

. While
it is not necessarily enforced, it is a usage error to fork a
task more than once unless it has completed and been
reinitialized. Subsequent modifications to the state of this
task or any data it operates on are not necessarily
consistently observable by any thread other than the one
executing it unless preceded by a call to

join()

or
related methods, or a call to

Future.isDone()

returning

true

.

**Returns:**
- this

, to simplify usage

---

#### public final
V
join()

Returns the result of the computation when it

is done

.
This method differs from

get()

in that abnormal
completion results in

RuntimeException

or

Error

,
not

ExecutionException

, and that interrupts of the
calling thread do

not

cause the method to abruptly
return by throwing

InterruptedException

.

**Returns:**
- the computed result

---

#### public final
V
invoke()

Commences performing this task, awaits its completion if
necessary, and returns its result, or throws an (unchecked)

RuntimeException

or

Error

if the underlying
computation did so.

**Returns:**
- the computed result

---

#### public static void invokeAll​(
ForkJoinTask
<?> t1,

ForkJoinTask
<?> t2)

Forks the given tasks, returning when

isDone

holds for
each task or an (unchecked) exception is encountered, in which
case the exception is rethrown. If more than one task
encounters an exception, then this method throws any one of
these exceptions. If any task encounters an exception, the
other may be cancelled. However, the execution status of
individual tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional return. The
status of each task may be obtained using

getException()

and related methods to check if they have been
cancelled, completed normally or exceptionally, or left
unprocessed.

**Parameters:**
- t1

- the first task
- t2

- the second task

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if any task is null

---

#### public static void invokeAll​(
ForkJoinTask
<?>... tasks)

Forks the given tasks, returning when

isDone

holds for
each task or an (unchecked) exception is encountered, in which
case the exception is rethrown. If more than one task
encounters an exception, then this method throws any one of
these exceptions. If any task encounters an exception, others
may be cancelled. However, the execution status of individual
tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional return. The status of
each task may be obtained using

getException()

and
related methods to check if they have been cancelled, completed
normally or exceptionally, or left unprocessed.

**Parameters:**
- tasks

- the tasks

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if any task is null

---

#### public static <T extends
ForkJoinTask
<?>>
Collection
<T> invokeAll​(
Collection
<T> tasks)

Forks all tasks in the specified collection, returning when

isDone

holds for each task or an (unchecked) exception
is encountered, in which case the exception is rethrown. If
more than one task encounters an exception, then this method
throws any one of these exceptions. If any task encounters an
exception, others may be cancelled. However, the execution
status of individual tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional
return. The status of each task may be obtained using

getException()

and related methods to check if they have been
cancelled, completed normally or exceptionally, or left
unprocessed.

**Parameters:**
- tasks

- the collection of tasks

**Returns:**
- the tasks argument, to simplify usage

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if tasks or any element are null

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the type of the values returned from the tasks

---

#### public boolean cancel​(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)

Attempts to cancel execution of this task. This attempt will
fail if the task has already completed or could not be
cancelled for some other reason. If successful, and this task
has not started when

cancel

is called, execution of
this task is suppressed. After this method returns
successfully, unless there is an intervening call to

reinitialize()

, subsequent calls to

Future.isCancelled()

,

Future.isDone()

, and

cancel

will return

true

and calls to

join()

and related methods will result in

CancellationException

.

This method may be overridden in subclasses, but if so, must
still ensure that these properties hold. In particular, the

cancel

method itself must not throw exceptions.

This method is designed to be invoked by

other

tasks. To terminate the current task, you can just return or
throw an unchecked exception from its computation method, or
invoke

completeExceptionally(Throwable)

.

**Specified by:**
- cancel

in interface

Future

<

V

>

**Parameters:**
- mayInterruptIfRunning

- this value has no effect in the
default implementation because interrupts are not used to
control cancellation.

**Returns:**
- true

if this task is now cancelled

---

#### public final boolean isCompletedAbnormally()

Returns

true

if this task threw an exception or was cancelled.

**Returns:**
- true

if this task threw an exception or was cancelled

---

#### public final boolean isCompletedNormally()

Returns

true

if this task completed without throwing an
exception and was not cancelled.

**Returns:**
- true

if this task completed without throwing an
exception and was not cancelled

---

#### public final
Throwable
getException()

Returns the exception thrown by the base computation, or a

CancellationException

if cancelled, or

null

if
none or if the method has not yet completed.

**Returns:**
- the exception, or

null

if none

---

#### public void completeExceptionally​(
Throwable
ex)

Completes this task abnormally, and if not already aborted or
cancelled, causes it to throw the given exception upon

join

and related operations. This method may be used
to induce exceptions in asynchronous tasks, or to force
completion of tasks that would not otherwise complete. Its use
in other situations is discouraged. This method is
overridable, but overridden versions must invoke

super

implementation to maintain guarantees.

**Parameters:**
- ex

- the exception to throw. If this exception is not a

RuntimeException

or

Error

, the actual exception
thrown will be a

RuntimeException

with cause

ex

.

---

#### public void complete​(
V
value)

Completes this task, and if not already aborted or cancelled,
returning the given value as the result of subsequent
invocations of

join

and related operations. This method
may be used to provide results for asynchronous tasks, or to
provide alternative handling for tasks that would not otherwise
complete normally. Its use in other situations is
discouraged. This method is overridable, but overridden
versions must invoke

super

implementation to maintain
guarantees.

**Parameters:**
- value

- the result value for this task

---

#### public final void quietlyComplete()

Completes this task normally without setting a value. The most
recent value established by

setRawResult(V)

(or

null

by default) will be returned as the result of subsequent
invocations of

join

and related operations.

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public final
V
get()
throws
InterruptedException
,

ExecutionException

Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then
retrieves its result.

**Specified by:**
- get

in interface

Future

<

V

>

**Returns:**
- the computed result

**Throws:**
- CancellationException

- if the computation was cancelled
- ExecutionException

- if the computation threw an
exception
- InterruptedException

- if the current thread is not a
member of a ForkJoinPool and was interrupted while waiting

---

#### public final
V
get​(long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException
,

ExecutionException
,

TimeoutException

Waits if necessary for at most the given time for the computation
to complete, and then retrieves its result, if available.

**Specified by:**
- get

in interface

Future

<

V

>

**Parameters:**
- timeout

- the maximum time to wait
- unit

- the time unit of the timeout argument

**Returns:**
- the computed result

**Throws:**
- CancellationException

- if the computation was cancelled
- ExecutionException

- if the computation threw an
exception
- InterruptedException

- if the current thread is not a
member of a ForkJoinPool and was interrupted while waiting
- TimeoutException

- if the wait timed out

---

#### public final void quietlyJoin()

Joins this task, without returning its result or throwing its
exception. This method may be useful when processing
collections of tasks when some have been cancelled or otherwise
known to have aborted.

---

#### public final void quietlyInvoke()

Commences performing this task and awaits its completion if
necessary, without returning its result or throwing its
exception.

---

#### public static void helpQuiesce()

Possibly executes tasks until the pool hosting the current task

is quiescent

. This
method may be of use in designs in which many tasks are forked,
but none are explicitly joined, instead executing them until
all are processed.

---

#### public void reinitialize()

Resets the internal bookkeeping state of this task, allowing a
subsequent

fork

. This method allows repeated reuse of
this task, but only if reuse occurs when this task has either
never been forked, or has been forked, then completed and all
outstanding joins of this task have also completed. Effects
under any other usage conditions are not guaranteed.
This method may be useful when executing
pre-constructed trees of subtasks in loops.

Upon completion of this method,

isDone()

reports

false

, and

getException()

reports

null

. However, the value returned by

getRawResult

is
unaffected. To clear this value, you can invoke

setRawResult(null)

.

---

#### public static
ForkJoinPool
getPool()

Returns the pool hosting the current thread, or

null

if the current thread is executing outside of any ForkJoinPool.

This method returns

null

if and only if

inForkJoinPool()

returns

false

.

**Returns:**
- the pool, or

null

if none

---

#### public static boolean inForkJoinPool()

Returns

true

if the current thread is a

ForkJoinWorkerThread

executing as a ForkJoinPool computation.

**Returns:**
- true

if the current thread is a

ForkJoinWorkerThread

executing as a ForkJoinPool computation,
or

false

otherwise

---

#### public boolean tryUnfork()

Tries to unschedule this task for execution. This method will
typically (but is not guaranteed to) succeed if this task is
the most recently forked task by the current thread, and has
not commenced executing in another thread. This method may be
useful when arranging alternative local processing of tasks
that could have been, but were not, stolen.

**Returns:**
- true

if unforked

---

#### public static int getQueuedTaskCount()

Returns an estimate of the number of tasks that have been
forked by the current worker thread but not yet executed. This
value may be useful for heuristic decisions about whether to
fork other tasks.

**Returns:**
- the number of tasks

---

#### public static int getSurplusQueuedTaskCount()

Returns an estimate of how many more locally queued tasks are
held by the current worker thread than there are other worker
threads that might steal them, or zero if this thread is not
operating in a ForkJoinPool. This value may be useful for
heuristic decisions about whether to fork other tasks. In many
usages of ForkJoinTasks, at steady state, each worker should
aim to maintain a small constant surplus (for example, 3) of
tasks, and to process computations locally if this threshold is
exceeded.

**Returns:**
- the surplus number of tasks, which may be negative

---

#### public abstract
V
getRawResult()

Returns the result that would be returned by

join()

, even
if this task completed abnormally, or

null

if this task
is not known to have been completed. This method is designed
to aid debugging, as well as to support extensions. Its use in
any other context is discouraged.

**Returns:**
- the result, or

null

if not completed

---

#### protected abstract void setRawResult​(
V
value)

Forces the given value to be returned as a result. This method
is designed to support extensions, and should not in general be
called otherwise.

**Parameters:**
- value

- the value

---

#### protected abstract boolean exec()

Immediately performs the base action of this task and returns
true if, upon return from this method, this task is guaranteed
to have completed normally. This method may return false
otherwise, to indicate that this task is not necessarily
complete (or is not known to be complete), for example in
asynchronous actions that require explicit invocations of
completion methods. This method may also throw an (unchecked)
exception to indicate abnormal exit. This method is designed to
support extensions, and should not in general be called
otherwise.

**Returns:**
- true

if this task is known to have completed normally

---

#### protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> peekNextLocalTask()

Returns, but does not unschedule or execute, a task queued by
the current thread but not yet executed, if one is immediately
available. There is no guarantee that this task will actually
be polled or executed next. Conversely, this method may return
null even if a task exists but cannot be accessed without
contention with other threads. This method is designed
primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
otherwise.

**Returns:**
- the next task, or

null

if none are available

---

#### protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> pollNextLocalTask()

Unschedules and returns, without executing, the next task
queued by the current thread but not yet executed, if the
current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool. This method is
designed primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be
useful otherwise.

**Returns:**
- the next task, or

null

if none are available

---

#### protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> pollTask()

If the current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool,
unschedules and returns, without executing, the next task
queued by the current thread but not yet executed, if one is
available, or if not available, a task that was forked by some
other thread, if available. Availability may be transient, so a

null

result does not necessarily imply quiescence of
the pool this task is operating in. This method is designed
primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
otherwise.

**Returns:**
- a task, or

null

if none are available

---

#### protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> pollSubmission()

If the current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool,
unschedules and returns, without executing, a task externally
submitted to the pool, if one is available. Availability may be
transient, so a

null

result does not necessarily imply
quiescence of the pool. This method is designed primarily to
support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful otherwise.

**Returns:**
- a task, or

null

if none are available

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public final short getForkJoinTaskTag()

Returns the tag for this task.

**Returns:**
- the tag for this task

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public final short setForkJoinTaskTag​(short newValue)

Atomically sets the tag value for this task and returns the old value.

**Parameters:**
- newValue

- the new tag value

**Returns:**
- the previous value of the tag

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public final boolean compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag​(short expect,
short update)

Atomically conditionally sets the tag value for this task.
Among other applications, tags can be used as visit markers
in tasks operating on graphs, as in methods that check:

if (task.compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag((short)0, (short)1))

before processing, otherwise exiting because the node has
already been visited.

**Parameters:**
- expect

- the expected tag value
- update

- the new tag value

**Returns:**
- true

if successful; i.e., the current value was
equal to

expect

and was changed to

update

.

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public static
ForkJoinTask
<?> adapt​(
Runnable
runnable)

Returns a new

ForkJoinTask

that performs the

run

method of the given

Runnable

as its action, and returns
a null result upon

join()

.

**Parameters:**
- runnable

- the runnable action

**Returns:**
- the task

---

#### public static <T>
ForkJoinTask
<T> adapt​(
Runnable
runnable,
T result)

Returns a new

ForkJoinTask

that performs the

run

method of the given

Runnable

as its action, and returns
the given result upon

join()

.

ForkJoinTask
<T> adapt​(
Callable
<? extends T> callable)

encountered into

RuntimeException

.

**Parameters:**
- callable

- the callable action

**Returns:**
- the task

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the type of the callable's result

Abstract base class for tasks that run within a

ForkJoinPool

.
A

ForkJoinTask

is a thread-like entity that is much
lighter weight than a normal thread. Huge numbers of tasks and
subtasks may be hosted by a small number of actual threads in a
ForkJoinPool, at the price of some usage limitations.

A "main"

ForkJoinTask

begins execution when it is
explicitly submitted to a

ForkJoinPool

, or, if not already
engaged in a ForkJoin computation, commenced in the

ForkJoinPool.commonPool()

via

fork()

,

invoke()

, or
related methods. Once started, it will usually in turn start other
subtasks. As indicated by the name of this class, many programs
using

ForkJoinTask

employ only methods

fork()

and

join()

, or derivatives such as

invokeAll

. However, this class also
provides a number of other methods that can come into play in
advanced usages, as well as extension mechanics that allow support
of new forms of fork/join processing.

A

ForkJoinTask

is a lightweight form of

Future

.
The efficiency of

ForkJoinTask

s stems from a set of
restrictions (that are only partially statically enforceable)
reflecting their main use as computational tasks calculating pure
functions or operating on purely isolated objects. The primary
coordination mechanisms are

fork()

, that arranges
asynchronous execution, and

join()

, that doesn't proceed
until the task's result has been computed. Computations should
ideally avoid

synchronized

methods or blocks, and should
minimize other blocking synchronization apart from joining other
tasks or using synchronizers such as Phasers that are advertised to
cooperate with fork/join scheduling. Subdividable tasks should also
not perform blocking I/O, and should ideally access variables that
are completely independent of those accessed by other running
tasks. These guidelines are loosely enforced by not permitting
checked exceptions such as

IOExceptions

to be
thrown. However, computations may still encounter unchecked
exceptions, that are rethrown to callers attempting to join
them. These exceptions may additionally include

RejectedExecutionException

stemming from internal resource
exhaustion, such as failure to allocate internal task
queues. Rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as regular
exceptions, but, when possible, contain stack traces (as displayed
for example using

ex.printStackTrace()

) of both the thread
that initiated the computation as well as the thread actually
encountering the exception; minimally only the latter.

It is possible to define and use ForkJoinTasks that may block,
but doing so requires three further considerations: (1) Completion
of few if any

other

tasks should be dependent on a task
that blocks on external synchronization or I/O. Event-style async
tasks that are never joined (for example, those subclassing

CountedCompleter

) often fall into this category. (2) To minimize
resource impact, tasks should be small; ideally performing only the
(possibly) blocking action. (3) Unless the

ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker

API is used, or the number of possibly
blocked tasks is known to be less than the pool's

ForkJoinPool.getParallelism()

level, the pool cannot guarantee that
enough threads will be available to ensure progress or good
performance.

The primary method for awaiting completion and extracting
results of a task is

join()

, but there are several variants:
The

Future.get()

methods support interruptible and/or timed
waits for completion and report results using

Future

conventions. Method

invoke()

is semantically
equivalent to

fork(); join()

but always attempts to begin
execution in the current thread. The "

quiet

" forms of
these methods do not extract results or report exceptions. These
may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed, and you need
to delay processing of results or exceptions until all complete.
Method

invokeAll

(available in multiple versions)
performs the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set
of tasks and joining them all.

In the most typical usages, a fork-join pair act like a call
(fork) and return (join) from a parallel recursive function. As is
the case with other forms of recursive calls, returns (joins)
should be performed innermost-first. For example,

a.fork();
b.fork(); b.join(); a.join();

is likely to be substantially more
efficient than joining

a

before

b

.

The execution status of tasks may be queried at several levels
of detail:

Future.isDone()

is true if a task completed in any way
(including the case where a task was cancelled without executing);

isCompletedNormally()

is true if a task completed without
cancellation or encountering an exception;

Future.isCancelled()

is
true if the task was cancelled (in which case

getException()

returns a

CancellationException

); and

isCompletedAbnormally()

is true if a task was either
cancelled or encountered an exception, in which case

getException()

will return either the encountered exception or

CancellationException

.

The ForkJoinTask class is not usually directly subclassed.
Instead, you subclass one of the abstract classes that support a
particular style of fork/join processing, typically

RecursiveAction

for most computations that do not return results,

RecursiveTask

for those that do, and

CountedCompleter

for those in which completed actions trigger
other actions. Normally, a concrete ForkJoinTask subclass declares
fields comprising its parameters, established in a constructor, and
then defines a

compute

method that somehow uses the control
methods supplied by this base class.

Method

join()

and its variants are appropriate for use
only when completion dependencies are acyclic; that is, the
parallel computation can be described as a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Otherwise, executions may encounter a form of deadlock as
tasks cyclically wait for each other. However, this framework
supports other methods and techniques (for example the use of

Phaser

,

helpQuiesce()

, and

complete(V)

) that
may be of use in constructing custom subclasses for problems that
are not statically structured as DAGs. To support such usages, a
ForkJoinTask may be atomically

tagged

with a

short

value using

setForkJoinTaskTag(short)

or

compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag(short, short)

and checked using

getForkJoinTaskTag()

. The ForkJoinTask implementation does not use
these

protected

methods or tags for any purpose, but they
may be of use in the construction of specialized subclasses. For
example, parallel graph traversals can use the supplied methods to
avoid revisiting nodes/tasks that have already been processed.
(Method names for tagging are bulky in part to encourage definition
of methods that reflect their usage patterns.)

Most base support methods are

final

, to prevent
overriding of implementations that are intrinsically tied to the
underlying lightweight task scheduling framework. Developers
creating new basic styles of fork/join processing should minimally
implement

protected

methods

exec()

,

setRawResult(V)

, and

getRawResult()

, while also introducing
an abstract computational method that can be implemented in its
subclasses, possibly relying on other

protected

methods
provided by this class.

ForkJoinTasks should perform relatively small amounts of
computation. Large tasks should be split into smaller subtasks,
usually via recursive decomposition. As a very rough rule of thumb,
a task should perform more than 100 and less than 10000 basic
computational steps, and should avoid indefinite looping. If tasks
are too big, then parallelism cannot improve throughput. If too
small, then memory and internal task maintenance overhead may
overwhelm processing.

This class provides

adapt

methods for

Runnable

and

Callable

, that may be of use when mixing execution of

ForkJoinTasks

with other kinds of tasks. When all tasks are
of this form, consider using a pool constructed in

asyncMode

.

ForkJoinTasks are

Serializable

, which enables them to be
used in extensions such as remote execution frameworks. It is
sensible to serialize tasks only before or after, but not during,
execution. Serialization is not relied on during execution itself.

ForkJoinTask<V>

<V>,

Serializable

Abstract base class for tasks that run within a

ForkJoinPool

.
A

ForkJoinTask

is a thread-like entity that is much
lighter weight than a normal thread. Huge numbers of tasks and
subtasks may be hosted by a small number of actual threads in a
ForkJoinPool, at the price of some usage limitations.

A "main"

ForkJoinTask

begins execution when it is
explicitly submitted to a

ForkJoinPool

, or, if not already
engaged in a ForkJoin computation, commenced in the

ForkJoinPool.commonPool()

via

fork()

,

invoke()

, or
related methods. Once started, it will usually in turn start other
subtasks. As indicated by the name of this class, many programs
using

ForkJoinTask

employ only methods

fork()

and

join()

, or derivatives such as

invokeAll

. However, this class also
provides a number of other methods that can come into play in
advanced usages, as well as extension mechanics that allow support
of new forms of fork/join processing.

A

ForkJoinTask

is a lightweight form of

Future

.
The efficiency of

ForkJoinTask

s stems from a set of
restrictions (that are only partially statically enforceable)
reflecting their main use as computational tasks calculating pure
functions or operating on purely isolated objects. The primary
coordination mechanisms are

fork()

, that arranges
asynchronous execution, and

join()

, that doesn't proceed
until the task's result has been computed. Computations should
ideally avoid

synchronized

methods or blocks, and should
minimize other blocking synchronization apart from joining other
tasks or using synchronizers such as Phasers that are advertised to
cooperate with fork/join scheduling. Subdividable tasks should also
not perform blocking I/O, and should ideally access variables that
are completely independent of those accessed by other running
tasks. These guidelines are loosely enforced by not permitting
checked exceptions such as

IOExceptions

to be
thrown. However, computations may still encounter unchecked
exceptions, that are rethrown to callers attempting to join
them. These exceptions may additionally include

RejectedExecutionException

stemming from internal resource
exhaustion, such as failure to allocate internal task
queues. Rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as regular
exceptions, but, when possible, contain stack traces (as displayed
for example using

ex.printStackTrace()

) of both the thread
that initiated the computation as well as the thread actually
encountering the exception; minimally only the latter.

It is possible to define and use ForkJoinTasks that may block,
but doing so requires three further considerations: (1) Completion
of few if any

other

tasks should be dependent on a task
that blocks on external synchronization or I/O. Event-style async
tasks that are never joined (for example, those subclassing

CountedCompleter

) often fall into this category. (2) To minimize
resource impact, tasks should be small; ideally performing only the
(possibly) blocking action. (3) Unless the

ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker

API is used, or the number of possibly
blocked tasks is known to be less than the pool's

ForkJoinPool.getParallelism()

level, the pool cannot guarantee that
enough threads will be available to ensure progress or good
performance.

The primary method for awaiting completion and extracting
results of a task is

join()

, but there are several variants:
The

Future.get()

methods support interruptible and/or timed
waits for completion and report results using

Future

conventions. Method

invoke()

is semantically
equivalent to

fork(); join()

but always attempts to begin
execution in the current thread. The "

quiet

" forms of
these methods do not extract results or report exceptions. These
may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed, and you need
to delay processing of results or exceptions until all complete.
Method

invokeAll

(available in multiple versions)
performs the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set
of tasks and joining them all.

In the most typical usages, a fork-join pair act like a call
(fork) and return (join) from a parallel recursive function. As is
the case with other forms of recursive calls, returns (joins)
should be performed innermost-first. For example,

a.fork();
b.fork(); b.join(); a.join();

is likely to be substantially more
efficient than joining

a

before

b

.

overwhelm processing.

This class provides

adapt

methods for

Runnable

and

Callable

, that may be of use when mixing execution of

ForkJoinTasks

with other kinds of tasks. When all tasks are
of this form, consider using a pool constructed in

asyncMode

.

ForkJoinTasks are

Serializable

, which enables them to be
used in extensions such as remote execution frameworks. It is
sensible to serialize tasks only before or after, but not during,
execution. Serialization is not relied on during execution itself.

The primary method for awaiting completion and extracting
results of a task is

join()

, but there are several variants:
The

Future.get()

methods support interruptible and/or timed
waits for completion and report results using

Future

conventions. Method

invoke()

is semantically
equivalent to

fork(); join()

but always attempts to begin
execution in the current thread. The "

quiet

" forms of
these methods do not extract results or report exceptions. These
may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed, and you need
to delay processing of results or exceptions until all complete.
Method

invokeAll

(available in multiple versions)
performs the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set
of tasks and joining them all.

In the most typical usages, a fork-join pair act like a call
(fork) and return (join) from a parallel recursive function. As is
the case with other forms of recursive calls, returns (joins)
should be performed innermost-first. For example,

a.fork();
b.fork(); b.join(); a.join();

is likely to be substantially more
efficient than joining

a

before

b

.

The execution status of tasks may be queried at several levels
of detail:

Future.isDone()

is true if a task completed in any way
(including the case where a task was cancelled without executing);

isCompletedNormally()

is true if a task completed without
cancellation or encountering an exception;

Future.isCancelled()

is
true if the task was cancelled (in which case

getException()

returns a

CancellationException

); and

isCompletedAbnormally()

is true if a task was either
cancelled or encountered an exception, in which case

getException()

will return either the encountered exception or

CancellationException

.

The ForkJoinTask class is not usually directly subclassed.
Instead, you subclass one of the abstract classes that support a
particular style of fork/join processing, typically

RecursiveAction

for most computations that do not return results,

RecursiveTask

for those that do, and

CountedCompleter

for those in which completed actions trigger
other actions. Normally, a concrete ForkJoinTask subclass declares
fields comprising its parameters, established in a constructor, and
then defines a

compute

method that somehow uses the control
methods supplied by this base class.

Method

join()

and its variants are appropriate for use
only when completion dependencies are acyclic; that is, the
parallel computation can be described as a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Otherwise, executions may encounter a form of deadlock as
tasks cyclically wait for each other. However, this framework
supports other methods and techniques (for example the use of

Phaser

,

helpQuiesce()

, and

complete(V)

) that
may be of use in constructing custom subclasses for problems that
are not statically structured as DAGs. To support such usages, a
ForkJoinTask may be atomically

tagged

with a

short

value using

setForkJoinTaskTag(short)

or

compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag(short, short)

and checked using

getForkJoinTaskTag()

. The ForkJoinTask implementation does not use
these

protected

methods or tags for any purpose, but they
may be of use in the construction of specialized subclasses. For
example, parallel graph traversals can use the supplied methods to
avoid revisiting nodes/tasks that have already been processed.
(Method names for tagging are bulky in part to encourage definition
of methods that reflect their usage patterns.)

Most base support methods are

final

, to prevent
overriding of implementations that are intrinsically tied to the
underlying lightweight task scheduling framework. Developers
creating new basic styles of fork/join processing should minimally
implement

protected

methods

exec()

,

setRawResult(V)

, and

getRawResult()

, while also introducing
an abstract computational method that can be implemented in its
subclasses, possibly relying on other

protected

methods
provided by this class.

ForkJoinTasks should perform relatively small amounts of
computation. Large tasks should be split into smaller subtasks,
usually via recursive decomposition. As a very rough rule of thumb,
a task should perform more than 100 and less than 10000 basic
computational steps, and should avoid indefinite looping. If tasks
are too big, then parallelism cannot improve throughput. If too
small, then memory and internal task maintenance overhead may
overwhelm processing.

- ForkJoinTask

```java
public ForkJoinTask()
```

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- fork

```java
public final
ForkJoinTask
<
V
> fork()
```

Arranges to asynchronously execute this task in the pool the
current task is running in, if applicable, or using the

ForkJoinPool.commonPool()

if not

inForkJoinPool()

. While
it is not necessarily enforced, it is a usage error to fork a
task more than once unless it has completed and been
reinitialized. Subsequent modifications to the state of this
task or any data it operates on are not necessarily
consistently observable by any thread other than the one
executing it unless preceded by a call to

join()

or
related methods, or a call to

Future.isDone()

returning

true

.

**Returns:** this

, to simplify usage

- join

```java
public final
V
join()
```

Returns the result of the computation when it

is done

.
This method differs from

get()

in that abnormal
completion results in

RuntimeException

or

Error

,
not

ExecutionException

, and that interrupts of the
calling thread do

not

cause the method to abruptly
return by throwing

InterruptedException

.

**Returns:** the computed result

- invoke

```java
public final
V
invoke()
```

Commences performing this task, awaits its completion if
necessary, and returns its result, or throws an (unchecked)

RuntimeException

or

Error

if the underlying
computation did so.

**Returns:** the computed result

- invokeAll

```java
public static void invokeAll​(
ForkJoinTask
<?> t1,

ForkJoinTask
<?> t2)
```

Forks the given tasks, returning when

isDone

holds for
each task or an (unchecked) exception is encountered, in which
case the exception is rethrown. If more than one task
encounters an exception, then this method throws any one of
these exceptions. If any task encounters an exception, the
other may be cancelled. However, the execution status of
individual tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional return. The
status of each task may be obtained using

getException()

and related methods to check if they have been
cancelled, completed normally or exceptionally, or left
unprocessed.

**Parameters:** t1

- the first task
**Parameters:** t2

- the second task
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any task is null

- invokeAll

```java
public static void invokeAll​(
ForkJoinTask
<?>... tasks)
```

Forks the given tasks, returning when

isDone

holds for
each task or an (unchecked) exception is encountered, in which
case the exception is rethrown. If more than one task
encounters an exception, then this method throws any one of
these exceptions. If any task encounters an exception, others
may be cancelled. However, the execution status of individual
tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional return. The status of
each task may be obtained using

getException()

and
related methods to check if they have been cancelled, completed
normally or exceptionally, or left unprocessed.

**Parameters:** tasks

- the tasks
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any task is null

- invokeAll

```java
public static <T extends
ForkJoinTask
<?>>
Collection
<T> invokeAll​(
Collection
<T> tasks)
```

Forks all tasks in the specified collection, returning when

isDone

holds for each task or an (unchecked) exception
is encountered, in which case the exception is rethrown. If
more than one task encounters an exception, then this method
throws any one of these exceptions. If any task encounters an
exception, others may be cancelled. However, the execution
status of individual tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional
return. The status of each task may be obtained using

getException()

and related methods to check if they have been
cancelled, completed normally or exceptionally, or left
unprocessed.

**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the values returned from the tasks
**Parameters:** tasks

- the collection of tasks
**Returns:** the tasks argument, to simplify usage
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if tasks or any element are null

- cancel

```java
public boolean cancel​(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)
```

Attempts to cancel execution of this task. This attempt will
fail if the task has already completed or could not be
cancelled for some other reason. If successful, and this task
has not started when

cancel

is called, execution of
this task is suppressed. After this method returns
successfully, unless there is an intervening call to

reinitialize()

, subsequent calls to

Future.isCancelled()

,

Future.isDone()

, and

cancel

will return

true

and calls to

join()

and related methods will result in

CancellationException

.

This method may be overridden in subclasses, but if so, must
still ensure that these properties hold. In particular, the

cancel

method itself must not throw exceptions.

This method is designed to be invoked by

other

tasks. To terminate the current task, you can just return or
throw an unchecked exception from its computation method, or
invoke

completeExceptionally(Throwable)

.

**Specified by:** cancel

in interface

Future

<

V

>
**Parameters:** mayInterruptIfRunning

- this value has no effect in the
default implementation because interrupts are not used to
control cancellation.
**Returns:** true

if this task is now cancelled

- isCompletedAbnormally

```java
public final boolean isCompletedAbnormally()
```

Returns

true

if this task threw an exception or was cancelled.

**Returns:** true

if this task threw an exception or was cancelled

- isCompletedNormally

```java
public final boolean isCompletedNormally()
```

Returns

true

if this task completed without throwing an
exception and was not cancelled.

**Returns:** true

if this task completed without throwing an
exception and was not cancelled

- getException

```java
public final
Throwable
getException()
```

Returns the exception thrown by the base computation, or a

CancellationException

if cancelled, or

null

if
none or if the method has not yet completed.

**Returns:** the exception, or

null

if none

- completeExceptionally

```java
public void completeExceptionally​(
Throwable
ex)
```

Completes this task abnormally, and if not already aborted or
cancelled, causes it to throw the given exception upon

join

and related operations. This method may be used
to induce exceptions in asynchronous tasks, or to force
completion of tasks that would not otherwise complete. Its use
in other situations is discouraged. This method is
overridable, but overridden versions must invoke

super

implementation to maintain guarantees.

**Parameters:** ex

- the exception to throw. If this exception is not a

RuntimeException

or

Error

, the actual exception
thrown will be a

RuntimeException

with cause

ex

.

- complete

```java
public void complete​(
V
value)
```

Completes this task, and if not already aborted or cancelled,
returning the given value as the result of subsequent
invocations of

join

and related operations. This method
may be used to provide results for asynchronous tasks, or to
provide alternative handling for tasks that would not otherwise
complete normally. Its use in other situations is
discouraged. This method is overridable, but overridden
versions must invoke

super

implementation to maintain
guarantees.

**Parameters:** value

- the result value for this task

- quietlyComplete

```java
public final void quietlyComplete()
```

Completes this task normally without setting a value. The most
recent value established by

setRawResult(V)

(or

null

by default) will be returned as the result of subsequent
invocations of

join

and related operations.

**Since:** 1.8

- get

```java
public final
V
get()
throws
InterruptedException
,

ExecutionException
```

Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then
retrieves its result.

**Specified by:** get

in interface

Future

<

V

>
**Returns:** the computed result
**Throws:** CancellationException

- if the computation was cancelled
**Throws:** ExecutionException

- if the computation threw an
exception
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if the current thread is not a
member of a ForkJoinPool and was interrupted while waiting

- get

```java
public final
V
get​(long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException
,

ExecutionException
,

TimeoutException
```

Waits if necessary for at most the given time for the computation
to complete, and then retrieves its result, if available.

**Specified by:** get

in interface

Future

<

V

>
**Parameters:** timeout

- the maximum time to wait
**Parameters:** unit

- the time unit of the timeout argument
**Returns:** the computed result
**Throws:** CancellationException

- if the computation was cancelled
**Throws:** ExecutionException

- if the computation threw an
exception
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if the current thread is not a
member of a ForkJoinPool and was interrupted while waiting
**Throws:** TimeoutException

- if the wait timed out

- quietlyJoin

```java
public final void quietlyJoin()
```

Joins this task, without returning its result or throwing its
exception. This method may be useful when processing
collections of tasks when some have been cancelled or otherwise
known to have aborted.

- quietlyInvoke

```java
public final void quietlyInvoke()
```

Commences performing this task and awaits its completion if
necessary, without returning its result or throwing its
exception.

- helpQuiesce

```java
public static void helpQuiesce()
```

Possibly executes tasks until the pool hosting the current task

is quiescent

. This
method may be of use in designs in which many tasks are forked,
but none are explicitly joined, instead executing them until
all are processed.

- reinitialize

```java
public void reinitialize()
```

Resets the internal bookkeeping state of this task, allowing a
subsequent

fork

. This method allows repeated reuse of
this task, but only if reuse occurs when this task has either
never been forked, or has been forked, then completed and all
outstanding joins of this task have also completed. Effects
under any other usage conditions are not guaranteed.
This method may be useful when executing
pre-constructed trees of subtasks in loops.

Upon completion of this method,

isDone()

reports

false

, and

getException()

reports

null

. However, the value returned by

getRawResult

is
unaffected. To clear this value, you can invoke

setRawResult(null)

.

- getPool

```java
public static
ForkJoinPool
getPool()
```

Returns the pool hosting the current thread, or

null

if the current thread is executing outside of any ForkJoinPool.

This method returns

null

if and only if

inForkJoinPool()

returns

false

.

**Returns:** the pool, or

null

if none

- inForkJoinPool

```java
public static boolean inForkJoinPool()
```

Returns

true

if the current thread is a

ForkJoinWorkerThread

executing as a ForkJoinPool computation.

**Returns:** true

if the current thread is a

ForkJoinWorkerThread

executing as a ForkJoinPool computation,
or

false

otherwise

- tryUnfork

```java
public boolean tryUnfork()
```

Tries to unschedule this task for execution. This method will
typically (but is not guaranteed to) succeed if this task is
the most recently forked task by the current thread, and has
not commenced executing in another thread. This method may be
useful when arranging alternative local processing of tasks
that could have been, but were not, stolen.

**Returns:** true

if unforked

- getQueuedTaskCount

```java
public static int getQueuedTaskCount()
```

Returns an estimate of the number of tasks that have been
forked by the current worker thread but not yet executed. This
value may be useful for heuristic decisions about whether to
fork other tasks.

**Returns:** the number of tasks

- getSurplusQueuedTaskCount

```java
public static int getSurplusQueuedTaskCount()
```

Returns an estimate of how many more locally queued tasks are
held by the current worker thread than there are other worker
threads that might steal them, or zero if this thread is not
operating in a ForkJoinPool. This value may be useful for
heuristic decisions about whether to fork other tasks. In many
usages of ForkJoinTasks, at steady state, each worker should
aim to maintain a small constant surplus (for example, 3) of
tasks, and to process computations locally if this threshold is
exceeded.

**Returns:** the surplus number of tasks, which may be negative

- getRawResult

```java
public abstract
V
getRawResult()
```

Returns the result that would be returned by

join()

, even
if this task completed abnormally, or

null

if this task
is not known to have been completed. This method is designed
to aid debugging, as well as to support extensions. Its use in
any other context is discouraged.

**Returns:** the result, or

null

if not completed

- setRawResult

```java
protected abstract void setRawResult​(
V
value)
```

Forces the given value to be returned as a result. This method
is designed to support extensions, and should not in general be
called otherwise.

**Parameters:** value

- the value

- exec

```java
protected abstract boolean exec()
```

Immediately performs the base action of this task and returns
true if, upon return from this method, this task is guaranteed
to have completed normally. This method may return false
otherwise, to indicate that this task is not necessarily
complete (or is not known to be complete), for example in
asynchronous actions that require explicit invocations of
completion methods. This method may also throw an (unchecked)
exception to indicate abnormal exit. This method is designed to
support extensions, and should not in general be called
otherwise.

**Returns:** true

if this task is known to have completed normally

- peekNextLocalTask

```java
protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> peekNextLocalTask()
```

Returns, but does not unschedule or execute, a task queued by
the current thread but not yet executed, if one is immediately
available. There is no guarantee that this task will actually
be polled or executed next. Conversely, this method may return
null even if a task exists but cannot be accessed without
contention with other threads. This method is designed
primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
otherwise.

**Returns:** the next task, or

null

if none are available

- pollNextLocalTask

```java
protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> pollNextLocalTask()
```

Unschedules and returns, without executing, the next task
queued by the current thread but not yet executed, if the
current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool. This method is
designed primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be
useful otherwise.

**Returns:** the next task, or

null

if none are available

- pollTask

```java
protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> pollTask()
```

If the current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool,
unschedules and returns, without executing, the next task
queued by the current thread but not yet executed, if one is
available, or if not available, a task that was forked by some
other thread, if available. Availability may be transient, so a

null

result does not necessarily imply quiescence of
the pool this task is operating in. This method is designed
primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
otherwise.

**Returns:** a task, or

null

if none are available

- pollSubmission

```java
protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> pollSubmission()
```

If the current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool,
unschedules and returns, without executing, a task externally
submitted to the pool, if one is available. Availability may be
transient, so a

null

result does not necessarily imply
quiescence of the pool. This method is designed primarily to
support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful otherwise.

**Returns:** a task, or

null

if none are available
**Since:** 9

- getForkJoinTaskTag

```java
public final short getForkJoinTaskTag()
```

Returns the tag for this task.

**Returns:** the tag for this task
**Since:** 1.8

- setForkJoinTaskTag

```java
public final short setForkJoinTaskTag​(short newValue)
```

Atomically sets the tag value for this task and returns the old value.

**Parameters:** newValue

- the new tag value
**Returns:** the previous value of the tag
**Since:** 1.8

- compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag

```java
public final boolean compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag​(short expect,
short update)
```

Atomically conditionally sets the tag value for this task.
Among other applications, tags can be used as visit markers
in tasks operating on graphs, as in methods that check:

if (task.compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag((short)0, (short)1))

before processing, otherwise exiting because the node has
already been visited.

**Parameters:** expect

- the expected tag value
**Parameters:** update

- the new tag value
**Returns:** true

if successful; i.e., the current value was
equal to

expect

and was changed to

update

.
**Since:** 1.8

```java
public static
ForkJoinTask
<?> adapt​(
Runnable
runnable)
```

Returns a new

ForkJoinTask

that performs the

run

method of the given

Runnable

as its action, and returns
a null result upon

join()

- adapt

```java
public static <T>
ForkJoinTask
<T> adapt​(
Runnable
runnable,

- fork

```java
public final
ForkJoinTask
<
V
> fork()
```

Arranges to asynchronously execute this task in the pool the
current task is running in, if applicable, or using the

ForkJoinPool.commonPool()

if not

inForkJoinPool()

. While
it is not necessarily enforced, it is a usage error to fork a
task more than once unless it has completed and been
reinitialized. Subsequent modifications to the state of this
task or any data it operates on are not necessarily
consistently observable by any thread other than the one
executing it unless preceded by a call to

join()

or
related methods, or a call to

Future.isDone()

returning

true

.

**Returns:** this

, to simplify usage

- join

```java
public final
V
join()
```

Returns the result of the computation when it

is done

.
This method differs from

get()

in that abnormal
completion results in

RuntimeException

or

Error

,
not

ExecutionException

, and that interrupts of the
calling thread do

not

cause the method to abruptly
return by throwing

InterruptedException

.

**Returns:** the computed result

- invoke

```java
public final
V
invoke()
```

Commences performing this task, awaits its completion if
necessary, and returns its result, or throws an (unchecked)

RuntimeException

or

Error

if the underlying
computation did so.

**Returns:** the computed result

- invokeAll

```java
public static void invokeAll​(
ForkJoinTask
<?> t1,

ForkJoinTask
<?> t2)
```

Forks the given tasks, returning when

isDone

holds for
each task or an (unchecked) exception is encountered, in which
case the exception is rethrown. If more than one task
encounters an exception, then this method throws any one of
these exceptions. If any task encounters an exception, the
other may be cancelled. However, the execution status of
individual tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional return. The
status of each task may be obtained using

getException()

and related methods to check if they have been
cancelled, completed normally or exceptionally, or left
unprocessed.

**Parameters:** t1

- the first task
**Parameters:** t2

- the second task
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any task is null

- invokeAll

```java
public static void invokeAll​(
ForkJoinTask
<?>... tasks)
```

Forks the given tasks, returning when

isDone

holds for
each task or an (unchecked) exception is encountered, in which
case the exception is rethrown. If more than one task
encounters an exception, then this method throws any one of
these exceptions. If any task encounters an exception, others
may be cancelled. However, the execution status of individual
tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional return. The status of
each task may be obtained using

getException()

and
related methods to check if they have been cancelled, completed
normally or exceptionally, or left unprocessed.

**Parameters:** tasks

- the tasks
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any task is null

- invokeAll

```java
public static <T extends
ForkJoinTask
<?>>
Collection
<T> invokeAll​(
Collection
<T> tasks)
```

Forks all tasks in the specified collection, returning when

isDone

holds for each task or an (unchecked) exception
is encountered, in which case the exception is rethrown. If
more than one task encounters an exception, then this method
throws any one of these exceptions. If any task encounters an
exception, others may be cancelled. However, the execution
status of individual tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional
return. The status of each task may be obtained using

getException()

and related methods to check if they have been
cancelled, completed normally or exceptionally, or left
unprocessed.

**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the values returned from the tasks
**Parameters:** tasks

- the collection of tasks
**Returns:** the tasks argument, to simplify usage
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if tasks or any element are null

- cancel

```java
public boolean cancel​(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)
```

Attempts to cancel execution of this task. This attempt will
fail if the task has already completed or could not be
cancelled for some other reason. If successful, and this task
has not started when

cancel

is called, execution of
this task is suppressed. After this method returns
successfully, unless there is an intervening call to

reinitialize()

, subsequent calls to

Future.isCancelled()

,

Future.isDone()

, and

cancel

will return

true

and calls to

join()

and related methods will result in

CancellationException

.

This method may be overridden in subclasses, but if so, must
still ensure that these properties hold. In particular, the

cancel

method itself must not throw exceptions.

This method is designed to be invoked by

other

tasks. To terminate the current task, you can just return or
throw an unchecked exception from its computation method, or
invoke

completeExceptionally(Throwable)

.

**Specified by:** cancel

in interface

Future

<

V

>
**Parameters:** mayInterruptIfRunning

- this value has no effect in the
default implementation because interrupts are not used to
control cancellation.
**Returns:** true

if this task is now cancelled

- isCompletedAbnormally

```java
public final boolean isCompletedAbnormally()
```

Returns

true

if this task threw an exception or was cancelled.

**Returns:** true

if this task threw an exception or was cancelled

- isCompletedNormally

```java
public final boolean isCompletedNormally()
```

Returns

true

if this task completed without throwing an
exception and was not cancelled.

**Returns:** true

if this task completed without throwing an
exception and was not cancelled

- getException

```java
public final
Throwable
getException()
```

Returns the exception thrown by the base computation, or a

CancellationException

if cancelled, or

null

if
none or if the method has not yet completed.

**Returns:** the exception, or

null

if none

- completeExceptionally

```java
public void completeExceptionally​(
Throwable
ex)
```

Completes this task abnormally, and if not already aborted or
cancelled, causes it to throw the given exception upon

join

and related operations. This method may be used
to induce exceptions in asynchronous tasks, or to force
completion of tasks that would not otherwise complete. Its use
in other situations is discouraged. This method is
overridable, but overridden versions must invoke

super

implementation to maintain guarantees.

**Parameters:** ex

- the exception to throw. If this exception is not a

RuntimeException

or

Error

, the actual exception
thrown will be a

RuntimeException

with cause

ex

.

- complete

```java
public void complete​(
V
value)
```

Completes this task, and if not already aborted or cancelled,
returning the given value as the result of subsequent
invocations of

join

and related operations. This method
may be used to provide results for asynchronous tasks, or to
provide alternative handling for tasks that would not otherwise
complete normally. Its use in other situations is
discouraged. This method is overridable, but overridden
versions must invoke

super

implementation to maintain
guarantees.

**Parameters:** value

- the result value for this task

- quietlyComplete

```java
public final void quietlyComplete()
```

Completes this task normally without setting a value. The most
recent value established by

setRawResult(V)

(or

null

by default) will be returned as the result of subsequent
invocations of

join

and related operations.

**Since:** 1.8

- get

```java
public final
V
get()
throws
InterruptedException
,

ExecutionException
```

Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then
retrieves its result.

**Specified by:** get

in interface

Future

<

V

>
**Returns:** the computed result
**Throws:** CancellationException

- if the computation was cancelled
**Throws:** ExecutionException

- if the computation threw an
exception
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if the current thread is not a
member of a ForkJoinPool and was interrupted while waiting

- get

```java
public final
V
get​(long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException
,

ExecutionException
,

TimeoutException
```

Waits if necessary for at most the given time for the computation
to complete, and then retrieves its result, if available.

**Specified by:** get

in interface

Future

<

V

>
**Parameters:** timeout

- the maximum time to wait
**Parameters:** unit

- the time unit of the timeout argument
**Returns:** the computed result
**Throws:** CancellationException

- if the computation was cancelled
**Throws:** ExecutionException

- if the computation threw an
exception
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if the current thread is not a
member of a ForkJoinPool and was interrupted while waiting
**Throws:** TimeoutException

- if the wait timed out

- quietlyJoin

```java
public final void quietlyJoin()
```

Joins this task, without returning its result or throwing its
exception. This method may be useful when processing
collections of tasks when some have been cancelled or otherwise
known to have aborted.

- quietlyInvoke

```java
public final void quietlyInvoke()
```

Commences performing this task and awaits its completion if
necessary, without returning its result or throwing its
exception.

- helpQuiesce

```java
public static void helpQuiesce()
```

Possibly executes tasks until the pool hosting the current task

is quiescent

. This
method may be of use in designs in which many tasks are forked,
but none are explicitly joined, instead executing them until
all are processed.

- reinitialize

```java
public void reinitialize()
```

Resets the internal bookkeeping state of this task, allowing a
subsequent

fork

. This method allows repeated reuse of
this task, but only if reuse occurs when this task has either
never been forked, or has been forked, then completed and all
outstanding joins of this task have also completed. Effects
under any other usage conditions are not guaranteed.
This method may be useful when executing
pre-constructed trees of subtasks in loops.

Upon completion of this method,

isDone()

reports

false

, and

getException()

reports

null

. However, the value returned by

getRawResult

is
unaffected. To clear this value, you can invoke

setRawResult(null)

.

- getPool

```java
public static
ForkJoinPool
getPool()
```

Returns the pool hosting the current thread, or

null

if the current thread is executing outside of any ForkJoinPool.

This method returns

null

if and only if

inForkJoinPool()

returns

false

.

**Returns:** the pool, or

null

if none

- inForkJoinPool

```java
public static boolean inForkJoinPool()
```

Returns

true

if the current thread is a

ForkJoinWorkerThread

executing as a ForkJoinPool computation.

**Returns:** true

if the current thread is a

ForkJoinWorkerThread

executing as a ForkJoinPool computation,
or

false

otherwise

- tryUnfork

```java
public boolean tryUnfork()
```

Tries to unschedule this task for execution. This method will
typically (but is not guaranteed to) succeed if this task is
the most recently forked task by the current thread, and has
not commenced executing in another thread. This method may be
useful when arranging alternative local processing of tasks
that could have been, but were not, stolen.

**Returns:** true

if unforked

- getQueuedTaskCount

```java
public static int getQueuedTaskCount()
```

Returns an estimate of the number of tasks that have been
forked by the current worker thread but not yet executed. This
value may be useful for heuristic decisions about whether to
fork other tasks.

**Returns:** the number of tasks

- getSurplusQueuedTaskCount

```java
public static int getSurplusQueuedTaskCount()
```

Returns an estimate of how many more locally queued tasks are
held by the current worker thread than there are other worker
threads that might steal them, or zero if this thread is not
operating in a ForkJoinPool. This value may be useful for
heuristic decisions about whether to fork other tasks. In many
usages of ForkJoinTasks, at steady state, each worker should
aim to maintain a small constant surplus (for example, 3) of
tasks, and to process computations locally if this threshold is
exceeded.

**Returns:** the surplus number of tasks, which may be negative

- getRawResult

```java
public abstract
V
getRawResult()
```

Returns the result that would be returned by

join()

, even
if this task completed abnormally, or

null

if this task
is not known to have been completed. This method is designed
to aid debugging, as well as to support extensions. Its use in
any other context is discouraged.

**Returns:** the result, or

null

if not completed

- setRawResult

```java
protected abstract void setRawResult​(
V
value)
```

Forces the given value to be returned as a result. This method
is designed to support extensions, and should not in general be
called otherwise.

**Parameters:** value

- the value

- exec

```java
protected abstract boolean exec()
```

Immediately performs the base action of this task and returns
true if, upon return from this method, this task is guaranteed
to have completed normally. This method may return false
otherwise, to indicate that this task is not necessarily
complete (or is not known to be complete), for example in
asynchronous actions that require explicit invocations of
completion methods. This method may also throw an (unchecked)
exception to indicate abnormal exit. This method is designed to
support extensions, and should not in general be called
otherwise.

**Returns:** true

if this task is known to have completed normally

- peekNextLocalTask

```java
protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> peekNextLocalTask()
```

Returns, but does not unschedule or execute, a task queued by
the current thread but not yet executed, if one is immediately
available. There is no guarantee that this task will actually
be polled or executed next. Conversely, this method may return
null even if a task exists but cannot be accessed without
contention with other threads. This method is designed
primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
otherwise.

**Returns:** the next task, or

null

if none are available

- pollNextLocalTask

```java
protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> pollNextLocalTask()
```

Unschedules and returns, without executing, the next task
queued by the current thread but not yet executed, if the
current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool. This method is
designed primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be
useful otherwise.

**Returns:** the next task, or

null

if none are available

- pollTask

```java
protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> pollTask()
```

If the current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool,
unschedules and returns, without executing, the next task
queued by the current thread but not yet executed, if one is
available, or if not available, a task that was forked by some
other thread, if available. Availability may be transient, so a

null

result does not necessarily imply quiescence of
the pool this task is operating in. This method is designed
primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
otherwise.

**Returns:** a task, or

null

if none are available

- pollSubmission

```java
protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> pollSubmission()
```

If the current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool,
unschedules and returns, without executing, a task externally
submitted to the pool, if one is available. Availability may be
transient, so a

null

result does not necessarily imply
quiescence of the pool. This method is designed primarily to
support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful otherwise.

**Returns:** a task, or

null

if none are available
**Since:** 9

- getForkJoinTaskTag

```java
public final short getForkJoinTaskTag()
```

Returns the tag for this task.

**Returns:** the tag for this task
**Since:** 1.8

- setForkJoinTaskTag

```java
public final short setForkJoinTaskTag​(short newValue)
```

Atomically sets the tag value for this task and returns the old value.

**Parameters:** newValue

- the new tag value
**Returns:** the previous value of the tag
**Since:** 1.8

- compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag

```java
public final boolean compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag​(short expect,
short update)
```

Atomically conditionally sets the tag value for this task.
Among other applications, tags can be used as visit markers
in tasks operating on graphs, as in methods that check:

if (task.compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag((short)0, (short)1))

before processing, otherwise exiting because the node has
already been visited.

**Parameters:** expect

- the expected tag value
**Parameters:** update

- the new tag value
**Returns:** true

if successful; i.e., the current value was
equal to

expect

and was changed to

update

.
**Since:** 1.8

```java
public static
ForkJoinTask
<?> adapt​(
Runnable
runnable)
```

Returns a new

ForkJoinTask

that performs the

run

method of the given

Runnable

as its action, and returns
a null result upon

join()

.

**Parameters:** runnable

- the runnable action
**Returns:** the task

- adapt

```java
public static <T>
ForkJoinTask
<T> adapt​(
Runnable
runnable,

its result upon

join()

, translating any checked exceptions
encountered into

RuntimeException

.

#### Method Detail

fork

```java
public final
ForkJoinTask
<
V
> fork()
```

Arranges to asynchronously execute this task in the pool the
current task is running in, if applicable, or using the

ForkJoinPool.commonPool()

if not

inForkJoinPool()

. While
it is not necessarily enforced, it is a usage error to fork a
task more than once unless it has completed and been
reinitialized. Subsequent modifications to the state of this
task or any data it operates on are not necessarily
consistently observable by any thread other than the one
executing it unless preceded by a call to

join()

or
related methods, or a call to

Future.isDone()

returning

true

.

**Returns:** this

helpQuiesce

```java
public static void helpQuiesce()

but none are explicitly joined, instead executing them until
all are processed.

reinitialize

```java
public void reinitialize()
```

Resets the internal bookkeeping state of this task, allowing a
subsequent

fork

. This method allows repeated reuse of
this task, but only if reuse occurs when this task has either
never been forked, or has been forked, then completed and all
outstanding joins of this task have also completed. Effects
under any other usage conditions are not guaranteed.
This method may be useful when executing
pre-constructed trees of subtasks in loops.

Upon completion of this method,

isDone()

reports

false

, and

getException()

reports

null

. However, the value returned by

getRawResult

is
unaffected. To clear this value, you can invoke

setRawResult(null)

.

tryUnfork

```java
public boolean tryUnfork()
```

Tries to unschedule this task for execution. This method will
typically (but is not guaranteed to) succeed if this task is
the most recently forked task by the current thread, and has
not commenced executing in another thread. This method may be
useful when arranging alternative local processing of tasks
that could have been, but were not, stolen.

**Returns:** true

if unforked

---

#### tryUnfork

public boolean tryUnfork()

that could have been, but were not, stolen.

getQueuedTaskCount

```java
public static int getQueuedTaskCount()

public static int getSurplusQueuedTaskCount()
```

Returns an estimate of how many more locally queued tasks are
held by the current worker thread than there are other worker
threads that might steal them, or zero if this thread is not
operating in a ForkJoinPool. This value may be useful for
heuristic decisions about whether to fork other tasks. In many
usages of ForkJoinTasks, at steady state, each worker should
aim to maintain a small constant surplus (for example, 3) of
tasks, and to process computations locally if this threshold is
exceeded.

**Returns:** the surplus number of tasks, which may be negative

---

exec

```java
protected abstract boolean exec()
```

Immediately performs the base action of this task and returns
true if, upon return from this method, this task is guaranteed
to have completed normally. This method may return false
otherwise, to indicate that this task is not necessarily
complete (or is not known to be complete), for example in
asynchronous actions that require explicit invocations of
completion methods. This method may also throw an (unchecked)
exception to indicate abnormal exit. This method is designed to
support extensions, and should not in general be called
otherwise.

**Returns:** true

if this task is known to have completed normally

---

#### exec

protected abstract boolean exec()

Immediately performs the base action of this task and returns
true if, upon return from this method, this task is guaranteed

peekNextLocalTask

```java
protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> peekNextLocalTask()
```

Returns, but does not unschedule or execute, a task queued by
the current thread but not yet executed, if one is immediately
available. There is no guarantee that this task will actually
be polled or executed next. Conversely, this method may return
null even if a task exists but cannot be accessed without
contention with other threads. This method is designed
primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
otherwise.

**Returns:** the next task, or

null

if none are available

unschedules and returns, without executing, the next task
queued by the current thread but not yet executed, if one is
available, or if not available, a task that was forked by some
other thread, if available. Availability may be transient, so a

null

result does not necessarily imply quiescence of
the pool this task is operating in. This method is designed
primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
otherwise.

**Returns:** a task, or

null

if none are available

---

#### pollTask

protected static

ForkJoinTask

<?> pollTask()

If the current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool,
unschedules and returns, without executing, the next task
queued by the current thread but not yet executed, if one is
available, or if not available, a task that was forked by some
other thread, if available. Availability may be transient, so a

null

result does not necessarily imply quiescence of
the pool this task is operating in. This method is designed
primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
otherwise.

```java
protected static
ForkJoinTask
<?> pollSubmission()
```

If the current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool,
unschedules and returns, without executing, a task externally
submitted to the pool, if one is available. Availability may be
transient, so a

null

result does not necessarily imply
quiescence of the pool. This method is designed primarily to
support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful otherwise.

**Returns:** a task, or

null

if none are available
