# Class GSSManager

**Source:** `java.security.jgss\org\ietf\jgss\GSSManager.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
GSSManager

extends
Object
```

This class serves as a factory for other important
GSS-API classes and also provides information about the mechanisms that
are supported. It can create instances of classes
implementing the following three GSS-API interfaces:

GSSName

,

GSSCredential

, and

GSSContext

. It also has methods to query for the list
of available mechanisms and the nametypes that each mechanism
supports.

An instance of the default

GSSManager

subclass
may be obtained through the static method

getInstance

, but applications are free to instantiate other subclasses
of

GSSManager

. The default

GSSManager

instance
will support the Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism in addition to any
others. This mechanism is identified by the Oid "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2"
and is defined in RFC 1964.

A subclass extending the

GSSManager

abstract class may be
implemented as a modular provider based layer that utilizes some well
known service provider specification. The

GSSManager

API
allows the application to set provider preferences on
such an implementation. These methods also allow the implementation to
throw a well-defined exception in case provider based configuration is
not supported. Applications that expect to be portable should be aware
of this and recover cleanly by catching the exception.

It is envisioned that there will be three most common ways in which
providers will be used:

- The application does not care about what provider is used (the
default case).

The application wants a particular provider to be used
preferentially, either for a particular mechanism or all the
time, irrespective of mechanism.

The application wants to use the locally configured providers
as far as possible but if support is missing for one or more
mechanisms then it wants to fall back on its own provider.

The

GSSManager

class has two methods that enable these modes of
usage:

addProviderAtFront

and

addProviderAtEnd

. These methods
have the effect of creating an ordered list of

<provider,
oid>

pairs where each pair indicates a preference of provider
for a given oid.

It is important to note that there are certain interactions
between the different GSS-API objects that are created by a
GSSManager, where the provider that is used for a particular mechanism
might need to be consistent across all objects. For instance, if a
GSSCredential contains elements from a provider

p

for a mechanism

m

, it should generally be passed in to a GSSContext that will use
provider

p

for the mechanism

m

. A simple rule of thumb
that will maximize portability is that objects created from different
GSSManager's should not be mixed, and if possible, a different
GSSManager instance should be created if the application wants to invoke
the

addProviderAtFront

method on a GSSManager that has
already created an object.

Here is some sample code showing how the GSSManager might be used:

```java
GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();

Oid krb5Mechanism = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2");
Oid krb5PrincipalNameType = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1");

// Identify who the client wishes to be
GSSName userName = manager.createName("duke", GSSName.NT_USER_NAME);

// Identify the name of the server. This uses a Kerberos specific
// name format.
GSSName serverName = manager.createName("nfs/foo.sun.com",
krb5PrincipalNameType);

// Acquire credentials for the user
GSSCredential userCreds = manager.createCredential(userName,
GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
krb5Mechanism,
GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY);

// Instantiate and initialize a security context that will be
// established with the server
GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverName,
krb5Mechanism,
userCreds,
GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME);
```

The server side might use the following variation of this source:

```java
// Acquire credentials for the server
GSSCredential serverCreds = manager.createCredential(serverName,
GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
krb5Mechanism,
GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY);

// Instantiate and initialize a security context that will
// wait for an establishment request token from the client
GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverCreds);
```

### Method Details

#### public static
GSSManager
getInstance()

Returns the default GSSManager implementation.

**Returns:**
- a GSSManager implementation

---

#### public abstract
Oid
[] getMechs()

Returns a list of mechanisms that are available to GSS-API callers
through this GSSManager. The default GSSManager obtained from the

getInstance()

method includes the Oid
"1.2.840.113554.1.2.2" in its list. This Oid identifies the Kerberos
v5 GSS-API mechanism that is defined in RFC 1964.

**Returns:**
- an array of Oid objects corresponding to the mechanisms that
are available. A

null

value is returned when no
mechanism are available (an example of this would be when mechanism
are dynamically configured, and currently no mechanisms are
installed).

---

#### public abstract
Oid
[] getNamesForMech​(
Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException

Returns then name types supported by the indicated mechanism.

The default GSSManager instance includes support for the Kerberos v5
mechanism. When this mechanism ("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2") is indicated,
the returned list will contain at least the following nametypes:

GSSName.NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE

,

GSSName.NT_EXPORT_NAME

, and the
Kerberos v5 specific Oid "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1". The namespace for
the Oid "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1" is defined in RFC 1964.

**Parameters:**
- mech

- the Oid of the mechanism to query

**Returns:**
- an array of Oid objects corresponding to the name types that
the mechanism supports.

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.BAD_MECH

GSSException.FAILURE

**See Also:**
- getMechsForName(Oid)

---

#### public abstract
Oid
[] getMechsForName​(
Oid
nameType)

Returns a list of mechanisms that support the indicated name type.

The Kerberos v5 mechanism ("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2") will always be
returned in this list when the indicated nametype is one of

GSSName.NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE

,

GSSName.NT_EXPORT_NAME

, or
"1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1".

**Parameters:**
- nameType

- the Oid of the name type to look for

**Returns:**
- an array of Oid objects corresponding to the mechanisms that
support the specified name type.

null

is returned when no
mechanisms are found to support the specified name type.

**See Also:**
- getNamesForMech(Oid)

---

#### public abstract
GSSName
createName​(
String
nameStr,

Oid
nameType)
throws
GSSException

Factory method to convert a string name from the
specified namespace to a GSSName object. In general, the

GSSName

object created will contain multiple
representations of the name, one for each mechanism that is
supported; two examples that are exceptions to this are when
the namespace type parameter indicates NT_EXPORT_NAME or when the
GSS-API implementation is not multi-mechanism. It is
not recommended to use this method with a NT_EXPORT_NAME type because
representing a previously exported name consisting of arbitrary bytes
as a String might cause problems with character encoding schemes. In
such cases it is recommended that the bytes be passed in directly to
the overloaded form of this method

createName

.

**Parameters:**
- nameStr

- the string representing a printable form of the name to
create.
- nameType

- the Oid specifying the namespace of the printable name
supplied.

null

can be used to specify
that a mechanism specific default printable syntax should
be assumed by each mechanism that examines nameStr.
It is not advisable to use the nametype NT_EXPORT_NAME with this
method.

**Returns:**
- a GSSName representing the indicated principal

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.BAD_NAMETYPE

,

GSSException.BAD_NAME

,

GSSException.BAD_MECH

,

GSSException.FAILURE

#### public abstract
GSSName
createName​(byte[] name,

Oid
nameType)
throws
GSSException

Factory method to convert a byte array containing a
name from the specified namespace to a GSSName object. In general,
the

GSSName

object created will contain multiple
representations of the name, one for each mechanism that is
supported; two examples that are exceptions to this are when the
namespace type parameter indicates NT_EXPORT_NAME or when the
GSS-API implementation is not multi-mechanism. The bytes that are
passed in are interpreted by each underlying mechanism according to
some encoding scheme of its choice for the given nametype.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the byte array containing the name to create
- nameType

- the Oid specifying the namespace of the name supplied
in the byte array.

null

can be used to specify that a
mechanism specific default syntax should be assumed by each mechanism
that examines the byte array.

**Returns:**
- a GSSName representing the indicated principal

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.BAD_NAMETYPE

,

.

**Parameters:**
- nameStr

- the string representing a printable form of the name to
create.
- nameType

#### public abstract
GSSCredential
createCredential​(int usage)
throws
GSSException

Factory method for acquiring default credentials. This will cause
the GSS-API to use system specific defaults for the set of mechanisms,
name, and lifetime.

GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from
this method.

**Parameters:**
- usage

- The intended usage for this credential object. The value
of this parameter must be one of:

GSSCredential.INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT

,

GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY

, and

GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY

.

**Returns:**
- a GSSCredential of the requested type.

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.BAD_MECH

#### public abstract
GSSCredential
createCredential​(
GSSName
name,
int lifetime,

Oid
mech,
int usage)
throws
GSSException

Factory method for acquiring a single mechanism credential.

GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from
this method.

Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the
underlying mechanisms, thus applications should be prepared to call

getRemainingLifetime

on the returned credential.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the principal for whom this credential is to be
acquired. Use

null

to specify the default principal.
- lifetime

- The number of seconds that credentials should remain
valid. Use

GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME

to request that the credentials
have the maximum permitted lifetime. Use

GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME

to
request default credential lifetime.
- mech

- the Oid of the desired mechanism. Use

(Oid) null

to request the default mechanism.
- usage

- The intended usage for this credential object. The value
of this parameter must be one of:

GSSCredential.INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT

,

GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY

, and

#### public abstract
GSSCredential
createCredential​(
GSSName
name,
int lifetime,

Oid
[] mechs,
int usage)
throws
GSSException

Factory method for acquiring credentials over a set of
mechanisms. This method attempts to acquire credentials for
each of the mechanisms specified in the array called mechs. To
determine the list of mechanisms for which the acquisition of
credentials succeeded, the caller should use the

GSSCredential.getMechs

method.

GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from
this method.

Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the
underlying mechanisms, thus applications should be prepared to call

getRemainingLifetime

on the returned credential.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the principal for whom this credential is to
be acquired. Use

null

to specify the default
principal.
- lifetime

- The number of seconds that credentials should remain
valid. Use

GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME

to request that the credentials
have the maximum permitted lifetime. Use

GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME

to
request default credential lifetime.
- mechs

- an array of Oid's indicating the mechanisms over which
the credential is to be acquired. Use

(Oid[]) null

for
requesting a system specific default set of mechanisms.

#### public abstract
GSSContext
createContext​(
GSSName
peer,

Oid
mech,

GSSCredential
myCred,
int lifetime)
throws
GSSException

Factory method for creating a context on the initiator's
side.

Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
permission to initiate a security context. A failed permission check
might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from this method.

Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the
underlying mechanism, thus applications should be prepared to call

getLifetime

on the returned
context.

**Parameters:**
- peer

- the name of the target peer.
- mech

- the Oid of the desired mechanism. Use

null

to request the default mechanism.
- myCred

- the credentials of the initiator. Use

null

to act as the default initiator principal.
- lifetime

- the lifetime, in seconds, requested for the
context. Use

GSSContext.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME

to request that the context have the
maximum permitted lifetime. Use

GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME

to request a default lifetime for the
context.

**Returns:**
- an unestablished GSSContext

#### public abstract
GSSContext
createContext​(
GSSCredential
myCred)
throws
GSSException

Factory method for creating a context on the acceptor' side. The
context's properties will be determined from the input token supplied
to the accept method.

Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
permission to accept a security context. A failed permission check
might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from this method.

**Parameters:**
- myCred

- the credentials for the acceptor. Use

null

to act as a default acceptor principal.

**Returns:**
- an unestablished GSSContext

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.NO_CRED

GSSException.CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED

GSSException.BAD_MECH

GSSException.FAILURE

**See Also:**

---

#### public abstract
GSSContext
createContext​(byte[] interProcessToken)
throws
GSSException

Factory method for creating a previously exported context. The
context properties will be determined from the input token and
cannot be modified through the set methods.

Implementations are not required to support the inter-process
transfer of security contexts. Before exporting a context, calling
the

GSSContext.isTransferable

will indicate if the context is transferable. Calling this method in
an implementation that does not support it will result in a

GSSException

with the error
code

GSSException.UNAVAILABLE

.

Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
permission to initiate or accept a security context. A failed
permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from this method.

**Parameters:**
- interProcessToken

- the token previously emitted from the
export method.

**Returns:**
- the previously established GSSContext

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.NO_CONTEXT

#### public abstract void addProviderAtFront​(
Provider
p,

Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException

This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
application would like a particular provider to be used ahead of all
others when support is desired for the given mechanism. When a value
of null is used instead of an

Oid

for the mechanism,
the GSSManager must use the indicated provider ahead of all others
no matter what the mechanism is. Only when the indicated provider
does not support the needed mechanism should the GSSManager move on
to a different provider.

Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
lowers them in preference thus forming an ordered list of provider
and

Oid

pairs that grows at the top.

Calling addProviderAtFront with a null

Oid

will remove
all previous preferences that were set for this provider in the
GSSManager instance. Calling addProviderAtFront with a non-null

Oid

will remove any previous preference that was set
using this mechanism and this provider together.

If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
operation is unavailable.

Suppose an application desired that the provider A always be checked
first when any mechanism is needed, it would call:

```java
GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
// mgr may at this point have its own pre-configured list
// of provider preferences. The following will prepend to
// any such list:

mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, null);
```

Now if it also desired that the mechanism of Oid m1 always be
obtained from the provider B before the previously set A was checked,
it would call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, m1);
```

The GSSManager would then first check with B if m1 was needed. In
case B did not provide support for m1, the GSSManager would continue
on to check with A. If any mechanism m2 is needed where m2 is
different from m1 then the GSSManager would skip B and check with A
directly.

Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
GSSManager instance:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, null)
```

then the previous setting with the pair (B, m1) is subsumed by this
and should be removed. Effectively the list of preferences now
becomes {(B, null), (A, null),
... //followed by the pre-configured list.

Please note, however, that the following call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, m3)
```

does not subsume the previous setting of (A, null) and the list will
effectively become {(A, m3), (B, null), (A, null), ...}

**Parameters:**
- p

- the provider instance that should be used whenever support
is needed for mech.
- mech

- the mechanism for which the provider is being set

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.UNAVAILABLE

,

GSSException.FAILURE

---

#### public abstract void addProviderAtEnd​(
Provider
p,

Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException

This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
application would like a particular provider to be used if no other
provider can be found that supports the given mechanism. When a value
of null is used instead of an Oid for the mechanism, the GSSManager
must use the indicated provider for any mechanism.

Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
raises them above newer ones in preference thus forming an ordered
list of providers and Oid pairs that grows at the bottom. Thus the
older provider settings will be utilized first before this one is.

If there are any previously existing preferences that conflict with
the preference being set here, then the GSSManager should ignore this
request.

If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
operation is unavailable.

Suppose an application desired that when a mechanism of Oid m1 is
needed the system default providers always be checked first, and only
when they do not support m1 should a provider A be checked. It would
then make the call:

```java
GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, m1);
```

Now, if it also desired that for all mechanisms the provider B be
checked after all configured providers have been checked, it would
then call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, null);
```

Effectively the list of preferences now becomes {..., (A, m1), (B,
null)}.

Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
GSSManager instance:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, m2)
```

then the previous setting with the pair (B, null) subsumes this and
therefore this request should be ignored. The same would happen if a
request is made for the already existing pairs of (A, m1) or (B,
null).

Please note, however, that the following call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, null)
```

is not subsumed by the previous setting of (A, m1) and the list will
effectively become {..., (A, m1), (B, null), (A, null)}

**Parameters:**
- p

- the provider instance that should be used whenever support
is needed for mech.
- mech

- the mechanism for which the provider is being set

**Throws:**
- GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.UNAVAILABLE

,

GSSException.FAILURE

### Additional Sections

#### Class GSSManager

java.lang.Object

- org.ietf.jgss.GSSManager

org.ietf.jgss.GSSManager

```java
public abstract class
GSSManager

extends
Object
```

This class serves as a factory for other important
GSS-API classes and also provides information about the mechanisms that
are supported. It can create instances of classes
implementing the following three GSS-API interfaces:

GSSName

,

GSSCredential

, and

GSSContext

. It also has methods to query for the list
of available mechanisms and the nametypes that each mechanism
supports.

An instance of the default

GSSManager

subclass
may be obtained through the static method

getInstance

, but applications are free to instantiate other subclasses
of

GSSManager

. The default

GSSManager

instance
will support the Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism in addition to any
others. This mechanism is identified by the Oid "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2"
and is defined in RFC 1964.

A subclass extending the

GSSManager

abstract class may be
implemented as a modular provider based layer that utilizes some well
known service provider specification. The

GSSManager

API
allows the application to set provider preferences on
such an implementation. These methods also allow the implementation to
throw a well-defined exception in case provider based configuration is
not supported. Applications that expect to be portable should be aware
of this and recover cleanly by catching the exception.

It is envisioned that there will be three most common ways in which
providers will be used:

- The application does not care about what provider is used (the
default case).

The application wants a particular provider to be used
preferentially, either for a particular mechanism or all the
time, irrespective of mechanism.

The application wants to use the locally configured providers
as far as possible but if support is missing for one or more
mechanisms then it wants to fall back on its own provider.

The

GSSManager

class has two methods that enable these modes of
usage:

addProviderAtFront

and

addProviderAtEnd

. These methods
have the effect of creating an ordered list of

<provider,
oid>

pairs where each pair indicates a preference of provider
for a given oid.

It is important to note that there are certain interactions
between the different GSS-API objects that are created by a
GSSManager, where the provider that is used for a particular mechanism
might need to be consistent across all objects. For instance, if a
GSSCredential contains elements from a provider

p

for a mechanism

m

, it should generally be passed in to a GSSContext that will use
provider

p

. A simple rule of thumb
that will maximize portability is that objects created from different
GSSManager's should not be mixed, and if possible, a different
GSSManager instance should be created if the application wants to invoke
the

addProviderAtFront

method on a GSSManager that has
already created an object.

Here is some sample code showing how the GSSManager might be used:

```java
GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();

Oid krb5Mechanism = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2");
Oid krb5PrincipalNameType = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1");

// Identify who the client wishes to be
GSSName userName = manager.createName("duke", GSSName.NT_USER_NAME);

// Identify the name of the server. This uses a Kerberos specific
// name format.
GSSName serverName = manager.createName("nfs/foo.sun.com",
krb5PrincipalNameType);

// Acquire credentials for the user
GSSCredential userCreds = manager.createCredential(userName,
GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
krb5Mechanism,
GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY);

// Instantiate and initialize a security context that will be
// established with the server
GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverName,
krb5Mechanism,
userCreds,
GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME);
```

The server side might use the following variation of this source:

```java
// Acquire credentials for the server
GSSCredential serverCreds = manager.createCredential(serverName,
GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
krb5Mechanism,
GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY);

// Instantiate and initialize a security context that will
// wait for an establishment request token from the client
GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverCreds);
```

public abstract class

GSSManager

extends

Object

This class serves as a factory for other important
GSS-API classes and also provides information about the mechanisms that
are supported. It can create instances of classes
implementing the following three GSS-API interfaces:

GSSName

,

GSSCredential

, and

GSSContext

. It also has methods to query for the list
of available mechanisms and the nametypes that each mechanism
supports.

An instance of the default

GSSManager

subclass
may be obtained through the static method

getInstance

, but applications are free to instantiate other subclasses
of

GSSManager

. The default

GSSManager

instance
will support the Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism in addition to any
others. This mechanism is identified by the Oid "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2"
and is defined in RFC 1964.

A subclass extending the

GSSManager

abstract class may be
implemented as a modular provider based layer that utilizes some well
known service provider specification. The

GSSManager

API
allows the application to set provider preferences on
such an implementation. These methods also allow the implementation to
throw a well-defined exception in case provider based configuration is
not supported. Applications that expect to be portable should be aware
of this and recover cleanly by catching the exception.

It is envisioned that there will be three most common ways in which
providers will be used:

- The application does not care about what provider is used (the
default case).

The application wants a particular provider to be used
preferentially, either for a particular mechanism or all the
time, irrespective of mechanism.

The application wants to use the locally configured providers
as far as possible but if support is missing for one or more
mechanisms then it wants to fall back on its own provider.

The

GSSManager

class has two methods that enable these modes of
usage:

addProviderAtFront

and

addProviderAtEnd

. These methods
have the effect of creating an ordered list of

<provider,
oid>

pairs where each pair indicates a preference of provider
for a given oid.

It is important to note that there are certain interactions
between the different GSS-API objects that are created by a
GSSManager, where the provider that is used for a particular mechanism
might need to be consistent across all objects. For instance, if a
GSSCredential contains elements from a provider

p

for a mechanism

m

, it should generally be passed in to a GSSContext that will use
provider

p

for the mechanism

m

. A simple rule of thumb
that will maximize portability is that objects created from different
GSSManager's should not be mixed, and if possible, a different
GSSManager instance should be created if the application wants to invoke
the

addProviderAtFront

method on a GSSManager that has
already created an object.

Here is some sample code showing how the GSSManager might be used:

```java
GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();

Oid krb5Mechanism = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2");
Oid krb5PrincipalNameType = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1");

// Identify who the client wishes to be
GSSName userName = manager.createName("duke", GSSName.NT_USER_NAME);

// Identify the name of the server. This uses a Kerberos specific
// name format.
GSSName serverName = manager.createName("nfs/foo.sun.com",
krb5PrincipalNameType);

// Acquire credentials for the user
GSSCredential userCreds = manager.createCredential(userName,
GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
krb5Mechanism,
GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY);

// Instantiate and initialize a security context that will be
// established with the server
GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverName,
krb5Mechanism,
userCreds,
GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME);
```

The server side might use the following variation of this source:

```java
// Acquire credentials for the server
GSSCredential serverCreds = manager.createCredential(serverName,
GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
krb5Mechanism,
GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY);

// Instantiate and initialize a security context that will
// wait for an establishment request token from the client
GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverCreds);
```

GSSManager
getInstance()
```

Returns the default GSSManager implementation.

**Returns:** a GSSManager implementation

- getMechs

```java
public abstract
Oid
[] getMechs()
```

Returns a list of mechanisms that are available to GSS-API callers
through this GSSManager. The default GSSManager obtained from the

getInstance()

method includes the Oid
"1.2.840.113554.1.2.2" in its list. This Oid identifies the Kerberos
v5 GSS-API mechanism that is defined in RFC 1964.

**Returns:** an array of Oid objects corresponding to the mechanisms that
are available. A

null

value is returned when no
mechanism are available (an example of this would be when mechanism
are dynamically configured, and currently no mechanisms are
installed).

- getNamesForMech

```java
public abstract
Oid
[] getNamesForMech​(
Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException
```

Returns then name types supported by the indicated mechanism.

The default GSSManager instance includes support for the Kerberos v5
mechanism. When this mechanism ("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2") is indicated,
the returned list will contain at least the following nametypes:

GSSName.NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE

,

GSSName.NT_EXPORT_NAME

, and the
Kerberos v5 specific Oid "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1". The namespace for
the Oid "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1" is defined in RFC 1964.

**Parameters:** mech

- the Oid of the mechanism to query
**Returns:** an array of Oid objects corresponding to the name types that
the mechanism supports.
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

```

Returns a list of mechanisms that support the indicated name type.

The Kerberos v5 mechanism ("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2") will always be
returned in this list when the indicated nametype is one of

GSSName.NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE

,

GSSName.NT_EXPORT_NAME

, or
"1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1".

**Parameters:** nameType

- the Oid of the name type to look for
**Returns:** an array of Oid objects corresponding to the mechanisms that
support the specified name type.

null

is returned when no
mechanisms are found to support the specified name type.

- createName

```java
public abstract
GSSName
createName​(
String
nameStr,

Oid
nameType)
throws
GSSException
```

Factory method to convert a string name from the
specified namespace to a GSSName object. In general, the

GSSName

object created will contain multiple
representations of the name, one for each mechanism that is
supported; two examples that are exceptions to this are when
the namespace type parameter indicates NT_EXPORT_NAME or when the
GSS-API implementation is not multi-mechanism. It is
not recommended to use this method with a NT_EXPORT_NAME type because
representing a previously exported name consisting of arbitrary bytes
as a String might cause problems with character encoding schemes. In
such cases it is recommended that the bytes be passed in directly to
the overloaded form of this method

createName

.

**Parameters:** nameStr

- the string representing a printable form of the name to
create.
**Parameters:** nameType

- the Oid specifying the namespace of the printable name
supplied.

null

can be used to specify
that a mechanism specific default printable syntax should
be assumed by each mechanism that examines nameStr.
It is not advisable to use the nametype NT_EXPORT_NAME with this
method.
**Returns:** a GSSName representing the indicated principal
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.BAD_NAMETYPE

,

GSSException.BAD_NAME

```

Factory method to convert a byte array containing a
name from the specified namespace to a GSSName object. In general,
the

GSSName

object created will contain multiple
representations of the name, one for each mechanism that is
supported; two examples that are exceptions to this are when the
namespace type parameter indicates NT_EXPORT_NAME or when the
GSS-API implementation is not multi-mechanism. The bytes that are
passed in are interpreted by each underlying mechanism according to
some encoding scheme of its choice for the given nametype.

**Parameters:** name

- the byte array containing the name to create
**Parameters:** nameType

- the Oid specifying the namespace of the name supplied
in the byte array.

null

can be used to specify that a
mechanism specific default syntax should be assumed by each mechanism
that examines the byte array.

- createCredential

```java
public abstract
GSSCredential
createCredential​(int usage)
throws
GSSException
```

Factory method for acquiring default credentials. This will cause
the GSS-API to use system specific defaults for the set of mechanisms,
name, and lifetime.

GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from
this method.

**Parameters:** usage

- The intended usage for this credential object. The value
of this parameter must be one of:

GSSCredential.INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT

,

GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY

, and

GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY

.
**Returns:** a GSSCredential of the requested type.

mech,
int usage)
throws
GSSException
```

Factory method for acquiring a single mechanism credential.

GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from
this method.

Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the
underlying mechanisms, thus applications should be prepared to call

getRemainingLifetime

on the returned credential.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the principal for whom this credential is to be
acquired. Use

null

to specify the default principal.
**Parameters:** lifetime

- The number of seconds that credentials should remain
valid. Use

GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME

to request that the credentials
have the maximum permitted lifetime. Use

GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME

to
request default credential lifetime.
**Parameters:** mech

- the Oid of the desired mechanism. Use

(Oid) null

to request the default mechanism.
**Parameters:** usage

- The intended usage for this credential object. The value
of this parameter must be one of:

GSSCredential.INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT

,

- createCredential

```java
public abstract
GSSCredential
createCredential​(
GSSName
name,
int lifetime,

Oid
[] mechs,
int usage)
throws
GSSException
```

Factory method for acquiring credentials over a set of
mechanisms. This method attempts to acquire credentials for
each of the mechanisms specified in the array called mechs. To
determine the list of mechanisms for which the acquisition of
credentials succeeded, the caller should use the

GSSCredential.getMechs

method.

GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from
this method.

Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the
underlying mechanisms, thus applications should be prepared to call

getRemainingLifetime

on the returned credential.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the principal for whom this credential is to
be acquired. Use

null

to specify the default
principal.
**Parameters:** lifetime

- The number of seconds that credentials should remain
valid. Use

GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME

to request that the credentials
have the maximum permitted lifetime. Use

GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME

to
request default credential lifetime.
**Parameters:** mechs

- an array of Oid's indicating the mechanisms over which
the credential is to be acquired. Use

(Oid[]) null

for
requesting a system specific default set of mechanisms.
**Parameters:** usage

- The intended usage for this credential object. The value
of this parameter must be one of:

GSSCredential.INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT

,

GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY

, and

GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY

.
**Returns:** a GSSCredential of the requested type.
**Throws:** GSSException

- createContext

```java
public abstract
GSSContext
createContext​(
GSSName
peer,

Oid
mech,

GSSCredential
myCred,
int lifetime)
throws
GSSException
```

Factory method for creating a context on the initiator's
side.

Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
permission to initiate a security context. A failed permission check
might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from this method.

Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the
underlying mechanism, thus applications should be prepared to call

getLifetime

on the returned
context.

**Parameters:** peer

- the name of the target peer.
**Parameters:** mech

- the Oid of the desired mechanism. Use

null

to request the default mechanism.
**Parameters:** myCred

- the credentials of the initiator. Use

null

to act as the default initiator principal.
**Parameters:** lifetime

- the lifetime, in seconds, requested for the
context. Use

GSSContext.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME

to request that the context have the
maximum permitted lifetime. Use

GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME

to request a default lifetime for the
context.
**Returns:** an unestablished GSSContext
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.NO_CRED

GSSException.CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED

- createContext

```java
public abstract
GSSContext
createContext​(
GSSCredential
myCred)
throws
GSSException
```

Factory method for creating a context on the acceptor' side. The
context's properties will be determined from the input token supplied
to the accept method.

Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
permission to accept a security context. A failed permission check
might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from this method.

**Parameters:** myCred

- the credentials for the acceptor. Use

null

to act as a default acceptor principal.
**Returns:** an unestablished GSSContext
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.NO_CRED

GSSException.CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED

GSSException.BAD_MECH

GSSException.FAILURE
**See Also:** GSSContext

- createContext

```java
public abstract
GSSContext
createContext​(byte[] interProcessToken)
throws
GSSException
```

Factory method for creating a previously exported context. The
context properties will be determined from the input token and
cannot be modified through the set methods.

Implementations are not required to support the inter-process
transfer of security contexts. Before exporting a context, calling
the

GSSContext.isTransferable

will indicate if the context is transferable. Calling this method in
an implementation that does not support it will result in a

GSSException

with the error
code

GSSException.UNAVAILABLE

.

Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
permission to initiate or accept a security context. A failed
permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from this method.

**Parameters:** interProcessToken

- the token previously emitted from the
export method.
**Returns:** the previously established GSSContext
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.NO_CONTEXT

,

GSSException.DEFECTIVE_TOKEN

,

GSSException.UNAVAILABLE

- addProviderAtFront

```java
public abstract void addProviderAtFront​(
Provider
p,

Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException
```

This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
application would like a particular provider to be used ahead of all
others when support is desired for the given mechanism. When a value
of null is used instead of an

Oid

for the mechanism,
the GSSManager must use the indicated provider ahead of all others
no matter what the mechanism is. Only when the indicated provider
does not support the needed mechanism should the GSSManager move on
to a different provider.

Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
lowers them in preference thus forming an ordered list of provider
and

Oid

pairs that grows at the top.

Calling addProviderAtFront with a null

Oid

will remove
all previous preferences that were set for this provider in the
GSSManager instance. Calling addProviderAtFront with a non-null

Oid

will remove any previous preference that was set
using this mechanism and this provider together.

If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
operation is unavailable.

Suppose an application desired that the provider A always be checked
first when any mechanism is needed, it would call:

```java
GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
// mgr may at this point have its own pre-configured list
// of provider preferences. The following will prepend to
// any such list:

mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, null);
```

Now if it also desired that the mechanism of Oid m1 always be
obtained from the provider B before the previously set A was checked,
it would call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, m1);
```

The GSSManager would then first check with B if m1 was needed. In
case B did not provide support for m1, the GSSManager would continue
on to check with A. If any mechanism m2 is needed where m2 is
different from m1 then the GSSManager would skip B and check with A
directly.

Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
GSSManager instance:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, null)
```

then the previous setting with the pair (B, m1) is subsumed by this
and should be removed. Effectively the list of preferences now
becomes {(B, null), (A, null),
... //followed by the pre-configured list.

Please note, however, that the following call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, m3)
```

does not subsume the previous setting of (A, null) and the list will
effectively become {(A, m3), (B, null), (A, null), ...}

**Parameters:** p

- the provider instance that should be used whenever support
is needed for mech.
**Parameters:** mech

- the mechanism for which the provider is being set
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.UNAVAILABLE

,

GSSException.FAILURE

- addProviderAtEnd

```java
public abstract void addProviderAtEnd​(
Provider
p,

Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException
```

This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
application would like a particular provider to be used if no other
provider can be found that supports the given mechanism. When a value
of null is used instead of an Oid for the mechanism, the GSSManager
must use the indicated provider for any mechanism.

Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
raises them above newer ones in preference thus forming an ordered
list of providers and Oid pairs that grows at the bottom. Thus the
older provider settings will be utilized first before this one is.

If there are any previously existing preferences that conflict with
the preference being set here, then the GSSManager should ignore this
request.

If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
operation is unavailable.

Suppose an application desired that when a mechanism of Oid m1 is
needed the system default providers always be checked first, and only
when they do not support m1 should a provider A be checked. It would
then make the call:

```java
GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, m1);
```

Now, if it also desired that for all mechanisms the provider B be
checked after all configured providers have been checked, it would
then call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, null);
```

Effectively the list of preferences now becomes {..., (A, m1), (B,
null)}.

Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
GSSManager instance:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, m2)
```

then the previous setting with the pair (B, null) subsumes this and
therefore this request should be ignored. The same would happen if a
request is made for the already existing pairs of (A, m1) or (B,
null).

Please note, however, that the following call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, null)
```

is not subsumed by the previous setting of (A, m1) and the list will
effectively become {..., (A, m1), (B, null), (A, null)}

**Parameters:** p

- the provider instance that should be used whenever support
is needed for mech.
**Parameters:** mech

- the mechanism for which the provider is being set
**Throws:** GSSException

Factory method to convert a string name from the
specified namespace to a GSSName object. In general, the

GSSName

object created will contain multiple
representations of the name, one for each mechanism that is
supported; two examples that are exceptions to this are when
the namespace type parameter indicates NT_EXPORT_NAME or when the
GSS-API implementation is not multi-mechanism. It is
not recommended to use this method with a NT_EXPORT_NAME type because
representing a previously exported name consisting of arbitrary bytes
as a String might cause problems with character encoding schemes. In
such cases it is recommended that the bytes be passed in directly to
the overloaded form of this method

createName

.

**Parameters:** nameStr

- the string representing a printable form of the name to
create.
**Parameters:** nameType

- the Oid specifying the namespace of the printable name
supplied.

null

can be used to specify
that a mechanism specific default printable syntax should
be assumed by each mechanism that examines nameStr.
It is not advisable to use the nametype NT_EXPORT_NAME with this
method.
**Returns:** a GSSName representing the indicated principal

- createCredential

```java
public abstract
GSSCredential
createCredential​(int usage)
throws
GSSException
```

Factory method for acquiring default credentials. This will cause
the GSS-API to use system specific defaults for the set of mechanisms,
name, and lifetime.

GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from
this method.

**Parameters:** usage

- The intended usage for this credential object. The value
of this parameter must be one of:

GSSCredential.INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT

,

GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY

, and

GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY

Factory method for acquiring a single mechanism credential.

GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from
this method.

Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the
underlying mechanisms, thus applications should be prepared to call

getRemainingLifetime

on the returned credential.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the principal for whom this credential is to be
acquired. Use

null

to specify the default principal.
**Parameters:** lifetime

- The number of seconds that credentials should remain
valid. Use

GSSException
```

Factory method for acquiring credentials over a set of
mechanisms. This method attempts to acquire credentials for
each of the mechanisms specified in the array called mechs. To
determine the list of mechanisms for which the acquisition of
credentials succeeded, the caller should use the

GSSCredential.getMechs

method.

GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from
this method.

Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the
underlying mechanisms, thus applications should be prepared to call

getRemainingLifetime

on the returned credential.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the principal for whom this credential is to
be acquired. Use

null

to specify the default
principal.
**Parameters:** lifetime

- The number of seconds that credentials should remain
valid. Use

GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME

to request that the credentials
have the maximum permitted lifetime. Use

GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME

to
request default credential lifetime.
**Parameters:** mechs

- an array of Oid's indicating the mechanisms over which
the credential is to be acquired. Use

(Oid[]) null

for
requesting a system specific default set of mechanisms.

GSSName
peer,

Oid
mech,

GSSCredential
myCred,
int lifetime)
throws
GSSException
```

Factory method for creating a context on the initiator's
side.

Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
permission to initiate a security context. A failed permission check
might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from this method.

Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the
underlying mechanism, thus applications should be prepared to call

getLifetime

on the returned
context.

**Parameters:** peer

- the name of the target peer.
**Parameters:** mech

- the Oid of the desired mechanism. Use

null

to request the default mechanism.
**Parameters:** myCred

- the credentials of the initiator. Use

null

to act as the default initiator principal.
**Parameters:** lifetime

- the lifetime, in seconds, requested for the
context. Use

GSSContext.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME

to request that the context have the
maximum permitted lifetime. Use

GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME

```

Factory method for creating a context on the acceptor' side. The
context's properties will be determined from the input token supplied
to the accept method.

Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
permission to accept a security context. A failed permission check
might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from this method.

**Parameters:** myCred

- the credentials for the acceptor. Use

null

to act as a default acceptor principal.
**Returns:** an unestablished GSSContext
**Throws:** GSSException

**See Also:** GSSContext

- createContext

```java
public abstract
GSSContext
createContext​(byte[] interProcessToken)
throws
GSSException
```

Factory method for creating a previously exported context. The
context properties will be determined from the input token and
cannot be modified through the set methods.

Implementations are not required to support the inter-process
transfer of security contexts. Before exporting a context, calling
the

GSSContext.isTransferable

will indicate if the context is transferable. Calling this method in
an implementation that does not support it will result in a

GSSException

with the error
code

GSSException.UNAVAILABLE

.

Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
permission to initiate or accept a security context. A failed
permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from this method.

**Parameters:** interProcessToken

- the token previously emitted from the
export method.
**Returns:** the previously established GSSContext
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

- addProviderAtFront

```java
public abstract void addProviderAtFront​(
Provider
p,

Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException
```

This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
application would like a particular provider to be used ahead of all
others when support is desired for the given mechanism. When a value
of null is used instead of an

Oid

for the mechanism,
the GSSManager must use the indicated provider ahead of all others
no matter what the mechanism is. Only when the indicated provider
does not support the needed mechanism should the GSSManager move on
to a different provider.

Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
lowers them in preference thus forming an ordered list of provider
and

Oid

pairs that grows at the top.

Calling addProviderAtFront with a null

Oid

will remove
all previous preferences that were set for this provider in the
GSSManager instance. Calling addProviderAtFront with a non-null

Oid

will remove any previous preference that was set
using this mechanism and this provider together.

If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
operation is unavailable.

Suppose an application desired that the provider A always be checked
first when any mechanism is needed, it would call:

```java
GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
// mgr may at this point have its own pre-configured list
// of provider preferences. The following will prepend to
// any such list:

mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, null);
```

Now if it also desired that the mechanism of Oid m1 always be
obtained from the provider B before the previously set A was checked,
it would call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, m1);
```

The GSSManager would then first check with B if m1 was needed. In
case B did not provide support for m1, the GSSManager would continue
on to check with A. If any mechanism m2 is needed where m2 is
different from m1 then the GSSManager would skip B and check with A
directly.

Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
GSSManager instance:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, null)
```

then the previous setting with the pair (B, m1) is subsumed by this
and should be removed. Effectively the list of preferences now
becomes {(B, null), (A, null),
... //followed by the pre-configured list.

Please note, however, that the following call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, m3)
```

does not subsume the previous setting of (A, null) and the list will
effectively become {(A, m3), (B, null), (A, null), ...}

**Parameters:** p

- the provider instance that should be used whenever support
is needed for mech.
**Parameters:** mech

- the mechanism for which the provider is being set
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.UNAVAILABLE

,

GSSException.FAILURE

- addProviderAtEnd

```java
public abstract void addProviderAtEnd​(
Provider
p,

Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException
```

This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
application would like a particular provider to be used if no other
provider can be found that supports the given mechanism. When a value
of null is used instead of an Oid for the mechanism, the GSSManager
must use the indicated provider for any mechanism.

Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
raises them above newer ones in preference thus forming an ordered
list of providers and Oid pairs that grows at the bottom. Thus the
older provider settings will be utilized first before this one is.

If there are any previously existing preferences that conflict with
the preference being set here, then the GSSManager should ignore this
request.

If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
operation is unavailable.

Suppose an application desired that when a mechanism of Oid m1 is
needed the system default providers always be checked first, and only
when they do not support m1 should a provider A be checked. It would
then make the call:

```java
GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, m1);
```

Now, if it also desired that for all mechanisms the provider B be
checked after all configured providers have been checked, it would
then call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, null);
```

Effectively the list of preferences now becomes {..., (A, m1), (B,
null)}.

Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
GSSManager instance:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, m2)
```

then the previous setting with the pair (B, null) subsumes this and
therefore this request should be ignored. The same would happen if a
request is made for the already existing pairs of (A, m1) or (B,
null).

Please note, however, that the following call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, null)
```

is not subsumed by the previous setting of (A, m1) and the list will
effectively become {..., (A, m1), (B, null), (A, null)}

**Parameters:** p

- the provider instance that should be used whenever support
is needed for mech.
**Parameters:** mech

- the mechanism for which the provider is being set
**Throws:** GSSException

- containing the following
major error codes:

GSSException.UNAVAILABLE

Factory method to convert a string name from the
specified namespace to a GSSName object and canonicalize it at the
same time for a mechanism. In other words, this method is
a utility that does the equivalent of two steps: the

createName

and then also the

GSSName.canonicalize

.

**Parameters:** nameStr

- the string representing a printable form of the name to
create.
**Parameters:** nameType

- the Oid specifying the namespace of the printable name
supplied.

null

can be used to specify
that a mechanism specific default printable syntax should
be assumed by each mechanism that examines nameStr.
It is not advisable to use the nametype NT_EXPORT_NAME with this
method.
**Parameters:** mech

- Oid specifying the mechanism for which the name should be
canonicalized
**Returns:** a GSSName representing the indicated principal
**Throws:** GSSException

Factory method for acquiring default credentials. This will cause
the GSS-API to use system specific defaults for the set of mechanisms,
name, and lifetime.

GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a

SecurityException

to be thrown from
this method.

**Parameters:** usage

- The intended usage for this credential object. The value
of this parameter must be one of:

addProviderAtFront

```java
public abstract void addProviderAtFront​(
Provider
p,

Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException
```

This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
application would like a particular provider to be used ahead of all
others when support is desired for the given mechanism. When a value
of null is used instead of an

Oid

for the mechanism,
the GSSManager must use the indicated provider ahead of all others
no matter what the mechanism is. Only when the indicated provider
does not support the needed mechanism should the GSSManager move on
to a different provider.

Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
lowers them in preference thus forming an ordered list of provider
and

Oid

pairs that grows at the top.

Calling addProviderAtFront with a null

Oid

will remove
all previous preferences that were set for this provider in the
GSSManager instance. Calling addProviderAtFront with a non-null

Oid

will remove any previous preference that was set
using this mechanism and this provider together.

If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
operation is unavailable.

Suppose an application desired that the provider A always be checked
first when any mechanism is needed, it would call:

```java
GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
// mgr may at this point have its own pre-configured list
// of provider preferences. The following will prepend to
// any such list:

mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, null);
```

Now if it also desired that the mechanism of Oid m1 always be
obtained from the provider B before the previously set A was checked,
it would call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, m1);
```

The GSSManager would then first check with B if m1 was needed. In
case B did not provide support for m1, the GSSManager would continue
on to check with A. If any mechanism m2 is needed where m2 is
different from m1 then the GSSManager would skip B and check with A
directly.

Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
GSSManager instance:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, null)
```

then the previous setting with the pair (B, m1) is subsumed by this
and should be removed. Effectively the list of preferences now
becomes {(B, null), (A, null),
... //followed by the pre-configured list.

Please note, however, that the following call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, m3)
```

does not subsume the previous setting of (A, null) and the list will
effectively become {(A, m3), (B, null), (A, null), ...}

**Parameters:** p

- the provider instance that should be used whenever support
is needed for mech.
**Parameters:** mech

Now if it also desired that the mechanism of Oid m1 always be
obtained from the provider B before the previously set A was checked,
it would call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, m1);
```

The GSSManager would then first check with B if m1 was needed. In
case B did not provide support for m1, the GSSManager would continue
on to check with A. If any mechanism m2 is needed where m2 is
different from m1 then the GSSManager would skip B and check with A
directly.

Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
GSSManager instance:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, null)
```

then the previous setting with the pair (B, m1) is subsumed by this
and should be removed. Effectively the list of preferences now
becomes {(B, null), (A, null),
... //followed by the pre-configured list.

Please note, however, that the following call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, m3)
```

does not subsume the previous setting of (A, null) and the list will
effectively become {(A, m3), (B, null), (A, null), ...}

GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
// mgr may at this point have its own pre-configured list
// of provider preferences. The following will prepend to
// any such list:

mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, null);

mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, m1);

Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
GSSManager instance:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, null)
```

then the previous setting with the pair (B, m1) is subsumed by this
and should be removed. Effectively the list of preferences now
becomes {(B, null), (A, null),
... //followed by the pre-configured list.

```

does not subsume the previous setting of (A, null) and the list will
effectively become {(A, m3), (B, null), (A, null), ...}

mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, null)

Please note, however, that the following call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, m3)
```

does not subsume the previous setting of (A, null) and the list will
effectively become {(A, m3), (B, null), (A, null), ...}

mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, m3)

addProviderAtEnd

```java
public abstract void addProviderAtEnd​(
Provider
p,

Oid
mech)
throws
GSSException
```

This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
application would like a particular provider to be used if no other
provider can be found that supports the given mechanism. When a value
of null is used instead of an Oid for the mechanism, the GSSManager
must use the indicated provider for any mechanism.

Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
raises them above newer ones in preference thus forming an ordered
list of providers and Oid pairs that grows at the bottom. Thus the
older provider settings will be utilized first before this one is.

If there are any previously existing preferences that conflict with
the preference being set here, then the GSSManager should ignore this
request.

If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
operation is unavailable.

Suppose an application desired that when a mechanism of Oid m1 is
needed the system default providers always be checked first, and only
when they do not support m1 should a provider A be checked. It would
then make the call:

```java
GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, m1);
```

Now, if it also desired that for all mechanisms the provider B be
checked after all configured providers have been checked, it would
then call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, null);
```

Effectively the list of preferences now becomes {..., (A, m1), (B,
null)}.

Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
GSSManager instance:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, m2)
```

then the previous setting with the pair (B, null) subsumes this and
therefore this request should be ignored. The same would happen if a
request is made for the already existing pairs of (A, m1) or (B,
null).

Please note, however, that the following call:

```java
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, null)
```

is not subsumed by the previous setting of (A, m1) and the list will
effectively become {..., (A, m1), (B, null), (A, null)}
