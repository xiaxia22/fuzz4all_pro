# Class MonthDay

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\MonthDay.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
MonthDay

extends
Object

implements
TemporalAccessor
,
TemporalAdjuster
,
Comparable
<
MonthDay
>,
Serializable
```

A month-day in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as

--12-03

.

MonthDay

is an immutable date-time object that represents the combination
of a month and day-of-month. Any field that can be derived from a month and day,
such as quarter-of-year, can be obtained.

This class does not store or represent a year, time or time-zone.
For example, the value "December 3rd" can be stored in a

MonthDay

.

Since a

MonthDay

does not possess a year, the leap day of
February 29th is considered valid.

This class implements

TemporalAccessor

rather than

Temporal

.
This is because it is not possible to define whether February 29th is valid or not
without external information, preventing the implementation of plus/minus.
Related to this,

MonthDay

only provides access to query and set the fields

MONTH_OF_YEAR

and

DAY_OF_MONTH

.

The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.

This is a

value-based

class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
(

==

), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of

MonthDay

may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
The

equals

method should be used for comparisons.

### Method Details

#### public static
MonthDay
now()

Obtains the current month-day from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current month-day.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Returns:**
- the current month-day using the system clock and default time-zone, not null

---

#### public static
MonthDay
now​(
ZoneId
zone)

Obtains the current month-day from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current month-day.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the zone ID to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the current month-day using the system clock, not null

---

#### public static
MonthDay
now​(
Clock
clock)

Obtains the current month-day from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current month-day.
Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

**Parameters:**
- clock

- the clock to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the current month-day, not null

---

#### public static
MonthDay
of​(
Month
month,
int dayOfMonth)

Obtains an instance of

MonthDay

.

The day-of-month must be valid for the month within a leap year.
Hence, for February, day 29 is valid.

For example, passing in April and day 31 will throw an exception, as
there can never be April 31st in any year. By contrast, passing in
February 29th is permitted, as that month-day can sometimes be valid.

**Parameters:**
- month

- the month-of-year to represent, not null
- dayOfMonth

- the day-of-month to represent, from 1 to 31

**Returns:**
- the month-day, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the value of any field is out of range,
or if the day-of-month is invalid for the month

---

#### public static
MonthDay
of​(int month,
int dayOfMonth)

Obtains an instance of

MonthDay

.

The day-of-month must be valid for the month within a leap year.
Hence, for month 2 (February), day 29 is valid.

For example, passing in month 4 (April) and day 31 will throw an exception, as
there can never be April 31st in any year. By contrast, passing in
February 29th is permitted, as that month-day can sometimes be valid.

**Parameters:**
- month

- the month-of-year to represent, from 1 (January) to 12 (December)
- dayOfMonth

- the day-of-month to represent, from 1 to 31

**Returns:**
- the month-day, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the value of any field is out of range,
or if the day-of-month is invalid for the month

---

#### public static
MonthDay
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)

Obtains an instance of

MonthDay

from a temporal object.

This obtains a month-day based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

MonthDay

.

The conversion extracts the

MONTH_OF_YEAR

and

DAY_OF_MONTH

fields.
The extraction is only permitted if the temporal object has an ISO
chronology, or can be converted to a

LocalDate

.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

MonthDay::from

.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null

**Returns:**
- the month-day, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

MonthDay

---

#### public static
MonthDay
parse​(
CharSequence
text)

Obtains an instance of

MonthDay

from a text string such as

--12-03

.

The string must represent a valid month-day.
The format is

--MM-dd

.

**Parameters:**
- text

- the text to parse such as "--12-03", not null

**Returns:**
- the parsed month-day, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

---

#### public static
MonthDay
parse​(
CharSequence
text,

DateTimeFormatter
formatter)

Obtains an instance of

MonthDay

from a text string using a specific formatter.

The text is parsed using the formatter, returning a month-day.

**Parameters:**
- text

- the text to parse, not null
- formatter

- the formatter to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the parsed month-day, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

---

#### public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if this month-day can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

range

and

get

methods will throw an exception.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The supported fields are:

- MONTH_OF_YEAR

YEAR

All other

ChronoField

instances will return false.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:**
- isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if the field is supported on this month-day, false if not

---

#### public
ValueRange
range​(
TemporalField
field)

Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
This month-day is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return
appropriate range instances.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the range can be obtained is determined by the field.

**Specified by:**
- range

in interface

TemporalAccessor

int

.

This queries this month-day for the value of the specified field.
The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return valid
values based on this month-day.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

---

#### public <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)

Queries this month-day using the specified query.

This queries this month-day using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:**
- query

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- query

- the query to invoke, not null

**Returns:**
- the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)

---

#### public
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have this month-day.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the month and day-of-month changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR

and

ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH

as the fields.
If the specified temporal object does not use the ISO calendar system then
a

DateTimeException

is thrown.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisMonthDay.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisMonthDay);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null

LocalDate

.

This returns a

LocalDate

formed from this month-day and the specified year.

A month-day of February 29th will be adjusted to February 28th in the resulting
date if the year is not a leap year.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:**
- year

- the year to use, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR

**Returns:**
- the local date formed from this month-day and the specified year, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the year is outside the valid range of years

---

For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- now

```java
public static
MonthDay
now()
```

Obtains the current month-day from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current month-day.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Returns:** the current month-day using the system clock and default time-zone, not null

- now

```java
public static
MonthDay
now​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains the current month-day from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current month-day.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:** zone

- the zone ID to use, not null
**Returns:** the current month-day using the system clock, not null

- now

```java
public static
MonthDay
now​(
Clock
clock)
```

Obtains the current month-day from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current month-day.
Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

**Parameters:** clock

- the clock to use, not null
**Returns:** the current month-day, not null

- of

```java
public static
MonthDay
of​(
Month
month,
int dayOfMonth)
```

Obtains an instance of

MonthDay

.

The day-of-month must be valid for the month within a leap year.
Hence, for February, day 29 is valid.

For example, passing in April and day 31 will throw an exception, as
there can never be April 31st in any year. By contrast, passing in
February 29th is permitted, as that month-day can sometimes be valid.

**Parameters:** month

- the month-of-year to represent, not null
**Parameters:** dayOfMonth

- the day-of-month to represent, from 1 to 31
**Returns:** the month-day, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the value of any field is out of range,
or if the day-of-month is invalid for the month

- of

```java
public static
MonthDay
of​(int month,
int dayOfMonth)
```

Obtains an instance of

MonthDay

.

The day-of-month must be valid for the month within a leap year.
Hence, for month 2 (February), day 29 is valid.

For example, passing in month 4 (April) and day 31 will throw an exception, as
there can never be April 31st in any year. By contrast, passing in
February 29th is permitted, as that month-day can sometimes be valid.

**Parameters:** month

- the month-of-year to represent, from 1 (January) to 12 (December)
**Parameters:** dayOfMonth

- the day-of-month to represent, from 1 to 31
**Returns:** the month-day, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the value of any field is out of range,
or if the day-of-month is invalid for the month

- from

```java
public static
MonthDay
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

MonthDay

from a temporal object.

This obtains a month-day based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

MonthDay

.

The conversion extracts the

MONTH_OF_YEAR

and

DAY_OF_MONTH

fields.
The extraction is only permitted if the temporal object has an ISO
chronology, or can be converted to a

LocalDate

.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

MonthDay::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the month-day, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

MonthDay

- parse

```java
public static
MonthDay
parse​(
CharSequence
text)
```

Obtains an instance of

MonthDay

from a text string such as

--12-03

.

The string must represent a valid month-day.
The format is

--MM-dd

.

**Parameters:** text

- the text to parse such as "--12-03", not null
**Returns:** the parsed month-day, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- parse

```java
public static
MonthDay
parse​(
CharSequence
text,

DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Obtains an instance of

MonthDay

from a text string using a specific formatter.

The text is parsed using the formatter, returning a month-day.

**Parameters:** text

- the text to parse, not null
**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the parsed month-day, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- isSupported

```java
public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if this month-day can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

range

and

get

methods will throw an exception.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The supported fields are:

- MONTH_OF_YEAR

YEAR

All other

ChronoField

instances will return false.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the field is supported on this month-day, false if not

- range

```java
public
ValueRange
range​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
This month-day is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return
appropriate range instances.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the range can be obtained is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** range

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to query the range for, not null
**Returns:** the range of valid values for the field, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the range for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported

- get

```java
public int get​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the value of the specified field from this month-day as an

int

.

This queries this month-day for the value of the specified field.
The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return valid
values based on this month-day.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** get

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to get, not null
**Returns:** the value for the field
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained or
the value is outside the range of valid values for the field
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported or
the range of values exceeds an

int
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- getLong

```java
public long getLong​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the value of the specified field from this month-day as a

long

.

This queries this month-day for the value of the specified field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return valid
values based on this month-day.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** getLong

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to get, not null
**Returns:** the value for the field
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- getMonthValue

```java
public int getMonthValue()
```

Gets the month-of-year field from 1 to 12.

This method returns the month as an

int

from 1 to 12.
Application code is frequently clearer if the enum

Month

is used by calling

getMonth()

.

**Returns:** the month-of-year, from 1 to 12
**See Also:** getMonth()

- getMonth

```java
public
Month
getMonth()
```

Gets the month-of-year field using the

Month

enum.

This method returns the enum

Month

for the month.
This avoids confusion as to what

int

values mean.
If you need access to the primitive

int

value then the enum
provides the

int value

.

**Returns:** the month-of-year, not null
**See Also:** getMonthValue()

- getDayOfMonth

```java
public int getDayOfMonth()
```

Gets the day-of-month field.

int

value for the day-of-month.

**Returns:** the day-of-month, from 1 to 31

- isValidYear

```java
public boolean isValidYear​(int year)
```

Checks if the year is valid for this month-day.

This method checks whether this month and day and the input year form
a valid date. This can only return false for February 29th.

**Parameters:** year

- the year to validate
**Returns:** true if the year is valid for this month-day
**See Also:** Year.isValidMonthDay(MonthDay)

- withMonth

```java
public
MonthDay
withMonth​(int month)
```

Returns a copy of this

MonthDay

with the month-of-year altered.

This returns a month-day with the specified month.
If the day-of-month is invalid for the specified month, the day will
be adjusted to the last valid day-of-month.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** month

- the month-of-year to set in the returned month-day, from 1 (January) to 12 (December)
**Returns:** a

MonthDay

based on this month-day with the requested month, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the month-of-year value is invalid

- with

```java
public
MonthDay
with​(
Month
month)
```

Returns a copy of this

MonthDay

with the month-of-year altered.

This returns a month-day with the specified month.
If the day-of-month is invalid for the specified month, the day will
be adjusted to the last valid day-of-month.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** month

- the month-of-year to set in the returned month-day, not null
**Returns:** a

MonthDay

based on this month-day with the requested month, not null

- withDayOfMonth

```java
public
MonthDay
withDayOfMonth​(int dayOfMonth)
```

Returns a copy of this

MonthDay

with the day-of-month altered.

This returns a month-day with the specified day-of-month.
If the day-of-month is invalid for the month, an exception is thrown.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** dayOfMonth

- the day-of-month to set in the return month-day, from 1 to 31
**Returns:** a

MonthDay

based on this month-day with the requested day, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the day-of-month value is invalid,
or if the day-of-month is invalid for the month

- query

```java
public <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this month-day using the specified query.

This queries this month-day using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

- adjustInto

```java
public
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)
```

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have this month-day.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the month and day-of-month changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR

and

ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH

as the fields.
If the specified temporal object does not use the ISO calendar system then
a

DateTimeException

is thrown.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisMonthDay.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisMonthDay);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- format

```java
public
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Formats this month-day using the specified formatter.

This month-day will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the formatted month-day string, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

- atYear

```java
public
LocalDate
atYear​(int year)
```

Combines this month-day with a year to create a

LocalDate

.

This returns a

LocalDate

formed from this month-day and the specified year.

A month-day of February 29th will be adjusted to February 28th in the resulting
date if the year is not a leap year.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** year

- the year to use, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR
**Returns:** the local date formed from this month-day and the specified year, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the year is outside the valid range of years

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
MonthDay
other)
```

- query

```java
public <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this month-day using the specified query.

This queries this month-day using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

- adjustInto

```java
public
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)
```

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have this month-day.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the month and day-of-month changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR

and

ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH

as the fields.
If the specified temporal object does not use the ISO calendar system then
a

DateTimeException

is thrown.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisMonthDay.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisMonthDay);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
