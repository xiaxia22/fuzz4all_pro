# Class ComponentSampleModel

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\ComponentSampleModel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ComponentSampleModel

extends
SampleModel
```

This class represents image data which is stored such that each sample
of a pixel occupies one data element of the DataBuffer. It stores the
N samples which make up a pixel in N separate data array elements.
Different bands may be in different banks of the DataBuffer.
Accessor methods are provided so that image data can be manipulated
directly. This class can support different kinds of interleaving, e.g.
band interleaving, scanline interleaving, and pixel interleaving.
Pixel stride is the number of data array elements between two samples
for the same band on the same scanline. Scanline stride is the number
of data array elements between a given sample and the corresponding sample
in the same column of the next scanline. Band offsets denote the number
of data array elements from the first data array element of the bank
of the DataBuffer holding each band to the first sample of the band.
The bands are numbered from 0 to N-1. This class can represent image
data for which each sample is an unsigned integral number which can be
stored in 8, 16, or 32 bits (using

DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT

, or

DataBuffer.TYPE_INT

,
respectively), data for which each sample is a signed integral number
which can be stored in 16 bits (using

DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT

),
or data for which each sample is a signed float or double quantity
(using

DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT

or

DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE

, respectively).
All samples of a given ComponentSampleModel
are stored with the same precision. All strides and offsets must be
non-negative. This class supports

TYPE_BYTE

,

TYPE_USHORT

,

TYPE_SHORT

,

TYPE_INT

,

TYPE_FLOAT

,

TYPE_DOUBLE

,

#### public
Object
getDataElements​(int x,
int y,

Object
obj,

DataBuffer
data)

Returns data for a single pixel in a primitive array of type

TransferType

. For a

ComponentSampleModel

,
this is the same as the data type, and samples are returned
one per array element. Generally,

obj

should
be passed in as

null

, so that the

Object

is created automatically and is the right primitive data type.

The following code illustrates transferring data for one pixel from

DataBuffer db1

, whose storage layout is
described by

ComponentSampleModel csm1

,
to

DataBuffer db2

, whose storage layout
is described by

ComponentSampleModel csm2

.
The transfer is usually more efficient than using

getPixel

and

setPixel

.

```java
ComponentSampleModel csm1, csm2;
DataBufferInt db1, db2;
csm2.setDataElements(x, y,
csm1.getDataElements(x, y, null, db1), db2);
```

Using

getDataElements

and

setDataElements

to transfer between two

DataBuffer/SampleModel

pairs is legitimate if the

SampleModel

objects have
the same number of bands, corresponding bands have the same number of
bits per sample, and the

TransferType

s are the same.

If

obj

is not

null

, it should be a
primitive array of type

TransferType

.
Otherwise, a

ClassCastException

is thrown. An

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

might be thrown if the
coordinates are not in bounds, or if

obj

is not

null

and is not large enough to hold
the pixel data.

**Specified by:**

- getNumDataElements

```java
public final int getNumDataElements()
```

Returns the number of data elements needed to transfer a pixel
with the

getDataElements(int, int, Object, DataBuffer)

and

setDataElements(int, int, Object, DataBuffer)

methods.
For a

ComponentSampleModel

, this is identical to the
number of bands.

**Specified by:** getNumDataElements

in class

SampleModel
**Returns:** the number of data elements needed to transfer a pixel with
the

getDataElements

and

setDataElements

methods.
**See Also:** SampleModel.getNumDataElements()

,

SampleModel.getNumBands()

- getDataElements

```java
public
Object
getDataElements​(int x,
int y,

Object
obj,

DataBuffer
data)
```

Returns data for a single pixel in a primitive array of type

TransferType

. For a

ComponentSampleModel

,
this is the same as the data type, and samples are returned
one per array element. Generally,

obj

should
be passed in as

null

, so that the

Object

is created automatically and is the right primitive data type.

The following code illustrates transferring data for one pixel from

DataBuffer db1

, whose storage layout is
described by

ComponentSampleModel csm1

,
to

DataBuffer db2

, whose storage layout
is described by

ComponentSampleModel csm2

.
The transfer is usually more efficient than using

getPixel

and

setPixel

.

```java
ComponentSampleModel csm1, csm2;
DataBufferInt db1, db2;
csm2.setDataElements(x, y,
csm1.getDataElements(x, y, null, db1), db2);
```

Using

getDataElements

and

setDataElements

to transfer between two

DataBuffer/SampleModel

pairs is legitimate if the

SampleModel

objects have
the same number of bands, corresponding bands have the same number of
bits per sample, and the

TransferType

s are the same.

If

obj

is not

null

, it should be a
primitive array of type

TransferType

.
Otherwise, a

ClassCastException

is thrown. An

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

might be thrown if the
coordinates are not in bounds, or if

obj

is not

null

and is not large enough to hold
the pixel data.

**Specified by:** getDataElements

in class

SampleModel
**Parameters:** x

- the X coordinate of the pixel location
**Parameters:** y

- the Y coordinate of the pixel location
**Parameters:** obj

- if non-

null

, a primitive array
in which to return the pixel data
**Parameters:** data

- the

DataBuffer

containing the image data
**Returns:** the data of the specified pixel
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if data is null.
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the coordinates are
not in bounds, or if obj is too small to hold the output.
**See Also:** setDataElements(int, int, Object, DataBuffer)

- getPixel

```java
public int[] getPixel​(int x,
int y,
int[] iArray,

DataBuffer
data)
```

Returns all samples for the specified pixel in an int array,
one sample per array element.
An

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

might be thrown if
the coordinates are not in bounds.

**Returns:** the samples of the specified pixel.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if data is null.
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the coordinates are
not in bounds, or if iArray is too small to hold the output.
**See Also:** setPixel(int, int, int[], DataBuffer)

- getPixels

```java
public int[] getPixels​(int x,
int y,
int w,
int h,
int[] iArray,

DataBuffer
data)
```

Returns all samples for the specified rectangle of pixels in
an int array, one sample per array element.
An

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

might be thrown if
the coordinates are not in bounds.

- setDataElements

```java
public void setDataElements​(int x,
int y,

Object
obj,

DataBuffer
data)
```

Sets the data for a single pixel in the specified

DataBuffer

from a primitive array of type

TransferType

. For a

ComponentSampleModel

,
this is the same as the data type, and samples are transferred
one per array element.

The following code illustrates transferring data for one pixel from

DataBuffer db1

, whose storage layout is
described by

ComponentSampleModel csm1

,
to

DataBuffer db2

, whose storage layout
is described by

ComponentSampleModel csm2

.
The transfer is usually more efficient than using

getPixel

and

setPixel

.

```java
ComponentSampleModel csm1, csm2;
DataBufferInt db1, db2;
csm2.setDataElements(x, y, csm1.getDataElements(x, y, null, db1),
db2);
```

DataBuffer

data)

Sets the data for a single pixel in the specified

DataBuffer

from a primitive array of type

TransferType

. For a

ComponentSampleModel

,
this is the same as the data type, and samples are transferred
one per array element.

The following code illustrates transferring data for one pixel from

DataBuffer db1

, whose storage layout is
described by

ComponentSampleModel csm1

,
to

DataBuffer db2

, whose storage layout
is described by

ComponentSampleModel csm2

.
The transfer is usually more efficient than using

getPixel

and

setPixel

.

```java
ComponentSampleModel csm1, csm2;
DataBufferInt db1, db2;
csm2.setDataElements(x, y, csm1.getDataElements(x, y, null, db1),
db2);
```

Using

getDataElements

and

setDataElements

to transfer between two

DataBuffer/SampleModel

pairs
is legitimate if the

SampleModel

objects have
the same number of bands, corresponding bands have the same number of
bits per sample, and the

TransferType

s are the same.

A

ClassCastException

is thrown if

obj

is not
a primitive array of type

TransferType

.
An

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

might be thrown if
the coordinates are not in bounds, or if

obj

is not large
enough to hold the pixel data.
