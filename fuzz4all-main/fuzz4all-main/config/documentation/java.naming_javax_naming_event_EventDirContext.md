# Interface EventDirContext

**Source:** `java.naming\javax\naming\event\EventDirContext.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
EventDirContext

extends
EventContext
,
DirContext
```

Contains methods for registering listeners to be notified
of events fired when objects named in a directory context changes.

The methods in this interface support identification of objects by

RFC 2254

search filters.

Using the search filter, it is possible to register interest in objects
that do not exist at the time of registration but later come into existence and
satisfy the filter. However, there might be limitations in the extent
to which this can be supported by the service provider and underlying
protocol/service. If the caller submits a filter that cannot be
supported in this way,

addNamingListener()

throws an

InvalidSearchFilterException

.

See

EventContext

for a description of event source
and target, and information about listener registration/deregistration
that are also applicable to methods in this interface.
See the

package description

for information on threading issues.

A

SearchControls

or array object
passed as a parameter to any method is owned by the caller.
The service provider will not modify the object or keep a reference to it.

### Method Details

#### void addNamingListener​(
Name
target,

String
filter,

SearchControls
ctls,

NamingListener
l)
throws
NamingException

Adds a listener for receiving naming events fired
when objects identified by the search filter

filter

at
the object named by target are modified.

The scope, returningObj flag, and returningAttributes flag from
the search controls

ctls

are used to control the selection
of objects that the listener is interested in,
and determines what information is returned in the eventual

NamingEvent

object. Note that the requested
information to be returned might not be present in the

NamingEvent

object if they are unavailable or could not be obtained by the
service provider or service.

**Parameters:**
- target

- The nonnull name of the object resolved relative to this context.
- filter

- The nonnull string filter (see RFC2254).
- ctls

- The possibly null search controls. If null, the default
search controls are used.
- l

- The nonnull listener.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If a problem was encountered while
adding the listener.

- EventContext.removeNamingListener(javax.naming.event.NamingListener)

---

#### void addNamingListener​(
String
target,

String
filter,

SearchControls
ctls,

NamingListener
l)
throws
NamingException

Adds a listener for receiving naming events fired when
objects identified by the search filter

filter

at the
object named by the string target name are modified.
See the overload that accepts a

Name

for details of
how this method behaves.

**Parameters:**
- target

- The nonnull string name of the object resolved relative to this context.
- filter

- The nonnull string filter (see RFC2254).
- ctls

- The possibly null search controls. If null, the default
search controls is used.
- l

- The nonnull listener.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If a problem was encountered while
adding the listener.

#### void addNamingListener​(
Name
target,

String
filter,

Object
[] filterArgs,

SearchControls
ctls,

NamingListener
l)
throws
NamingException

Adds a listener for receiving naming events fired
when objects identified by the search filter

filter

and
filter arguments at the object named by the target are modified.
The scope, returningObj flag, and returningAttributes flag from
the search controls

ctls

are used to control the selection
of objects that the listener is interested in,
and determines what information is returned in the eventual

NamingEvent

object. Note that the requested
information to be returned might not be present in the

NamingEvent

object if they are unavailable or could not be obtained by the
service provider or service.

**Parameters:**
- target

- The nonnull name of the object resolved relative to this context.
- filter

- The nonnull string filter (see RFC2254).
- filterArgs

- The possibly null array of arguments for the filter.
- ctls

- The possibly null search controls. If null, the default
search controls are used.
- l

- The nonnull listener.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If a problem was encountered while
adding the listener.

#### Method Detail

addNamingListener

```java
void addNamingListener​(
Name
target,

String
filter,

SearchControls
ctls,

NamingListener
l)
throws
NamingException
```

Adds a listener for receiving naming events fired
when objects identified by the search filter

filter

at
the object named by target are modified.

The scope, returningObj flag, and returningAttributes flag from
the search controls

ctls

are used to control the selection
of objects that the listener is interested in,
and determines what information is returned in the eventual

NamingEvent

object. Note that the requested
information to be returned might not be present in the

NamingEvent

object if they are unavailable or could not be obtained by the
service provider or service.

**Parameters:** target

- The nonnull name of the object resolved relative to this context.
**Parameters:** filter

- The nonnull string filter (see RFC2254).
**Parameters:** ctls

- The possibly null search controls. If null, the default
search controls are used.
**Parameters:** l

- The nonnull listener.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If a problem was encountered while
adding the listener.
