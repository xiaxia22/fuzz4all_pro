# Interface DOMImplementation

**Source:** `java.xml\org\w3c\dom\DOMImplementation.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
DOMImplementation
```

The

DOMImplementation

interface provides a number of methods
for performing operations that are independent of any particular instance
of the document object model.

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### boolean hasFeature​(
String
feature,

String
version)

Test if the DOM implementation implements a specific feature and
version, as specified in

DOM Features

.

**Parameters:**
- feature

- The name of the feature to test.
- version

- This is the version number of the feature to test.

**Returns:**
- true

if the feature is implemented in the
specified version,

false

otherwise.

---

#### DocumentType
createDocumentType​(
String
qualifiedName,

String
publicId,

String
systemId)
throws
DOMException

Creates an empty

DocumentType

node. Entity declarations
and notations are not made available. Entity reference expansions and
default attribute additions do not occur..

**Parameters:**
- qualifiedName

- The qualified name of the document type to be
created.
- publicId

- The external subset public identifier.
- systemId

- The external subset system identifier.

**Returns:**
- A new

DocumentType

node with

Node.ownerDocument

set to

null

.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified qualified name is not
an XML name according to [

XML 1.0

].

NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the

qualifiedName

is
malformed.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: May be raised if the implementation does not
support the feature "XML" and the language exposed through the
Document does not support XML Namespaces (such as [

HTML 4.01

]).

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### Document
createDocument​(
String
namespaceURI,

String
qualifiedName,

DocumentType
doctype)
throws
DOMException

Creates a DOM Document object of the specified type with its document
element.

Note that based on the

DocumentType

given to create
the document, the implementation may instantiate specialized

Document

objects that support additional features than
the "Core", such as "HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
. On the other hand, setting the

DocumentType

after the
document was created makes this very unlikely to happen.
Alternatively, specialized

Document

creation methods,
such as

createHTMLDocument

[

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, can be used to obtain specific types of

Document

objects.

**Parameters:**
- namespaceURI

- The namespace URI of the document element to
create or

null

.
- qualifiedName

- The qualified name of the document element to be
created or

null

.
- doctype

- The type of document to be created or

null

.
When

doctype

is not

null

, its

Node.ownerDocument

attribute is set to the document
being created.

**Returns:**
- A new

Document

object with its document element.
If the

NamespaceURI

,

qualifiedName

, and

doctype

are

null

, the returned

Document

is empty with no document element.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified qualified name is not
an XML name according to [

XML 1.0

].

NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the

qualifiedName

is
malformed, if the

qualifiedName

has a prefix and the

namespaceURI

is

null

, or if the

qualifiedName

is

null

and the

namespaceURI

is different from

null

, or
if the

qualifiedName

has a prefix that is "xml" and
the

namespaceURI

is different from "

http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace

" [

XML Namespaces

]
, or if the DOM implementation does not support the

"XML"

feature but a non-null namespace URI was
provided, since namespaces were defined by XML.

WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised if

doctype

has already
been used with a different document or was created from a different
implementation.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: May be raised if the implementation does not
support the feature "XML" and the language exposed through the
Document does not support XML Namespaces (such as [

HTML 4.01

]).

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### Object
getFeature​(
String
feature,

String
version)

This method returns a specialized object which implements the
specialized APIs of the specified feature and version, as specified
in

DOM Features

. The specialized object may also be obtained by using
binding-specific casting methods but is not necessarily expected to,
as discussed in . This method also allow the implementation to
provide specialized objects which do not support the

DOMImplementation

interface.

**Parameters:**
- feature

- The name of the feature requested. Note that any plus
sign "+" prepended to the name of the feature will be ignored since
it is not significant in the context of this method.
- version

- This is the version number of the feature to test.

**Returns:**
- Returns an object which implements the specialized APIs of
the specified feature and version, if any, or

null

if
there is no object which implements interfaces associated with that
feature. If the

DOMObject

returned by this method
implements the

DOMImplementation

interface, it must
delegate to the primary core

DOMImplementation

and not
return results inconsistent with the primary core

DOMImplementation

such as

hasFeature

,

getFeature

, etc.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3
