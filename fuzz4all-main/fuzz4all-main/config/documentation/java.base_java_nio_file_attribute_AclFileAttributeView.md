# Interface AclFileAttributeView

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\file\attribute\AclFileAttributeView.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
AclFileAttributeView

extends
FileOwnerAttributeView
```

A file attribute view that supports reading or updating a file's Access
Control Lists (ACL) or file owner attributes.

ACLs are used to specify access rights to file system objects. An ACL is
an ordered list of

access-control-entries

, each specifying a

UserPrincipal

and the level of access for that user principal. This
file attribute view defines the

getAcl

, and

setAcl

methods to read and write ACLs based on the ACL
model specified in

RFC 3530:
Network File System (NFS) version 4 Protocol

. This file attribute view
is intended for file system implementations that support the NFSv4 ACL model
or have a

well-defined

mapping between the NFSv4 ACL model and the ACL
model used by the file system. The details of such mapping are implementation
dependent and are therefore unspecified.

This class also extends

FileOwnerAttributeView

so as to define
methods to get and set the file owner.

When a file system provides access to a set of

file-systems

that are not homogeneous then only some of the file systems may
support ACLs. The

supportsFileAttributeView

method can be used to test if a file system
supports ACLs.

Interoperability

RFC 3530 allows for special user identities to be used on platforms that
support the POSIX defined access permissions. The special user identities
are "

OWNER@

", "

GROUP@

", and "

EVERYONE@

". When both
the

AclFileAttributeView

and the

PosixFileAttributeView

are supported then these special user identities may be included in ACL

entries

that are read or written. The file system's

UserPrincipalLookupService

may be used to obtain a

UserPrincipal

to represent these special identities by invoking the

lookupPrincipalByName

method.

Usage Example:

Suppose we wish to add an entry to an existing ACL to grant "joe" access:

```java
// lookup "joe"
UserPrincipal joe = file.getFileSystem().getUserPrincipalLookupService()
.lookupPrincipalByName("joe");

// get view
AclFileAttributeView view = Files.getFileAttributeView(file, AclFileAttributeView.class);

// create ACE to give "joe" read access
AclEntry entry = AclEntry.newBuilder()
.setType(AclEntryType.ALLOW)
.setPrincipal(joe)
.setPermissions(AclEntryPermission.READ_DATA, AclEntryPermission.READ_ATTRIBUTES)
.build();

// read ACL, insert ACE, re-write ACL
List<AclEntry> acl = view.getAcl();
acl.add(0, entry); // insert before any DENY entries
view.setAcl(acl);
```

Dynamic Access

Where dynamic access to file attributes is required, the attributes
supported by this attribute view are as follows:

Supported attributes

Name

Type

"acl"

List

<

AclEntry

>

"owner"

UserPrincipal

The

getAttribute

method may be used to read
the ACL or owner attributes as if by invoking the

getAcl

or

getOwner

methods.

The

setAttribute

method may be used to
update the ACL or owner attributes as if by invoking the

setAcl

or

setOwner

methods.

Setting the ACL when creating a file

Implementations supporting this attribute view may also support setting
the initial ACL when creating a file or directory. The initial ACL
may be provided to methods such as

createFile

or

createDirectory

as an

FileAttribute

with

name

"acl:acl"

and a

value

that is the list of

AclEntry

objects.

Where an implementation supports an ACL model that differs from the NFSv4
defined ACL model then setting the initial ACL when creating the file must
translate the ACL to the model supported by the file system. Methods that
create a file should reject (by throwing

IOException

)
any attempt to create a file that would be less secure as a result of the
translation.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### String
name()

Returns the name of the attribute view. Attribute views of this type
have the name

"acl"

.

**Specified by:**
- name

in interface

AttributeView
- name

in interface

FileOwnerAttributeView

**Returns:**
- the name of the attribute view

---

#### List
<
AclEntry
> getAcl()
throws
IOException

Reads the access control list.

When the file system uses an ACL model that differs from the NFSv4
defined ACL model, then this method returns an ACL that is the translation
of the ACL to the NFSv4 ACL model.

The returned list is modifiable so as to facilitate changes to the
existing ACL. The

setAcl

method is used to update
the file's ACL attribute.

**Returns:**
- an ordered list of

entries

representing the
ACL

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, a security manager is
installed, and it denies

RuntimePermission

("accessUserInformation")

or its

checkRead

method
denies read access to the file.

---

#### void setAcl​(
List
<
AclEntry
> acl)
throws
IOException

Updates (replace) the access control list.

Where the file system supports Access Control Lists, and it uses an
ACL model that differs from the NFSv4 defined ACL model, then this method
must translate the ACL to the model supported by the file system. This
method should reject (by throwing

IOException

) any
attempt to write an ACL that would appear to make the file more secure
than would be the case if the ACL were updated. Where an implementation
does not support a mapping of

AclEntryType.AUDIT

or

AclEntryType.ALARM

entries, then this method ignores these entries when
writing the ACL.

If an ACL entry contains a

user-principal

that is not associated with the same provider as this attribute view then

ProviderMismatchException

is thrown. Additional validation, if
any, is implementation dependent.

If the file system supports other security related file attributes
(such as a file

access-permissions

for example), the updating the access control list
may also cause these security related attributes to be updated.

**Parameters:**
- acl

- the new access control list

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the ACL is invalid
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, a security manager is
installed, it denies

RuntimePermission

("accessUserInformation")

or its

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file.

Where an implementation supports an ACL model that differs from the NFSv4
defined ACL model then setting the initial ACL when creating the file must
translate the ACL to the model supported by the file system. Methods that
create a file should reject (by throwing

IOException

)
any attempt to create a file that would be less secure as a result of the
translation.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- name

```java

Returns the name of the attribute view. Attribute views of this type
have the name

"acl"

.

**Specified by:** name

in interface

AttributeView
**Specified by:** name

FileOwnerAttributeView
**Returns:** the name of the attribute view

- getAcl

```java
List
<
AclEntry
> getAcl()
throws
IOException
```

Reads the access control list.

When the file system uses an ACL model that differs from the NFSv4
defined ACL model, then this method returns an ACL that is the translation
of the ACL to the NFSv4 ACL model.

The returned list is modifiable so as to facilitate changes to the
existing ACL. The

setAcl

method is used to update
the file's ACL attribute.

**Returns:** an ordered list of

entries

representing the
ACL
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, a security manager is
installed, and it denies

RuntimePermission

("accessUserInformation")

or its

checkRead

method
denies read access to the file.

- setAcl

```java
void setAcl​(
List
<
AclEntry
> acl)
throws
IOException
```

Updates (replace) the access control list.

Where the file system supports Access Control Lists, and it uses an
ACL model that differs from the NFSv4 defined ACL model, then this method
must translate the ACL to the model supported by the file system. This
method should reject (by throwing

IOException

) any
attempt to write an ACL that would appear to make the file more secure
than would be the case if the ACL were updated. Where an implementation
does not support a mapping of

AclEntryType.AUDIT

or

AclEntryType.ALARM

entries, then this method ignores these entries when
writing the ACL.

If an ACL entry contains a

user-principal

that is not associated with the same provider as this attribute view then

ProviderMismatchException

is thrown. Additional validation, if
any, is implementation dependent.

If the file system supports other security related file attributes
(such as a file

access-permissions

for example), the updating the access control list
may also cause these security related attributes to be updated.

**Parameters:** acl

- the new access control list
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the ACL is invalid
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, a security manager is
installed, it denies

RuntimePermission

("accessUserInformation")

or its

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file.
