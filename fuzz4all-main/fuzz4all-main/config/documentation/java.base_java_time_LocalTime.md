# Class LocalTime

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\LocalTime.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
LocalTime

extends
Object

implements
Temporal
,
TemporalAdjuster
,
Comparable
<
LocalTime
>,
Serializable
```

A time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
such as

10:15:30

.

LocalTime

is an immutable date-time object that represents a time,
often viewed as hour-minute-second.
Time is represented to nanosecond precision.
For example, the value "13:45.30.123456789" can be stored in a

LocalTime

.

This class does not store or represent a date or time-zone.
Instead, it is a description of the local time as seen on a wall clock.
It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
such as an offset or time-zone.

The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
in most of the world. This API assumes that all calendar systems use the same
representation, this class, for time-of-day.

This is a

value-based

class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
(

==

), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of

LocalTime

may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
The

equals

method should be used for comparisons.

### Method Details

#### public static
LocalTime
now()

Obtains the current time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current time.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Returns:**
- the current time using the system clock and default time-zone, not null

---

#### public static
LocalTime
now​(
ZoneId
zone)

Obtains the current time from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current time.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the zone ID to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the current time using the system clock, not null

---

#### public static
LocalTime
now​(
Clock
clock)

#### public
LocalTime
minus​(
TemporalAmount
amountToSubtract)

Returns a copy of this time with the specified amount subtracted.

This returns a

LocalTime

, based on this one, with the specified amount subtracted.
The amount is typically

Duration

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface.

The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling

TemporalAmount.subtractFrom(Temporal)

. The amount implementation is free
to implement the subtraction in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to

minus(long, TemporalUnit)

. Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully subtracted.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- minus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**

#### public <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)

Queries this time using the specified query.

This queries this time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:**
- query

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- query

- the query to invoke, not null

**Returns:**
- the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)

---

#### public
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same time as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the time changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

passing

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as the field.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalTime);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null

**Returns:**
- the adjusted object, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Calculates the amount of time until another time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

LocalTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

LocalTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
For example, the amount in hours between two times can be calculated
using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two times.
For example, the amount in hours between 11:30 and 13:29 will only
be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MINUTES);
amount = MINUTES.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- until

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- endExclusive

- the end time, exclusive, which is converted to a

LocalTime

, not null
- unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null

**Returns:**
- the amount of time between this time and the end time

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to a

LocalTime
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

This queries this time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

with the time changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

passing

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as the field.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalTime);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

LocalTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

LocalTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
For example, the amount in hours between two times can be calculated
using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two times.
For example, the amount in hours between 11:30 and 13:29 will only
be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MINUTES);
amount = MINUTES.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

- from

```java
public static
LocalTime
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

LocalTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains a local time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

LocalTime

.

The conversion uses the

TemporalQueries.localTime()

query, which relies
on extracting the

NANO_OF_DAY

field.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

LocalTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the local time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

LocalTime

- parse

```java
public static
LocalTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text)
```

Obtains an instance of

LocalTime

from a text string such as

10:15

.

The string must represent a valid time and is parsed using

DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_TIME

.

**Parameters:** text

- the text to parse such as "10:15:30", not null
**Returns:** the parsed local time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- parse

```java
public static
LocalTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text,

**Returns:** the parsed local time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- isSupported

```java
public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if this time can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The supported fields are:

- NANO_OF_SECOND

NANO_OF_DAY

MICRO_OF_SECOND

MICRO_OF_DAY

MILLI_OF_SECOND

MILLI_OF_DAY

SECOND_OF_MINUTE

SECOND_OF_DAY

MINUTE_OF_HOUR

MINUTE_OF_DAY

HOUR_OF_AMPM

CLOCK_HOUR_OF_AMPM

HOUR_OF_DAY

CLOCK_HOUR_OF_DAY

AMPM_OF_DAY

All other

ChronoField

instances will return false.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

If the unit is a

ChronoUnit

then the query is implemented here.
The supported units are:

- NANOS

MICROS

MILLIS

SECONDS

MINUTES

HOURS

HALF_DAYS

All other

ChronoUnit

instances will return false.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return valid
values based on this time, except

NANO_OF_DAY

and

MICRO_OF_DAY

which are too large to fit in an

int

and throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

LocalTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

LocalTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
For example, the amount in hours between two times can be calculated
using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two times.
For example, the amount in hours between 11:30 and 13:29 will only
be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MINUTES);
amount = MINUTES.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
