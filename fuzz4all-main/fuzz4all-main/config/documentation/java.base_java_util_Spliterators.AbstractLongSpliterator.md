# Class Spliterators.AbstractLongSpliterator

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Spliterators.AbstractLongSpliterator.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract static class
Spliterators.AbstractLongSpliterator

extends
Object

implements
Spliterator.OfLong
```

An abstract

Spliterator.OfLong

that implements

trySplit

to permit limited parallelism.

To implement a spliterator an extending class need only
implement

tryAdvance

. The extending class should override

forEachRemaining

if it can provide a more performant implementation.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Spliterator

,

Spliterator.OfLong

,

Spliterator.OfPrimitive

<

,​

LongConsumer

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected AbstractLongSpliterator​(long est,
int additionalCharacteristics)

Creates a spliterator reporting the given estimated size and
characteristics.

**Parameters:**
- est

- the estimated size of this spliterator if known, otherwise

Long.MAX_VALUE

.
- additionalCharacteristics

- properties of this spliterator's
source or elements. If

SIZED

is reported then this
spliterator will additionally report

SUBSIZED

.

---

### Method Details

#### public
Spliterator.OfLong
trySplit()

If this spliterator can be partitioned, returns a Spliterator
covering elements, that will, upon return from this method, not
be covered by this Spliterator.

If this Spliterator is

Spliterator.ORDERED

, the returned Spliterator
must cover a strict prefix of the elements.

Unless this Spliterator covers an infinite number of elements,
repeated calls to

trySplit()

must eventually return

null

.
Upon non-null return:

- the value reported for

estimateSize()

before splitting,
must, after splitting, be greater than or equal to

estimateSize()

for this and the returned Spliterator; and
- if this Spliterator is

SUBSIZED

, then

estimateSize()

for this spliterator before splitting must be equal to the sum of

estimateSize()

for this and the returned Spliterator after
splitting.

This method may return

null

for any reason,
including emptiness, inability to split after traversal has
commenced, data structure constraints, and efficiency
considerations.

This implementation permits limited parallelism.

**Specified by:**
- trySplit

in interface

Spliterator

<

Long

>

**Returns:**
- a

Spliterator

covering some portion of the
elements, or

null

if this spliterator cannot be split

---

#### public long estimateSize()

Returns an estimate of the number of elements that would be
encountered by a

Spliterator.forEachRemaining(java.util.function.Consumer<? super T>)

traversal, or returns

Long.MAX_VALUE

if infinite, unknown, or too expensive to compute.

If this Spliterator is

Spliterator.SIZED

and has not yet been partially
traversed or split, or this Spliterator is

Spliterator.SUBSIZED

and has
not yet been partially traversed, this estimate must be an accurate
count of elements that would be encountered by a complete traversal.
Otherwise, this estimate may be arbitrarily inaccurate, but must decrease
as specified across invocations of

Spliterator.trySplit()

.

**Specified by:**
- estimateSize

in interface

Spliterator

<

Long

>

**Returns:**
- the estimated size, or

Long.MAX_VALUE

if infinite,
unknown, or too expensive to compute.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation returns the estimated size as reported when
created and, if the estimate size is known, decreases in size when
split.

---

#### public int characteristics()

Returns a set of characteristics of this Spliterator and its
elements. The result is represented as ORed values from

Spliterator.ORDERED

,

Spliterator.DISTINCT

,

Spliterator.SORTED

,

Spliterator.SIZED

,

Spliterator.NONNULL

,

Spliterator.IMMUTABLE

,

Spliterator.CONCURRENT

,

Spliterator.SUBSIZED

. Repeated calls to

characteristics()

on
a given spliterator, prior to or in-between calls to

trySplit

,
should always return the same result.

If a Spliterator reports an inconsistent set of
characteristics (either those returned from a single invocation
or across multiple invocations), no guarantees can be made
about any computation using this Spliterator.

**Specified by:**
- characteristics

in interface

Spliterator

<

Long

>

**Returns:**
- a representation of characteristics

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation returns the characteristics as reported when
created.

**API Note:** This class is a useful aid for creating a spliterator when it is not
possible or difficult to efficiently partition elements in a manner
allowing balanced parallel computation.

An alternative to using this class, that also permits limited
parallelism, is to create a spliterator from an iterator
(see

Spliterators.spliterator(java.util.PrimitiveIterator.OfLong, long, int)

.
Depending on the circumstances using an iterator may be easier or more
convenient than extending this class. For example, if there is already an
iterator available to use then there is no need to extend this class.

. Repeated calls to

characteristics()

on
a given spliterator, prior to or in-between calls to

trySplit

,
should always return the same result.

If a Spliterator reports an inconsistent set of
characteristics (either those returned from a single invocation
or across multiple invocations), no guarantees can be made
about any computation using this Spliterator.
