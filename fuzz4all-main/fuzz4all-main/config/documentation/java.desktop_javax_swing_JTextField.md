# Class JTextField

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\JTextField.html`

### Class Description

```java
@JavaBean
(
defaultProperty
="UIClassID",

description
="A component which allows for the editing of a single line of text.")
public class
JTextField

extends
JTextComponent

implements
SwingConstants
```

JTextField

is a lightweight component that allows the editing
of a single line of text.
For information on and examples of using text fields,
see

How to Use Text Fields

in

The Java Tutorial.

JTextField

is intended to be source-compatible
with

java.awt.TextField

where it is reasonable to do so. This
component has capabilities not found in the

java.awt.TextField

class. The superclass should be consulted for additional capabilities.

JTextField

has a method to establish the string used as the
command string for the action event that gets fired. The

java.awt.TextField

used the text of the field as the command
string for the

ActionEvent

.

JTextField

will use the command
string set with the

setActionCommand

method if not

null

,
otherwise it will use the text of the field as a compatibility with

java.awt.TextField

.

The method

setEchoChar

and

getEchoChar

are not provided directly to avoid a new implementation of a
pluggable look-and-feel inadvertently exposing password characters.
To provide password-like services a separate class

JPasswordField

extends

JTextField

to provide this service with an independently
pluggable look-and-feel.

The

java.awt.TextField

could be monitored for changes by adding
a

TextListener

for

TextEvent

's.
In the

JTextComponent

based
components, changes are broadcasted from the model via a

DocumentEvent

to

DocumentListeners

.
The

DocumentEvent

gives
the location of the change and the kind of change if desired.
The code fragment might look something like:

```java
DocumentListener myListener = ??;
JTextField myArea = ??;
myArea.getDocument().addDocumentListener(myListener);
```

The horizontal alignment of

JTextField

can be set to be left
justified, leading justified, centered, right justified or trailing justified.
Right/trailing justification is useful if the required size
of the field text is smaller than the size allocated to it.
This is determined by the

setHorizontalAlignment

and

getHorizontalAlignment

methods. The default
is to be leading justified.

How the text field consumes VK_ENTER events depends
on whether the text field has any action listeners.
If so, then VK_ENTER results in the listeners
getting an ActionEvent,
and the VK_ENTER event is consumed.
This is compatible with how AWT text fields handle VK_ENTER events.
If the text field has no action listeners, then as of v 1.3 the VK_ENTER
event is not consumed. Instead, the bindings of ancestor components
are processed, which enables the default button feature of
JFC/Swing to work.

Customized fields can easily be created by extending the model and
changing the default model provided. For example, the following piece
of code will create a field that holds only upper case characters. It
will work even if text is pasted into from the clipboard or it is altered via
programmatic changes.

```java
public class UpperCaseField extends JTextField {

public UpperCaseField(int cols) {
super(cols);
}

protected Document createDefaultModel() {
return new UpperCaseDocument();
}

static class UpperCaseDocument extends PlainDocument {

public void insertString(int offs, String str, AttributeSet a)
throws BadLocationException {

if (str == null) {
return;
}
char[] upper = str.toCharArray();
for (int i = 0; i < upper.length; i++) {
upper[i] = Character.toUpperCase(upper[i]);
}
super.insertString(offs, new String(upper), a);
}
}
}
```

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.

#### @BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="the Action instance connected with this ActionEvent source")
public void setAction​(
Action
a)

Sets the

Action

for the

ActionEvent

source.
The new

Action

replaces
any previously set

Action

but does not affect

ActionListeners

independently
added with

addActionListener

.
If the

Action

is already a registered

ActionListener

for the

ActionEvent

source, it is not re-registered.

Setting the

Action

results in immediately changing
all the properties described in

Swing Components Supporting

Action

.
Subsequently, the textfield's properties are automatically updated
as the

Action

's properties change.

This method uses three other methods to set
and help track the

Action

's property values.
It uses the

configurePropertiesFromAction

method
to immediately change the textfield's properties.
To track changes in the

Action

's property values,
this method registers the

PropertyChangeListener

returned by

createActionPropertyChangeListener

. The
default

PropertyChangeListener

invokes the

actionPropertyChanged

method when a property in the

Action

changes.

**Parameters:**
- a

- the

Action

for the

JTextField

,
or

null

**See Also:**
- Action

,

getAction()

,

configurePropertiesFromAction(javax.swing.Action)

,

createActionPropertyChangeListener(javax.swing.Action)

,

actionPropertyChanged(javax.swing.Action, java.lang.String)

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public
Action
getAction()

Returns the currently set

Action

for this

ActionEvent

source, or

null

if no

Action

is set.

**Returns:**
- the

Action

for this

ActionEvent

source,
or

null

**See Also:**
- Action

,

setAction(javax.swing.Action)

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### protected void configurePropertiesFromAction​(
Action
a)

Sets the properties on this textfield to match those in the specified

Action

. Refer to

Swing Components Supporting

Action

for more
details as to which properties this sets.

**Parameters:**
- a

- the

Action

from which to get the properties,
or

null

**See Also:**
- Action

,

setAction(javax.swing.Action)

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### protected void actionPropertyChanged​(
Action
action,

String
propertyName)

Updates the textfield's state in response to property changes in
associated action. This method is invoked from the

PropertyChangeListener

returned from

createActionPropertyChangeListener

. Subclasses do not normally
need to invoke this. Subclasses that support additional

Action

properties should override this and

configurePropertiesFromAction

.

Refer to the table at

Swing Components Supporting

Action

for a list of
the properties this method sets.

**Parameters:**
- action

- the

Action

associated with this textfield
- propertyName

- the name of the property that changed

**See Also:**
- Action

,

configurePropertiesFromAction(javax.swing.Action)

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### protected
PropertyChangeListener
createActionPropertyChangeListener​(
Action
a)

Creates and returns a

PropertyChangeListener

that is
responsible for listening for changes from the specified

Action

and updating the appropriate properties.

Warning:

If you subclass this do not create an anonymous
inner class. If you do the lifetime of the textfield will be tied to
that of the

Action

.

**Parameters:**
- a

- the textfield's action

**Returns:**
- a

PropertyChangeListener

that is responsible for
listening for changes from the specified

Action

and
updating the appropriate properties

**See Also:**
- Action

,

setAction(javax.swing.Action)

**Since:**

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
Action
[] getActions()

Fetches the command list for the editor. This is
the list of commands supported by the plugged-in UI
augmented by the collection of commands that the
editor itself supports. These are useful for binding
to events, such as in a keymap.

**Overrides:**
- getActions

in class

JTextComponent

**Returns:**
- the command list

---

#### public void postActionEvent()

Processes action events occurring on this textfield by
dispatching them to any registered

ActionListener

objects.
This is normally called by the controller registered with
textfield.

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
BoundedRangeModel
getHorizontalVisibility()

Gets the visibility of the text field. This can
be adjusted to change the location of the visible
area if the size of the field is greater than
the area that was allocated to the field.

is to be leading justified.

How the text field consumes VK_ENTER events depends

This is compatible with how AWT text fields handle VK_ENTER events.

the location of the change and the kind of change if desired.
The code fragment might look something like:

```java
DocumentListener myListener = ??;
JTextField myArea = ??;
myArea.getDocument().addDocumentListener(myListener);
```

The horizontal alignment of

JTextField

can be set to be left
justified, leading justified, centered, right justified or trailing justified.
Right/trailing justification is useful if the required size
of the field text is smaller than the size allocated to it.
This is determined by the

setHorizontalAlignment

and

getHorizontalAlignment

methods. The default
is to be leading justified.

How the text field consumes VK_ENTER events depends
on whether the text field has any action listeners.
If so, then VK_ENTER results in the listeners
getting an ActionEvent,
and the VK_ENTER event is consumed.
This is compatible with how AWT text fields handle VK_ENTER events.
If the text field has no action listeners, then as of v 1.3 the VK_ENTER
event is not consumed. Instead, the bindings of ancestor components
are processed, which enables the default button feature of
JFC/Swing to work.

Customized fields can easily be created by extending the model and
changing the default model provided. For example, the following piece
of code will create a field that holds only upper case characters. It
will work even if text is pasted into from the clipboard or it is altered via
programmatic changes.

```java
public class UpperCaseField extends JTextField {

public UpperCaseField(int cols) {
super(cols);
}

protected Document createDefaultModel() {
return new UpperCaseDocument();
}

static class UpperCaseDocument extends PlainDocument {

public void insertString(int offs, String str, AttributeSet a)
throws BadLocationException {

if (str == null) {
return;
}
char[] upper = str.toCharArray();
for (int i = 0; i < upper.length; i++) {
upper[i] = Character.toUpperCase(upper[i]);
}
super.insertString(offs, new String(upper), a);
}
}
}
```

JTextField

has a method to establish the string used as the
command string for the action event that gets fired. The

java.awt.TextField

used the text of the field as the command
string for the

ActionEvent

.

JTextField

will use the command
string set with the

setActionCommand

method if not

null

,
otherwise it will use the text of the field as a compatibility with

java.awt.TextField

.

The method

setEchoChar

and

getEchoChar

are not provided directly to avoid a new implementation of a
pluggable look-and-feel inadvertently exposing password characters.
To provide password-like services a separate class

JPasswordField

extends

JTextField

to provide this service with an independently
pluggable look-and-feel.

a

TextListener

ActionListener

s added or an empty
array if no listeners have been added
**Since:** 1.4

- fireActionPerformed

```java
protected void fireActionPerformed()
```

Notifies all listeners that have registered interest for
notification on this event type. The event instance
is lazily created.
The listener list is processed in last to
first order.

**See Also:** EventListenerList

- setActionCommand

```java
public void setActionCommand​(
String
command)
```

Sets the command string used for action events.

**Parameters:** command

- the command string

- setAction

```java
@BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="the Action instance connected with this ActionEvent source")
public void setAction​(
Action
a)
```

Sets the

Action

for the

ActionEvent

source.
The new

Action

replaces
any previously set

Action

but does not affect

ActionListeners

independently
added with

addActionListener

.
If the

Action

is already a registered

ActionListener

for the

ActionEvent

source, it is not re-registered.

Setting the

Action

results in immediately changing
all the properties described in

Swing Components Supporting

Action

.
Subsequently, the textfield's properties are automatically updated
as the

Action

's properties change.

This method uses three other methods to set
and help track the

Action

's property values.
It uses the

configurePropertiesFromAction

method
to immediately change the textfield's properties.
To track changes in the

Action

's property values,
this method registers the

PropertyChangeListener

returned by

createActionPropertyChangeListener

. The
default

PropertyChangeListener

invokes the

actionPropertyChanged

method when a property in the

Action

changes.

**Parameters:** a

- the

Action

for the

JTextField

,
or

null
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** Action

,

getAction()

,

configurePropertiesFromAction(javax.swing.Action)

,

createActionPropertyChangeListener(javax.swing.Action)

,

actionPropertyChanged(javax.swing.Action, java.lang.String)

- getAction

```java
public
Action
getAction()
```

Returns the currently set

Action

for this

ActionEvent

source, or

null

if no

Action

is set.

**Returns:** the

Action

for this

ActionEvent

source,
or

null
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** Action

,

setAction(javax.swing.Action)

- configurePropertiesFromAction

```java
protected void configurePropertiesFromAction​(
Action
a)
```

Sets the properties on this textfield to match those in the specified

Action

. Refer to

Swing Components Supporting

Action

for more
details as to which properties this sets.

**Parameters:** a

- the

Action

from which to get the properties,
or

null
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** Action

,

setAction(javax.swing.Action)

- actionPropertyChanged

```java
protected void actionPropertyChanged​(
Action
action,

String
propertyName)
```

Updates the textfield's state in response to property changes in
associated action. This method is invoked from the

PropertyChangeListener

returned from

createActionPropertyChangeListener

. Subclasses do not normally
need to invoke this. Subclasses that support additional

Action

properties should override this and

configurePropertiesFromAction

.

Refer to the table at

Swing Components Supporting

Action

for a list of
the properties this method sets.

**Parameters:** action

- the

Action

associated with this textfield
**Parameters:** propertyName

- the name of the property that changed
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** Action

,

configurePropertiesFromAction(javax.swing.Action)

- createActionPropertyChangeListener

```java
protected
PropertyChangeListener
createActionPropertyChangeListener​(
Action
a)
```

Creates and returns a

PropertyChangeListener

that is
responsible for listening for changes from the specified

Action

and updating the appropriate properties.

Warning:

If you subclass this do not create an anonymous
inner class. If you do the lifetime of the textfield will be tied to
that of the

Action

.

**Parameters:** a

- the textfield's action
**Returns:** a

PropertyChangeListener

that is responsible for
listening for changes from the specified

Action

and
updating the appropriate properties
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** Action

,

setAction(javax.swing.Action)

- getActions

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
Action
[] getActions()
```

Fetches the command list for the editor. This is
the list of commands supported by the plugged-in UI
augmented by the collection of commands that the
editor itself supports. These are useful for binding
to events, such as in a keymap.

**Overrides:** getActions

in class

JTextComponent
**Returns:** the command list

- postActionEvent

```java
public void postActionEvent()
```

Processes action events occurring on this textfield by
dispatching them to any registered

ActionListener

objects.

for the

ActionEvent

source.
The new

Action

replaces
any previously set

Action

but does not affect

ActionListeners

independently
added with

addActionListener

.
If the

Action

is already a registered

ActionListener

for the

ActionEvent

source, it is not re-registered.

Setting the

It uses the

configurePropertiesFromAction

method
to immediately change the textfield's properties.
To track changes in the

Action

's property values,
this method registers the

PropertyChangeListener

returned by

createActionPropertyChangeListener

. The
default

PropertyChangeListener

invokes the

actionPropertyChanged

method when a property in the

Action

changes.

**Parameters:** a

- the

Action

for the

JTextField

,
or

null
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** Action

setAction(javax.swing.Action)

- actionPropertyChanged

```java
protected void actionPropertyChanged​(
Action
action,

String
propertyName)
```

Updates the textfield's state in response to property changes in
associated action. This method is invoked from the

PropertyChangeListener

returned from

createActionPropertyChangeListener

. Subclasses do not normally
need to invoke this. Subclasses that support additional

Action

properties should override this and

configurePropertiesFromAction

.

Refer to the table at

Swing Components Supporting

Action

for a list of
the properties this method sets.

**Parameters:** action

- the

Action

associated with this textfield
**Parameters:** propertyName

PropertyChangeListener

that is
responsible for listening for changes from the specified

Action

and updating the appropriate properties.

Warning:

If you subclass this do not create an anonymous
inner class. If you do the lifetime of the textfield will be tied to
that of the

Action

.

**Parameters:** a

- the textfield's action
**Returns:** a

PropertyChangeListener

that is responsible for
listening for changes from the specified

Action

and
updating the appropriate properties

and help track the

Action

's property values.
It uses the

configurePropertiesFromAction

method
to immediately change the textfield's properties.
To track changes in the

Action

's property values,
this method registers the

PropertyChangeListener

returned by

createActionPropertyChangeListener

. The
default

PropertyChangeListener

invokes the

actionPropertyChanged

method when a property in the

Action

changes.

Setting the

Action

results in immediately changing
all the properties described in

Swing Components Supporting

Action

.
Subsequently, the textfield's properties are automatically updated
as the

Action
