# Class FloatControl

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\sound\sampled\FloatControl.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
FloatControl

extends
Control
```

A

FloatControl

object provides control over a range of floating-point
values. Float controls are often represented in graphical user interfaces by
continuously adjustable objects such as sliders or rotary knobs. Concrete
subclasses of

FloatControl

implement controls, such as gain and pan,
that affect a line's audio signal in some way that an application can
manipulate. The

FloatControl.Type

inner class provides static
instances of types that are used to identify some common kinds of float
control.

The

FloatControl

abstract class provides methods to set and get the
control's current floating-point value. Other methods obtain the possible
range of values and the control's resolution (the smallest increment between
returned values). Some float controls allow ramping to a new value over a
specified period of time.

FloatControl

also includes methods that
return string labels for the minimum, maximum, and midpoint positions of the
control.

**Parameters:**

- the kind of control represented by this float control object

during a

shift

constructed

zero-length strings.

**Parameters:**
- type

- the kind of control represented by this float control object
- minimum

- the smallest value permitted for the control
- maximum

- the largest value permitted for the control
- precision

- the resolution or granularity of the control. This is

---

### Method Details

#### public void setValue​(float newValue)

Sets the current value for the control. The default implementation simply
sets the value as indicated. If the value indicated is greater than the
maximum value, or smaller than the minimum value, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown. Some controls require that
their line be open before they can be affected by setting a value.

**Parameters:**
- newValue

- desired new value

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the value indicated does not fall
within the allowable range

---

#### public float getValue()

Obtains this control's current value.

**Returns:**
- the current value

---

#### public float getMaximum()

Obtains the maximum value permitted.

**Returns:**
- the maximum allowable value

---

#### public float getMinimum()

Obtains the minimum value permitted.

**Returns:**
- the minimum allowable value

---

#### public
String
getUnits()

Obtains the label for the units in which the control's values are
expressed, such as "dB" or "frames per second."

**Returns:**
- the units label, or a zero-length string if no label

---

#### public
String
getMinLabel()

Obtains the label for the minimum value, such as "Left" or "Off".

**Returns:**
- the minimum value label, or a zero-length string if no label has
been set

---

#### public
String
getMidLabel()

Obtains the label for the mid-point value, such as "Center" or "Default".

**Returns:**
- the mid-point value label, or a zero-length string if no label
has been set

---

#### public
String
getMaxLabel()

Obtains the label for the maximum value, such as "Right" or "Full".

**Returns:**
- the maximum value label, or a zero-length string if no label has
been set

---

#### public float getPrecision()

Obtains the resolution or granularity of the control, in the units that
the control measures. The precision is the size of the increment between
discrete valid values for this control, over the set of supported
floating-point values.

**Returns:**
- the control's precision

---

#### public int getUpdatePeriod()

Obtains the smallest time interval, in microseconds, over which the
control's value can change during a shift. The update period is the
inverse of the frequency with which the control updates its value during
a shift. If the implementation does not support value shifting over time,
it should set the control's value to the final value immediately and
return -1 from this method.

**Returns:**
- update period in microseconds, or -1 if shifting over time is
unsupported

**See Also:**
- shift(float, float, int)

---

#### public void shift​(float from,
float to,
int microseconds)

Changes the control value from the initial value to the final value
linearly over the specified time period, specified in microseconds. This
method returns without blocking; it does not wait for the shift to
complete. An implementation should complete the operation within the time
specified. The default implementation simply changes the value to the
final value immediately.

**Parameters:**
- from

- initial value at the beginning of the shift
- to

- final value after the shift
- microseconds

- maximum duration of the shift in microseconds

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if either

from

or

to

value does not fall within the allowable range

**See Also:**
- getUpdatePeriod()

---

#### public
String
toString()

Provides a string representation of the control.

**Overrides:**
- toString

```

Obtains the label for the units in which the control's values are
expressed, such as "dB" or "frames per second."

**Returns:** the units label, or a zero-length string if no label

- getMinLabel

```java
public
String
getMinLabel()
```

Obtains the label for the minimum value, such as "Left" or "Off".

**Returns:** the minimum value label, or a zero-length string if no label has
been set

- getMidLabel

```java
public
String
getMidLabel()
```

Obtains the label for the mid-point value, such as "Center" or "Default".

**Returns:** the mid-point value label, or a zero-length string if no label
has been set

- getMaxLabel

```java
public
String
getMaxLabel()
```

Obtains the label for the maximum value, such as "Right" or "Full".

**Returns:** the maximum value label, or a zero-length string if no label has
been set

- getPrecision

```java
public float getPrecision()
```

Obtains the resolution or granularity of the control, in the units that
the control measures. The precision is the size of the increment between
discrete valid values for this control, over the set of supported
floating-point values.

**Returns:** the control's precision

- getUpdatePeriod

```java
public int getUpdatePeriod()
```

Obtains the smallest time interval, in microseconds, over which the
control's value can change during a shift. The update period is the
inverse of the frequency with which the control updates its value during
a shift. If the implementation does not support value shifting over time,
it should set the control's value to the final value immediately and
return -1 from this method.

**Returns:** update period in microseconds, or -1 if shifting over time is
unsupported
**See Also:** shift(float, float, int)

- shift

```java
public void shift​(float from,
float to,
int microseconds)
```

Changes the control value from the initial value to the final value
linearly over the specified time period, specified in microseconds. This
method returns without blocking; it does not wait for the shift to
complete. An implementation should complete the operation within the time
specified. The default implementation simply changes the value to the
final value immediately.

**Parameters:** from

- initial value at the beginning of the shift
**Parameters:** to

- final value after the shift
**Parameters:** microseconds

- maximum duration of the shift in microseconds
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if either

from

or

to

value does not fall within the allowable range
**See Also:** getUpdatePeriod()

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Provides a string representation of the control.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Control
**Returns:** a string description

#### Method Detail

setValue

```java
public void setValue​(float newValue)
```

Sets the current value for the control. The default implementation simply
sets the value as indicated. If the value indicated is greater than the
maximum value, or smaller than the minimum value, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown. Some controls require that
their line be open before they can be affected by setting a value.

**Parameters:** newValue

- desired new value
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the value indicated does not fall
within the allowable range

---

#### setValue

public void setValue​(float newValue)

Sets the current value for the control. The default implementation simply
sets the value as indicated. If the value indicated is greater than the

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown. Some controls require that
their line be open before they can be affected by setting a value.
