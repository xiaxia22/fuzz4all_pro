# Class DirectColorModel

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\DirectColorModel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
DirectColorModel

extends
PackedColorModel
```

The

DirectColorModel

class is a

ColorModel

class that works with pixel values that represent RGB
color and alpha information as separate samples and that pack all
samples for a single pixel into a single int, short, or byte quantity.
This class can be used only with ColorSpaces of type ColorSpace.TYPE_RGB.
In addition, for each component of the ColorSpace, the minimum
normalized component value obtained via the

getMinValue()

method of ColorSpace must be 0.0, and the maximum value obtained via
the

getMaxValue()

method must be 1.0 (these min/max
values are typical for RGB spaces).
There must be three color samples in the pixel values and there can
be a single alpha sample. For those methods that use a primitive array
pixel representation of type

transferType

, the array
length is always one. The transfer
types supported are DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE,
DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, and DataBuffer.TYPE_INT.
Color and alpha samples are stored in the single
element of the array in bits indicated by bit masks. Each bit mask
must be contiguous and masks must not overlap. The same masks apply to
the single int pixel representation used by other methods. The
correspondence of masks and color/alpha samples is as follows:

- Masks are identified by indices running from 0 through 2
if no alpha is present, or 3 if an alpha is present.

The first three indices refer to color samples;
index 0 corresponds to red, index 1 to green, and index 2 to blue.

Index 3 corresponds to the alpha sample, if present.

The translation from pixel values to color/alpha components for
display or processing purposes is a one-to-one correspondence of
samples to components. A

DirectColorModel

is
typically used with image data which uses masks to define packed
samples. For example, a

DirectColorModel

can be used in
conjunction with a

SinglePixelPackedSampleModel

to
construct a

BufferedImage

. Normally the masks used by the

SampleModel

and the

ColorModel

would be the
same. However, if they are different, the color interpretation
of pixel data will be done according to the masks of the

ColorModel

.

A single int pixel representation is valid for all objects of this
class, since it is always possible to represent pixel values used with
this class in a single int. Therefore, methods which use this
representation will not throw an

IllegalArgumentException

due to an invalid pixel value.

This color model is similar to an X11 TrueColor visual.
The default RGB ColorModel specified by the

getRGBdefault

method is a

DirectColorModel

with the following parameters:

```java
Number of bits: 32
Red mask: 0x00ff0000
Green mask: 0x0000ff00
Blue mask: 0x000000ff
Alpha mask: 0xff000000
Color space: sRGB
isAlphaPremultiplied: False
Transparency: Transparency.TRANSLUCENT
transferType: DataBuffer.TYPE_INT
```

Many of the methods in this class are final. This is because the
underlying native graphics code makes assumptions about the layout
and operation of this class and those assumptions are reflected in
the implementations of the methods here that are marked final. You
can subclass this class for other reasons, but you cannot override
or modify the behavior of those methods.

### Constructor Details

#### public DirectColorModel​(int bits,
int rmask,
int gmask,
int bmask)

Constructs a

DirectColorModel

from the specified masks
that indicate which bits in an

int

pixel representation
contain the red, green and blue color samples. As pixel values do not
contain alpha information, all pixels are treated as opaque, which
means that alpha = 1.0. All of the bits
in each mask must be contiguous and fit in the specified number
of least significant bits of an

int

pixel representation.
The

ColorSpace

is the default sRGB space. The
transparency value is Transparency.OPAQUE. The transfer type
is the smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT,
or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel.

**Parameters:**
- bits

- the number of bits in the pixel values; for example,
the sum of the number of bits in the masks.
- rmask

- specifies a mask indicating which bits in an
integer pixel contain the red component
- gmask

- specifies a mask indicating which bits in an
integer pixel contain the green component
- bmask

- specifies a mask indicating which bits in an
integer pixel contain the blue component

---

#### public DirectColorModel​(int bits,
int rmask,
int gmask,
int bmask,
int amask)

Constructs a

DirectColorModel

from the specified masks
that indicate which bits in an

int

pixel representation
contain the red, green and blue color samples and the alpha sample,
if present. If

amask

is 0, pixel values do not contain
alpha information and all pixels are treated as opaque, which means
that alpha = 1.0. All of the bits in each mask must
be contiguous and fit in the specified number of least significant bits
of an

int

pixel representation. Alpha, if present, is not
premultiplied. The

ColorSpace

is the default sRGB space.
The transparency value is Transparency.OPAQUE if no alpha is
present, or Transparency.TRANSLUCENT otherwise. The transfer type
is the smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT,
or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel.

**Parameters:**
- bits

- the number of bits in the pixel values; for example,
the sum of the number of bits in the masks.
- rmask

- specifies a mask indicating which bits in an
integer pixel contain the red component
- gmask

- specifies a mask indicating which bits in an
integer pixel contain the green component
- bmask

- specifies a mask indicating which bits in an
integer pixel contain the blue component
- amask

- specifies a mask indicating which bits in an
integer pixel contain the alpha component

#### public DirectColorModel​(
ColorSpace
space,
int bits,
int rmask,
int gmask,
int bmask,
int amask,
boolean isAlphaPremultiplied,
int transferType)

Constructs a

DirectColorModel

from the specified
parameters. Color components are in the specified

ColorSpace

, which must be of type ColorSpace.TYPE_RGB
and have minimum normalized component values which are all 0.0
and maximum values which are all 1.0.
The masks specify which bits in an

int

pixel
representation contain the red, green and blue color samples and
the alpha sample, if present. If

amask

is 0, pixel
values do not contain alpha information and all pixels are treated
as opaque, which means that alpha = 1.0. All of the
bits in each mask must be contiguous and fit in the specified number
of least significant bits of an

int

pixel
representation. If there is alpha, the

boolean

isAlphaPremultiplied

specifies how to interpret
color and alpha samples in pixel values. If the

boolean

is

true

, color samples are assumed to have been
multiplied by the alpha sample. The transparency value is
Transparency.OPAQUE, if no alpha is present, or
Transparency.TRANSLUCENT otherwise. The transfer type
is the type of primitive array used to represent pixel values and
must be one of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, or
DataBuffer.TYPE_INT.

**Parameters:**
- space

- the specified

ColorSpace
- bits

- the number of bits in the pixel values; for example,
the sum of the number of bits in the masks.

- the type of array used to represent pixel values

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

space

is not a
TYPE_RGB space or if the min/max normalized component
values are not 0.0/1.0.

```

The

DirectColorModel

class is a

ColorModel

class that works with pixel values that represent RGB
color and alpha information as separate samples and that pack all
samples for a single pixel into a single int, short, or byte quantity.
This class can be used only with ColorSpaces of type ColorSpace.TYPE_RGB.
In addition, for each component of the ColorSpace, the minimum
normalized component value obtained via the

getMinValue()

method of ColorSpace must be 0.0, and the maximum value obtained via
the

getMaxValue()

method must be 1.0 (these min/max
values are typical for RGB spaces).
There must be three color samples in the pixel values and there can
be a single alpha sample. For those methods that use a primitive array
pixel representation of type

transferType

, the array
length is always one. The transfer
types supported are DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE,
DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, and DataBuffer.TYPE_INT.
Color and alpha samples are stored in the single
element of the array in bits indicated by bit masks. Each bit mask
must be contiguous and masks must not overlap. The same masks apply to
the single int pixel representation used by other methods. The
correspondence of masks and color/alpha samples is as follows:

- Masks are identified by indices running from 0 through 2
if no alpha is present, or 3 if an alpha is present.

The first three indices refer to color samples;
index 0 corresponds to red, index 1 to green, and index 2 to blue.

Index 3 corresponds to the alpha sample, if present.

The translation from pixel values to color/alpha components for
display or processing purposes is a one-to-one correspondence of
samples to components. A

DirectColorModel

is
typically used with image data which uses masks to define packed
samples. For example, a

DirectColorModel

can be used in
conjunction with a

SinglePixelPackedSampleModel

to
construct a

BufferedImage

. Normally the masks used by the

SampleModel

and the

ColorModel

would be the
same. However, if they are different, the color interpretation
of pixel data will be done according to the masks of the

ColorModel

.

A single int pixel representation is valid for all objects of this
class, since it is always possible to represent pixel values used with
this class in a single int. Therefore, methods which use this
representation will not throw an

IllegalArgumentException

due to an invalid pixel value.

This color model is similar to an X11 TrueColor visual.
The default RGB ColorModel specified by the

getRGBdefault

method is a

DirectColorModel

with the following parameters:

```java
Number of bits: 32
Red mask: 0x00ff0000
Green mask: 0x0000ff00
Blue mask: 0x000000ff
Alpha mask: 0xff000000
Color space: sRGB
isAlphaPremultiplied: False
Transparency: Transparency.TRANSLUCENT
transferType: DataBuffer.TYPE_INT
```

Many of the methods in this class are final. This is because the
underlying native graphics code makes assumptions about the layout
and operation of this class and those assumptions are reflected in
the implementations of the methods here that are marked final. You
can subclass this class for other reasons, but you cannot override
or modify the behavior of those methods.

of least significant bits of an

int

pixel representation.
The

ColorSpace

is the default sRGB space. The
transparency value is Transparency.OPAQUE. The transfer type
is the smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT,
or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel.

**Parameters:** bits

- specifies a mask indicating which bits in an
integer pixel contain the blue component

- DirectColorModel

```java
public DirectColorModel​(int bits,
int rmask,
int gmask,
int bmask,
int amask)
```

Constructs a

DirectColorModel

from the specified masks
that indicate which bits in an

int

pixel representation
contain the red, green and blue color samples and the alpha sample,
if present. If

amask

is 0, pixel values do not contain
alpha information and all pixels are treated as opaque, which means
that alpha = 1.0. All of the bits in each mask must
be contiguous and fit in the specified number of least significant bits
of an

int

pixel representation. Alpha, if present, is not
premultiplied. The

ColorSpace

is the default sRGB space.
The transparency value is Transparency.OPAQUE if no alpha is
present, or Transparency.TRANSLUCENT otherwise. The transfer type
is the smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT,
or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel.

**Parameters:** bits

- the number of bits in the pixel values; for example,
the sum of the number of bits in the masks.

```

Constructs a

DirectColorModel

from the specified
parameters. Color components are in the specified

ColorSpace

, which must be of type ColorSpace.TYPE_RGB
and have minimum normalized component values which are all 0.0
and maximum values which are all 1.0.
The masks specify which bits in an

int

pixel
representation contain the red, green and blue color samples and
the alpha sample, if present. If

amask

is 0, pixel
values do not contain alpha information and all pixels are treated
as opaque, which means that alpha = 1.0. All of the
bits in each mask must be contiguous and fit in the specified number
of least significant bits of an

int

pixel
representation. If there is alpha, the

boolean

isAlphaPremultiplied

specifies how to interpret
color and alpha samples in pixel values. If the

boolean

is

true

, color samples are assumed to have been
multiplied by the alpha sample. The transparency value is
Transparency.OPAQUE, if no alpha is present, or
Transparency.TRANSLUCENT otherwise. The transfer type
is the type of primitive array used to represent pixel values and
must be one of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, or
DataBuffer.TYPE_INT.

in each mask must be contiguous and fit in the specified number
of least significant bits of an

int

pixel representation.
The

ColorSpace

is the default sRGB space. The
transparency value is Transparency.OPAQUE. The transfer type
is the smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT,
or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel.

**Parameters:** bits

pixel,
int[] components,
int offset)

Returns an array of unnormalized color/alpha components given a pixel
in this

ColorModel

. The pixel value is specified by an
array of data elements of type

transferType

passed in as
an object reference. If

pixel

is not a primitive array
of type

transferType

, a

ClassCastException

is thrown. An

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

is
thrown if

pixel

is not large enough to hold a
pixel value for this

, even if the array is allocated by
this method. An

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

is thrown if the

components

array is not

null

and is not large enough to hold all the color and
alpha components, starting at
