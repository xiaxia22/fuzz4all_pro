### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### public
List
<
Recording
> getRecordings()

Returns an immutable list of the available recordings.

A recording becomes available when it is created. It becomes unavailable when it
is in the

CLOSED

state, typically after a call to

Recording.close()

.

**Returns:**
- a list of recordings, not

null

---

#### public
Recording
takeSnapshot()

Creates a snapshot of all available recorded data.

A snapshot is a synthesized recording in a

STOPPPED

state. If no data is
available, a recording with size

0

is returned.

A snapshot provides stable access to data for later operations (for example,
operations to change the interval or to reduce the data size).

The following example shows how to create a snapshot and write a subset of the data to a file.

```java
try (Recording snapshot = FlightRecorder.getFlightRecorder().takeSnapshot()) {
if (snapshot.getSize() > 0) {
snapshot.setMaxSize(100_000_000);
snapshot.setMaxAge(Duration.ofMinutes(5));
snapshot.dump(Paths.get("snapshot.jfr"));
}
}
```

The caller must close the recording when access to the data is no longer
needed.

**Returns:**
- a snapshot of all available recording data, not

null

---

#### public static void register​(
Class
<? extends
Event
> eventClass)

Registers an event class.

If the event class is already registered, then the invocation of this method is
ignored.

**Parameters:**
- eventClass

- the event class to register, not

null

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if class is abstract or not a subclass
of

Event
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

FlightRecorderPermission("registerEvent")

---

#### public static void unregister​(
Class
<? extends
Event
> eventClass)

Unregisters an event class.

If the event class is not registered, then the invocation of this method is
ignored.

**Parameters:**
- eventClass

- the event class to unregistered, not

null

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if a class is abstract or not a subclass
of

Event
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

FlightRecorderPermission("registerEvent")

---

#### public static
FlightRecorder
getFlightRecorder()
throws
IllegalStateException
,

SecurityException

Returns the Flight Recorder for the platform.

**Returns:**
- a Flight Recorder instance, not

null

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if Flight Recorder can't be created (for
example, if the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) lacks Flight Recorder
support, or if the file repository can't be created or accessed)
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller does
not have

FlightRecorderPermission("accessFlightRecorder")

---

#### public static void addPeriodicEvent​(
Class
<? extends
Event
> eventClass,

Runnable
hook)
throws
SecurityException

Adds a hook for a periodic event.

The implementation of the hook should return as soon as possible, to
avoid blocking other Flight Recorder operations. The hook should emit
one or more events of the specified type. When a hook is added, the
interval at which the call is invoked is configurable using the

"period"

setting.

**Parameters:**
- eventClass

- the class that the hook should run for, not

null
- hook

- the hook, not

null

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if a class is not a subclass of

Event

, is abstract, or the hook is already added
- IllegalStateException

- if the event class has the

Registered(false)

annotation and is not registered manually
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

FlightRecorderPermission("registerEvent")

---

#### public static boolean removePeriodicEvent​(
Runnable
hook)
throws
SecurityException

Removes a hook for a periodic event.

**Parameters:**
- hook

- the hook to remove, not

null

**Returns:**
- true

if hook is removed,

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

FlightRecorderPermission("registerEvent")

---

#### public
List
<
EventType
> getEventTypes()

Returns an immutable list that contains all currently registered events.

By default, events are registered when they are first used, typically
when an event object is allocated. To ensure an event is visible early,
registration can be triggered by invoking the

register(Class)

method.

**Returns:**
- list of events, not

null

---

#### public static void addListener​(
FlightRecorderListener
changeListener)

Adds a recorder listener and captures the

AccessControlContext

to
use when invoking the listener.

If Flight Recorder is already initialized when the listener is added, then the method

FlightRecorderListener.recorderInitialized(FlightRecorder)

method is
invoked before returning from this method.

**Parameters:**
- changeListener

- the listener to add, not

null

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

FlightRecorderPermission("accessFlightRecorder")

---

#### public static boolean removeListener​(
FlightRecorderListener
changeListener)

Removes a recorder listener.

If the same listener is added multiple times, only one instance is
removed.

**Parameters:**
- changeListener

- listener to remove, not

null

**Returns:**
- true

, if the listener could be removed,

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

FlightRecorderPermission("accessFlightRecorder")

---

#### public static boolean isAvailable()

Returns

true

if the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has Flight Recorder capabilities.

This method can quickly check whether Flight Recorder can be
initialized, without actually doing the initialization work. The value may
change during runtime and it is not safe to cache it.

**Returns:**
- true

, if Flight Recorder is available,

false

otherwise

**See Also:**
- for callback when Flight Recorder is
initialized

---

#### public static boolean isInitialized()

Returns

true

if Flight Recorder is initialized.

**Returns:**
- true

, if Flight Recorder is initialized,

false

otherwise

**See Also:**
- for callback when Flight Recorder is
initialized

public static void register​(

Class

<? extends

Event

> eventClass)

Registers an event class.

If the event class is already registered, then the invocation of this method is
ignored.

If the event class is already registered, then the invocation of this method is
ignored.

unregister

```java
public static void unregister​(
Class
<? extends
Event
> eventClass)
```

Unregisters an event class.

If the event class is not registered, then the invocation of this method is
ignored.

**Parameters:** eventClass

- the event class to unregistered, not

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a class is abstract or not a subclass
of

Event
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

FlightRecorderPermission("registerEvent")

getFlightRecorder

```java
public static
FlightRecorder
getFlightRecorder()
throws
IllegalStateException
,

SecurityException
```

Returns the Flight Recorder for the platform.

**Returns:** a Flight Recorder instance, not

null
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if Flight Recorder can't be created (for
example, if the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) lacks Flight Recorder
support, or if the file repository can't be created or accessed)
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller does
not have

FlightRecorderPermission("accessFlightRecorder")

---

#### getFlightRecorder

public static

FlightRecorder

getFlightRecorder()
throws

IllegalStateException

,

SecurityException

Returns the Flight Recorder for the platform.

addPeriodicEvent

```java
public static void addPeriodicEvent​(
Class
<? extends
Event
> eventClass,

Runnable
hook)
throws
SecurityException
```

Adds a hook for a periodic event.

The implementation of the hook should return as soon as possible, to
avoid blocking other Flight Recorder operations. The hook should emit
one or more events of the specified type. When a hook is added, the
interval at which the call is invoked is configurable using the

"period"

setting.

**Parameters:** eventClass

- the class that the hook should run for, not

null
**Parameters:** hook

- the hook, not

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a class is not a subclass of

Event

, is abstract, or the hook is already added
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the event class has the

Registered(false)

annotation and is not registered manually
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

FlightRecorderPermission("registerEvent")

removePeriodicEvent

```java
public static boolean removePeriodicEvent​(
Runnable
hook)
throws
SecurityException
```

Removes a hook for a periodic event.

**Parameters:** hook

- the hook to remove, not

null
**Returns:** true

if hook is removed,

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

FlightRecorderPermission("registerEvent")

---

#### removePeriodicEvent

public static boolean removePeriodicEvent​(

Runnable

hook)
throws

SecurityException

Removes a hook for a periodic event.

getEventTypes

```java
public
List
<
EventType
> getEventTypes()
```

Returns an immutable list that contains all currently registered events.

By default, events are registered when they are first used, typically
when an event object is allocated. To ensure an event is visible early,
registration can be triggered by invoking the

register(Class)

method.

**Returns:** list of events, not

null

addListener

```java
public static void addListener​(
FlightRecorderListener
changeListener)
```

Adds a recorder listener and captures the

AccessControlContext

to
use when invoking the listener.

If Flight Recorder is already initialized when the listener is added, then the method

FlightRecorderListener.recorderInitialized(FlightRecorder)

method is
invoked before returning from this method.

**Parameters:** changeListener

- the listener to add, not

null
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

FlightRecorderPermission("accessFlightRecorder")

removeListener

```java
public static boolean removeListener​(
FlightRecorderListener
changeListener)
```

Removes a recorder listener.

If the same listener is added multiple times, only one instance is
removed.

**Parameters:** changeListener

- listener to remove, not

null
**Returns:** true

, if the listener could be removed,

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller
does not have

removed.

isAvailable

```java
public static boolean isAvailable()
```

Returns

true

if the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has Flight Recorder capabilities.

This method can quickly check whether Flight Recorder can be
initialized, without actually doing the initialization work. The value may
change during runtime and it is not safe to cache it.

**Returns:** true

, if Flight Recorder is available,

false

otherwise
**See Also:** for callback when Flight Recorder is
initialized
