# Class View

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\text\View.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
View

extends
Object

implements
SwingConstants
```

A very important part of the text package is the

View

class.
As the name suggests it represents a view of the text model,
or a piece of the text model.
It is this class that is responsible for the look of the text component.
The view is not intended to be some completely new thing that one must
learn, but rather is much like a lightweight component.

By default, a view is very light. It contains a reference to the parent
view from which it can fetch many things without holding state, and it
contains a reference to a portion of the model (

Element

).
A view does not
have to exactly represent an element in the model, that is simply a typical
and therefore convenient mapping. A view can alternatively maintain a couple
of Position objects to maintain its location in the model (i.e. represent
a fragment of an element). This is typically the result of formatting where
views have been broken down into pieces. The convenience of a substantial
relationship to the element makes it easier to build factories to produce the
views, and makes it easier to keep track of the view pieces as the model is
changed and the view must be changed to reflect the model. Simple views
therefore represent an Element directly and complex views do not.

A view has the following responsibilities:

### Field Details

#### public static final int BadBreakWeight

The weight to indicate a view is a bad break
opportunity for the purpose of formatting. This
value indicates that no attempt should be made to
break the view into fragments as the view has
not been written to support fragmenting.

Element
elem)

Creates a new

View

object.

**Parameters:**
- elem

- the

Element

to represent

---

### Method Details

#### public
View
getParent()

Returns the parent of the view.

**Returns:**
- the parent, or

null

if none exists

---

#### public boolean isVisible()

Returns a boolean that indicates whether
the view is visible or not. By default
all views are visible.

**Returns:**
- always returns true

---

#### public abstract float getPreferredSpan​(int axis)

Determines the preferred span for this view along an
axis.

**Parameters:**
- axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS

**Returns:**
- the span the view would like to be rendered into.
Typically the view is told to render into the span
that is returned, although there is no guarantee.
The parent may choose to resize or break the view

**See Also:**
- getPreferredSpan(int)

---

#### public float getMinimumSpan​(int axis)

Determines the minimum span for this view along an
axis.

**Parameters:**
- axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS

**Returns:**
- the minimum span the view can be rendered into

**See Also:**
- getPreferredSpan(int)

---

#### public float getMaximumSpan​(int axis)

Determines the maximum span for this view along an
axis.

**Parameters:**
- axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS

**Returns:**
- the maximum span the view can be rendered into

**See Also:**
- getPreferredSpan(int)

---

#### public void preferenceChanged​(
View
child,
boolean width,
boolean height)

Child views can call this on the parent to indicate that
the preference has changed and should be reconsidered
for layout. By default this just propagates upward to
the next parent. The root view will call

revalidate

on the associated text component.

**Parameters:**
- child

- the child view
- width

- true if the width preference has changed
- height

- true if the height preference has changed

**See Also:**
- JComponent.revalidate()

---

#### public float getAlignment​(int axis)

Determines the desired alignment for this view along an
axis. The desired alignment is returned. This should be
a value >= 0.0 and <= 1.0, where 0 indicates alignment at
the origin and 1.0 indicates alignment to the full span
away from the origin. An alignment of 0.5 would be the
center of the view.

**Parameters:**
- axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS

**Returns:**
- the value 0.5

---

#### public abstract void paint​(
Graphics
g,

Shape
allocation)

Renders using the given rendering surface and area on that
surface. The view may need to do layout and create child
views to enable itself to render into the given allocation.

**Parameters:**
- g

- the rendering surface to use
- allocation

- the allocated region to render into

---

#### public void setParent​(
View
parent)

Establishes the parent view for this view. This is
guaranteed to be called before any other methods if the
parent view is functioning properly. This is also
the last method called, since it is called to indicate
the view has been removed from the hierarchy as
well. When this method is called to set the parent to
null, this method does the same for each of its children,
propagating the notification that they have been
disconnected from the view tree. If this is
reimplemented,

super.setParent()

should
be called.

**Parameters:**
- parent

- the new parent, or

null

if the view is
being removed from a parent

---

#### public int getViewCount()

Returns the number of views in this view. Since
the default is to not be a composite view this
returns 0.

**Returns:**
- the number of views >= 0

**See Also:**
- getViewCount()

---

#### public
View
getView​(int n)

Gets the

n

th child view. Since there are no
children by default, this returns

null

.

**Parameters:**
- n

- the number of the view to get, >= 0 && < getViewCount()

**Returns:**
- the view

---

#### public void removeAll()

Removes all of the children. This is a convenience
call to

replace

.

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public void remove​(int i)

Removes one of the children at the given position.
This is a convenience call to

replace

.

**Parameters:**
- i

- the position

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public void insert​(int offs,

View
v)

Inserts a single child view. This is a convenience
call to

replace

.

**Parameters:**
- offs

- the offset of the view to insert before >= 0
- v

- the view

**See Also:**
- replace(int, int, javax.swing.text.View[])

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public void append​(
View
v)

Appends a single child view. This is a convenience
call to

replace

.

**Parameters:**
- v

- the view

**See Also:**
- replace(int, int, javax.swing.text.View[])

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public void replace​(int offset,
int length,

View
[] views)

Replaces child views. If there are no views to remove
this acts as an insert. If there are no views to
add this acts as a remove. Views being removed will
have the parent set to

null

, and the internal reference
to them removed so that they can be garbage collected.
This is implemented to do nothing, because by default
a view has no children.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- the starting index into the child views to insert
the new views. This should be a value >= 0 and <= getViewCount
- length

- the number of existing child views to remove
This should be a value >= 0 and <= (getViewCount() - offset).
- views

- the child views to add. This value can be

null

to indicate no children are being added
(useful to remove).

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public int getViewIndex​(int pos,

Position.Bias
b)

Returns the child view index representing the given position in
the model. By default a view has no children so this is implemented
to return -1 to indicate there is no valid child index for any
position.

**Parameters:**
- pos

- the position >= 0
- b

- the bias

**Returns:**
- index of the view representing the given position, or
-1 if no view represents that position

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public
Shape
getChildAllocation​(int index,

Shape
a)

Fetches the allocation for the given child view.
This enables finding out where various views
are located, without assuming how the views store
their location. This returns

null

since the
default is to not have any child views.

**Parameters:**
- index

- the index of the child, >= 0 && <

getViewCount()
- a

- the allocation to this view

**Returns:**
- the allocation to the child

they might not be in the same order found in the model, or they just
might not allow access to some of the locations in the model.
This method enables specifying a position to convert
within the range of >=0. If the value is -1, a position
will be calculated automatically. If the value < -1,
the

BadLocationException

will be thrown.

- the location within the model that best represents the next
location visual position

**Throws:**
- BadLocationException

- the given position is not a valid
position within the document
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

direction

doesn't have one of the legal values above

f)

Gives notification from the document that attributes were changed
in a location that this view is responsible for.
To reduce the burden to subclasses, this functionality is
spread out into the following calls that subclasses can
reimplement:

null

if none

**See Also:**
- getDocument()

---

#### public int getStartOffset()

than a component view.

**Returns:**
- a

Graphics

object for rendering

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public
AttributeSet
getAttributes()

Fetches the attributes to use when rendering. By default
this simply returns the attributes of the associated element.
This method should be used rather than using the element
directly to obtain access to the attributes to allow
view-specific attributes to be mixed in or to allow the
view to have view-specific conversion of attributes by
subclasses.
Each view should document what attributes it recognizes
for the purpose of rendering or layout, and should always
access them through the

AttributeSet

returned
by this method.

**Returns:**
- the attributes to use when rendering

---

#### public
View
breakView​(int axis,
int offset,
float pos,
float len)

Tries to break this view on the given axis. This is
called by views that try to do formatting of their
children. For example, a view of a paragraph will
typically try to place its children into row and
views representing chunks of text can sometimes be
broken down into smaller pieces.

This is implemented to return the view itself, which
represents the default behavior on not being
breakable. If the view does support breaking, the
starting offset of the view returned should be the
given offset, and the end offset should be less than
or equal to the end offset of the view being broken.

**Parameters:**
- axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
- offset

- the location in the document model
that a broken fragment would occupy >= 0. This
would be the starting offset of the fragment
returned
- pos

- the position along the axis that the
broken view would occupy >= 0. This may be useful for
things like tab calculations
- len

- specifies the distance along the axis
where a potential break is desired >= 0

**Returns:**
- the fragment of the view that represents the
given span, if the view can be broken. If the view
doesn't support breaking behavior, the view itself is
returned.

**See Also:**
- ParagraphView

---

#### public
View
createFragment​(int p0,
int p1)

Creates a view that represents a portion of the element.
This is potentially useful during formatting operations
for taking measurements of fragments of the view. If
the view doesn't support fragmenting (the default), it
should return itself.

**Parameters:**
- p0

- the starting offset >= 0. This should be a value
greater or equal to the element starting offset and
less than the element ending offset.
- p1

- the ending offset > p0. This should be a value
less than or equal to the elements end offset and
greater than the elements starting offset.

**Returns:**
- the view fragment, or itself if the view doesn't
support breaking into fragments

**See Also:**
- LabelView

---

#### public int getBreakWeight​(int axis,
float pos,
float len)

Determines how attractive a break opportunity in
this view is. This can be used for determining which
view is the most attractive to call

breakView

on in the process of formatting. A view that represents
text that has whitespace in it might be more attractive
than a view that has no whitespace, for example. The
higher the weight, the more attractive the break. A
value equal to or lower than

BadBreakWeight

should not be considered for a break. A value greater
than or equal to

ForcedBreakWeight

should
be broken.

This is implemented to provide the default behavior
of returning

BadBreakWeight

unless the length
is greater than the length of the view in which case the
entire view represents the fragment. Unless a view has
been written to support breaking behavior, it is not
attractive to try and break the view. An example of
a view that does support breaking is

LabelView

.
An example of a view that uses break weight is

ParagraphView

.

**Parameters:**
- axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
- pos

- the potential location of the start of the
broken view >= 0. This may be useful for calculating tab
positions
- len

- specifies the relative length from

pos

where a potential break is desired >= 0

**Returns:**
- the weight, which should be a value between
ForcedBreakWeight and BadBreakWeight

**See Also:**
- LabelView

,

ParagraphView

,

BadBreakWeight

,

GoodBreakWeight

,

ExcellentBreakWeight

,

ForcedBreakWeight

---

#### public int getResizeWeight​(int axis)

Determines the resizability of the view along the
given axis. A value of 0 or less is not resizable.

**Parameters:**
- axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS

**Returns:**
- the weight

---

#### public void setSize​(float width,
float height)

Sets the size of the view. This should cause
layout of the view along the given axis, if it
has any layout duties.

**Parameters:**
- width

- the width >= 0
- height

- the height >= 0

---

#### public
Container
getContainer()

Fetches the container hosting the view. This is useful for
things like scheduling a repaint, finding out the host
components font, etc. The default implementation
of this is to forward the query to the parent view.

**Returns:**
- the container,

null

if none

---

#### public
ViewFactory
getViewFactory()

Fetches the

ViewFactory

implementation that is feeding
the view hierarchy. Normally the views are given this
as an argument to updates from the model when they
are most likely to need the factory, but this
method serves to provide it at other times.

**Returns:**
- the factory,

null

if none

---

#### public
String
getToolTipText​(float x,
float y,

Shape
allocation)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public int getViewIndex​(float x,
float y,

Shape
allocation)

Returns the child view index representing the given position in
the view. This iterates over all the children returning the
first with a bounds that contains

x

,

y

.

**Parameters:**

#### protected boolean updateChildren​(
DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

ViewFactory
f)

Updates the child views in response to receiving notification
that the model changed, and there is change record for the
element this view is responsible for. This is implemented
to assume the child views are directly responsible for the
child elements of the element this view represents. The

ViewFactory

is used to create child views for each element
specified as added in the

ElementChange

, starting at the
index specified in the given

ElementChange

. The number of
child views representing the removed elements specified are
removed.

**Parameters:**
- ec

- the change information for the element this view
is responsible for. This should not be

null

if
this method gets called
- e

- the change information from the associated document
- f

- the factory to use to build child views

**Returns:**
- whether or not the child views represent the
child elements of the element this view is responsible
for. Some views create children that represent a portion
of the element they are responsible for, and should return
false. This information is used to determine if views
in the range of the added elements should be forwarded to
or not

**See Also:**
- insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

,

DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)

Forwards the given

DocumentEvent

to the child views
that need to be notified of the change to the model.
If there were changes to the element this view is
responsible for, that should be considered when
forwarding (i.e. new child views should not get
notified).

**Parameters:**
- ec

- changes to the element this view is responsible
for (may be

null

if there were no changes).
- e

- the change information from the associated document
- a

A very important part of the text package is the

View

class.
As the name suggests it represents a view of the text model,
or a piece of the text model.
It is this class that is responsible for the look of the text component.
The view is not intended to be some completely new thing that one must
learn, but rather is much like a lightweight component.

By default, a view is very light. It contains a reference to the parent
view from which it can fetch many things without holding state, and it
contains a reference to a portion of the model (

Element

).
A view does not
have to exactly represent an element in the model, that is simply a typical
and therefore convenient mapping. A view can alternatively maintain a couple
of Position objects to maintain its location in the model (i.e. represent
a fragment of an element). This is typically the result of formatting where
views have been broken down into pieces. The convenience of a substantial
relationship to the element makes it easier to build factories to produce the
views, and makes it easier to keep track of the view pieces as the model is
changed and the view must be changed to reflect the model. Simple views
therefore represent an Element directly and complex views do not.

A view has the following responsibilities:

A view has the following responsibilities:

The view has a

setSize

method which is like

doLayout

and

setSize

in

Component

combined.
The view has a

preferenceChanged

method which is
like

invalidate

in

Component

except that one can
invalidate just one axis
and the child requesting the change is identified.

A View expresses the size that it would like to be in terms of three
values, a minimum, a preferred, and a maximum span. Layout in a view is
can be done independently upon each axis. For a properly functioning View
implementation, the minimum span will be <= the preferred span which in turn
will be <= the maximum span.

The minimum set of methods for layout are:

- getMinimumSpan

getPreferredSpan

getMaximumSpan

getAlignment

preferenceChanged

setSize

The

setSize

method should be prepared to be called a number of times
(i.e. It may be called even if the size didn't change).
The

setSize

method
is generally called to make sure the View layout is complete prior to trying
to perform an operation on it that requires an up-to-date layout. A view's
size should

always

be set to a value within the minimum and maximum
span specified by that view. Additionally, the view must always call the

preferenceChanged

method on the parent if it has changed the
values for the
layout it would like, and expects the parent to honor. The parent View is
not required to recognize a change until the

preferenceChanged

has been sent.
This allows parent View implementations to cache the child requirements if
desired. The calling sequence looks something like the following:

The exact calling sequence is up to the layout functionality of
the parent view (if the view has any children). The view may collect
the preferences of the children prior to determining what it will give
each child, or it might iteratively update the children one at a time.

Render a portion of the model.

This is done in the paint method, which is pretty much like a component
paint method. Views are expected to potentially populate a fairly large
tree. A

View

has the following semantics for rendering:

- The view gets its allocation from the parent at paint time, so it
must be prepared to redo layout if the allocated area is different from
what it is prepared to deal with.

The coordinate system is the same as the hosting

Component

(i.e. the

Component

returned by the

getContainer

method).
This means a child view lives in the same coordinate system as the parent
view unless the parent has explicitly changed the coordinate system.
To schedule itself to be repainted a view can call repaint on the hosting

Component

.

The default is to

not clip

the children. It is more efficient
to allow a view to clip only if it really feels it needs clipping.

The

Graphics

object given is not initialized in any way.
A view should set any settings needed.

A

View

is inherently transparent. While a view may render into its
entire allocation, typically a view does not. Rendering is performed by
traversing down the tree of

View

implementations.
Each

View

is responsible
for rendering its children. This behavior is depended upon for thread
safety. While view implementations do not necessarily have to be implemented
with thread safety in mind, other view implementations that do make use of
concurrency can depend upon a tree traversal to guarantee thread safety.

The order of views relative to the model is up to the implementation.
Although child views will typically be arranged in the same order that they
occur in the model, they may be visually arranged in an entirely different
order. View implementations may have Z-Order associated with them if the
children are overlapping.

The methods for rendering are:

- paint

Translate between the model and view coordinate systems.

Because the view objects are produced from a factory and therefore cannot
necessarily be counted upon to be in a particular pattern, one must be able
to perform translation to properly locate spatial representation of the model.
The methods for doing this are:

- modelToView

viewToModel

getDocument

getElement

getStartOffset

getEndOffset

The layout must be valid prior to attempting to make the translation.
The translation is not valid, and must not be attempted while changes
are being broadcasted from the model via a

DocumentEvent

.

Respond to changes from the model.

If the overall view is represented by many pieces (which is the best situation
if one want to be able to change the view and write the least amount of new code),
it would be impractical to have a huge number of

DocumentListener

s.
If each
view listened to the model, only a few would actually be interested in the
changes broadcasted at any given time. Since the model has no knowledge of
views, it has no way to filter the broadcast of change information. The view
hierarchy itself is instead responsible for propagating the change information.
At any level in the view hierarchy, that view knows enough about its children to
best distribute the change information further. Changes are therefore broadcasted
starting from the root of the view hierarchy.

removeUpdate

- View

```java
public View​(
Element
elem)
```

Creates a new

View

object.

**Parameters:** elem

- the

Element

to represent

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getParent

```java
public
View
getParent()
```

Returns the parent of the view.

**Returns:** the parent, or

null

if none exists

- isVisible

```java
public boolean isVisible()
```

Returns a boolean that indicates whether
the view is visible or not. By default
all views are visible.

**Returns:** always returns true

- getPreferredSpan

```java
public abstract float getPreferredSpan​(int axis)
```

Determines the preferred span for this view along an
axis.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Returns:** the span the view would like to be rendered into.
Typically the view is told to render into the span
that is returned, although there is no guarantee.
The parent may choose to resize or break the view
**See Also:** getPreferredSpan(int)

- getMinimumSpan

```java
public float getMinimumSpan​(int axis)
```

Determines the minimum span for this view along an
axis.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Returns:** the minimum span the view can be rendered into
**See Also:** getPreferredSpan(int)

- getMaximumSpan

```java
public float getMaximumSpan​(int axis)
```

Determines the maximum span for this view along an
axis.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Returns:** the maximum span the view can be rendered into
**See Also:** getPreferredSpan(int)

- preferenceChanged

```java
public void preferenceChanged​(
View
child,
boolean width,
boolean height)
```

Child views can call this on the parent to indicate that
the preference has changed and should be reconsidered
for layout. By default this just propagates upward to
the next parent. The root view will call

revalidate

on the associated text component.

**Parameters:** child

- the child view
**Parameters:** width

- true if the width preference has changed
**Parameters:** height

- true if the height preference has changed
**See Also:** JComponent.revalidate()

- getAlignment

```java
public float getAlignment​(int axis)
```

Determines the desired alignment for this view along an
axis. The desired alignment is returned. This should be
a value >= 0.0 and <= 1.0, where 0 indicates alignment at
the origin and 1.0 indicates alignment to the full span
away from the origin. An alignment of 0.5 would be the
center of the view.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Returns:** the value 0.5

- paint

```java
public abstract void paint​(
Graphics
g,

Shape
allocation)
```

Renders using the given rendering surface and area on that
surface. The view may need to do layout and create child
views to enable itself to render into the given allocation.

**Parameters:** g

- the rendering surface to use
**Parameters:** allocation

- the allocated region to render into

- setParent

```java
public void setParent​(
View
parent)
```

Establishes the parent view for this view. This is
guaranteed to be called before any other methods if the
parent view is functioning properly. This is also
the last method called, since it is called to indicate
the view has been removed from the hierarchy as
well. When this method is called to set the parent to
null, this method does the same for each of its children,
propagating the notification that they have been
disconnected from the view tree. If this is
reimplemented,

super.setParent()

should
be called.

**Parameters:** parent

- the new parent, or

null

if the view is
being removed from a parent

- getViewCount

```java
public int getViewCount()
```

Returns the number of views in this view. Since
the default is to not be a composite view this
returns 0.

**Returns:** the number of views >= 0
**See Also:** getViewCount()

- getView

```java
public
View
getView​(int n)
```

Gets the

n

th child view. Since there are no
children by default, this returns

null

.

**Parameters:** n

- the number of the view to get, >= 0 && < getViewCount()
**Returns:** the view

- removeAll

```java
public void removeAll()
```

Removes all of the children. This is a convenience
call to

replace

.

**Since:** 1.3

- remove

```java
public void remove​(int i)
```

Removes one of the children at the given position.
This is a convenience call to

replace

.

**Parameters:** i

- the position
**Since:** 1.3

- insert

```java
public void insert​(int offs,

View
v)
```

Inserts a single child view. This is a convenience
call to

replace

.

**Parameters:** offs

- the offset of the view to insert before >= 0
**Parameters:** v

- the view
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** replace(int, int, javax.swing.text.View[])

- append

```java
public void append​(
View
v)
```

Appends a single child view. This is a convenience
call to

replace

.

**Parameters:** v

- the view
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** replace(int, int, javax.swing.text.View[])

- replace

```java
public void replace​(int offset,
int length,

View
[] views)
```

Replaces child views. If there are no views to remove
this acts as an insert. If there are no views to
add this acts as a remove. Views being removed will
have the parent set to

null

, and the internal reference
to them removed so that they can be garbage collected.
This is implemented to do nothing, because by default
a view has no children.

**Parameters:** offset

- the starting index into the child views to insert
the new views. This should be a value >= 0 and <= getViewCount
**Parameters:** length

- the number of existing child views to remove
This should be a value >= 0 and <= (getViewCount() - offset).
**Parameters:** views

- the child views to add. This value can be

null

to indicate no children are being added
(useful to remove).
**Since:** 1.3

- getViewIndex

```java
public int getViewIndex​(int pos,

Position.Bias
b)
```

Returns the child view index representing the given position in
the model. By default a view has no children so this is implemented
to return -1 to indicate there is no valid child index for any
position.

**Parameters:** pos

- the position >= 0
**Parameters:** b

- the bias
**Returns:** index of the view representing the given position, or
-1 if no view represents that position
**Since:** 1.3

- getChildAllocation

```java
public
Shape
getChildAllocation​(int index,

Shape
a)
```

Fetches the allocation for the given child view.
This enables finding out where various views
are located, without assuming how the views store
their location. This returns

null

since the
default is to not have any child views.

**Parameters:** index

- the index of the child, >= 0 && <

getViewCount()
**Parameters:** a

- the allocation to this view
**Returns:** the allocation to the child

- getNextVisualPositionFrom

```java
public int getNextVisualPositionFrom​(int pos,

Position.Bias
b,

Shape
a,
int direction,

Position.Bias
[] biasRet)
throws
BadLocationException
```

Provides a way to determine the next visually represented model
location at which one might place a caret.
Some views may not be visible,
they might not be in the same order found in the model, or they just
might not allow access to some of the locations in the model.
This method enables specifying a position to convert
within the range of >=0. If the value is -1, a position
will be calculated automatically. If the value < -1,
the

BadLocationException

will be thrown.

**Parameters:** pos

- the position to convert
**Parameters:** b

- the bias
**Parameters:** a

- the allocated region in which to render
**Parameters:** direction

- the direction from the current position that can
be thought of as the arrow keys typically found on a keyboard.
This will be one of the following values:

- SwingConstants.WEST

SwingConstants.EAST

SwingConstants.NORTH

SwingConstants.SOUTH
**Parameters:** biasRet

- the returned bias
**Returns:** the location within the model that best represents the next
location visual position
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- the given position is not a valid
position within the document
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

direction

doesn't have one of the legal values above

- modelToView

```java
public abstract
Shape
modelToView​(int pos,

Shape
a,

Position.Bias
b)
throws
BadLocationException
```

Provides a mapping, for a given character,
from the document model coordinate space
to the view coordinate space.

**Parameters:** pos

- the position of the desired character (>=0)
**Parameters:** a

next character represented by the offset, in case the
position is a boundary of two views;

b

will have one
of these values:

- Position.Bias.Forward

Position.Bias.Backward
**Returns:** the bounding box, in view coordinate space,
of the character at the specified position
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- if the specified position does
not represent a valid location in the associated document
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

b

is not one of the
legal

Position.Bias

values listed above
**See Also:** viewToModel(float, float, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.Position.Bias[])

- modelToView

b0,
int p1,

Position.Bias
b1,

Shape
a)
throws
BadLocationException

from the document model coordinate space
to the view coordinate space. The specified region is
created as a union of the first and last character positions.

**Parameters:** p0

- the position of the first character (>=0)
**Parameters:** b0

- the bias of the first character position,
toward the previous character or the
next character represented by the offset, in case the
position is a boundary of two views;

**Parameters:** p1

- the position of the last character (>=0)
**Parameters:** b1

- the bias for the second character position, defined
one of the legal values shown above
**Parameters:** a

- the area of the view, which encompasses the requested region
**Returns:** the bounding box which is a union of the region specified
by the first and last character positions
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- if the given position does
not represent a valid location in the associated document
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

b0

or

b1

are not one of the
legal

Position.Bias

values listed above
**See Also:** viewToModel(float, float, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.Position.Bias[])

- viewToModel

```java
public abstract int viewToModel​(float x,

Shape
a,

Position.Bias
[] biasReturn)
```

Provides a mapping from the view coordinate space to the logical
coordinate space of the model. The

biasReturn

argument will be filled in to indicate that the point given is
closer to the next character in the model or the previous

- insertUpdate

```java
public void insertUpdate​(
DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Gives notification that something was inserted into
the document in a location that this view is responsible for.
To reduce the burden to subclasses, this functionality is
spread out into the following calls that subclasses can
reimplement:

- updateChildren

is called
if there were any changes to the element this view is
responsible for. If this view has child views that are
represent the child elements, then this method should do
whatever is necessary to make sure the child views correctly
represent the model.

forwardUpdate

is called
to forward the DocumentEvent to the appropriate child views.

updateLayout

is called to
give the view a chance to either repair its layout, to reschedule
layout, or do nothing.

**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children
**See Also:** insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

- removeUpdate

```java
public void removeUpdate​(
DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Gives notification that something was removed from the document
in a location that this view is responsible for.
To reduce the burden to subclasses, this functionality is
spread out into the following calls that subclasses can
reimplement:

- updateChildren

is called
if there were any changes to the element this view is
responsible for. If this view has child views that are
represent the child elements, then this method should do
whatever is necessary to make sure the child views correctly
represent the model.

forwardUpdate

is called
to forward the DocumentEvent to the appropriate child views.

updateLayout

is called to
give the view a chance to either repair its layout, to reschedule
layout, or do nothing.

**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children
**See Also:** removeUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

- changedUpdate

```java
public void changedUpdate​(
DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Gives notification from the document that attributes were changed
in a location that this view is responsible for.
To reduce the burden to subclasses, this functionality is
spread out into the following calls that subclasses can
reimplement:

- updateChildren

is called
if there were any changes to the element this view is
responsible for. If this view has child views that are
represent the child elements, then this method should do
whatever is necessary to make sure the child views correctly
represent the model.

forwardUpdate

is called
to forward the DocumentEvent to the appropriate child views.

updateLayout

is called to
give the view a chance to either repair its layout, to reschedule
layout, or do nothing.

**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children
**See Also:** changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

- getDocument

```java
public
Document
getDocument()
```

Fetches the model associated with the view.

**Returns:** the view model,

null

if none
**See Also:** getDocument()

- getStartOffset

```java
public int getStartOffset()
```

Fetches the portion of the model for which this view is
responsible.

**Returns:** the starting offset into the model >= 0
**See Also:** getStartOffset()

- getEndOffset

```java
public int getEndOffset()
```

Fetches the portion of the model for which this view is
responsible.

**Returns:** the ending offset into the model >= 0
**See Also:** getEndOffset()

- getElement

```java
public
Element
getElement()
```

Fetches the structural portion of the subject that this
view is mapped to. The view may not be responsible for the
entire portion of the element.

**Returns:** the subject
**See Also:** getElement()

- getGraphics

```java
public
Graphics
getGraphics()
```

Fetch a

Graphics

for rendering.
This can be used to determine
font characteristics, and will be different for a print view
than a component view.

**Returns:** a

Graphics

object for rendering
**Since:** 1.3

- getAttributes

```java
public
AttributeSet
getAttributes()
```

Fetches the attributes to use when rendering. By default
this simply returns the attributes of the associated element.
This method should be used rather than using the element
directly to obtain access to the attributes to allow
view-specific attributes to be mixed in or to allow the
view to have view-specific conversion of attributes by
subclasses.
Each view should document what attributes it recognizes
for the purpose of rendering or layout, and should always
access them through the

AttributeSet

returned
by this method.

**Returns:** the attributes to use when rendering

- breakView

```java
public
View
breakView​(int axis,
int offset,
float pos,
float len)
```

Tries to break this view on the given axis. This is
called by views that try to do formatting of their
children. For example, a view of a paragraph will
typically try to place its children into row and
views representing chunks of text can sometimes be
broken down into smaller pieces.

This is implemented to return the view itself, which
represents the default behavior on not being
breakable. If the view does support breaking, the
starting offset of the view returned should be the
given offset, and the end offset should be less than
or equal to the end offset of the view being broken.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Parameters:** offset

- the location in the document model
that a broken fragment would occupy >= 0. This
would be the starting offset of the fragment
returned
**Parameters:** pos

- the position along the axis that the
broken view would occupy >= 0. This may be useful for
things like tab calculations
**Parameters:** len

- specifies the distance along the axis
where a potential break is desired >= 0
**Returns:** the fragment of the view that represents the
given span, if the view can be broken. If the view
doesn't support breaking behavior, the view itself is
returned.
**See Also:** ParagraphView

- createFragment

```java
public
View
createFragment​(int p0,
int p1)
```

Creates a view that represents a portion of the element.
This is potentially useful during formatting operations
for taking measurements of fragments of the view. If
the view doesn't support fragmenting (the default), it
should return itself.

**Parameters:** p0

- the starting offset >= 0. This should be a value
greater or equal to the element starting offset and
less than the element ending offset.
**Parameters:** p1

- the ending offset > p0. This should be a value
less than or equal to the elements end offset and
greater than the elements starting offset.
**Returns:** the view fragment, or itself if the view doesn't
support breaking into fragments
**See Also:** LabelView

- getBreakWeight

```java
public int getBreakWeight​(int axis,
float pos,
float len)
```

Determines how attractive a break opportunity in
this view is. This can be used for determining which
view is the most attractive to call

breakView

on in the process of formatting. A view that represents
text that has whitespace in it might be more attractive
than a view that has no whitespace, for example. The
higher the weight, the more attractive the break. A
value equal to or lower than

BadBreakWeight

should not be considered for a break. A value greater
than or equal to

ForcedBreakWeight

should
be broken.

This is implemented to provide the default behavior
of returning

BadBreakWeight

unless the length
is greater than the length of the view in which case the
entire view represents the fragment. Unless a view has
been written to support breaking behavior, it is not
attractive to try and break the view. An example of
a view that does support breaking is

LabelView

.
An example of a view that uses break weight is

ParagraphView

.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Parameters:** pos

- the potential location of the start of the
broken view >= 0. This may be useful for calculating tab
positions
**Parameters:** len

- specifies the relative length from

pos

where a potential break is desired >= 0
**Returns:** the weight, which should be a value between
ForcedBreakWeight and BadBreakWeight
**See Also:** LabelView

,

ParagraphView

,

BadBreakWeight

,

GoodBreakWeight

,

ExcellentBreakWeight

,

ForcedBreakWeight

- getResizeWeight

```java
public int getResizeWeight​(int axis)
```

Determines the resizability of the view along the
given axis. A value of 0 or less is not resizable.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Returns:** the weight

- setSize

```java
public void setSize​(float width,
float height)
```

Sets the size of the view. This should cause
layout of the view along the given axis, if it
has any layout duties.

**Parameters:** width

- the width >= 0
**Parameters:** height

- the height >= 0

- getContainer

```java
public
Container
getContainer()
```

Fetches the container hosting the view. This is useful for
things like scheduling a repaint, finding out the host
components font, etc. The default implementation
of this is to forward the query to the parent view.

**Returns:** the container,

null

if none

- getViewFactory

```java
public
ViewFactory
getViewFactory()
```

Fetches the

ViewFactory

implementation that is feeding
the view hierarchy. Normally the views are given this
as an argument to updates from the model when they
are most likely to need the factory, but this
method serves to provide it at other times.

**Returns:** the factory,

null

if none

- getToolTipText

```java
public
String
getToolTipText​(float x,
float y,

Shape
allocation)
```

Returns the tooltip text at the specified location. The default
implementation returns the value from the child View identified by
the passed in location.

**Parameters:** x

- the x coordinate
**Parameters:** y

- the y coordinate
**Parameters:** allocation

- current allocation of the View.
**Returns:** the tooltip text at the specified location
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** JTextComponent.getToolTipText(java.awt.event.MouseEvent)

- getViewIndex

```java
public int getViewIndex​(float x,
float y,

Shape
allocation)
```

Returns the child view index representing the given position in
the view. This iterates over all the children returning the
first with a bounds that contains

x

,

y

.

**Parameters:** x

- the x coordinate
**Parameters:** y

- the y coordinate
**Parameters:** allocation

- current allocation of the View.
**Returns:** index of the view representing the given location, or
-1 if no view represents that position
**Since:** 1.4

- updateChildren

```java
protected boolean updateChildren​(
DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Updates the child views in response to receiving notification
that the model changed, and there is change record for the
element this view is responsible for. This is implemented
to assume the child views are directly responsible for the
child elements of the element this view represents. The

ViewFactory

is used to create child views for each element
specified as added in the

ElementChange

, starting at the
index specified in the given

ElementChange

. The number of
child views representing the removed elements specified are
removed.

**Parameters:** ec

- the change information for the element this view
is responsible for. This should not be

null

if
this method gets called
**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to build child views
**Returns:** whether or not the child views represent the
child elements of the element this view is responsible
for. Some views create children that represent a portion
of the element they are responsible for, and should return
false. This information is used to determine if views
in the range of the added elements should be forwarded to
or not
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

- forwardUpdate

```java
protected void forwardUpdate​(
DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Forwards the given

DocumentEvent

to the child views
that need to be notified of the change to the model.
If there were changes to the element this view is
responsible for, that should be considered when
forwarding (i.e. new child views should not get
notified).

**Parameters:** ec

- changes to the element this view is responsible
for (may be

null

if there were no changes).
**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Parameters:** f

- forwardUpdateToView

```java
protected void forwardUpdateToView​(
View
v,

DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Forwards the

DocumentEvent

to the give child view. This
simply messages the view with a call to

insertUpdate

,

removeUpdate

, or

changedUpdate

depending
upon the type of the event. This is called by

forwardUpdate

to forward
the event to children that need it.

**Parameters:** v

- the child view to forward the event to
**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

- updateLayout

```java
protected void updateLayout​(
DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a)
```

Updates the layout in response to receiving notification of
change from the model. This is implemented to call

preferenceChanged

to reschedule a new layout
if the

ElementChange

record is not

null

.

**Parameters:** ec

- changes to the element this view is responsible
for (may be

null

if there were no changes)

```

Returns the parent of the view.

**Returns:** the parent, or

null

if none exists

- isVisible

```java
public boolean isVisible()
```

Returns a boolean that indicates whether
the view is visible or not. By default
all views are visible.

**Returns:** always returns true

- getPreferredSpan

```java
public abstract float getPreferredSpan​(int axis)
```

Determines the preferred span for this view along an
axis.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Returns:** the span the view would like to be rendered into.
Typically the view is told to render into the span
that is returned, although there is no guarantee.
The parent may choose to resize or break the view
**See Also:** getPreferredSpan(int)

- getMinimumSpan

```java
public float getMinimumSpan​(int axis)
```

Determines the minimum span for this view along an
axis.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Returns:** the minimum span the view can be rendered into
**See Also:** getPreferredSpan(int)

- getMaximumSpan

```java
public float getMaximumSpan​(int axis)
```

Determines the maximum span for this view along an
axis.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Returns:** the maximum span the view can be rendered into
**See Also:** getPreferredSpan(int)

- preferenceChanged

```java
public void preferenceChanged​(
View
child,
boolean width,
boolean height)
```

Child views can call this on the parent to indicate that
the preference has changed and should be reconsidered
for layout. By default this just propagates upward to
the next parent. The root view will call

revalidate

on the associated text component.

**Parameters:** child

- the child view
**Parameters:** width

- true if the width preference has changed
**Parameters:** height

- true if the height preference has changed
**See Also:** JComponent.revalidate()

- getAlignment

```java
public float getAlignment​(int axis)
```

Determines the desired alignment for this view along an
axis. The desired alignment is returned. This should be
a value >= 0.0 and <= 1.0, where 0 indicates alignment at
the origin and 1.0 indicates alignment to the full span
away from the origin. An alignment of 0.5 would be the
center of the view.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Returns:** the value 0.5

- paint

```java
public abstract void paint​(
Graphics

surface. The view may need to do layout and create child
views to enable itself to render into the given allocation.

**Parameters:** g

- the rendering surface to use
**Parameters:** allocation

- the allocated region to render into

- setParent

```java
public void setParent​(
View
parent)
```

Establishes the parent view for this view. This is
guaranteed to be called before any other methods if the
parent view is functioning properly. This is also
the last method called, since it is called to indicate
the view has been removed from the hierarchy as
well. When this method is called to set the parent to
null, this method does the same for each of its children,
propagating the notification that they have been
disconnected from the view tree. If this is
reimplemented,

super.setParent()

should
be called.

**Parameters:** parent

- the new parent, or

null

if the view is
being removed from a parent

- getViewCount

```java
public int getViewCount()
```

Returns the number of views in this view. Since
the default is to not be a composite view this
returns 0.

**Returns:** the number of views >= 0
**See Also:** getViewCount()

- getView

```java
public
View
getView​(int n)
```

Gets the

n

th child view. Since there are no
children by default, this returns

null

.

**Parameters:** n

- the number of the view to get, >= 0 && < getViewCount()
**Returns:** the view

- removeAll

```java
public void removeAll()
```

Removes all of the children. This is a convenience
call to

replace

.

**Since:** 1.3

- remove

```java
public void remove​(int i)
```

Removes one of the children at the given position.
This is a convenience call to

replace

.

**Parameters:** i

- the position
**Since:** 1.3

- insert

```java
public void insert​(int offs,

View
v)
```

Inserts a single child view. This is a convenience
call to

replace

.

**Parameters:** offs

- the offset of the view to insert before >= 0
**Parameters:** v

- the view
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** replace(int, int, javax.swing.text.View[])

- append

```java
public void append​(
View
v)
```

Appends a single child view. This is a convenience
call to

replace

.

**Parameters:** v

- the view
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** replace(int, int, javax.swing.text.View[])

- replace

```java
public void replace​(int offset,
int length,

View
[] views)
```

Replaces child views. If there are no views to remove
this acts as an insert. If there are no views to
add this acts as a remove. Views being removed will
have the parent set to

null

, and the internal reference
to them removed so that they can be garbage collected.
This is implemented to do nothing, because by default
a view has no children.

**Parameters:** offset

- the starting index into the child views to insert
the new views. This should be a value >= 0 and <= getViewCount
**Parameters:** length

- the number of existing child views to remove
This should be a value >= 0 and <= (getViewCount() - offset).
**Parameters:** views

- the child views to add. This value can be

null

to indicate no children are being added
(useful to remove).
**Since:** 1.3

- getViewIndex

```java
public int getViewIndex​(int pos,

Position.Bias
b)
```

Returns the child view index representing the given position in
the model. By default a view has no children so this is implemented
to return -1 to indicate there is no valid child index for any
position.

**Parameters:** pos

- the position >= 0
**Parameters:** b

- the bias
**Returns:** index of the view representing the given position, or
-1 if no view represents that position
**Since:** 1.3

- getChildAllocation

```java
public
Shape
getChildAllocation​(int index,

Shape
a)
```

Fetches the allocation for the given child view.
This enables finding out where various views
are located, without assuming how the views store
their location. This returns

null

since the
default is to not have any child views.

**Parameters:** index

- the index of the child, >= 0 && <

getViewCount()
**Parameters:** a

- the allocation to this view
**Returns:** the allocation to the child

- getNextVisualPositionFrom

```java
public int getNextVisualPositionFrom​(int pos,

Position.Bias
b,

Shape
a,
int direction,

Position.Bias
[] biasRet)
throws
BadLocationException
```

Provides a way to determine the next visually represented model
location at which one might place a caret.
Some views may not be visible,
they might not be in the same order found in the model, or they just
might not allow access to some of the locations in the model.
This method enables specifying a position to convert
within the range of >=0. If the value is -1, a position
will be calculated automatically. If the value < -1,
the

BadLocationException

will be thrown.

**Parameters:** pos

- the position to convert
**Parameters:** b

- the bias
**Parameters:** a

- the allocated region in which to render
**Parameters:** direction

- the direction from the current position that can
be thought of as the arrow keys typically found on a keyboard.
This will be one of the following values:

- SwingConstants.WEST

SwingConstants.EAST

SwingConstants.NORTH

SwingConstants.SOUTH
**Parameters:** biasRet

- the returned bias
**Returns:** the location within the model that best represents the next
location visual position
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- the given position is not a valid
position within the document
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

Gives notification that something was inserted into
the document in a location that this view is responsible for.
To reduce the burden to subclasses, this functionality is
spread out into the following calls that subclasses can
reimplement:

than a component view.

**Returns:** a

Graphics

object for rendering
**Since:** 1.3

- getAttributes

```java
public
AttributeSet
getAttributes()
```

Fetches the attributes to use when rendering. By default
this simply returns the attributes of the associated element.
This method should be used rather than using the element
directly to obtain access to the attributes to allow
view-specific attributes to be mixed in or to allow the
view to have view-specific conversion of attributes by
subclasses.
Each view should document what attributes it recognizes
for the purpose of rendering or layout, and should always
access them through the

AttributeSet

returned
by this method.

**Returns:** the attributes to use when rendering

- breakView

```java
public
View
breakView​(int axis,
int offset,
float pos,
float len)
```

Tries to break this view on the given axis. This is
called by views that try to do formatting of their
children. For example, a view of a paragraph will
typically try to place its children into row and
views representing chunks of text can sometimes be
broken down into smaller pieces.

This is implemented to return the view itself, which
represents the default behavior on not being
breakable. If the view does support breaking, the
starting offset of the view returned should be the
given offset, and the end offset should be less than
or equal to the end offset of the view being broken.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Parameters:** offset

- the location in the document model
that a broken fragment would occupy >= 0. This
would be the starting offset of the fragment
returned
**Parameters:** pos

- the position along the axis that the
broken view would occupy >= 0. This may be useful for
things like tab calculations
**Parameters:** len

- specifies the distance along the axis
where a potential break is desired >= 0
**Returns:** the fragment of the view that represents the
given span, if the view can be broken. If the view
doesn't support breaking behavior, the view itself is
returned.
**See Also:** ParagraphView

- createFragment

```java
public
View
createFragment​(int p0,
int p1)
```

Creates a view that represents a portion of the element.
This is potentially useful during formatting operations
for taking measurements of fragments of the view. If
the view doesn't support fragmenting (the default), it
should return itself.

**Parameters:** p0

- the starting offset >= 0. This should be a value
greater or equal to the element starting offset and
less than the element ending offset.
**Parameters:** p1

- the ending offset > p0. This should be a value
less than or equal to the elements end offset and
greater than the elements starting offset.
**Returns:** the view fragment, or itself if the view doesn't
support breaking into fragments
**See Also:** LabelView

- getBreakWeight

```java
public int getBreakWeight​(int axis,
float pos,
float len)
```

Determines how attractive a break opportunity in
this view is. This can be used for determining which
view is the most attractive to call

breakView

on in the process of formatting. A view that represents
text that has whitespace in it might be more attractive
than a view that has no whitespace, for example. The
higher the weight, the more attractive the break. A
value equal to or lower than

BadBreakWeight

should not be considered for a break. A value greater
than or equal to

ForcedBreakWeight

should
be broken.

This is implemented to provide the default behavior
of returning

BadBreakWeight

unless the length
is greater than the length of the view in which case the
entire view represents the fragment. Unless a view has
been written to support breaking behavior, it is not
attractive to try and break the view. An example of
a view that does support breaking is

LabelView

.
An example of a view that uses break weight is

ParagraphView

.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Parameters:** pos

- the potential location of the start of the
broken view >= 0. This may be useful for calculating tab
positions
**Parameters:** len

- specifies the relative length from

pos

where a potential break is desired >= 0
**Returns:** the weight, which should be a value between
ForcedBreakWeight and BadBreakWeight
**See Also:** LabelView

,

ParagraphView

,

BadBreakWeight

,

GoodBreakWeight

,

ExcellentBreakWeight

,

ForcedBreakWeight

- getResizeWeight

```java
public int getResizeWeight​(int axis)
```

given axis. A value of 0 or less is not resizable.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Returns:** the weight

- setSize

```java
public void setSize​(float width,
float height)
```

Sets the size of the view. This should cause
layout of the view along the given axis, if it
has any layout duties.

**Parameters:** width

- the width >= 0
**Parameters:** height

- the height >= 0

- getContainer

```java
public
Container
getContainer()
```

Fetches the container hosting the view. This is useful for
things like scheduling a repaint, finding out the host
components font, etc. The default implementation
of this is to forward the query to the parent view.

**Returns:** the container,

null

if none

- getViewFactory

```java
public
ViewFactory
getViewFactory()
```

Fetches the

ViewFactory

implementation that is feeding
the view hierarchy. Normally the views are given this
as an argument to updates from the model when they
are most likely to need the factory, but this
method serves to provide it at other times.

**Returns:** the factory,

null

if none

- getToolTipText

```java
public
String

the view. This iterates over all the children returning the
first with a bounds that contains

x

,

y

.

**Parameters:** x

- the x coordinate
**Parameters:** y

- the y coordinate
**Parameters:** allocation

- current allocation of the View.

-1 if no view represents that position
**Since:** 1.4

- updateChildren

```java
protected boolean updateChildren​(
DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Updates the child views in response to receiving notification
that the model changed, and there is change record for the
element this view is responsible for. This is implemented
to assume the child views are directly responsible for the
child elements of the element this view represents. The

ViewFactory

is used to create child views for each element
specified as added in the

ElementChange

, starting at the
index specified in the given

ElementChange

. The number of
child views representing the removed elements specified are
removed.

**Parameters:** ec

- the change information for the element this view
is responsible for. This should not be

null

if
this method gets called
**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to build child views
**Returns:** whether or not the child views represent the
child elements of the element this view is responsible
for. Some views create children that represent a portion
of the element they are responsible for, and should return
false. This information is used to determine if views
in the range of the added elements should be forwarded to
or not
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

,

ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Forwards the given

DocumentEvent

to the child views
that need to be notified of the change to the model.
If there were changes to the element this view is
responsible for, that should be considered when
forwarding (i.e. new child views should not get
notified).

**Parameters:** ec

- changes to the element this view is responsible
for (may be

null

if there were no changes).

```java
protected void updateLayout​(
DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a)

propagating the notification that they have been
disconnected from the view tree. If this is
reimplemented,

super.setParent()

should
be called.

This should be a value >= 0 and <= (getViewCount() - offset).
**Parameters:** views

- the child views to add. This value can be

null

to indicate no children are being added
(useful to remove).
**Since:** 1.3

---

#### replace

public void replace​(int offset,
int length,

View

[] views)

Replaces child views. If there are no views to remove
this acts as an insert. If there are no views to
add this acts as a remove. Views being removed will
have the parent set to

null

, and the internal reference
to them removed so that they can be garbage collected.
This is implemented to do nothing, because by default
a view has no children.

getViewIndex

```java
public int getViewIndex​(int pos,

Position.Bias
b)
```

Returns the child view index representing the given position in
the model. By default a view has no children so this is implemented
to return -1 to indicate there is no valid child index for any
position.

**Parameters:** pos

- the position >= 0
**Parameters:** b

- the bias
**Returns:** index of the view representing the given position, or
-1 if no view represents that position
**Since:** 1.3

---

#### getViewIndex

position.

getChildAllocation

```java
public
Shape
getChildAllocation​(int index,

Shape
a)
```

Fetches the allocation for the given child view.
This enables finding out where various views
are located, without assuming how the views store
their location. This returns

null

since the
default is to not have any child views.

**Parameters:** index

- the index of the child, >= 0 && <

getViewCount()
**Parameters:** a

- the allocation to this view
**Returns:** the allocation to the child

Provides a way to determine the next visually represented model
location at which one might place a caret.
Some views may not be visible,
they might not be in the same order found in the model, or they just
might not allow access to some of the locations in the model.
This method enables specifying a position to convert
within the range of >=0. If the value is -1, a position
will be calculated automatically. If the value < -1,
the

BadLocationException

will be thrown.

**Parameters:** pos

- the position to convert
**Parameters:** b

- the bias
**Parameters:** a

- the allocated region in which to render
**Parameters:** direction

- the direction from the current position that can
be thought of as the arrow keys typically found on a keyboard.
This will be one of the following values:

- SwingConstants.WEST

SwingConstants.EAST

SwingConstants.NORTH

SwingConstants.SOUTH
**Parameters:** biasRet

typically try to place its children into row and
views representing chunks of text can sometimes be
broken down into smaller pieces.

This is implemented to return the view itself, which
represents the default behavior on not being
breakable. If the view does support breaking, the
starting offset of the view returned should be the
given offset, and the end offset should be less than
or equal to the end offset of the view being broken.

**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

should return itself.

**Parameters:** p0

- the starting offset >= 0. This should be a value
greater or equal to the element starting offset and
less than the element ending offset.
**Parameters:** p1

view is the most attractive to call

breakView

on in the process of formatting. A view that represents
text that has whitespace in it might be more attractive
than a view that has no whitespace, for example. The
higher the weight, the more attractive the break. A
value equal to or lower than

BadBreakWeight

should not be considered for a break. A value greater
than or equal to

ForcedBreakWeight

should
be broken.

This is implemented to provide the default behavior
of returning

BadBreakWeight

unless the length
is greater than the length of the view in which case the
entire view represents the fragment. Unless a view has
been written to support breaking behavior, it is not
attractive to try and break the view. An example of

this method gets called
**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to build child views
**Returns:** whether or not the child views represent the
child elements of the element this view is responsible
for. Some views create children that represent a portion
of the element they are responsible for, and should return
false. This information is used to determine if views
in the range of the added elements should be forwarded to
or not

#### updateChildren

protected boolean updateChildren​(

DocumentEvent.ElementChange

ec,

DocumentEvent

e,

ViewFactory

f)

Updates the child views in response to receiving notification
that the model changed, and there is change record for the
element this view is responsible for. This is implemented
to assume the child views are directly responsible for the
child elements of the element this view represents. The

ViewFactory

is used to create child views for each element
specified as added in the

ElementChange

, starting at the
index specified in the given

ElementChange

. The number of
child views representing the removed elements specified are
removed.

forwardUpdate

```java
protected void forwardUpdate​(
DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Forwards the given

DocumentEvent

to the child views
that need to be notified of the change to the model.
If there were changes to the element this view is
responsible for, that should be considered when
forwarding (i.e. new child views should not get
notified).

**Parameters:** ec

- changes to the element this view is responsible
for (may be

null

if there were no changes).
**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

#### forwardUpdate

protected void forwardUpdate​(

DocumentEvent.ElementChange

ec,

DocumentEvent

e,

Shape

a,

ViewFactory

f)

Forwards the given

DocumentEvent

to the child views
that need to be notified of the change to the model.
If there were changes to the element this view is
responsible for, that should be considered when
forwarding (i.e. new child views should not get
notified).

forwardUpdateToView

```java
protected void forwardUpdateToView​(
View
v,

DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Forwards the

DocumentEvent

to the give child view. This
simply messages the view with a call to

insertUpdate

,

removeUpdate

, or

changedUpdate

depending
upon the type of the event. This is called by

forwardUpdate

to forward
the event to children that need it.

**Parameters:** v

- the child view to forward the event to
**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Parameters:** f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** forwardUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent.ElementChange, javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

#### forwardUpdateToView

protected void forwardUpdateToView​(

View

v,

DocumentEvent

e,

Shape

a,

ViewFactory

f)

Forwards the

DocumentEvent

to the give child view. This
simply messages the view with a call to

insertUpdate

,

removeUpdate

, or

changedUpdate

depending
upon the type of the event. This is called by

forwardUpdate

to forward
the event to children that need it.

updateLayout

```java
protected void updateLayout​(
DocumentEvent.ElementChange
ec,

DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a)
```

Updates the layout in response to receiving notification of
change from the model. This is implemented to call

preferenceChanged

to reschedule a new layout
if the

ElementChange

record is not

null

.

**Parameters:** ec

- changes to the element this view is responsible
for (may be

null

if there were no changes)
**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

,

#### updateLayout

protected void updateLayout​(

DocumentEvent.ElementChange

ec,

DocumentEvent

e,

Shape

a)

Updates the layout in response to receiving notification of
change from the model. This is implemented to call

preferenceChanged

to reschedule a new layout
if the

ElementChange

record is not

null

.

modelToView

```java
@Deprecated

public
Shape
modelToView​(int pos,

Shape
a)
throws
BadLocationException
```

Deprecated.

Provides a mapping from the document model coordinate space
to the coordinate space of the view mapped to it. This is
implemented to default the bias to

Position.Bias.Forward

which was previously implied.

**Parameters:** pos

- the position to convert >= 0
**Parameters:** a

- the allocated region in which to render
**Returns:** the bounding box of the given position is returned
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- if the given position does
not represent a valid location in the associated document
**See Also:** modelToView(int, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.Position.Bias)
