### Class Description

```java
public class
Finishings

extends
EnumSyntax

implements
DocAttribute
,
PrintRequestAttribute
,
PrintJobAttribute
```

Class

Finishings

is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that
identifies whether the printer applies a finishing operation of some kind of
binding to each copy of each printed document in the job. For multidoc print
jobs (jobs with multiple documents), the

MultipleDocumentHandling

attribute
determines what constitutes a "copy" for purposes of finishing.

Standard Finishings values are:

Standard Finishings values

NONE

STAPLE

EDGE_STITCH

BIND

SADDLE_STITCH

COVER

The following

Finishings

values are more specific; they indicate a
corner or an edge as if the document were a portrait document:

Specific Finishings values

STAPLE_TOP_LEFT

EDGE_STITCH_LEFT

STAPLE_DUAL_LEFT

STAPLE_BOTTOM_LEFT

EDGE_STITCH_TOP

STAPLE_DUAL_TOP

STAPLE_TOP_RIGHT

EDGE_STITCH_RIGHT

STAPLE_DUAL_RIGHT

STAPLE_BOTTOM_RIGHT

EDGE_STITCH_BOTTOM

STAPLE_DUAL_BOTTOM

The STAPLE_

XXX

values are specified with respect to the document as if
the document were a portrait document. If the document is actually a
landscape or a reverse-landscape document, the client supplies the
appropriate transformed value. For example, to position a staple in the upper
left hand corner of a landscape document when held for reading, the client
supplies the

STAPLE_BOTTOM_LEFT

value (since landscape is defined as
a +90 degree rotation from portrait, i.e., anti-clockwise). On the other
hand, to position a staple in the upper left hand corner of a
reverse-landscape document when held for reading, the client supplies the

STAPLE_TOP_RIGHT

value (since reverse-landscape is defined as a -90
degree rotation from portrait, i.e., clockwise).

The angle (vertical, horizontal, angled) of each staple with respect to the
document depends on the implementation which may in turn depend on the value
of the attribute.

The effect of a

Finishings

attribute on a multidoc print job (a job
with multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same
binding specified or whether different docs have different bindings
specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the

MultipleDocumentHandling

attribute.

- If all the docs have the same binding specified, then any value of

MultipleDocumentHandling

makes sense, and
the printer's processing depends on the

MultipleDocumentHandling

value:

- SINGLE_DOCUMENT

-- All the input docs will be bound together
as one output document with the specified binding.

SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET

-- All the input docs will be bound
together as one output document with the specified binding, and the first
impression of each input doc will always start on a new media sheet.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will
be bound separately with the specified binding.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will be
bound separately with the specified binding.

If different docs have different bindings specified, then only two
values of

MultipleDocumentHandling

make
sense, and the printer reports an error when the job is submitted if any
other value is specified:

- SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will
be bound separately with its own specified binding.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will be
bound separately with its own specified binding.

IPP Compatibility:

Class Finishings encapsulates some of the IPP enum
values that can be included in an IPP "finishings" attribute, which is a set
of enums. The category name returned by

getName()

is the IPP
attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum value. The

toString()

method returns the IPP string representation of the
attribute value. In IPP Finishings is a multi-value attribute, this API
currently allows only one binding to be specified.

bound separately with its own specified binding.

IPP Compatibility:

Class Finishings encapsulates some of the IPP enum
values that can be included in an IPP "finishings" attribute, which is a set
of enums. The category name returned by

getName()

is the IPP
attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum value. The

toString()

method returns the IPP string representation of the
attribute value. In IPP Finishings is a multi-value attribute, this API
currently allows only one binding to be specified.

If all the docs have the same binding specified, then any value of

MultipleDocumentHandling

makes sense, and
the printer's processing depends on the

MultipleDocumentHandling

value:

- SINGLE_DOCUMENT

-- All the input docs will be bound together
as one output document with the specified binding.

SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET

-- All the input docs will be bound
together as one output document with the specified binding, and the first
impression of each input doc will always start on a new media sheet.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will
be bound separately with the specified binding.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will be
bound separately with the specified binding.

If different docs have different bindings specified, then only two
values of

MultipleDocumentHandling

make
sense, and the printer reports an error when the job is submitted if any
other value is specified:

- SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will
be bound separately with its own specified binding.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will be
bound separately with its own specified binding.

SINGLE_DOCUMENT

-- All the input docs will be bound together
as one output document with the specified binding.

SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET

-- All the input docs will be bound
together as one output document with the specified binding, and the first
impression of each input doc will always start on a new media sheet.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will
be bound separately with the specified binding.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will be
bound separately with the specified binding.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will
be bound separately with its own specified binding.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES

-- Each input doc will be
