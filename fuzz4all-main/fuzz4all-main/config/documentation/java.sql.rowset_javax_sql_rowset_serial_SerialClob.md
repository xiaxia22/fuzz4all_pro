# Class SerialClob

**Source:** `java.sql.rowset\javax\sql\rowset\serial\SerialClob.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
SerialClob

extends
Object

implements
Clob
,
Serializable
,
Cloneable
```

A serialized mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL

CLOB

value.

The

SerialClob

class provides a constructor for creating
an instance from a

Clob

object. Note that the

Clob

object should have brought the SQL

CLOB

value's data over
to the client before a

SerialClob

object
is constructed from it. The data of an SQL

CLOB

value can
be materialized on the client as a stream of Unicode characters.

SerialClob

methods make it possible to get a substring
from a

SerialClob

object or to locate the start of
a pattern of characters.

Thread safety

A SerialClob is not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. If a
SerialClob is to be used by more than one thread then access to the SerialClob
should be controlled by appropriate synchronization.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

,

Cloneable

,

Clob

### Field Details

### Constructor Details

#### public SerialClob​(char[] ch)
throws
SerialException
,

SQLException

Constructs a

SerialClob

object that is a serialized version of
the given

char

array.

The new

SerialClob

object is initialized with the data from the

char

array, thus allowing disconnected

RowSet

objects to establish a serialized

Clob

object without touching
the data source.

**Parameters:**
- ch

- the char array representing the

Clob

object to be
serialized

**Throws:**
- SerialException

- if an error occurs during serialization
- SQLException

- if a SQL error occurs

---

#### public SerialClob​(
Clob
clob)
throws
SerialException
,

SQLException

Constructs a

SerialClob

object that is a serialized
version of the given

Clob

object.

The new

SerialClob

object is initialized with the
data from the

Clob

object; therefore, the

Clob

object should have previously brought the
SQL

CLOB

value's data over to the client from
the database. Otherwise, the new

SerialClob

object
object will contain no data.

Note: The

Clob

object supplied to this constructor must
return non-null for both the

Clob.getCharacterStream()

and

Clob.getAsciiStream

methods. This

SerialClob

constructor cannot serialize a

Clob

object in this instance
and will throw an

SQLException

object.

**Parameters:**
- clob

- the

Clob

object from which this

SerialClob

object is to be constructed; cannot be null

**Throws:**
- SerialException

- if an error occurs during serialization
- SQLException

- if a SQL error occurs in capturing the CLOB;
if the

Clob

object is a null; or if either of the

Clob.getCharacterStream()

and

Clob.getAsciiStream()

methods on the

Clob

returns a null

**See Also:**
- Clob

### Method Details

#### public long length()
throws
SerialException

Retrieves the number of characters in this

SerialClob

object's array of characters.

**Specified by:**
- length

in interface

Clob

**Returns:**
- a

long

indicating the length in characters of this

SerialClob

object's array of character

**Throws:**
- SerialException

- if an error occurs;
if

free

had previously been called on this object

---

#### public
Reader
getCharacterStream()
throws
SerialException

Returns this

SerialClob

object's data as a stream
of Unicode characters. Unlike the related method,

getAsciiStream

,
a stream is produced regardless of whether the

SerialClob

object
was created with a

Clob

object or a

char

array.

**Specified by:**
- getCharacterStream

in interface

Clob

**Returns:**
- a

java.io.Reader

if

free

had previously been called on this object

**See Also:**
- Clob.setCharacterStream(long)

---

#### public
InputStream
getAsciiStream()
throws
SerialException
,

SQLException

Retrieves the

CLOB

value designated by this

SerialClob

object as an ascii stream. This method forwards the

getAsciiStream

call to the underlying

Clob

object in the event that this

SerialClob

object is instantiated with a

Clob

object. If this

SerialClob

object is instantiated with
a

char

array, a

SerialException

object is thrown.

**Specified by:**
- getAsciiStream

in interface

Clob

**Returns:**
- a

java.io.InputStream

object containing
this

SerialClob

object's data

**Throws:**
- SerialException

- if this

SerialClob

object was not
instantiated with a

Clob

object;
if

free

had previously been called on this object
- SQLException

- if there is an error accessing the

CLOB

value represented by the

Clob

object
that was used to create this

SerialClob

object

**See Also:**
- Clob.setAsciiStream(long)

---

#### public

object

**Returns:**
- a

String

object containing a substring of
this

SerialClob

object beginning at the
given position and containing the specified number of
consecutive characters

**Throws:**
- SerialException

- if either of the arguments is out of bounds;

String
searchStr,
long start)
throws
SerialException
,

SQLException

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- SerialClob

```java
public SerialClob​(char[] ch)
throws
SerialException
,

SQLException
```

Constructs a

SerialClob

object that is a serialized version of
the given

char

array.

The new

SerialClob

object is initialized with the data from the

char

array, thus allowing disconnected

RowSet

objects to establish a serialized

Clob

object without touching
the data source.

**Parameters:** ch

- the char array representing the

Clob

object to be
serialized
**Throws:** SerialException

- if an error occurs during serialization
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a SQL error occurs

- SerialClob

```java
public SerialClob​(
Clob
clob)
throws
SerialException
,

SQLException
```

Constructs a

SerialClob

object that is a serialized
version of the given

Clob

object.

The new

SerialClob

object is initialized with the
data from the

Clob

object; therefore, the

Clob

object should have previously brought the
SQL

CLOB

value's data over to the client from
the database. Otherwise, the new

SerialClob

object
object will contain no data.

Note: The

Clob

object supplied to this constructor must
return non-null for both the

Clob.getCharacterStream()

and

Clob.getAsciiStream

methods. This

SerialClob

constructor cannot serialize a

Clob

object in this instance
and will throw an

SQLException

object.

**Parameters:** clob

- the

Clob

object from which this

SerialClob

object is to be constructed; cannot be null
**Throws:** SerialException

- if an error occurs during serialization
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a SQL error occurs in capturing the CLOB;
if the

Clob

object is a null; or if either of the

Clob.getCharacterStream()

and

Clob.getAsciiStream()

methods on the

Clob

returns a null
