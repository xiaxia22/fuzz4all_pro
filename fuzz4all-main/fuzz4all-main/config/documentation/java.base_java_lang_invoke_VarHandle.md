# Class VarHandle

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\invoke\VarHandle.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
VarHandle

extends
Object
```

A VarHandle is a dynamically strongly typed reference to a variable, or to a
parametrically-defined family of variables, including static fields,
non-static fields, array elements, or components of an off-heap data
structure. Access to such variables is supported under various

access modes

, including plain read/write access, volatile
read/write access, and compare-and-set.

VarHandles are immutable and have no visible state. VarHandles cannot be
subclassed by the user.

A VarHandle has:

- a

variable type

T, the type of every variable referenced
by this VarHandle; and

a list of

coordinate types

CT1, CT2, ..., CTn

, the types of

coordinate expressions

that
jointly locate a variable referenced by this VarHandle.

Variable and coordinate types may be primitive or reference, and are
represented by

Class

objects. The list of coordinate types may be
empty.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the supported variable type and the list
of coordinate types.

Each access mode is associated with one

access mode method

, a

signature polymorphic

method named
for the access mode. When an access mode method is invoked on a VarHandle
instance, the initial arguments to the invocation are coordinate expressions
that indicate in precisely which object the variable is to be accessed.
Trailing arguments to the invocation represent values of importance to the
access mode. For example, the various compare-and-set or compare-and-exchange
access modes require two trailing arguments for the variable's expected value
and new value.

The arity and types of arguments to the invocation of an access mode
method are not checked statically. Instead, each access mode method
specifies an

access mode type

,
represented as an instance of

MethodType

, that serves as a kind of
method signature against which the arguments are checked dynamically. An
access mode type gives formal parameter types in terms of the coordinate
types of a VarHandle instance and the types for values of importance to the
access mode. An access mode type also gives a return type, often in terms of
the variable type of a VarHandle instance. When an access mode method is
invoked on a VarHandle instance, the symbolic type descriptor at the
call site, the run time types of arguments to the invocation, and the run
time type of the return value, must

match

the types
given in the access mode type. A runtime exception will be thrown if the
match fails.

For example, the access mode method

compareAndSet(java.lang.Object...)

specifies that if
its receiver is a VarHandle instance with coordinate types

CT1, ..., CTn

and variable type

T

, then its access mode type
is

(CT1 c1, ..., CTn cn, T expectedValue, T newValue)boolean

.
Suppose that a VarHandle instance can access array elements, and that its
coordinate types are

String[]

and

int

while its variable type
is

String

. The access mode type for

compareAndSet

on this
VarHandle instance would be

(String[] c1, int c2, String expectedValue, String newValue)boolean

.
Such a VarHandle instance may be produced by the

array factory method

and
access array elements as follows:

```java
String[] sa = ...
VarHandle avh = MethodHandles.arrayElementVarHandle(String[].class);
boolean r = avh.compareAndSet(sa, 10, "expected", "new");
```

Access modes control atomicity and consistency properties.

Plain

read (

get

) and write (

set

)
accesses are guaranteed to be bitwise atomic only for references
and for primitive values of at most 32 bits, and impose no observable
ordering constraints with respect to threads other than the
executing thread.

Opaque

operations are bitwise atomic and
coherently ordered with respect to accesses to the same variable.
In addition to obeying Opaque properties,

Acquire

mode
reads and their subsequent accesses are ordered after matching

Release

mode writes and their previous accesses. In
addition to obeying Acquire and Release properties, all

Volatile

operations are totally ordered with respect to
each other.

Access modes are grouped into the following categories:

- read access modes that get the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

get

,

getVolatile

,

getAcquire

,

getOpaque

.

write access modes that set the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

set

,

setVolatile

,

setRelease

,

setOpaque

.

atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically compare and set
the value of a variable under specified memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

compareAndSet

,

weakCompareAndSetPlain

,

weakCompareAndSet

,

weakCompareAndSetAcquire

,

weakCompareAndSetRelease

,

compareAndExchangeAcquire

,

compareAndExchange

,

compareAndExchangeRelease

,

getAndSet

,

getAndSetAcquire

,

getAndSetRelease

.

numeric atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically get and
set with addition the value of a variable under specified memory ordering
effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

getAndAdd

,

getAndAddAcquire

,

getAndAddRelease

,

bitwise atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically get and
bitwise OR the value of a variable under specified memory ordering
effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

getAndBitwiseOr

,

getAndBitwiseOrAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseOrRelease

,

getAndBitwiseAnd

,

getAndBitwiseAndAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseAndRelease

,

getAndBitwiseXor

,

getAndBitwiseXorAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseXorRelease

.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the set of access modes that are
supported, which may also include documenting restrictions based on the
variable type and whether a variable is read-only. If an access mode is not
supported then the corresponding access mode method will on invocation throw
an

UnsupportedOperationException

. Factory methods should document
any additional undeclared exceptions that may be thrown by access mode
methods.
The

get

access mode is supported for all
VarHandle instances and the corresponding method never throws

UnsupportedOperationException

.
If a VarHandle references a read-only variable (for example a

final

field) then write, atomic update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic
update access modes are not supported and corresponding methods throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.
Read/write access modes (if supported), with the exception of

get

and

set

, provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitive types.
Unless stated otherwise in the documentation of a factory method, the access
modes

get

and

set

(if supported) provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitives types, with the exception of

long

and

double

on 32-bit platforms.

Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
the declaration site of a variable. For example, a VarHandle accessing
a field using the

get

access mode will access the field as
specified

by its access mode

even if that field is declared

volatile

. When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also
provided for fine-grained control of memory ordering.

The Java Language Specification permits other threads to observe operations
as if they were executed in orders different than are apparent in program
source code, subject to constraints arising, for example, from the use of
locks,

volatile

fields or VarHandles. The static methods,

fullFence

,

acquireFence

,

releaseFence

,

loadLoadFence

and

storeStoreFence

, can also be used to impose
constraints. Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
are phrased in terms of the lack of "reorderings" -- observable ordering
effects that might otherwise occur if the fence was not present. More
precise phrasing of the specification of access mode methods and memory fence
methods may accompany future updates of the Java Language Specification.

Compiling invocation of access mode methods

A Java method call expression naming an access mode method can invoke a
VarHandle from Java source code. From the viewpoint of source code, these
methods can take any arguments and their polymorphic result (if expressed)
can be cast to any return type. Formally this is accomplished by giving the
access mode methods variable arity

Object

arguments and

Object

return types (if the return type is polymorphic), but they
have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which
connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to access mode methods
compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction. More unusually, the
compiler must record the actual argument types, and may not perform method
invocation conversions on the arguments. Instead, it must generate
instructions to push them on the stack according to their own unconverted
types. The VarHandle object itself will be pushed on the stack before the
arguments. The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction
that invokes the access mode method with a symbolic type descriptor which
describes the argument and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also
determine the return type (if polymorphic). This is based on a cast on the
method invocation expression, if there is one, or else

Object

if the
invocation is an expression, or else

void

if the invocation is a
statement. The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given a symbolic type
descriptor of

java.lang.Void

. The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Performing invocation of access mode methods

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed it is linked
by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction and verifying that
the method call is statically legal. This also holds for calls to access mode
methods. In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler
is checked for correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved. Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes an access mode method will
always link, as long as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically
well-formed and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking, the receiving
VarHandle's access mode type is first checked by the JVM to ensure that it
matches the symbolic type descriptor. If the type
match fails, it means that the access mode method which the caller is
invoking is not present on the individual VarHandle being invoked.

Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of

MethodHandle.invoke(java.lang.Object...)

, where the receiving method handle accepts the
VarHandle instance as the leading argument. More specifically, the
following, where

{access-mode}

corresponds to the access mode method
name:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
```

behaves as if:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
am,
vh.accessModeType(am));

R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

(modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of

Throwable

).
This is equivalent to:

```java
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
VarHandle.class,
"{access-mode}",
MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a

MethodHandle.invokeExact(java.lang.Object...)

is performed, since before invocation of the
target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
widen primitive values, as if by

asType

(see also

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

).

More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.

Invocation checking

In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
succeed. But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses VarHandles.

Because access mode types contain "live"

Class

objects, method type
matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a VarHandle

VH

is created in one class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

, VarHandle access mode method
calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
resolved in

L2

, is matched against the original callee method's
symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in

L1

. The resolution in

L1

happens when

VH

is created and its access mode types are
assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
access it's variables is unrestricted.
If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed

when the VarHandle is
created

.
Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
classes, should generally be kept secret. They should not be passed to
untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.

VarHandle creation

Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is
accessible to that code. This is done via a reflective, capability-based
API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
from

Lookup.findVarHandle

.
There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.

Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
class. If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
the type of the accessing class.

Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
For example, a reflective

Field

can
be converted to a VarHandle using

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.
The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying fields.

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
source-level type. When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Object
getAndBitwiseXorRelease​(
Object
... args)

Atomically sets the value of a variable to the result of
bitwise XOR between the variable's current value and the

mask

VarHandle.

**Parameters:**
- args

- the signature-polymorphic parameter list of the form

(CT1 ct1, ..., CTn ctn, T mask)

### Additional Sections

#### Class VarHandle

java.lang.Object

- java.lang.invoke.VarHandle

java.lang.invoke.VarHandle

```java
public abstract class
VarHandle

extends
Object
```

A VarHandle is a dynamically strongly typed reference to a variable, or to a
parametrically-defined family of variables, including static fields,
non-static fields, array elements, or components of an off-heap data
structure. Access to such variables is supported under various

access modes

, including plain read/write access, volatile
read/write access, and compare-and-set.

VarHandles are immutable and have no visible state. VarHandles cannot be
subclassed by the user.

A VarHandle has:

- a

variable type

T, the type of every variable referenced
by this VarHandle; and

a list of

coordinate types

CT1, CT2, ..., CTn

, the types of

coordinate expressions

that
jointly locate a variable referenced by this VarHandle.

Variable and coordinate types may be primitive or reference, and are
represented by

Class

objects. The list of coordinate types may be
empty.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the supported variable type and the list
of coordinate types.

Each access mode is associated with one

access mode method

, a

signature polymorphic

method named
for the access mode. When an access mode method is invoked on a VarHandle
instance, the initial arguments to the invocation are coordinate expressions
that indicate in precisely which object the variable is to be accessed.
Trailing arguments to the invocation represent values of importance to the
access mode. For example, the various compare-and-set or compare-and-exchange
access modes require two trailing arguments for the variable's expected value
and new value.

The arity and types of arguments to the invocation of an access mode
method are not checked statically. Instead, each access mode method
specifies an

access mode type

,
represented as an instance of

MethodType

, that serves as a kind of
method signature against which the arguments are checked dynamically. An
access mode type gives formal parameter types in terms of the coordinate
types of a VarHandle instance and the types for values of importance to the
access mode. An access mode type also gives a return type, often in terms of
the variable type of a VarHandle instance. When an access mode method is
invoked on a VarHandle instance, the symbolic type descriptor at the
call site, the run time types of arguments to the invocation, and the run
time type of the return value, must

match

the types
given in the access mode type. A runtime exception will be thrown if the
match fails.

For example, the access mode method

compareAndSet(java.lang.Object...)

specifies that if
its receiver is a VarHandle instance with coordinate types

CT1, ..., CTn

and variable type

T

, then its access mode type
is

(CT1 c1, ..., CTn cn, T expectedValue, T newValue)boolean

.
Suppose that a VarHandle instance can access array elements, and that its
coordinate types are

String[]

and

int

while its variable type
is

String

. The access mode type for

compareAndSet

on this
VarHandle instance would be

(String[] c1, int c2, String expectedValue, String newValue)boolean

.
Such a VarHandle instance may be produced by the

array factory method

and
access array elements as follows:

```java
String[] sa = ...
VarHandle avh = MethodHandles.arrayElementVarHandle(String[].class);
boolean r = avh.compareAndSet(sa, 10, "expected", "new");
```

Access modes control atomicity and consistency properties.

Plain

read (

get

) and write (

set

)
accesses are guaranteed to be bitwise atomic only for references
and for primitive values of at most 32 bits, and impose no observable
ordering constraints with respect to threads other than the
executing thread.

Opaque

operations are bitwise atomic and
coherently ordered with respect to accesses to the same variable.
In addition to obeying Opaque properties,

Acquire

mode
reads and their subsequent accesses are ordered after matching

Release

mode writes and their previous accesses. In
addition to obeying Acquire and Release properties, all

Volatile

operations are totally ordered with respect to
each other.

Access modes are grouped into the following categories:

- read access modes that get the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

get

,

getVolatile

,

getAcquire

,

getOpaque

.

write access modes that set the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

set

,

setVolatile

,

setRelease

,

setOpaque

.

atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically compare and set
the value of a variable under specified memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

,

weakCompareAndSetPlain

,

.

numeric atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically get and
set with addition the value of a variable under specified memory ordering
effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

getAndAdd

,

getAndAddAcquire

,

getAndAddRelease

,

bitwise atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically get and
bitwise OR the value of a variable under specified memory ordering
effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

getAndBitwiseOr

,

,

,

getAndBitwiseAnd

,

getAndBitwiseAndAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseAndRelease

,

getAndBitwiseXor

,

getAndBitwiseXorAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseXorRelease

.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the set of access modes that are
supported, which may also include documenting restrictions based on the
variable type and whether a variable is read-only. If an access mode is not
supported then the corresponding access mode method will on invocation throw
an

UnsupportedOperationException

. Factory methods should document
any additional undeclared exceptions that may be thrown by access mode
methods.
The

get

access mode is supported for all
VarHandle instances and the corresponding method never throws

UnsupportedOperationException

.
If a VarHandle references a read-only variable (for example a

final

field) then write, atomic update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic
update access modes are not supported and corresponding methods throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.
Read/write access modes (if supported), with the exception of

get

and

set

, provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitive types.
Unless stated otherwise in the documentation of a factory method, the access
modes

get

and

set

(if supported) provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitives types, with the exception of

long

and

double

on 32-bit platforms.

Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
the declaration site of a variable. For example, a VarHandle accessing
a field using the

get

access mode will access the field as
specified

by its access mode

even if that field is declared

volatile

. When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also
provided for fine-grained control of memory ordering.

The Java Language Specification permits other threads to observe operations
as if they were executed in orders different than are apparent in program
source code, subject to constraints arising, for example, from the use of
locks,

volatile

fields or VarHandles. The static methods,

fullFence

,

acquireFence

,

releaseFence

,

loadLoadFence

and

storeStoreFence

, can also be used to impose
constraints. Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
are phrased in terms of the lack of "reorderings" -- observable ordering
effects that might otherwise occur if the fence was not present. More
precise phrasing of the specification of access mode methods and memory fence
methods may accompany future updates of the Java Language Specification.

Compiling invocation of access mode methods

A Java method call expression naming an access mode method can invoke a
VarHandle from Java source code. From the viewpoint of source code, these
methods can take any arguments and their polymorphic result (if expressed)
can be cast to any return type. Formally this is accomplished by giving the
access mode methods variable arity

Object

arguments and

Object

return types (if the return type is polymorphic), but they
have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which
connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to access mode methods
compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction. More unusually, the
compiler must record the actual argument types, and may not perform method
invocation conversions on the arguments. Instead, it must generate
instructions to push them on the stack according to their own unconverted
types. The VarHandle object itself will be pushed on the stack before the
arguments. The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction
that invokes the access mode method with a symbolic type descriptor which
describes the argument and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also
determine the return type (if polymorphic). This is based on a cast on the
method invocation expression, if there is one, or else

Object

if the
invocation is an expression, or else

void

if the invocation is a
statement. The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given a symbolic type
descriptor of

java.lang.Void

. The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Performing invocation of access mode methods

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed it is linked
by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction and verifying that
the method call is statically legal. This also holds for calls to access mode
methods. In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler
is checked for correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved. Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes an access mode method will
always link, as long as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically
well-formed and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking, the receiving
VarHandle's access mode type is first checked by the JVM to ensure that it
matches the symbolic type descriptor. If the type
match fails, it means that the access mode method which the caller is
invoking is not present on the individual VarHandle being invoked.

Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of

MethodHandle.invoke(java.lang.Object...)

, where the receiving method handle accepts the
VarHandle instance as the leading argument. More specifically, the
following, where

{access-mode}

corresponds to the access mode method
name:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
```

behaves as if:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
am,
vh.accessModeType(am));

R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

(modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of

Throwable

).
This is equivalent to:

```java
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
VarHandle.class,
"{access-mode}",
MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a

MethodHandle.invokeExact(java.lang.Object...)

is performed, since before invocation of the
target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
widen primitive values, as if by

asType

(see also

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

).

More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.

Invocation checking

In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
succeed. But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses VarHandles.

Because access mode types contain "live"

Class

objects, method type
matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a VarHandle

VH

is created in one class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

, VarHandle access mode method
calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
resolved in

L2

, is matched against the original callee method's
symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in

L1

. The resolution in

L1

happens when

VH

is created and its access mode types are
assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
access it's variables is unrestricted.
If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed

when the VarHandle is
created

.
Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
classes, should generally be kept secret. They should not be passed to
untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.

VarHandle creation

Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is
accessible to that code. This is done via a reflective, capability-based
API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
from

Lookup.findVarHandle

.
There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.

Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
class. If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
the type of the accessing class.

Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
For example, a reflective

Field

can
be converted to a VarHandle using

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.
The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying fields.

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
source-level type. When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

public abstract class

VarHandle

extends

Object

A VarHandle is a dynamically strongly typed reference to a variable, or to a
parametrically-defined family of variables, including static fields,
non-static fields, array elements, or components of an off-heap data
structure. Access to such variables is supported under various

access modes

, including plain read/write access, volatile
read/write access, and compare-and-set.

VarHandles are immutable and have no visible state. VarHandles cannot be
subclassed by the user.

A VarHandle has:

- a

variable type

T, the type of every variable referenced
by this VarHandle; and

a list of

coordinate types

CT1, CT2, ..., CTn

, the types of

coordinate expressions

that
jointly locate a variable referenced by this VarHandle.

Variable and coordinate types may be primitive or reference, and are
represented by

Class

objects. The list of coordinate types may be
empty.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the supported variable type and the list
of coordinate types.

Each access mode is associated with one

access mode method

, a

signature polymorphic

method named
for the access mode. When an access mode method is invoked on a VarHandle
instance, the initial arguments to the invocation are coordinate expressions
that indicate in precisely which object the variable is to be accessed.
Trailing arguments to the invocation represent values of importance to the
access mode. For example, the various compare-and-set or compare-and-exchange
access modes require two trailing arguments for the variable's expected value
and new value.

The arity and types of arguments to the invocation of an access mode
method are not checked statically. Instead, each access mode method
specifies an

access mode type

,
represented as an instance of

MethodType

, that serves as a kind of
method signature against which the arguments are checked dynamically. An
access mode type gives formal parameter types in terms of the coordinate
types of a VarHandle instance and the types for values of importance to the
access mode. An access mode type also gives a return type, often in terms of
the variable type of a VarHandle instance. When an access mode method is
invoked on a VarHandle instance, the symbolic type descriptor at the
call site, the run time types of arguments to the invocation, and the run
time type of the return value, must

match

the types
given in the access mode type. A runtime exception will be thrown if the
match fails.

For example, the access mode method

compareAndSet(java.lang.Object...)

specifies that if
its receiver is a VarHandle instance with coordinate types

CT1, ..., CTn

and variable type

T

, then its access mode type
is

(CT1 c1, ..., CTn cn, T expectedValue, T newValue)boolean

.
Suppose that a VarHandle instance can access array elements, and that its
coordinate types are

String[]

and

int

while its variable type
is

String

. The access mode type for

compareAndSet

on this
VarHandle instance would be

(String[] c1, int c2, String expectedValue, String newValue)boolean

.
Such a VarHandle instance may be produced by the

array factory method

and
access array elements as follows:

```java
String[] sa = ...
VarHandle avh = MethodHandles.arrayElementVarHandle(String[].class);
boolean r = avh.compareAndSet(sa, 10, "expected", "new");
```

Access modes control atomicity and consistency properties.

Plain

read (

get

) and write (

set

)
accesses are guaranteed to be bitwise atomic only for references
and for primitive values of at most 32 bits, and impose no observable
ordering constraints with respect to threads other than the
executing thread.

Opaque

operations are bitwise atomic and
coherently ordered with respect to accesses to the same variable.
In addition to obeying Opaque properties,

Acquire

mode
reads and their subsequent accesses are ordered after matching

Release

mode writes and their previous accesses. In
addition to obeying Acquire and Release properties, all

Volatile

operations are totally ordered with respect to
each other.

Access modes are grouped into the following categories:

- read access modes that get the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the set of access modes that are
supported, which may also include documenting restrictions based on the
variable type and whether a variable is read-only. If an access mode is not
supported then the corresponding access mode method will on invocation throw
an

UnsupportedOperationException

. Factory methods should document
any additional undeclared exceptions that may be thrown by access mode
methods.
The

get

access mode is supported for all
VarHandle instances and the corresponding method never throws

UnsupportedOperationException

.
If a VarHandle references a read-only variable (for example a

final

field) then write, atomic update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic
update access modes are not supported and corresponding methods throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.
Read/write access modes (if supported), with the exception of

get

and

set

, provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitive types.
Unless stated otherwise in the documentation of a factory method, the access
modes

get

and

set

(if supported) provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitives types, with the exception of

long

and

double

on 32-bit platforms.

Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
the declaration site of a variable. For example, a VarHandle accessing
a field using the

get

access mode will access the field as
specified

by its access mode

even if that field is declared

volatile

. When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also

,

acquireFence

,

releaseFence

,

loadLoadFence

and

storeStoreFence

, can also be used to impose
constraints. Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
are phrased in terms of the lack of "reorderings" -- observable ordering
effects that might otherwise occur if the fence was not present. More
precise phrasing of the specification of access mode methods and memory fence
methods may accompany future updates of the Java Language Specification.

Compiling invocation of access mode methods

A Java method call expression naming an access mode method can invoke a
VarHandle from Java source code. From the viewpoint of source code, these
methods can take any arguments and their polymorphic result (if expressed)
can be cast to any return type. Formally this is accomplished by giving the
access mode methods variable arity

Object

arguments and

Object

return types (if the return type is polymorphic), but they
have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which
connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to access mode methods
compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction. More unusually, the
compiler must record the actual argument types, and may not perform method
invocation conversions on the arguments. Instead, it must generate
instructions to push them on the stack according to their own unconverted
types. The VarHandle object itself will be pushed on the stack before the
arguments. The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction
that invokes the access mode method with a symbolic type descriptor which
describes the argument and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also
determine the return type (if polymorphic). This is based on a cast on the
method invocation expression, if there is one, or else

Object

if the
invocation is an expression, or else

void

if the invocation is a
statement. The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given a symbolic type
descriptor of

java.lang.Void

. The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Performing invocation of access mode methods

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed it is linked
by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction and verifying that
the method call is statically legal. This also holds for calls to access mode
methods. In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler
is checked for correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved. Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes an access mode method will
always link, as long as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically
well-formed and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking, the receiving
VarHandle's access mode type is first checked by the JVM to ensure that it
matches the symbolic type descriptor. If the type
match fails, it means that the access mode method which the caller is
invoking is not present on the individual VarHandle being invoked.

Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of

MethodHandle.invoke(java.lang.Object...)

, where the receiving method handle accepts the
VarHandle instance as the leading argument. More specifically, the
following, where

{access-mode}

corresponds to the access mode method
name:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
```

behaves as if:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
am,
vh.accessModeType(am));

R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

(modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of

Throwable

).
This is equivalent to:

```java
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
VarHandle.class,
"{access-mode}",
MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a

MethodHandle.invokeExact(java.lang.Object...)

is performed, since before invocation of the
target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
widen primitive values, as if by

asType

(see also

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

).

More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.

Invocation checking

In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
succeed. But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses VarHandles.

Because access mode types contain "live"

Class

objects, method type
matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a VarHandle

VH

is created in one class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

, VarHandle access mode method
calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
resolved in

L2

, is matched against the original callee method's
symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in

L1

. The resolution in

L1

happens when

VH

is created and its access mode types are
assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
access it's variables is unrestricted.
If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed

when the VarHandle is
created

.
Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
classes, should generally be kept secret. They should not be passed to
untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.

VarHandle creation

Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is
accessible to that code. This is done via a reflective, capability-based
API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
from

Lookup.findVarHandle

.
There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.

Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
class. If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
the type of the accessing class.

Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
For example, a reflective

Field

can
be converted to a VarHandle using

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.
The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying fields.

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
source-level type. When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

VarHandles are immutable and have no visible state. VarHandles cannot be
subclassed by the user.

A VarHandle has:

- a

variable type

T, the type of every variable referenced
by this VarHandle; and

a list of

coordinate types

CT1, CT2, ..., CTn

, the types of

coordinate expressions

that
jointly locate a variable referenced by this VarHandle.

Variable and coordinate types may be primitive or reference, and are
represented by

Class

objects. The list of coordinate types may be
empty.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the supported variable type and the list
of coordinate types.

Each access mode is associated with one

access mode method

, a

signature polymorphic

method named
for the access mode. When an access mode method is invoked on a VarHandle
instance, the initial arguments to the invocation are coordinate expressions
that indicate in precisely which object the variable is to be accessed.
Trailing arguments to the invocation represent values of importance to the
access mode. For example, the various compare-and-set or compare-and-exchange
access modes require two trailing arguments for the variable's expected value
and new value.

The arity and types of arguments to the invocation of an access mode
method are not checked statically. Instead, each access mode method
specifies an

access mode type

,
represented as an instance of

MethodType

, that serves as a kind of
method signature against which the arguments are checked dynamically. An
access mode type gives formal parameter types in terms of the coordinate
types of a VarHandle instance and the types for values of importance to the
access mode. An access mode type also gives a return type, often in terms of
the variable type of a VarHandle instance. When an access mode method is
invoked on a VarHandle instance, the symbolic type descriptor at the
call site, the run time types of arguments to the invocation, and the run
time type of the return value, must

match

the types
given in the access mode type. A runtime exception will be thrown if the
match fails.

For example, the access mode method

compareAndSet(java.lang.Object...)

specifies that if
its receiver is a VarHandle instance with coordinate types

CT1, ..., CTn

and variable type

T

, then its access mode type
is

(CT1 c1, ..., CTn cn, T expectedValue, T newValue)boolean

.
Suppose that a VarHandle instance can access array elements, and that its
coordinate types are

String[]

and

int

while its variable type
is

String

. The access mode type for

compareAndSet

on this
VarHandle instance would be

(String[] c1, int c2, String expectedValue, String newValue)boolean

.
Such a VarHandle instance may be produced by the

array factory method

and
access array elements as follows:

```java
String[] sa = ...
VarHandle avh = MethodHandles.arrayElementVarHandle(String[].class);
boolean r = avh.compareAndSet(sa, 10, "expected", "new");
```

Access modes control atomicity and consistency properties.

Plain

read (

get

) and write (

set

)
accesses are guaranteed to be bitwise atomic only for references
and for primitive values of at most 32 bits, and impose no observable
ordering constraints with respect to threads other than the
executing thread.

Opaque

operations are bitwise atomic and
coherently ordered with respect to accesses to the same variable.
In addition to obeying Opaque properties,

Acquire

mode
reads and their subsequent accesses are ordered after matching

Release

mode writes and their previous accesses. In
addition to obeying Acquire and Release properties, all

Volatile

operations are totally ordered with respect to
each other.

Access modes are grouped into the following categories:

- read access modes that get the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

get

,

getVolatile

,

getAcquire

,

getOpaque

.

write access modes that set the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

set

,

setVolatile

,

setRelease

,

setOpaque

.

atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically compare and set
the value of a variable under specified memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

compareAndSet

,

weakCompareAndSetPlain

,

weakCompareAndSet

,

weakCompareAndSetAcquire

,

weakCompareAndSetRelease

,

compareAndExchangeAcquire

,

compareAndExchange

,

compareAndExchangeRelease

,

getAndSet

,

getAndSetAcquire

,

getAndSetRelease

.

numeric atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically get and
set with addition the value of a variable under specified memory ordering
effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

getAndAdd

,

getAndAddAcquire

,

getAndAddRelease

,

bitwise atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically get and
bitwise OR the value of a variable under specified memory ordering
effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

getAndBitwiseOr

,

getAndBitwiseOrAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseOrRelease

,

getAndBitwiseAnd

,

getAndBitwiseAndAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseAndRelease

,

getAndBitwiseXor

,

getAndBitwiseXorAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseXorRelease

.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the set of access modes that are
supported, which may also include documenting restrictions based on the
variable type and whether a variable is read-only. If an access mode is not
supported then the corresponding access mode method will on invocation throw
an

UnsupportedOperationException

. Factory methods should document
any additional undeclared exceptions that may be thrown by access mode
methods.
The

get

access mode is supported for all
VarHandle instances and the corresponding method never throws

UnsupportedOperationException

.
If a VarHandle references a read-only variable (for example a

final

field) then write, atomic update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic
update access modes are not supported and corresponding methods throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.
Read/write access modes (if supported), with the exception of

get

and

set

, provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitive types.
Unless stated otherwise in the documentation of a factory method, the access
modes

get

and

set

(if supported) provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitives types, with the exception of

long

and

double

on 32-bit platforms.

Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
the declaration site of a variable. For example, a VarHandle accessing
a field using the

get

access mode will access the field as
specified

by its access mode

even if that field is declared

volatile

. When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also
provided for fine-grained control of memory ordering.

The Java Language Specification permits other threads to observe operations
as if they were executed in orders different than are apparent in program
source code, subject to constraints arising, for example, from the use of
locks,

volatile

fields or VarHandles. The static methods,

fullFence

,

acquireFence

,

releaseFence

,

loadLoadFence

and

storeStoreFence

, can also be used to impose
constraints. Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
are phrased in terms of the lack of "reorderings" -- observable ordering
effects that might otherwise occur if the fence was not present. More
precise phrasing of the specification of access mode methods and memory fence
methods may accompany future updates of the Java Language Specification.

Compiling invocation of access mode methods

A Java method call expression naming an access mode method can invoke a
VarHandle from Java source code. From the viewpoint of source code, these
methods can take any arguments and their polymorphic result (if expressed)
can be cast to any return type. Formally this is accomplished by giving the
access mode methods variable arity

Object

Object

connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to access mode methods

compiler must record the actual argument types, and may not perform method
invocation conversions on the arguments. Instead, it must generate
instructions to push them on the stack according to their own unconverted

arguments. The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction
that invokes the access mode method with a symbolic type descriptor which
describes the argument and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also
determine the return type (if polymorphic). This is based on a cast on the
method invocation expression, if there is one, or else

Object

if the
invocation is an expression, or else

void

if the invocation is a
statement. The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given a symbolic type
descriptor of

java.lang.Void

. The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

The first time an

invokevirtual

by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction and verifying that
the method call is statically legal. This also holds for calls to access mode
methods. In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler
is checked for correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved. Thus, an

invokevirtual

always link, as long as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically
well-formed and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

VarHandle's access mode type is first checked by the JVM to ensure that it
matches the symbolic type descriptor. If the type
match fails, it means that the access mode method which the caller is
invoking is not present on the individual VarHandle being invoked.

Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of

MethodHandle.invoke(java.lang.Object...)

, where the receiving method handle accepts the
VarHandle instance as the leading argument. More specifically, the
following, where

{access-mode}

corresponds to the access mode method
name:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
```

behaves as if:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
am,
vh.accessModeType(am));

R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

(modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of

Throwable

).
This is equivalent to:

```java
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
VarHandle.class,
"{access-mode}",
MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a

MethodHandle.invokeExact(java.lang.Object...)

is performed, since before invocation of the
target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
widen primitive values, as if by

asType

(see also

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

).

More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.

Invocation checking

In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
succeed. But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses VarHandles.

Because access mode types contain "live"

Class

objects, method type
matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a VarHandle

VH

is created in one class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

, VarHandle access mode method
calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
resolved in

L2

, is matched against the original callee method's
symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in

L1

. The resolution in

L1

happens when

VH

is created and its access mode types are
assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
access it's variables is unrestricted.
If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed

when the VarHandle is
created

.
Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
classes, should generally be kept secret. They should not be passed to
untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.

VarHandle creation

Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is
accessible to that code. This is done via a reflective, capability-based
API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
from

Lookup.findVarHandle

.
There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.

Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
class. If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
the type of the accessing class.

Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
For example, a reflective

Field

can
be converted to a VarHandle using

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.
The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying fields.

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the

types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

A VarHandle has:

- a

variable type

T, the type of every variable referenced
by this VarHandle; and

a list of

coordinate types

CT1, CT2, ..., CTn

, the types of

coordinate expressions

that
jointly locate a variable referenced by this VarHandle.

Variable and coordinate types may be primitive or reference, and are
represented by

Class

objects. The list of coordinate types may be
empty.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the supported variable type and the list
of coordinate types.

Each access mode is associated with one

The arity and types of arguments to the invocation of an access mode

specifies an

MethodType

, that serves as a kind of
method signature against which the arguments are checked dynamically. An
access mode type gives formal parameter types in terms of the coordinate
types of a VarHandle instance and the types for values of importance to the
access mode. An access mode type also gives a return type, often in terms of
the variable type of a VarHandle instance. When an access mode method is
invoked on a VarHandle instance, the symbolic type descriptor at the
call site, the run time types of arguments to the invocation, and the run
time type of the return value, must

match

the types
given in the access mode type. A runtime exception will be thrown if the
match fails.

For example, the access mode method

compareAndSet(java.lang.Object...)

specifies that if
its receiver is a VarHandle instance with coordinate types

CT1, ..., CTn

and variable type

T

, then its access mode type
is

(CT1 c1, ..., CTn cn, T expectedValue, T newValue)boolean

.
Suppose that a VarHandle instance can access array elements, and that its
coordinate types are

String[]

and

int

while its variable type
is

String

. The access mode type for

compareAndSet

on this
VarHandle instance would be

(String[] c1, int c2, String expectedValue, String newValue)boolean

.
Such a VarHandle instance may be produced by the

array factory method

and
access array elements as follows:

```java
String[] sa = ...
VarHandle avh = MethodHandles.arrayElementVarHandle(String[].class);
boolean r = avh.compareAndSet(sa, 10, "expected", "new");
```

Access modes control atomicity and consistency properties.

Plain

read (

get

) and write (

set

)
accesses are guaranteed to be bitwise atomic only for references
and for primitive values of at most 32 bits, and impose no observable
ordering constraints with respect to threads other than the

Opaque

operations are bitwise atomic and
coherently ordered with respect to accesses to the same variable.
In addition to obeying Opaque properties,

Acquire

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the set of access modes that are
supported, which may also include documenting restrictions based on the
variable type and whether a variable is read-only. If an access mode is not
supported then the corresponding access mode method will on invocation throw
an

UnsupportedOperationException

. Factory methods should document
any additional undeclared exceptions that may be thrown by access mode
methods.
The

get

access mode is supported for all
VarHandle instances and the corresponding method never throws

UnsupportedOperationException

.
If a VarHandle references a read-only variable (for example a

final

field) then write, atomic update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic
update access modes are not supported and corresponding methods throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.
Read/write access modes (if supported), with the exception of

get

and

set

, provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitive types.
Unless stated otherwise in the documentation of a factory method, the access
modes

get

and

set

(if supported) provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitives types, with the exception of

long

and

double

on 32-bit platforms.

Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
the declaration site of a variable. For example, a VarHandle accessing
a field using the

get

access mode will access the field as
specified

by its access mode

even if that field is declared

volatile

. When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also
provided for fine-grained control of memory ordering.

The Java Language Specification permits other threads to observe operations
as if they were executed in orders different than are apparent in program
source code, subject to constraints arising, for example, from the use of
locks,

volatile

fields or VarHandles. The static methods,

fullFence

,

acquireFence

,

releaseFence

,

loadLoadFence

and

storeStoreFence

, can also be used to impose
constraints. Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
are phrased in terms of the lack of "reorderings" -- observable ordering
effects that might otherwise occur if the fence was not present. More
precise phrasing of the specification of access mode methods and memory fence
methods may accompany future updates of the Java Language Specification.

Compiling invocation of access mode methods

A Java method call expression naming an access mode method can invoke a
VarHandle from Java source code. From the viewpoint of source code, these
methods can take any arguments and their polymorphic result (if expressed)
can be cast to any return type. Formally this is accomplished by giving the
access mode methods variable arity

Object

arguments and

Object

return types (if the return type is polymorphic), but they
have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which
connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to access mode methods
compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction. More unusually, the
compiler must record the actual argument types, and may not perform method
invocation conversions on the arguments. Instead, it must generate
instructions to push them on the stack according to their own unconverted
types. The VarHandle object itself will be pushed on the stack before the
arguments. The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction
that invokes the access mode method with a symbolic type descriptor which
describes the argument and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also
determine the return type (if polymorphic). This is based on a cast on the
method invocation expression, if there is one, or else

Object

if the
invocation is an expression, or else

void

if the invocation is a
statement. The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given a symbolic type
descriptor of

java.lang.Void

. The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Performing invocation of access mode methods

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed it is linked
by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction and verifying that
the method call is statically legal. This also holds for calls to access mode
methods. In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler
is checked for correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved. Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes an access mode method will
always link, as long as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically
well-formed and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking, the receiving
VarHandle's access mode type is first checked by the JVM to ensure that it
matches the symbolic type descriptor. If the type
match fails, it means that the access mode method which the caller is
invoking is not present on the individual VarHandle being invoked.

Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of

MethodHandle.invoke(java.lang.Object...)

, where the receiving method handle accepts the
VarHandle instance as the leading argument. More specifically, the
following, where

{access-mode}

corresponds to the access mode method
name:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
```

behaves as if:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
am,
vh.accessModeType(am));

R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

(modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of

Throwable

).
This is equivalent to:

```java
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
VarHandle.class,
"{access-mode}",
MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a

MethodHandle.invokeExact(java.lang.Object...)

is performed, since before invocation of the
target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
widen primitive values, as if by

asType

(see also

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

).

More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.

Invocation checking

In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
succeed. But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses VarHandles.

Because access mode types contain "live"

Class

objects, method type
matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a VarHandle

VH

is created in one class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

, VarHandle access mode method
calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
resolved in

L2

, is matched against the original callee method's
symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in

L1

. The resolution in

L1

happens when

VH

is created and its access mode types are
assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
access it's variables is unrestricted.
If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed

when the VarHandle is
created

.
Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
classes, should generally be kept secret. They should not be passed to
untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.

VarHandle creation

Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is
accessible to that code. This is done via a reflective, capability-based
API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
from

Lookup.findVarHandle

.
There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.

Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
class. If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
the type of the accessing class.

Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
For example, a reflective

Field

can
be converted to a VarHandle using

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.
The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying fields.

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
source-level type. When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

a

variable type

T, the type of every variable referenced
by this VarHandle; and

a list of

coordinate types

CT1, CT2, ..., CTn

, the types of

coordinate expressions

that
jointly locate a variable referenced by this VarHandle.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the supported variable type and the list
of coordinate types.

Each access mode is associated with one

access mode method

, a

signature polymorphic

method named
for the access mode. When an access mode method is invoked on a VarHandle
instance, the initial arguments to the invocation are coordinate expressions
that indicate in precisely which object the variable is to be accessed.
Trailing arguments to the invocation represent values of importance to the
access mode. For example, the various compare-and-set or compare-and-exchange
access modes require two trailing arguments for the variable's expected value
and new value.

The arity and types of arguments to the invocation of an access mode
method are not checked statically. Instead, each access mode method
specifies an

access mode type

,
represented as an instance of

MethodType

, that serves as a kind of
method signature against which the arguments are checked dynamically. An
access mode type gives formal parameter types in terms of the coordinate
types of a VarHandle instance and the types for values of importance to the
access mode. An access mode type also gives a return type, often in terms of
the variable type of a VarHandle instance. When an access mode method is
invoked on a VarHandle instance, the symbolic type descriptor at the
call site, the run time types of arguments to the invocation, and the run
time type of the return value, must

match

the types
given in the access mode type. A runtime exception will be thrown if the
match fails.

For example, the access mode method

compareAndSet(java.lang.Object...)

specifies that if
its receiver is a VarHandle instance with coordinate types

CT1, ..., CTn

and variable type

T

, then its access mode type
is

(CT1 c1, ..., CTn cn, T expectedValue, T newValue)boolean

.
Suppose that a VarHandle instance can access array elements, and that its
coordinate types are

String[]

and

int

while its variable type
is

String

. The access mode type for

compareAndSet

on this
VarHandle instance would be

(String[] c1, int c2, String expectedValue, String newValue)boolean

.
Such a VarHandle instance may be produced by the

array factory method

and
access array elements as follows:

```java
String[] sa = ...
VarHandle avh = MethodHandles.arrayElementVarHandle(String[].class);
boolean r = avh.compareAndSet(sa, 10, "expected", "new");
```

Access modes control atomicity and consistency properties.

Plain

read (

get

) and write (

set

)
accesses are guaranteed to be bitwise atomic only for references
and for primitive values of at most 32 bits, and impose no observable
ordering constraints with respect to threads other than the
executing thread.

Opaque

operations are bitwise atomic and
coherently ordered with respect to accesses to the same variable.
In addition to obeying Opaque properties,

Acquire

mode
reads and their subsequent accesses are ordered after matching

Release

mode writes and their previous accesses. In
addition to obeying Acquire and Release properties, all

Volatile

operations are totally ordered with respect to
each other.

Access modes are grouped into the following categories:

- read access modes that get the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group

Factory methods that produce or

VarHandle instances document the set of access modes that are
supported, which may also include documenting restrictions based on the
variable type and whether a variable is read-only. If an access mode is not
supported then the corresponding access mode method will on invocation throw
an

UnsupportedOperationException

. Factory methods should document
any additional undeclared exceptions that may be thrown by access mode
methods.
The

get

access mode is supported for all
VarHandle instances and the corresponding method never throws

UnsupportedOperationException

.
If a VarHandle references a read-only variable (for example a

final

field) then write, atomic update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic
update access modes are not supported and corresponding methods throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.
Read/write access modes (if supported), with the exception of

get

and

set

, provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitive types.
Unless stated otherwise in the documentation of a factory method, the access
modes

get

and

set

(if supported) provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitives types, with the exception of

long

and

double

on 32-bit platforms.

Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
the declaration site of a variable. For example, a VarHandle accessing
a field using the

get

access mode will access the field as
specified

by its access mode

even if that field is declared

volatile

. When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also
provided for fine-grained control of memory ordering.

The Java Language Specification permits other threads to observe operations

fullFence

loadLoadFence

and

storeStoreFence

, can also be used to impose
constraints. Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
are phrased in terms of the lack of "reorderings" -- observable ordering

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)

types of a VarHandle instance and the types for values of importance to the
access mode. An access mode type also gives a return type, often in terms of
the variable type of a VarHandle instance. When an access mode method is
invoked on a VarHandle instance, the symbolic type descriptor at the
call site, the run time types of arguments to the invocation, and the run
time type of the return value, must

match

the types
given in the access mode type. A runtime exception will be thrown if the
match fails.

For example, the access mode method

compareAndSet(java.lang.Object...)

specifies that if
its receiver is a VarHandle instance with coordinate types

CT1, ..., CTn

and variable type

T

, then its access mode type
is

(CT1 c1, ..., CTn cn, T expectedValue, T newValue)boolean

.
Suppose that a VarHandle instance can access array elements, and that its
coordinate types are

String[]

and

int

while its variable type
is

String

. The access mode type for

compareAndSet

on this
VarHandle instance would be

(String[] c1, int c2, String expectedValue, String newValue)boolean

.
Such a VarHandle instance may be produced by the

array factory method

and
access array elements as follows:

```java
String[] sa = ...
VarHandle avh = MethodHandles.arrayElementVarHandle(String[].class);
boolean r = avh.compareAndSet(sa, 10, "expected", "new");
```

Access modes control atomicity and consistency properties.

Plain

read (

get

) and write (

set

)
accesses are guaranteed to be bitwise atomic only for references
and for primitive values of at most 32 bits, and impose no observable
ordering constraints with respect to threads other than the
executing thread.

Opaque

operations are bitwise atomic and
coherently ordered with respect to accesses to the same variable.
In addition to obeying Opaque properties,

Acquire

mode
reads and their subsequent accesses are ordered after matching

Release

mode writes and their previous accesses. In
addition to obeying Acquire and Release properties, all

Volatile

operations are totally ordered with respect to
each other.

Access modes are grouped into the following categories:

- read access modes that get the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

get

,

getVolatile

,

,

.

write access modes that set the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

,

getAndBitwiseAndRelease

,

getAndBitwiseXor

,

getAndBitwiseXorAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseXorRelease

.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the set of access modes that are
supported, which may also include documenting restrictions based on the
variable type and whether a variable is read-only. If an access mode is not
supported then the corresponding access mode method will on invocation throw
an

UnsupportedOperationException

. Factory methods should document
any additional undeclared exceptions that may be thrown by access mode
methods.
The

get

access mode is supported for all
VarHandle instances and the corresponding method never throws

UnsupportedOperationException

.
If a VarHandle references a read-only variable (for example a

final

field) then write, atomic update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic
update access modes are not supported and corresponding methods throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.
Read/write access modes (if supported), with the exception of

get

and

set

, provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitive types.
Unless stated otherwise in the documentation of a factory method, the access
modes

get

and

set

(if supported) provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitives types, with the exception of

long

and

double

on 32-bit platforms.

Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
the declaration site of a variable. For example, a VarHandle accessing
a field using the

get

access mode will access the field as
specified

by its access mode

even if that field is declared

volatile

. When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also
provided for fine-grained control of memory ordering.

The Java Language Specification permits other threads to observe operations
as if they were executed in orders different than are apparent in program
source code, subject to constraints arising, for example, from the use of
locks,

volatile

fields or VarHandles. The static methods,

fullFence

,

acquireFence

,

releaseFence

,

loadLoadFence

and

storeStoreFence

, can also be used to impose
constraints. Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
are phrased in terms of the lack of "reorderings" -- observable ordering
effects that might otherwise occur if the fence was not present. More
precise phrasing of the specification of access mode methods and memory fence
methods may accompany future updates of the Java Language Specification.

Compiling invocation of access mode methods

A Java method call expression naming an access mode method can invoke a
VarHandle from Java source code. From the viewpoint of source code, these
methods can take any arguments and their polymorphic result (if expressed)
can be cast to any return type. Formally this is accomplished by giving the
access mode methods variable arity

Object

arguments and

Object

return types (if the return type is polymorphic), but they
have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which
connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to access mode methods
compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction. More unusually, the
compiler must record the actual argument types, and may not perform method
invocation conversions on the arguments. Instead, it must generate
instructions to push them on the stack according to their own unconverted
types. The VarHandle object itself will be pushed on the stack before the
arguments. The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction
that invokes the access mode method with a symbolic type descriptor which
describes the argument and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also
determine the return type (if polymorphic). This is based on a cast on the
method invocation expression, if there is one, or else

Object

if the
invocation is an expression, or else

void

if the invocation is a
statement. The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given a symbolic type
descriptor of

java.lang.Void

. The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Performing invocation of access mode methods

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed it is linked
by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction and verifying that
the method call is statically legal. This also holds for calls to access mode
methods. In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler
is checked for correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved. Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes an access mode method will
always link, as long as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically
well-formed and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking, the receiving
VarHandle's access mode type is first checked by the JVM to ensure that it
matches the symbolic type descriptor. If the type
match fails, it means that the access mode method which the caller is
invoking is not present on the individual VarHandle being invoked.

Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of

MethodHandle.invoke(java.lang.Object...)

, where the receiving method handle accepts the
VarHandle instance as the leading argument. More specifically, the
following, where

{access-mode}

corresponds to the access mode method
name:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
```

behaves as if:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
am,
vh.accessModeType(am));

R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

(modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of

Throwable

).
This is equivalent to:

```java
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
VarHandle.class,
"{access-mode}",
MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a

MethodHandle.invokeExact(java.lang.Object...)

is performed, since before invocation of the
target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
widen primitive values, as if by

asType

(see also

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

).

More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.

Invocation checking

In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
succeed. But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses VarHandles.

Because access mode types contain "live"

Class

objects, method type
matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a VarHandle

VH

is created in one class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

, VarHandle access mode method
calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
resolved in

L2

, is matched against the original callee method's
symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in

L1

. The resolution in

L1

happens when

VH

is created and its access mode types are
assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
access it's variables is unrestricted.
If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed

when the VarHandle is
created

.
Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
classes, should generally be kept secret. They should not be passed to
untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.

VarHandle creation

Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is
accessible to that code. This is done via a reflective, capability-based
API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
from

Lookup.findVarHandle

.
There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.

Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
class. If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
the type of the accessing class.

Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
For example, a reflective

Field

can
be converted to a VarHandle using

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.
The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying fields.

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
source-level type. When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

The arity and types of arguments to the invocation of an access mode
method are not checked statically. Instead, each access mode method
specifies an

access mode type

,
represented as an instance of

MethodType

, that serves as a kind of
method signature against which the arguments are checked dynamically. An
access mode type gives formal parameter types in terms of the coordinate
types of a VarHandle instance and the types for values of importance to the
access mode. An access mode type also gives a return type, often in terms of
the variable type of a VarHandle instance. When an access mode method is
invoked on a VarHandle instance, the symbolic type descriptor at the
call site, the run time types of arguments to the invocation, and the run
time type of the return value, must

match

the types
given in the access mode type. A runtime exception will be thrown if the
match fails.

For example, the access mode method

compareAndSet(java.lang.Object...)

specifies that if
its receiver is a VarHandle instance with coordinate types

CT1, ..., CTn

and variable type

T

, then its access mode type
is

(CT1 c1, ..., CTn cn, T expectedValue, T newValue)boolean

.
Suppose that a VarHandle instance can access array elements, and that its
coordinate types are

String[]

and

int

while its variable type
is

String

. The access mode type for

compareAndSet

on this
VarHandle instance would be

(String[] c1, int c2, String expectedValue, String newValue)boolean

.
Such a VarHandle instance may be produced by the

array factory method

and
access array elements as follows:

```java
String[] sa = ...
VarHandle avh = MethodHandles.arrayElementVarHandle(String[].class);
boolean r = avh.compareAndSet(sa, 10, "expected", "new");
```

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
source-level type. When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

String[] sa = ...
VarHandle avh = MethodHandles.arrayElementVarHandle(String[].class);
boolean r = avh.compareAndSet(sa, 10, "expected", "new");

Access modes control atomicity and consistency properties.

Plain

read (

get

) and write (

set

)
accesses are guaranteed to be bitwise atomic only for references
and for primitive values of at most 32 bits, and impose no observable
ordering constraints with respect to threads other than the
executing thread.

Opaque

operations are bitwise atomic and
coherently ordered with respect to accesses to the same variable.
In addition to obeying Opaque properties,

Acquire

mode
reads and their subsequent accesses are ordered after matching

Release

mode writes and their previous accesses. In
addition to obeying Acquire and Release properties, all

Volatile

operations are totally ordered with respect to
each other.

Access modes are grouped into the following categories:

- read access modes that get the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

get

,

getVolatile

,

getAcquire

,

getOpaque

.

write access modes that set the value of a variable under specified
memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

set

,

setVolatile

,

setRelease

,

setOpaque

.

atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically compare and set
the value of a variable under specified memory ordering effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

compareAndSet

.

numeric atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically get and
set with addition the value of a variable under specified memory ordering
effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

getAndAdd

,

getAndAddAcquire

,

getAndAddRelease

,

bitwise atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically get and
bitwise OR the value of a variable under specified memory ordering
effects.
The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
consists of the methods

getAndBitwiseOr

,

getAndBitwiseOrAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseOrRelease

,

getAndBitwiseAnd

,

getAndBitwiseAndAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseAndRelease

,

getAndBitwiseXor

,

getAndBitwiseXorAcquire

,

getAndBitwiseXorRelease

.

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the set of access modes that are
supported, which may also include documenting restrictions based on the
variable type and whether a variable is read-only. If an access mode is not
supported then the corresponding access mode method will on invocation throw
an

UnsupportedOperationException

. Factory methods should document
any additional undeclared exceptions that may be thrown by access mode
methods.
The

get

access mode is supported for all
VarHandle instances and the corresponding method never throws

UnsupportedOperationException

.
If a VarHandle references a read-only variable (for example a

final

field) then write, atomic update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic
update access modes are not supported and corresponding methods throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.
Read/write access modes (if supported), with the exception of

get

and

set

, provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitive types.
Unless stated otherwise in the documentation of a factory method, the access
modes

get

and

set

(if supported) provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitives types, with the exception of

long

and

double

on 32-bit platforms.

Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
the declaration site of a variable. For example, a VarHandle accessing
a field using the

get

access mode will access the field as
specified

by its access mode

even if that field is declared

volatile

. When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also
provided for fine-grained control of memory ordering.

The Java Language Specification permits other threads to observe operations
as if they were executed in orders different than are apparent in program
source code, subject to constraints arising, for example, from the use of
locks,

volatile

fields or VarHandles. The static methods,

fullFence

,

acquireFence

,

releaseFence

,

loadLoadFence

and

storeStoreFence

, can also be used to impose
constraints. Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
are phrased in terms of the lack of "reorderings" -- observable ordering
effects that might otherwise occur if the fence was not present. More
precise phrasing of the specification of access mode methods and memory fence
methods may accompany future updates of the Java Language Specification.

Compiling invocation of access mode methods

A Java method call expression naming an access mode method can invoke a
VarHandle from Java source code. From the viewpoint of source code, these
methods can take any arguments and their polymorphic result (if expressed)
can be cast to any return type. Formally this is accomplished by giving the
access mode methods variable arity

Object

arguments and

Object

return types (if the return type is polymorphic), but they
have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which
connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to access mode methods
compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction. More unusually, the
compiler must record the actual argument types, and may not perform method
invocation conversions on the arguments. Instead, it must generate
instructions to push them on the stack according to their own unconverted
types. The VarHandle object itself will be pushed on the stack before the
arguments. The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction
that invokes the access mode method with a symbolic type descriptor which
describes the argument and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also
determine the return type (if polymorphic). This is based on a cast on the
method invocation expression, if there is one, or else

Object

if the
invocation is an expression, or else

void

if the invocation is a
statement. The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given a symbolic type
descriptor of

java.lang.Void

. The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Performing invocation of access mode methods

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed it is linked
by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction and verifying that
the method call is statically legal. This also holds for calls to access mode
methods. In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler
is checked for correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved. Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes an access mode method will
always link, as long as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically
well-formed and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking, the receiving
VarHandle's access mode type is first checked by the JVM to ensure that it
matches the symbolic type descriptor. If the type
match fails, it means that the access mode method which the caller is
invoking is not present on the individual VarHandle being invoked.

Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of

MethodHandle.invoke(java.lang.Object...)

, where the receiving method handle accepts the
VarHandle instance as the leading argument. More specifically, the
following, where

{access-mode}

corresponds to the access mode method
name:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
```

behaves as if:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
am,
vh.accessModeType(am));

R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

(modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of

Throwable

).
This is equivalent to:

```java
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
VarHandle.class,
"{access-mode}",
MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a

MethodHandle.invokeExact(java.lang.Object...)

is performed, since before invocation of the
target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
widen primitive values, as if by

asType

(see also

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

).

More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.

Invocation checking

In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
succeed. But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses VarHandles.

Because access mode types contain "live"

Class

objects, method type
matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a VarHandle

VH

is created in one class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

, VarHandle access mode method
calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
resolved in

L2

, is matched against the original callee method's
symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in

L1

. The resolution in

L1

happens when

VH

is created and its access mode types are
assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
access it's variables is unrestricted.
If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed

when the VarHandle is
created

.
Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
classes, should generally be kept secret. They should not be passed to
untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.

VarHandle creation

Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is
accessible to that code. This is done via a reflective, capability-based
API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
from

Lookup.findVarHandle

.
There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.

Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
class. If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
the type of the accessing class.

Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
For example, a reflective

Field

can
be converted to a VarHandle using

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.
The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying fields.

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

Factory methods that produce or

lookup

VarHandle instances document the set of access modes that are
supported, which may also include documenting restrictions based on the
variable type and whether a variable is read-only. If an access mode is not
supported then the corresponding access mode method will on invocation throw
an

UnsupportedOperationException

. Factory methods should document
any additional undeclared exceptions that may be thrown by access mode
methods.
The

get

access mode is supported for all
VarHandle instances and the corresponding method never throws

UnsupportedOperationException

.
If a VarHandle references a read-only variable (for example a

final

field) then write, atomic update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic
update access modes are not supported and corresponding methods throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.
Read/write access modes (if supported), with the exception of

get

and

set

, provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitive types.
Unless stated otherwise in the documentation of a factory method, the access
modes

get

and

set

(if supported) provide atomic access for
reference types and all primitives types, with the exception of

long

and

double

on 32-bit platforms.

Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
the declaration site of a variable. For example, a VarHandle accessing
a field using the

get

access mode will access the field as
specified

by its access mode

even if that field is declared

volatile

. When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also
provided for fine-grained control of memory ordering.

The Java Language Specification permits other threads to observe operations
as if they were executed in orders different than are apparent in program
source code, subject to constraints arising, for example, from the use of
locks,

volatile

fields or VarHandles. The static methods,

fullFence

,

acquireFence

,

releaseFence

,

loadLoadFence

and

storeStoreFence

, can also be used to impose
constraints. Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
are phrased in terms of the lack of "reorderings" -- observable ordering
effects that might otherwise occur if the fence was not present. More
precise phrasing of the specification of access mode methods and memory fence
methods may accompany future updates of the Java Language Specification.

Compiling invocation of access mode methods

A Java method call expression naming an access mode method can invoke a
VarHandle from Java source code. From the viewpoint of source code, these
methods can take any arguments and their polymorphic result (if expressed)
can be cast to any return type. Formally this is accomplished by giving the
access mode methods variable arity

Object

arguments and

Object

return types (if the return type is polymorphic), but they
have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which
connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to access mode methods
compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction. More unusually, the
compiler must record the actual argument types, and may not perform method
invocation conversions on the arguments. Instead, it must generate
instructions to push them on the stack according to their own unconverted
types. The VarHandle object itself will be pushed on the stack before the
arguments. The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction
that invokes the access mode method with a symbolic type descriptor which
describes the argument and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also
determine the return type (if polymorphic). This is based on a cast on the
method invocation expression, if there is one, or else

Object

if the
invocation is an expression, or else

void

if the invocation is a
statement. The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given a symbolic type
descriptor of

java.lang.Void

. The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Performing invocation of access mode methods

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed it is linked
by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction and verifying that
the method call is statically legal. This also holds for calls to access mode
methods. In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler
is checked for correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved. Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes an access mode method will
always link, as long as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically
well-formed and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking, the receiving
VarHandle's access mode type is first checked by the JVM to ensure that it
matches the symbolic type descriptor. If the type
match fails, it means that the access mode method which the caller is
invoking is not present on the individual VarHandle being invoked.

Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of

MethodHandle.invoke(java.lang.Object...)

, where the receiving method handle accepts the
VarHandle instance as the leading argument. More specifically, the
following, where

{access-mode}

corresponds to the access mode method
name:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
```

behaves as if:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
am,
vh.accessModeType(am));

R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

(modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of

Throwable

).
This is equivalent to:

```java
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
VarHandle.class,
"{access-mode}",
MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a

MethodHandle.invokeExact(java.lang.Object...)

is performed, since before invocation of the
target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
widen primitive values, as if by

asType

(see also

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

).

More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.

Invocation checking

In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
succeed. But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses VarHandles.

Because access mode types contain "live"

Class

objects, method type
matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a VarHandle

VH

is created in one class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

, VarHandle access mode method
calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
resolved in

L2

, is matched against the original callee method's
symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in

L1

. The resolution in

L1

happens when

VH

is created and its access mode types are
assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
access it's variables is unrestricted.
If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed

when the VarHandle is
created

.
Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
classes, should generally be kept secret. They should not be passed to
untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.

VarHandle creation

Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is
accessible to that code. This is done via a reflective, capability-based
API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
from

Lookup.findVarHandle

.
There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.

Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
class. If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
the type of the accessing class.

Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
For example, a reflective

Field

can
be converted to a VarHandle using

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.
The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying fields.

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
source-level type. When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
the declaration site of a variable. For example, a VarHandle accessing
a field using the

get

access mode will access the field as
specified

by its access mode

even if that field is declared

volatile

. When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also

fullFence

,

loadLoadFence

and

storeStoreFence

, can also be used to impose
constraints. Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
are phrased in terms of the lack of "reorderings" -- observable ordering
effects that might otherwise occur if the fence was not present. More

methods may accompany future updates of the Java Language Specification.

However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
source-level type. When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

---

#### Compiling invocation of access mode methods

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to access mode methods
compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction. More unusually, the
compiler must record the actual argument types, and may not perform method
invocation conversions on the arguments. Instead, it must generate
instructions to push them on the stack according to their own unconverted
types. The VarHandle object itself will be pushed on the stack before the
arguments. The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction
that invokes the access mode method with a symbolic type descriptor which
describes the argument and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also
determine the return type (if polymorphic). This is based on a cast on the
method invocation expression, if there is one, or else

Object

if the
invocation is an expression, or else

void

if the invocation is a
statement. The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given a symbolic type
descriptor of

java.lang.Void

. The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Performing invocation of access mode methods

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed it is linked
by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction and verifying that
the method call is statically legal. This also holds for calls to access mode
methods. In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler
is checked for correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved. Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes an access mode method will
always link, as long as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically
well-formed and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking, the receiving
VarHandle's access mode type is first checked by the JVM to ensure that it
matches the symbolic type descriptor. If the type
match fails, it means that the access mode method which the caller is
invoking is not present on the individual VarHandle being invoked.

Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of

MethodHandle.invoke(java.lang.Object...)

, where the receiving method handle accepts the
VarHandle instance as the leading argument. More specifically, the
following, where

{access-mode}

corresponds to the access mode method
name:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
```

behaves as if:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
am,
vh.accessModeType(am));

R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

(modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of

Throwable

).
This is equivalent to:

```java
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
VarHandle.class,
"{access-mode}",
MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a

MethodHandle.invokeExact(java.lang.Object...)

is performed, since before invocation of the
target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
widen primitive values, as if by

asType

(see also

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

).

More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.

Invocation checking

In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
succeed. But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses VarHandles.

Because access mode types contain "live"

Class

objects, method type
matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a VarHandle

VH

is created in one class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

, VarHandle access mode method
calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
resolved in

L2

, is matched against the original callee method's
symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in

L1

. The resolution in

L1

happens when

VH

is created and its access mode types are
assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
access it's variables is unrestricted.
If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed

when the VarHandle is
created

.
Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
classes, should generally be kept secret. They should not be passed to
untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.

VarHandle creation

Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is
accessible to that code. This is done via a reflective, capability-based
API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
from

Lookup.findVarHandle

.
There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.

Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
class. If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
the type of the accessing class.

Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
For example, a reflective

Field

can
be converted to a VarHandle using

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.
The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying fields.

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

Lookup.findVirtual

any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

accessible to that code. This is done via a reflective, capability-based
API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
from

Lookup.findVarHandle

.
There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.

Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
class. If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
the type of the accessing class.

Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
For example, a reflective

Field

can
be converted to a VarHandle using

Lookup.unreflectVarHandle

.
The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying fields.

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
source-level type. When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of

MethodHandle.invoke(java.lang.Object...)

, where the receiving method handle accepts the
VarHandle instance as the leading argument. More specifically, the
following, where

{access-mode}

corresponds to the access mode method
name:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
```

behaves as if:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
am,
vh.accessModeType(am));

R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

(modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of

Throwable

).
This is equivalent to:

```java
MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
VarHandle.class,
"{access-mode}",
MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a

MethodHandle.invokeExact(java.lang.Object...)

is performed, since before invocation of the
target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
widen primitive values, as if by

asType

(see also

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

).

More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:

```java
VarHandle vh = ..
VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName("{access-mode}");
MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
```

Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.

Invocation checking

In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
succeed. But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses VarHandles.

Because access mode types contain "live"

Class

objects, method type
matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a VarHandle

VH

is created in one class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

, VarHandle access mode method
calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
resolved in

L2

, is matched against the original callee method's
symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in

L1

. The resolution in

L1

happens when

VH

is created and its access mode types are
assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
access it's variables is unrestricted.
If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed

when the VarHandle is
created

.
Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
classes, should generally be kept secret. They should not be passed to
untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.

Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

.

Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics

A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a field, which is
declared with Java generic types. As with the Core Reflection API, the
VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
source-level type. When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
types
of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
instances. If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

---

#### Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API

As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
ordinary non-polymorphic methods. Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

,
via JNI, or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
invocations. Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
use

MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

or

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

. The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to

MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)
