# Interface ImageProducer

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\ImageProducer.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ImageProducer
```

The interface for objects which can produce the image data for Images.
Each image contains an ImageProducer which is used to reconstruct
the image whenever it is needed, for example, when a new size of the
Image is scaled, or when the width or height of the Image is being
requested.

**All Known Implementing Classes:** FilteredImageSource

,

MemoryImageSource

,

### Constructor Details

### Method Details

#### void addConsumer​(
ImageConsumer
ic)

Registers an

ImageConsumer

with the

ImageProducer

for access to the image data
during a later reconstruction of the

Image

.
The

ImageProducer

may, at its discretion,
start delivering the image data to the consumer
using the

ImageConsumer

interface immediately,
or when the next available image reconstruction is triggered
by a call to the

startProduction

method.

**Parameters:**
- ic

- the specified

ImageConsumer

**See Also:**
- startProduction(java.awt.image.ImageConsumer)

---

#### boolean isConsumer​(
ImageConsumer
ic)

Determines if a specified

ImageConsumer

object is currently registered with this

ImageProducer

as one of its consumers.

**Parameters:**
- ic

- the specified

ImageConsumer

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified

ImageConsumer

is registered with
this

ImageProducer

;

false

otherwise.

---

#### void removeConsumer​(
ImageConsumer
ic)

Removes the specified

ImageConsumer

object
from the list of consumers currently registered to
receive image data. It is not considered an error
to remove a consumer that is not currently registered.
The

ImageProducer

should stop sending data
to this consumer as soon as is feasible.

**Parameters:**
- ic

- the specified

ImageConsumer

---

#### void startProduction​(
ImageConsumer
ic)

Registers the specified

ImageConsumer

object
as a consumer and starts an immediate reconstruction of
the image data which will then be delivered to this
consumer and any other consumer which might have already
been registered with the producer. This method differs
from the addConsumer method in that a reproduction of
the image data should be triggered as soon as possible.

**Parameters:**
- ic

- the specified

ImageConsumer

**See Also:**
- addConsumer(java.awt.image.ImageConsumer)

---

#### void requestTopDownLeftRightResend​(
ImageConsumer
ic)

Requests, on behalf of the

ImageConsumer

,
that the

ImageProducer

attempt to resend
the image data one more time in TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT order
so that higher quality conversion algorithms which
depend on receiving pixels in order can be used to
produce a better output version of the image. The

ImageProducer

is free to
ignore this call if it cannot resend the data in that
order. If the data can be resent, the

ImageProducer

should respond by executing
the following minimum set of

ImageConsumer

method calls:

```java
ic.setHints(TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT | < otherhints >);
ic.setPixels(...); // As many times as needed
ic.imageComplete();
```

**Parameters:**
- ic

- the specified

ImageConsumer

**See Also:**
- ImageConsumer.setHints(int)
