# Class SelectableChannel

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\channels\SelectableChannel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
SelectableChannel

extends
AbstractInterruptibleChannel

implements
Channel
```

A channel that can be multiplexed via a

Selector

.

In order to be used with a selector, an instance of this class must
first be

registered

via the

register

method. This method returns a new

SelectionKey

object
that represents the channel's registration with the selector.

Once registered with a selector, a channel remains registered until it
is

deregistered

. This involves deallocating whatever resources were
allocated to the channel by the selector.

A channel cannot be deregistered directly; instead, the key representing
its registration must be

cancelled

. Cancelling a key requests that
the channel be deregistered during the selector's next selection operation.
A key may be cancelled explicitly by invoking its

cancel

method. All of a channel's keys are cancelled
implicitly when the channel is closed, whether by invoking its

close

method or by interrupting a thread blocked in an I/O
operation upon the channel.

If the selector itself is closed then the channel will be deregistered,
and the key representing its registration will be invalidated, without
further delay.

A channel may be registered at most once with any particular selector.

Whether or not a channel is registered with one or more selectors may be
determined by invoking the

isRegistered

method.

Selectable channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

Blocking mode

A selectable channel is either in

blocking

mode or in

non-blocking

mode. In blocking mode, every I/O operation invoked
upon the channel will block until it completes. In non-blocking mode an I/O
operation will never block and may transfer fewer bytes than were requested
or possibly no bytes at all. The blocking mode of a selectable channel may
be determined by invoking its

isBlocking

method.

Newly-created selectable channels are always in blocking mode.
Non-blocking mode is most useful in conjunction with selector-based
multiplexing. A channel must be placed into non-blocking mode before being
registered with a selector, and may not be returned to blocking mode until
it has been deregistered.

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected SelectableChannel()

Initializes a new instance of this class.

---

### Method Details

#### public abstract
SelectorProvider
provider()

Returns the provider that created this channel.

**Returns:**
- The provider that created this channel

---

#### public abstract int validOps()

Returns an

operation set

identifying this channel's supported operations. The bits that are set
in this integer value denote exactly the operations that are valid for
this channel. This method always returns the same value for a given
concrete channel class.

**Returns:**
- The valid-operation set

---

#### public abstract boolean isRegistered()

Tells whether or not this channel is currently registered with any
selectors. A newly-created channel is not registered.

Due to the inherent delay between key cancellation and channel
deregistration, a channel may remain registered for some time after all
of its keys have been cancelled. A channel may also remain registered
for some time after it is closed.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this channel is registered

---

#### public abstract
SelectionKey
keyFor​(
Selector
sel)

Retrieves the key representing the channel's registration with the given
selector.

**Parameters:**
- sel

- The selector

**Returns:**
- The key returned when this channel was last registered with the
given selector, or

null

if this channel is not
currently registered with that selector

---

#### public abstract
SelectionKey
register​(
Selector
sel,
int ops,

Object
att)
throws
ClosedChannelException

Registers this channel with the given selector, returning a selection
key.

If this channel is currently registered with the given selector then
the selection key representing that registration is returned. The key's
interest set will have been changed to

ops

, as if by invoking
the

interestOps(int)

method. If
the

att

argument is not

null

then the key's attachment
will have been set to that value. A

CancelledKeyException

will
be thrown if the key has already been cancelled.

Otherwise this channel has not yet been registered with the given
selector, so it is registered and the resulting new key is returned.
The key's initial interest set will be

ops

and its attachment
will be

att

.

This method may be invoked at any time. If this method is invoked
while a selection operation is in progress then it has no effect upon
that operation; the new registration or change to the key's interest set
will be seen by the next selection operation. If this method is invoked
while an invocation of

configureBlocking

is in progress then it will block until the channel's blocking mode has
been adjusted.

If this channel is closed while this operation is in progress then
the key returned by this method will have been cancelled and will
therefore be invalid.

**Parameters:**
- sel

- The selector with which this channel is to be registered
- ops

- The interest set for the resulting key
- att

- The attachment for the resulting key; may be

null

**Returns:**
- A key representing the registration of this channel with
the given selector

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- ClosedSelectorException

- If the selector is closed
- IllegalBlockingModeException

- If this channel is in blocking mode
- IllegalSelectorException

- If this channel was not created by the same provider
as the given selector
- CancelledKeyException

- If this channel is currently registered with the given selector
but the corresponding key has already been cancelled
- IllegalArgumentException

- If a bit in the

ops

set does not correspond to an
operation that is supported by this channel, that is, if

set & ~validOps() != 0

---

#### public final
SelectionKey
register​(
Selector
sel,
int ops)
throws
ClosedChannelException

Registers this channel with the given selector, returning a selection
key.

An invocation of this convenience method of the form

sc.register(sel, ops)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

sc.

register(sel, ops, null)

**Parameters:**
- sel

- The selector with which this channel is to be registered
- ops

- The interest set for the resulting key

**Returns:**
- A key representing the registration of this channel with
the given selector

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- ClosedSelectorException

- If the selector is closed
- IllegalBlockingModeException

- If this channel is in blocking mode
- IllegalSelectorException

- If this channel was not created by the same provider
as the given selector
- CancelledKeyException

- If this channel is currently registered with the given selector
but the corresponding key has already been cancelled
- IllegalArgumentException

- If a bit in

ops

does not correspond to an operation
that is supported by this channel, that is, if

set &
~validOps() != 0

---

#### public abstract
SelectableChannel
configureBlocking​(boolean block)
throws
IOException

Adjusts this channel's blocking mode.

If this channel is registered with one or more selectors then an
attempt to place it into blocking mode will cause an

IllegalBlockingModeException

to be thrown.

This method may be invoked at any time. The new blocking mode will
only affect I/O operations that are initiated after this method returns.
For some implementations this may require blocking until all pending I/O
operations are complete.

If this method is invoked while another invocation of this method or
of the

register

method is in progress
then it will first block until the other operation is complete.

**Parameters:**
- block

- If

true

then this channel will be placed in
blocking mode; if

false

then it will be placed
non-blocking mode

**Returns:**
- This selectable channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IllegalBlockingModeException

- If

block

is

true

and this channel is
registered with one or more selectors
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract boolean isBlocking()

Tells whether or not every I/O operation on this channel will block
until it completes. A newly-created channel is always in blocking mode.

If this channel is closed then the value returned by this method is
not specified.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this channel is in blocking mode

---

#### public abstract
Object
blockingLock()

Retrieves the object upon which the

configureBlocking

and

register

methods synchronize.
This is often useful in the implementation of adaptors that require a
specific blocking mode to be maintained for a short period of time.

**Returns:**
- The blocking-mode lock object

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- provider

```java

provider()
```

Returns the provider that created this channel.

**Returns:** The provider that created this channel

- validOps

```java

identifying this channel's supported operations. The bits that are set
in this integer value denote exactly the operations that are valid for
this channel. This method always returns the same value for a given
concrete channel class.

**Returns:** The valid-operation set

- isRegistered

```java
public abstract boolean isRegistered()
```

Tells whether or not this channel is currently registered with any
selectors. A newly-created channel is not registered.

Due to the inherent delay between key cancellation and channel
deregistration, a channel may remain registered for some time after all
of its keys have been cancelled. A channel may also remain registered
for some time after it is closed.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this channel is registered

- keyFor

```java
public abstract
SelectionKey
keyFor​(
Selector
sel)
```

Retrieves the key representing the channel's registration with the given
selector.

**Parameters:** sel

- The selector
**Returns:** The key returned when this channel was last registered with the
given selector, or

null

if this channel is not
currently registered with that selector

- register

```java
public abstract
SelectionKey
register​(
Selector
sel,
int ops,

Object
att)
throws
ClosedChannelException
```

Registers this channel with the given selector, returning a selection
key.

If this channel is currently registered with the given selector then
the selection key representing that registration is returned. The key's
interest set will have been changed to

ops

, as if by invoking
the

interestOps(int)

method. If
the

att

argument is not

null

then the key's attachment
will have been set to that value. A

CancelledKeyException

will
be thrown if the key has already been cancelled.

Otherwise this channel has not yet been registered with the given
selector, so it is registered and the resulting new key is returned.
The key's initial interest set will be

ops

and its attachment
will be

att

.

This method may be invoked at any time. If this method is invoked
while a selection operation is in progress then it has no effect upon
that operation; the new registration or change to the key's interest set
will be seen by the next selection operation. If this method is invoked
while an invocation of

configureBlocking

is in progress then it will block until the channel's blocking mode has
been adjusted.

If this channel is closed while this operation is in progress then
the key returned by this method will have been cancelled and will
therefore be invalid.

**Parameters:** sel

- The selector with which this channel is to be registered
**Parameters:** ops

- The interest set for the resulting key
**Parameters:** att

- The attachment for the resulting key; may be

null
**Returns:** A key representing the registration of this channel with

An invocation of this convenience method of the form

sc.register(sel, ops)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

sc.

register(sel, ops, null)

**Parameters:** sel

- The selector with which this channel is to be registered
**Parameters:** ops

- The interest set for the resulting key
**Returns:** A key representing the registration of this channel with
the given selector
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If the selector is closed
**Throws:** IllegalBlockingModeException

- If this channel is in blocking mode
**Throws:** IllegalSelectorException

- If this channel was not created by the same provider
as the given selector
**Throws:** CancelledKeyException

- If this channel is currently registered with the given selector
but the corresponding key has already been cancelled
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If a bit in

ops

does not correspond to an operation
that is supported by this channel, that is, if

set &
~validOps() != 0

- configureBlocking

```java
public abstract
SelectableChannel
configureBlocking​(boolean block)
throws
IOException
```

Adjusts this channel's blocking mode.

If this channel is registered with one or more selectors then an
attempt to place it into blocking mode will cause an

IllegalBlockingModeException

to be thrown.

This method may be invoked at any time. The new blocking mode will
only affect I/O operations that are initiated after this method returns.
For some implementations this may require blocking until all pending I/O
operations are complete.

If this method is invoked while another invocation of this method or
of the

register

method is in progress
then it will first block until the other operation is complete.

**Parameters:** block

- If

true

then this channel will be placed in
blocking mode; if

false

then it will be placed
non-blocking mode
**Returns:** This selectable channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IllegalBlockingModeException

- If

block

is

true

and this channel is
registered with one or more selectors
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- isBlocking

```java
public abstract boolean isBlocking()
```

Tells whether or not every I/O operation on this channel will block
until it completes. A newly-created channel is always in blocking mode.

If this channel is closed then the value returned by this method is
not specified.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this channel is in blocking mode

- blockingLock

```java
public abstract
Object
blockingLock()
```

Retrieves the object upon which the

configureBlocking

and

register

methods synchronize.
This is often useful in the implementation of adaptors that require a
specific blocking mode to be maintained for a short period of time.

**Returns:** The blocking-mode lock object

Method Detail

- provider

```java
public abstract
SelectorProvider
provider()
```

Returns the provider that created this channel.

**Returns:** The provider that created this channel

- validOps

```java
public abstract int validOps()
```

Returns an

operation set

identifying this channel's supported operations. The bits that are set
in this integer value denote exactly the operations that are valid for
this channel. This method always returns the same value for a given
concrete channel class.

**Returns:** The valid-operation set

- isRegistered

```java
public abstract boolean isRegistered()
```

Tells whether or not this channel is currently registered with any
selectors. A newly-created channel is not registered.

Due to the inherent delay between key cancellation and channel
deregistration, a channel may remain registered for some time after all
of its keys have been cancelled. A channel may also remain registered
for some time after it is closed.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this channel is registered

- keyFor

```java
public abstract
SelectionKey
keyFor​(
Selector
sel)
```

Retrieves the key representing the channel's registration with the given
selector.

**Parameters:** sel

- The selector
**Returns:** The key returned when this channel was last registered with the
given selector, or

null

if this channel is not
currently registered with that selector

- register

```java
public abstract
SelectionKey
register​(
Selector
sel,
int ops,

Object
att)
throws
ClosedChannelException
```

Registers this channel with the given selector, returning a selection
key.

If this channel is currently registered with the given selector then
the selection key representing that registration is returned. The key's
interest set will have been changed to

ops

, as if by invoking
the

interestOps(int)

method. If
the

att

argument is not

null

then the key's attachment
will have been set to that value. A

CancelledKeyException

will
be thrown if the key has already been cancelled.

Otherwise this channel has not yet been registered with the given
selector, so it is registered and the resulting new key is returned.
The key's initial interest set will be

ops

and its attachment
will be

att

.

This method may be invoked at any time. If this method is invoked
while a selection operation is in progress then it has no effect upon
that operation; the new registration or change to the key's interest set
will be seen by the next selection operation. If this method is invoked
while an invocation of

configureBlocking

is in progress then it will block until the channel's blocking mode has
been adjusted.

If this channel is closed while this operation is in progress then
the key returned by this method will have been cancelled and will
therefore be invalid.

**Parameters:** sel

- The selector with which this channel is to be registered
**Parameters:** ops

- The interest set for the resulting key
**Parameters:** att

- The attachment for the resulting key; may be

null
**Returns:** A key representing the registration of this channel with
the given selector
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If the selector is closed
**Throws:** IllegalBlockingModeException

- If this channel is in blocking mode
**Throws:** IllegalSelectorException

- If this channel was not created by the same provider
as the given selector
**Throws:** CancelledKeyException

- If this channel is currently registered with the given selector
but the corresponding key has already been cancelled
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If a bit in the

ops

set does not correspond to an
operation that is supported by this channel, that is, if

set & ~validOps() != 0

- register

```java
public final
SelectionKey
register​(
Selector
sel,
int ops)
throws
ClosedChannelException
```
