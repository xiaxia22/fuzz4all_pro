# Class CertPathValidator

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\cert\CertPathValidator.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
CertPathValidator

extends
Object
```

A class for validating certification paths (also known as certificate
chains).

This class uses a provider-based architecture.
To create a

CertPathValidator

,
call one of the static

getInstance

methods, passing in the
algorithm name of the

CertPathValidator

desired and
optionally the name of the provider desired.

Once a

CertPathValidator

object has been created, it can
be used to validate certification paths by calling the

validate

method and passing it the

CertPath

to be validated
and an algorithm-specific set of parameters. If successful, the result is
returned in an object that implements the

CertPathValidatorResult

interface.

The

getRevocationChecker()

method allows an application to specify
additional algorithm-specific parameters and options used by the

CertPathValidator

when checking the revocation status of
certificates. Here is an example demonstrating how it is used with the PKIX
algorithm:

```java
CertPathValidator cpv = CertPathValidator.getInstance("PKIX");
PKIXRevocationChecker rc = (PKIXRevocationChecker)cpv.getRevocationChecker();
rc.setOptions(EnumSet.of(Option.SOFT_FAIL));
params.addCertPathChecker(rc);
CertPathValidatorResult cpvr = cpv.validate(path, params);
```

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard

CertPathValidator

algorithm:

- PKIX

This algorithm is described in the

CertPathValidator section

of the
Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.
Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
other algorithms are supported.

Concurrent Access

The static methods of this class are guaranteed to be thread-safe.
Multiple threads may concurrently invoke the static methods defined in
this class with no ill effects.

However, this is not true for the non-static methods defined by this class.
Unless otherwise documented by a specific provider, threads that need to
access a single

CertPathValidator

instance concurrently should
synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple
threads each manipulating a different

CertPathValidator

instance need not synchronize.

Creates a

CertPathValidator

object of the given algorithm,

### Method Details

#### public static
CertPathValidator
getInstance​(
String

throws
NoSuchAlgorithmException

Returns a

CertPathValidator

object that implements the
specified algorithm.

This method traverses the list of registered security Providers,
starting with the most preferred Provider.
A new CertPathValidator object encapsulating the
CertPathValidatorSpi implementation from the first
Provider that supports the specified algorithm is returned.

Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via
the

Security.getProviders()

method.

CertPathValidator

algorithm. See the CertPathValidator section in the

Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification

for information about standard algorithm names.

algorithm

is

null

**See Also:**

**Implementation Note:**
- The JDK Reference Implementation additionally uses the

jdk.security.provider.preferred

Security

property to determine
the preferred provider order for the specified algorithm. This
may be different than the order of providers returned by

Security.getProviders()

.

is returned. The specified provider must be registered
in the security provider list.

Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via
the

Security.getProviders()

method.

**Parameters:**

CertPathValidator

algorithm. See the CertPathValidator section in the

Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification

for information about standard algorithm names.

params)
throws
CertPathValidatorException
,

InvalidAlgorithmParameterException

Validates the specified certification path using the specified
algorithm parameter set.

The

CertPath

specified must be of a type that is
supported by the validation algorithm, otherwise an

InvalidAlgorithmParameterException

will be thrown. For
example, a

CertPathValidator

that implements the PKIX
algorithm validates

CertPath

objects of type X.509.

**Parameters:**
- certPath

- the

CertPath

to be validated
- params

- the algorithm parameters

**Returns:**
- the result of the validation algorithm

**Throws:**
- CertPathValidatorException

- if the

CertPath

does not validate
- InvalidAlgorithmParameterException

- if the specified
parameters or the type of the specified

CertPath

inappropriate for this

CertPathValidator

---

#### public static final
String
getDefaultType()

Returns the default

CertPathValidator

type as specified by
the

certpathvalidator.type

security property, or the string
"PKIX" if no such property exists.

The default

CertPathValidator

type can be used by
applications that do not want to use a hard-coded type when calling one
of the

getInstance

methods, and want to provide a default
type in case a user does not specify its own.

The default

CertPathValidator

type can be changed by
setting the value of the

certpathvalidator.type

security
property to the desired type.

**Returns:**
- the default

CertPathValidator

type as specified
by the

certpathvalidator.type

security property, or the string
"PKIX" if no such property exists.

- security properties

---

#### public final
CertPathChecker
getRevocationChecker()

Returns a

CertPathChecker

that the encapsulated

CertPathValidatorSpi

implementation uses to check the revocation
status of certificates. A PKIX implementation returns objects of
type

PKIXRevocationChecker

. Each invocation of this method
returns a new instance of

CertPathChecker

.

The primary purpose of this method is to allow callers to specify
additional input parameters and options specific to revocation checking.
See the class description for an example.

**Returns:**
- a

CertPathChecker

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the service provider does not
support this method

algorithm parameter set.

The

CertPath

specified must be of a type that is
supported by the validation algorithm, otherwise an

InvalidAlgorithmParameterException

will be thrown. For
example, a

CertPathValidator

that implements the PKIX
algorithm validates

CertPath

objects of type X.509.

**Parameters:** certPath

- the

CertPath

to be validated
**Parameters:** params

- the algorithm parameters
**Returns:** the result of the validation algorithm
**Throws:** CertPathValidatorException

- if the

CertPath

does not validate
**Throws:** InvalidAlgorithmParameterException

- if the specified
parameters or the type of the specified

CertPath

are
inappropriate for this

CertPathValidator

- getDefaultType

```java
public static final
String
getDefaultType()
```

Returns the default

CertPathValidator

type as specified by
the

certpathvalidator.type

security property, or the string
"PKIX" if no such property exists.

The default

CertPathValidator

type can be used by
applications that do not want to use a hard-coded type when calling one
of the

getInstance

methods, and want to provide a default
type in case a user does not specify its own.

The default

CertPathValidator

type can be changed by
setting the value of the

certpathvalidator.type

security
property to the desired type.

**Returns:** the default

CertPathValidator

type as specified
by the

certpathvalidator.type

security property, or the string
"PKIX" if no such property exists.

- getRevocationChecker

```java
public final

getRevocationChecker()
```

Returns a

implementation uses to check the revocation
status of certificates. A PKIX implementation returns objects of

CertPathChecker

.

The primary purpose of this method is to allow callers to specify
additional input parameters and options specific to revocation checking.
See the class description for an example.

**Returns:** a

CertPathChecker
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the service provider does not
support this method
**Since:** 1.8
