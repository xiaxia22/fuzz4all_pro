# Interface Set<E>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Set.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Set<E>

extends
Collection
<E>
```

A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets
contain no pair of elements

e1

and

e2

such that

e1.equals(e2)

, and at most one null element. As implied by
its name, this interface models the mathematical

set

abstraction.

The

Set

interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
inherited from the

Collection

interface, on the contracts of all
constructors and on the contracts of the

add

,

equals

and

hashCode

methods. Declarations for other inherited methods are
also included here for convenience. (The specifications accompanying these
declarations have been tailored to the

Set

interface, but they do
not contain any additional stipulations.)

The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
(as defined above).

Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
elements. The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
is changed in a manner that affects

equals

comparisons while the
object is an element in the set. A special case of this prohibition is
that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.

Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that
they may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
and some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to
add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically

NullPointerException

or

ClassCastException

. Attempting
to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an
operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
the insertion of an ineligible element into the set may throw an
exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
interface.

Unmodifiable Sets

The

Set.of

and

Set.copyOf

static factory methods
provide a convenient way to create unmodifiable sets. The

Set

instances created by these methods have the following characteristics:

- They are

unmodifiable

. Elements cannot
be added or removed. Calling any mutator method on the Set
will always cause

UnsupportedOperationException

to be thrown.
However, if the contained elements are themselves mutable, this may cause the
Set to behave inconsistently or its contents to appear to change.

They disallow

null

elements. Attempts to create them with

null

elements result in

NullPointerException

.

They are serializable if all elements are serializable.

They reject duplicate elements at creation time. Duplicate elements
passed to a static factory method result in

IllegalArgumentException

.

The iteration order of set elements is unspecified and is subject to change.

They are

value-based

.
Callers should make no assumptions about the identity of the returned instances.
Factories are free to create new instances or reuse existing ones. Therefore,
identity-sensitive operations on these instances (reference equality (

==

),
identity hash code, and synchronization) are unreliable and should be avoided.

They are serialized as specified on the

Serialized Form

page.

This interface is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

**Type Parameters:** E

- the type of elements maintained by this set

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### int size()

Returns the number of elements in this set (its cardinality). If this
set contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

**Specified by:**
- size

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- the number of elements in this set (its cardinality)

---

#### boolean isEmpty()

Returns

true

if this set contains no elements.

**Specified by:**
- isEmpty

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- true

if this set contains no elements

---

#### boolean contains​(
Object
o)

Returns

true

if this set contains the specified element.
More formally, returns

true

if and only if this set
contains an element

e

such that

Objects.equals(o, e)

.

**Specified by:**
- contains

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- o

- element whose presence in this set is to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if this set contains the specified element

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the type of the specified element
is incompatible with this set
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null and this
set does not permit null elements
(

optional

)

---

#### Iterator
<
E
> iterator()

Returns an iterator over the elements in this set. The elements are
returned in no particular order (unless this set is an instance of some
class that provides a guarantee).

**Specified by:**
- iterator

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
- iterator

in interface

Iterable

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- an iterator over the elements in this set

---

#### Object
[] toArray()

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set.
If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
are returned by its iterator, this method must return the
elements in the same order.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it
are maintained by this set. (In other words, this method must
allocate a new array even if this set is backed by an array).
The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- an array containing all the elements in this set

---

#### <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the
runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
If the set fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
specified array and the size of this set.

If this set fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this set), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the set is set to

null

. (This is useful in determining the length of this
set

only

if the caller knows that this set does not contain
any null elements.)

If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements
in the same order.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a set known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the set into a newly allocated
array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- a

- the array into which the elements of this set are to be
stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same
runtime type is allocated for this purpose.

**Returns:**
- an array containing all the elements in this set

**Throws:**
- ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in this
set
- NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection

---

#### boolean add​(
E
e)

Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present
(optional operation). More formally, adds the specified element

e

to this set if the set contains no element

e2

such that

Objects.equals(e, e2)

.
If this set already contains the element, the call leaves the set
unchanged and returns

false

. In combination with the
restriction on constructors, this ensures that sets never contain
duplicate elements.

The stipulation above does not imply that sets must accept all
elements; sets may refuse to add any particular element, including

null

, and throw an exception, as described in the
specification for

Collection.add

.
Individual set implementations should clearly document any
restrictions on the elements that they may contain.

**Specified by:**
- add

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- e

- element to be added to this set

**Returns:**
- true

if this set did not already contain the specified
element

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

add

operation
is not supported by this set
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this set
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null and this
set does not permit null elements
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this set

---

#### boolean remove​(
Object
o)

Removes the specified element from this set if it is present
(optional operation). More formally, removes an element

e

such that

Objects.equals(o, e)

, if
this set contains such an element. Returns

true

if this set
contained the element (or equivalently, if this set changed as a
result of the call). (This set will not contain the element once the
call returns.)

**Specified by:**
- remove

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- o

- object to be removed from this set, if present

**Returns:**
- true

if this set contained the specified element

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the type of the specified element
is incompatible with this set
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null and this
set does not permit null elements
(

optional

)
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

remove

operation
is not supported by this set

---

#### boolean containsAll​(
Collection
<?> c)

Returns

true

if this set contains all of the elements of the
specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this
method returns

true

if it is a

subset

of this set.

**Specified by:**
- containsAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- c

- collection to be checked for containment in this set

**Returns:**
- true

if this set contains all of the elements of the
specified collection

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the types of one or more elements
in the specified collection are incompatible with this
set
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified collection contains one
or more null elements and this set does not permit null
elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null

**See Also:**
- contains(Object)

---

#### boolean addAll​(
Collection
<? extends
E
> c)

Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set if
they're not already present (optional operation). If the specified
collection is also a set, the

addAll

operation effectively
modifies this set so that its value is the

union

of the two
sets. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified
collection is modified while the operation is in progress.

**Specified by:**
- addAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- c

- collection containing elements to be added to this set

**Returns:**
- true

if this set changed as a result of the call

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

addAll

operation
is not supported by this set
- ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of the
specified collection prevents it from being added to this set
- NullPointerException

- if the specified collection contains one
or more null elements and this set does not permit null
elements, or if the specified collection is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of an element of the
specified collection prevents it from being added to this set

**See Also:**
- add(Object)

---

#### boolean retainAll​(
Collection
<?> c)

Retains only the elements in this set that are contained in the
specified collection (optional operation). In other words, removes
from this set all of its elements that are not contained in the
specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this
operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the

intersection

of the two sets.

**Specified by:**
- retainAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- c

- collection containing elements to be retained in this set

**Returns:**
- true

if this set changed as a result of the call

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

retainAll

operation
is not supported by this set
- ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this set
is incompatible with the specified collection
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if this set contains a null element and the
specified collection does not permit null elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null

**See Also:**
- remove(Object)

---

#### boolean removeAll​(
Collection
<?> c)

Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the
specified collection (optional operation). If the specified
collection is also a set, this operation effectively modifies this
set so that its value is the

asymmetric set difference

of
the two sets.

**Specified by:**
- removeAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- c

- collection containing elements to be removed from this set

**Returns:**
- true

if this set changed as a result of the call

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

removeAll

operation
is not supported by this set
- ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this set
is incompatible with the specified collection
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if this set contains a null element and the
specified collection does not permit null elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null

**See Also:**
- remove(Object)

,

contains(Object)

---

#### void clear()

Removes all of the elements from this set (optional operation).
The set will be empty after this call returns.

**Specified by:**
- clear

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

clear

method
is not supported by this set

---

#### boolean equals​(
Object
o)

Compares the specified object with this set for equality. Returns

true

if the specified object is also a set, the two sets
have the same size, and every member of the specified set is
contained in this set (or equivalently, every member of this set is
contained in the specified set). This definition ensures that the
equals method works properly across different implementations of the
set interface.

**Specified by:**
- equals

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- o

- object to be compared for equality with this set

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified object is equal to this set

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this set. The hash code of a set is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of the elements in the set,
where the hash code of a

null

element is defined to be zero.
This ensures that

s1.equals(s2)

implies that

s1.hashCode()==s2.hashCode()

for any two sets

s1

and

s2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

**Specified by:**
- hashCode

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- the hash code value for this set

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(Object)

,

equals(Object)

---

#### default
Spliterator
<
E
> spliterator()

Creates a

Spliterator

over the elements in this set.

The

Spliterator

reports

Spliterator.DISTINCT

.
Implementations should document the reporting of additional
characteristic values.

**Specified by:**
- spliterator

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
- spliterator

in interface

Iterable

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- a

Spliterator

over the elements in this set

**Since:**
- 1.8

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation creates a

late-binding

spliterator
from the set's

Iterator

. The spliterator inherits the

fail-fast

properties of the set's iterator.

The created

Spliterator

additionally reports

Spliterator.SIZED

.

**Implementation Note:**
- The created

Spliterator

additionally reports

Spliterator.SUBSIZED

.

static <E>
Set
<E> of​(E... elements)

Returns an unmodifiable set containing an arbitrary number of elements.
See

Unmodifiable Sets

for details.

**Parameters:**
- elements

- the elements to be contained in the set

**API Note:**
- This method also accepts a single array as an argument. The element type of
the resulting set will be the component type of the array, and the size of
the set will be equal to the length of the array. To create a set with
a single element that is an array, do the following:

```java
String[] array = ... ;
Set<String[]> list = Set.<String[]>of(array);
```

This will cause the

Set.of(E)

method
to be invoked instead.

**Type Parameters:**
- E

- the

Set

's element type

---

#### static <E>
Set
<E> copyOf​(
Collection
<? extends E> coll)

Returns an

unmodifiable Set

containing the elements
of the given Collection. The given Collection must not be null, and it must not
contain any null elements. If the given Collection contains duplicate elements,
an arbitrary element of the duplicates is preserved. If the given Collection is
subsequently modified, the returned Set will not reflect such modifications.

**Parameters:**
- coll

- a

Collection

from which elements are drawn, must be non-null

**Returns:**
- a

Set

containing the elements of the given

Collection

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if coll is null, or if it contains any nulls

**Since:**
- 10

**Implementation Note:**
- If the given Collection is an

unmodifiable Set

,
calling copyOf will generally not create a copy.

**Type Parameters:**
- E

- the

Set

's element type

```java
public interface
Set<E>

extends
Collection
<E>
```

A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets
contain no pair of elements

e1

and

e2

such that

e1.equals(e2)

, and at most one null element. As implied by
its name, this interface models the mathematical

set

abstraction.

The

Set

interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
inherited from the

Collection

interface, on the contracts of all
constructors and on the contracts of the

add

,

equals

and

hashCode

methods. Declarations for other inherited methods are
also included here for convenience. (The specifications accompanying these
declarations have been tailored to the

Set

interface, but they do
not contain any additional stipulations.)

The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
(as defined above).

Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
elements. The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
is changed in a manner that affects

equals

comparisons while the
object is an element in the set. A special case of this prohibition is
that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.

Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that
they may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
and some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to
add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically

NullPointerException

or

ClassCastException

. Attempting
to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an
operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
the insertion of an ineligible element into the set may throw an
exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
interface.

Unmodifiable Sets

The

Set.of

and

Set.copyOf

static factory methods
provide a convenient way to create unmodifiable sets. The

Set

instances created by these methods have the following characteristics:

- They are

unmodifiable

. Elements cannot
be added or removed. Calling any mutator method on the Set
will always cause

UnsupportedOperationException

to be thrown.
However, if the contained elements are themselves mutable, this may cause the
Set to behave inconsistently or its contents to appear to change.

They disallow

null

elements. Attempts to create them with

null

elements result in

NullPointerException

.

They are serializable if all elements are serializable.

They reject duplicate elements at creation time. Duplicate elements
passed to a static factory method result in

IllegalArgumentException

.

The iteration order of set elements is unspecified and is subject to change.

They are

value-based

.
Callers should make no assumptions about the identity of the returned instances.
Factories are free to create new instances or reuse existing ones. Therefore,
identity-sensitive operations on these instances (reference equality (

==

),
identity hash code, and synchronization) are unreliable and should be avoided.

They are serialized as specified on the

Serialized Form

page.

This interface is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

public interface

Set<E>

extends

Collection

<E>

A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets
contain no pair of elements

e1

and

e2

such that

e1.equals(e2)

, and at most one null element. As implied by
its name, this interface models the mathematical

set

abstraction.

The

Set

interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
inherited from the

Collection

interface, on the contracts of all
constructors and on the contracts of the

add

,

equals

and

hashCode

methods. Declarations for other inherited methods are
also included here for convenience. (The specifications accompanying these
declarations have been tailored to the

Set

interface, but they do
not contain any additional stipulations.)

The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
(as defined above).

Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
elements. The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
is changed in a manner that affects

equals

comparisons while the
object is an element in the set. A special case of this prohibition is
that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.

Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that
they may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
and some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to
add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically

NullPointerException

or

ClassCastException

. Attempting
to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an
operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
the insertion of an ineligible element into the set may throw an
exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.

Returns an iterator over the elements in this set. The elements are
returned in no particular order (unless this set is an instance of some
class that provides a guarantee).

**Returns:** an iterator over the elements in this set

- toArray

```java
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set.
If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
are returned by its iterator, this method must return the
elements in the same order.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it
are maintained by this set. (In other words, this method must
allocate a new array even if this set is backed by an array).
The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Returns:** an array containing all the elements in this set

- toArray

```java
<T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the
runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
If the set fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
specified array and the size of this set.

If this set fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this set), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the set is set to

null

. (This is useful in determining the length of this
set

only

if the caller knows that this set does not contain
any null elements.)

If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements
in the same order.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a set known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the set into a newly allocated
array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Type Parameters:** T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection
**Parameters:** a

- the array into which the elements of this set are to be
stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same
runtime type is allocated for this purpose.
**Returns:** an array containing all the elements in this set
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in this
set
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

- add

```java
boolean add​(
E
e)
```

Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present
(optional operation). More formally, adds the specified element

e

to this set if the set contains no element

e2

such that

Objects.equals(e, e2)

.
If this set already contains the element, the call leaves the set
unchanged and returns

false

. In combination with the
restriction on constructors, this ensures that sets never contain
duplicate elements.

The stipulation above does not imply that sets must accept all
elements; sets may refuse to add any particular element, including

null

, and throw an exception, as described in the
specification for

Collection.add

.
Individual set implementations should clearly document any
restrictions on the elements that they may contain.

**Specified by:** add

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** e

- element to be added to this set
**Returns:** true

if this set did not already contain the specified
element
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

add

operation
is not supported by this set
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this set
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null and this
set does not permit null elements
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this set

- remove

```java
boolean remove​(
Object
o)
```

Removes the specified element from this set if it is present
(optional operation). More formally, removes an element

e

such that

Objects.equals(o, e)

, if
this set contains such an element. Returns

true

if this set
contained the element (or equivalently, if this set changed as a
result of the call). (This set will not contain the element once the
call returns.)

**Specified by:** remove

in interface

Collection

<

E

**Parameters:** o

- object to be removed from this set, if present
**Returns:** true

if this set contained the specified element
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the type of the specified element
is incompatible with this set
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null and this
set does not permit null elements
(

optional

)
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

remove

operation
is not supported by this set

- containsAll

```java
boolean containsAll​(
Collection
<?> c)
```

Returns

true

if this set contains all of the elements of the
specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this
method returns

true

if it is a

subset

of this set.

**Specified by:** containsAll

in interface

Collection

<

**Parameters:** c

- collection to be checked for containment in this set
**Returns:** true

if this set contains all of the elements of the
specified collection
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the types of one or more elements
in the specified collection are incompatible with this
set
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified collection contains one
or more null elements and this set does not permit null
elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null
**See Also:** contains(Object)

- addAll

```java
boolean addAll​(
Collection
<? extends
E
> c)
```

Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set if
they're not already present (optional operation). If the specified
collection is also a set, the

addAll

operation effectively
modifies this set so that its value is the

union

of the two
sets. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified
collection is modified while the operation is in progress.

**Specified by:** addAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection containing elements to be added to this set
**Returns:** true

if this set changed as a result of the call
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

addAll

operation
is not supported by this set
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of the
specified collection prevents it from being added to this set
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified collection contains one
or more null elements and this set does not permit null
elements, or if the specified collection is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of an element of the
specified collection prevents it from being added to this set
**See Also:** add(Object)

- retainAll

```java
boolean retainAll​(
Collection
<?> c)
```

Retains only the elements in this set that are contained in the
specified collection (optional operation). In other words, removes
from this set all of its elements that are not contained in the
specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this
operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the

intersection

of the two sets.

**Specified by:** retainAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection containing elements to be retained in this set
**Returns:** true

if this set changed as a result of the call
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

retainAll

operation
is not supported by this set
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this set
is incompatible with the specified collection
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if this set contains a null element and the
specified collection does not permit null elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null
**See Also:** remove(Object)

- removeAll

```java
boolean removeAll​(
Collection
<?> c)
```

Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the
specified collection (optional operation). If the specified
collection is also a set, this operation effectively modifies this
set so that its value is the

asymmetric set difference

of
the two sets.

**Specified by:** removeAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection containing elements to be removed from this set
**Returns:** true

if this set changed as a result of the call
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

removeAll

operation
is not supported by this set
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this set
is incompatible with the specified collection
(

optional

**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if this set contains a null element and the
specified collection does not permit null elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null
**See Also:** remove(Object)

contains(Object)

- clear

```java
void clear()
```

Removes all of the elements from this set (optional operation).
The set will be empty after this call returns.

**Specified by:** clear

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

clear

method
is not supported by this set

- equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Compares the specified object with this set for equality. Returns

true

if the specified object is also a set, the two sets
have the same size, and every member of the specified set is
contained in this set (or equivalently, every member of this set is
contained in the specified set). This definition ensures that the
equals method works properly across different implementations of the
set interface.

**Specified by:** equals

in interface

Collection

<

E

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** o

- object to be compared for equality with this set
**Returns:** true

if the specified object is equal to this set
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this set. The hash code of a set is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of the elements in the set,
where the hash code of a

null

element is defined to be zero.
This ensures that

s1.equals(s2)

implies that

s1.hashCode()==s2.hashCode()

for any two sets

s1

and

s2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

**Specified by:** hashCode

- spliterator

```java
default
Spliterator
<
E
> spliterator()
```

Creates a

Spliterator

over the elements in this set.

The

Spliterator

reports

Spliterator.DISTINCT

.
Implementations should document the reporting of additional
characteristic values.

**Specified by:** spliterator

in interface

Collection

<

>
**Specified by:** spliterator

in interface

Iterable

<

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation creates a

late-binding

spliterator
from the set's

Iterator

. The spliterator inherits the

fail-fast

properties of the set's iterator.

The created

Spliterator

additionally reports

Spliterator.SIZED

.
**Implementation Note:** The created

Spliterator

additionally reports

Spliterator.SUBSIZED

.
**Returns:** a

Spliterator

```java
@SafeVarargs

static <E>
Set
<E> of​(E... elements)
```

Returns an unmodifiable set containing an arbitrary number of elements.
See

Unmodifiable Sets

for details.

**API Note:** This method also accepts a single array as an argument. The element type of
the resulting set will be the component type of the array, and the size of
the set will be equal to the length of the array. To create a set with
a single element that is an array, do the following:

```java
String[] array = ... ;
Set<String[]> list = Set.<String[]>of(array);
```

This will cause the

Set.of(E)

method
to be invoked instead.
**Type Parameters:** E

- the

Set

's element type
**Parameters:** elements

- the elements to be contained in the set
**Returns:** a

Set

containing the specified elements
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if there are any duplicate elements
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if an element is

null

or if the array is

null
**Since:** 9

- copyOf

```java
static <E>
Set
<E> copyOf​(
Collection
<? extends E> coll)
```

Returns an

unmodifiable Set

containing the elements
of the given Collection. The given Collection must not be null, and it must not
contain any null elements. If the given Collection contains duplicate elements,
an arbitrary element of the duplicates is preserved. If the given Collection is
subsequently modified, the returned Set will not reflect such modifications.

**Implementation Note:** If the given Collection is an

unmodifiable Set

,
calling copyOf will generally not create a copy.
**Type Parameters:** E

- the

Set

's element type
**Parameters:** coll

- a

Collection

from which elements are drawn, must be non-null
**Returns:** a

Set

containing the elements of the given

Collection
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if coll is null, or if it contains any nulls
**Since:** 10

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the
runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
If the set fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
specified array and the size of this set.

If this set fits in the specified array with room to spare

e

to this set if the set contains no element

e2

such that

Objects.equals(e, e2)

.
If this set already contains the element, the call leaves the set

this set contains such an element. Returns

true

if this set

Returns

true

if this set contains all of the elements of the
specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this
method returns

true

if it is a

subset

of this set.

**Specified by:** containsAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection to be checked for containment in this set
**Returns:** true

if this set contains all of the elements of the
specified collection
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the types of one or more elements
in the specified collection are incompatible with this
set
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified collection contains one
or more null elements and this set does not permit null
elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null
**See Also:** contains(Object)

- addAll

```java
boolean addAll​(
Collection
<? extends
E
> c)
```

Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set if
they're not already present (optional operation). If the specified
collection is also a set, the

addAll

operation effectively
modifies this set so that its value is the

union

of the two
sets. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified
collection is modified while the operation is in progress.

**Specified by:** addAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection containing elements to be added to this set
**Returns:** true

if this set changed as a result of the call
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

addAll

operation
is not supported by this set
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of the
specified collection prevents it from being added to this set
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified collection contains one
or more null elements and this set does not permit null
elements, or if the specified collection is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of an element of the
specified collection prevents it from being added to this set
**See Also:** add(Object)

- retainAll

```java
boolean retainAll​(
Collection
<?> c)
```

Retains only the elements in this set that are contained in the
specified collection (optional operation). In other words, removes
from this set all of its elements that are not contained in the
specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this
operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the

intersection

of the two sets.

**Specified by:** retainAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection containing elements to be retained in this set
**Returns:** true

if this set changed as a result of the call
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

retainAll

operation
is not supported by this set
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this set
is incompatible with the specified collection
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if this set contains a null element and the
specified collection does not permit null elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null
**See Also:** remove(Object)

- removeAll

```java
boolean removeAll​(
Collection
<?> c)
```

Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the
specified collection (optional operation). If the specified
collection is also a set, this operation effectively modifies this
set so that its value is the

asymmetric set difference

of
the two sets.

**Specified by:** removeAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection containing elements to be removed from this set
**Returns:** true

if this set changed as a result of the call
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

removeAll

operation
is not supported by this set
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this set
is incompatible with the specified collection
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if this set contains a null element and the
specified collection does not permit null elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null
**See Also:** remove(Object)

contains(Object)

- clear

```java
void clear()
```

Removes all of the elements from this set (optional operation).
The set will be empty after this call returns.

**Specified by:** clear

in interface

Collection

<

E

**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

clear

method
is not supported by this set

- equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Compares the specified object with this set for equality. Returns

true

if the specified object is also a set, the two sets
have the same size, and every member of the specified set is
contained in this set (or equivalently, every member of this set is
contained in the specified set). This definition ensures that the
equals method works properly across different implementations of the
set interface.

**Specified by:** equals

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** o

- object to be compared for equality with this set
**Returns:** true

if the specified object is equal to this set
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this set. The hash code of a set is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of the elements in the set,
where the hash code of a

null

element is defined to be zero.
This ensures that

s1.equals(s2)

implies that

s1.hashCode()==s2.hashCode()

for any two sets

s1

and

s2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

**Specified by:** hashCode

in interface

- spliterator

```java
default
Spliterator
<
E
> spliterator()
```

Creates a

Spliterator

over the elements in this set.

The

Spliterator

reports

Spliterator.DISTINCT

.
Implementations should document the reporting of additional
characteristic values.

**Specified by:** spliterator

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Specified by:** spliterator

in interface

Iterable

<

E

>
**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation creates a

late-binding

spliterator
from the set's

Iterator

. The spliterator inherits the

fail-fast

properties of the set's iterator.

The created

Spliterator

additionally reports

Spliterator.SIZED

.
**Implementation Note:** The created

Spliterator

additionally reports

Spliterator.SUBSIZED

.
**Returns:** a

Spliterator

```java
@SafeVarargs

static <E>
Set
<E> of​(E... elements)
```

Returns an unmodifiable set containing an arbitrary number of elements.
See

Unmodifiable Sets

for details.

**API Note:** This method also accepts a single array as an argument. The element type of
the resulting set will be the component type of the array, and the size of
the set will be equal to the length of the array. To create a set with
a single element that is an array, do the following:

```java
String[] array = ... ;
Set<String[]> list = Set.<String[]>of(array);
```

This will cause the

Set.of(E)

method
to be invoked instead.
**Type Parameters:** E

- the

Set

's element type
**Parameters:** elements

- the elements to be contained in the set
**Returns:** a

Set

containing the specified elements
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if there are any duplicate elements
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if an element is

null

or if the array is

null
**Since:** 9

- copyOf

```java
static <E>
Set
<E> copyOf​(
Collection
<? extends E> coll)
```

Returns an

unmodifiable Set

containing the elements
of the given Collection. The given Collection must not be null, and it must not
contain any null elements. If the given Collection contains duplicate elements,
an arbitrary element of the duplicates is preserved. If the given Collection is
subsequently modified, the returned Set will not reflect such modifications.

**Implementation Note:** If the given Collection is an

unmodifiable Set

,
calling copyOf will generally not create a copy.
**Type Parameters:** E

- the

Set

's element type
**Parameters:** coll

- a

Collection

from which elements are drawn, must be non-null
**Returns:** a

Set

containing the elements of the given

Collection
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if coll is null, or if it contains any nulls
**Since:** 10

iterator

```java
Iterator
<
E
> iterator()
```

Returns an iterator over the elements in this set. The elements are
returned in no particular order (unless this set is an instance of some
class that provides a guarantee).

**Specified by:** iterator

> iterator()

Returns an iterator over the elements in this set. The elements are
returned in no particular order (unless this set is an instance of some
class that provides a guarantee).

toArray

```java
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set.
If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
are returned by its iterator, this method must return the
elements in the same order.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it
are maintained by this set. (In other words, this method must
allocate a new array even if this set is backed by an array).
The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

toArray

```java
<T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the
runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
If the set fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
specified array and the size of this set.

If this set fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this set), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the set is set to

null

. (This is useful in determining the length of this
set

only

if the caller knows that this set does not contain
any null elements.)

If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements
in the same order.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a set known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the set into a newly allocated
array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Parameters:** a

- the array into which the elements of this set are to be
stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same
runtime type is allocated for this purpose.
**Returns:** an array containing all the elements in this set
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in this
set
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

to this set if the set contains no element

e2

such that

Objects.equals(e, e2)

.
If this set already contains the element, the call leaves the set
unchanged and returns

false

. In combination with the
restriction on constructors, this ensures that sets never contain
duplicate elements.

elements; sets may refuse to add any particular element, including

null

, and throw an exception, as described in the

restrictions on the elements that they may contain.

remove

```java
boolean remove​(
Object
o)
```

Removes the specified element from this set if it is present
(optional operation). More formally, removes an element

e

such that

Objects.equals(o, e)

, if
this set contains such an element. Returns

true

if this set
contained the element (or equivalently, if this set changed as a
result of the call). (This set will not contain the element once the
call returns.)

**Specified by:** remove

in interface

Collection

<

E

**Parameters:** o

- object to be removed from this set, if present
**Returns:** true

if this set contained the specified element
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the type of the specified element
is incompatible with this set
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null and this
set does not permit null elements

#### remove

boolean remove​(

Object

o)

Removes the specified element from this set if it is present
(optional operation). More formally, removes an element

e

such that

Objects.equals(o, e)

, if
this set contains such an element. Returns

true

if this set
contained the element (or equivalently, if this set changed as a
result of the call). (This set will not contain the element once the
call returns.)

containsAll

```java
boolean containsAll​(
Collection
<?> c)
```

Returns

true

if this set contains all of the elements of the
specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this
method returns

true

if it is a

subset

of this set.

**Specified by:** containsAll

in interface

Collection

<

of this set.

addAll

```java
boolean addAll​(
Collection
<? extends
E
> c)
```

Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set if
they're not already present (optional operation). If the specified
collection is also a set, the

addAll

operation effectively
modifies this set so that its value is the

union

of the two
sets. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified
collection is modified while the operation is in progress.

**Specified by:** addAll

in interface

Collection

<

they're not already present (optional operation). If the specified
collection is also a set, the

addAll

operation effectively
modifies this set so that its value is the

union

of the two
sets. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified
collection is modified while the operation is in progress.

retainAll

```java
boolean retainAll​(
Collection
<?> c)
```

Retains only the elements in this set that are contained in the
specified collection (optional operation). In other words, removes
from this set all of its elements that are not contained in the
specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this
operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the

intersection

of the two sets.

**Specified by:** retainAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection containing elements to be retained in this set
**Returns:** true

if this set changed as a result of the call
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

retainAll

operation
is not supported by this set
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this set
is incompatible with the specified collection
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if this set contains a null element and the
specified collection does not permit null elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null
**See Also:** remove(Object)

removeAll

```java
boolean removeAll​(
Collection
<?> c)
```

Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the
specified collection (optional operation). If the specified
collection is also a set, this operation effectively modifies this
set so that its value is the

asymmetric set difference

of
the two sets.

**Specified by:** removeAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection containing elements to be removed from this set
**Returns:** true

if this set changed as a result of the call
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

removeAll

operation
is not supported by this set
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this set
is incompatible with the specified collection
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if this set contains a null element and the
specified collection does not permit null elements
(

optional

equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Compares the specified object with this set for equality. Returns

true

if the specified object is also a set, the two sets
have the same size, and every member of the specified set is
contained in this set (or equivalently, every member of this set is
contained in the specified set). This definition ensures that the
equals method works properly across different implementations of the
set interface.

**Specified by:** equals

in interface

Collection

<

E

#### equals

boolean equals​(

Object

o)

Compares the specified object with this set for equality. Returns

true

if the specified object is also a set, the two sets
have the same size, and every member of the specified set is
contained in this set (or equivalently, every member of this set is
contained in the specified set). This definition ensures that the

hashCode

```java
int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this set. The hash code of a set is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of the elements in the set,
where the hash code of a

null

element is defined to be zero.
This ensures that

s1.equals(s2)

implies that

s1.hashCode()==s2.hashCode()

for any two sets

s1

and

s2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

**Specified by:** hashCode

```

Returns an unmodifiable set containing an arbitrary number of elements.
See

Unmodifiable Sets

for details.

**API Note:** This method also accepts a single array as an argument. The element type of
the resulting set will be the component type of the array, and the size of
the set will be equal to the length of the array. To create a set with
a single element that is an array, do the following:

```java
String[] array = ... ;
Set<String[]> list = Set.<String[]>of(array);
```

This will cause the

Set.of(E)

method
to be invoked instead.
**Type Parameters:** E
