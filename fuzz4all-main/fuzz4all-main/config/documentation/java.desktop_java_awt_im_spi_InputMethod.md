# Interface InputMethod

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\im\spi\InputMethod.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
InputMethod
```

Defines the interface for an input method that supports complex text input.
Input methods traditionally support text input for languages that have
more characters than can be represented on a standard-size keyboard,
such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. However, they may also be used to
support phonetic text input for English or character reordering for Thai.

Subclasses of InputMethod can be loaded by the input method framework; they
can then be selected either through the API
(

InputContext.selectInputMethod

)
or the user interface (the input method selection menu).

### Method Details

#### void setInputMethodContext​(
InputMethodContext
context)

Sets the input method context, which is used to dispatch input method
events to the client component and to request information from
the client component.

This method is called once immediately after instantiating this input
method.

**Parameters:**
- context

- the input method context for this input method

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

context

is null

---

#### boolean setLocale​(
Locale
locale)

Attempts to set the input locale. If the input method supports the
desired locale, it changes its behavior to support input for the locale
and returns true.
Otherwise, it returns false and does not change its behavior.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.selectInputMethod

,

when switching to this input method through the user interface if the user
specified a locale or if the previously selected input method's

getLocale

method
returns a non-null value.

**Parameters:**
- locale

- locale to input

**Returns:**
- whether the specified locale is supported

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

locale

is null

---

#### Locale
getLocale()

Returns the current input locale. Might return null in exceptional cases.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.getLocale

and

when switching from this input method to a different one through the
user interface.

**Returns:**
- the current input locale, or null

---

#### void setCharacterSubsets​(
Character.Subset
[] subsets)

Sets the subsets of the Unicode character set that this input method
is allowed to input. Null may be passed in to indicate that all
characters are allowed.

This method is called

- immediately after instantiating this input method,

when switching to this input method from a different one, and

by

InputContext.setCharacterSubsets

.

**Parameters:**
- subsets

- the subsets of the Unicode character set from which
characters may be input

---

#### void setCompositionEnabled​(boolean enable)

Enables or disables this input method for composition,
depending on the value of the parameter

enable

.

An input method that is enabled for composition interprets incoming
events for both composition and control purposes, while a
disabled input method does not interpret events for composition.
Note however that events are passed on to the input method regardless
whether it is enabled or not, and that an input method that is disabled
for composition may still interpret events for control purposes,
including to enable or disable itself for composition.

For input methods provided by host operating systems, it is not always possible to
determine whether this operation is supported. For example, an input method may enable
composition only for some locales, and do nothing for other locales. For such input
methods, it is possible that this method does not throw

UnsupportedOperationException

,
but also does not affect whether composition is enabled.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.setCompositionEnabled

,

when switching to this input method from a different one using the
user interface or

InputContext.selectInputMethod

,
if the previously selected input method's

isCompositionEnabled

method returns without throwing an exception.

**Parameters:**
- enable

- whether to enable the input method for composition

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if this input method does not
support the enabling/disabling operation

**See Also:**
- isCompositionEnabled()

---

#### boolean isCompositionEnabled()

Determines whether this input method is enabled.
An input method that is enabled for composition interprets incoming
events for both composition and control purposes, while a
disabled input method does not interpret events for composition.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.isCompositionEnabled

and

when switching from this input method to a different one using the
user interface or

InputContext.selectInputMethod

.

**Returns:**
- true

if this input method is enabled for
composition;

false

otherwise.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if this input method does not
support checking whether it is enabled for composition

**See Also:**
- setCompositionEnabled(boolean)

---

#### void reconvert()

Starts the reconversion operation. The input method obtains the
text to be reconverted from the current client component using the

InputMethodRequests.getSelectedText

method. It can use other

InputMethodRequests

methods to request additional information required for the
reconversion operation. The composed and committed text
produced by the operation is sent to the client component as a
sequence of

InputMethodEvent

s. If the given text
cannot be reconverted, the same text should be sent to the
client component as committed text.

This method is called by

InputContext.reconvert

.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the input method does not
support the reconversion operation.

---

#### void dispatchEvent​(
AWTEvent
event)

Dispatches the event to the input method. If input method support is
enabled for the focused component, incoming events of certain types
are dispatched to the current input method for this component before
they are dispatched to the component's methods or event listeners.
The input method decides whether it needs to handle the event. If it
does, it also calls the event's

consume

method; this
causes the event to not get dispatched to the component's event
processing methods or event listeners.

Events are dispatched if they are instances of InputEvent or its
subclasses.
This includes instances of the AWT classes KeyEvent and MouseEvent.

This method is called by

InputContext.dispatchEvent

.

**Parameters:**
- event

- the event being dispatched to the input method

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

event

is null

---

#### void notifyClientWindowChange​(
Rectangle
bounds)

Notifies this input method of changes in the client window
location or state. This method is called while this input
method is the current input method of its input context and
notifications for it are enabled (see

InputMethodContext.enableClientWindowNotification

). Calls
to this method are temporarily suspended if the input context's

removeNotify

method is called, and resume when the input method is activated
for a new client component. It is called in the following
situations:

- when the window containing the current client component changes
in location, size, visibility, iconification state, or when the
window is closed.
- from

enableClientWindowNotification(inputMethod, true)

if the current client component exists,
- when activating the input method for the first time after it
called

enableClientWindowNotification(inputMethod, true)

if during the call no current client component was
available,
- when activating the input method for a new client component
after the input context's removeNotify method has been
called.

**Parameters:**
- bounds

- client window's

bounds

on the screen; or null if
the client window is iconified or invisible

---

#### void activate()

Activates the input method for immediate input processing.

If an input method provides its own windows, it should make sure
at this point that all necessary windows are open and visible.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.dispatchEvent

when a client component receives a FOCUS_GAINED event,

when switching to this input method from a different one using the
user interface or

InputContext.selectInputMethod

.

The method is only called when the input method is inactive.
A newly instantiated input method is assumed to be inactive.

---

#### void deactivate​(boolean isTemporary)

Deactivates the input method.
The isTemporary argument has the same meaning as in

FocusEvent.isTemporary

.

If an input method provides its own windows, only windows that relate
to the current composition (such as a lookup choice window) should be
closed at this point.
It is possible that the input method will be immediately activated again
for a different client component, and closing and reopening more
persistent windows (such as a control panel) would create unnecessary
screen flicker.
Before an instance of a different input method class is activated,

hideWindows()

is called on the current input method.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.dispatchEvent

when a client component receives a FOCUS_LOST event,

when switching from this input method to a different one using the
user interface or

InputContext.selectInputMethod

,

before

removeNotify

if the current client component is
removed.

The method is only called when the input method is active.

**Parameters:**
- isTemporary

- whether the focus change is temporary

---

#### void hideWindows()

Closes or hides all windows opened by this input method instance or
its class.

This method is called

- before calling

activate

on an instance of a different input
method class,

before calling

dispose

on this input method.

The method is only called when the input method is inactive.

---

#### void removeNotify()

Notifies the input method that a client component has been
removed from its containment hierarchy, or that input method
support has been disabled for the component.

This method is called by

InputContext.removeNotify

.

The method is only called when the input method is inactive.

---

#### void endComposition()

Ends any input composition that may currently be going on in this
context. Depending on the platform and possibly user preferences,
this may commit or delete uncommitted text. Any changes to the text
are communicated to the active component using an input method event.

A text editing component may call this in a variety of situations,
for example, when the user moves the insertion point within the text
(but outside the composed text), or when the component's text is
saved to a file or copied to the clipboard.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.endComposition

,

by

InputContext.dispatchEvent

when switching to a different client component

when switching from this input method to a different one using the
user interface or

InputContext.selectInputMethod

.

---

#### void dispose()

Releases the resources used by this input method.
In particular, the input method should dispose windows and close files that are no
longer needed.

This method is called by

InputContext.dispose

.

The method is only called when the input method is inactive.
No method of this interface is called on this instance after dispose.

---

#### Object
getControlObject()

Returns a control object from this input method, or null. A
control object provides methods that control the behavior of the
input method or obtain information from the input method. The type
of the object is an input method specific class. Clients have to
compare the result against known input method control object
classes and cast to the appropriate class to invoke the methods
provided.

This method is called by

InputContext.getInputMethodControlObject

.

**Returns:**
- a control object from this input method, or null

---

### Additional Sections

#### Interface InputMethod

```java
public interface
InputMethod
```

Defines the interface for an input method that supports complex text input.
Input methods traditionally support text input for languages that have
more characters than can be represented on a standard-size keyboard,
such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. However, they may also be used to
support phonetic text input for English or character reordering for Thai.

Subclasses of InputMethod can be loaded by the input method framework; they
can then be selected either through the API
(

InputContext.selectInputMethod

)
or the user interface (the input method selection menu).

This method is called

- by

InputContext.setCompositionEnabled

,

when switching to this input method from a different one using the
user interface or

InputContext.selectInputMethod

,
if the previously selected input method's

isCompositionEnabled

method returns without throwing an exception.

**Parameters:** enable

- whether to enable the input method for composition
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this input method does not
support the enabling/disabling operation
**See Also:** isCompositionEnabled()

- isCompositionEnabled

```java
boolean isCompositionEnabled()
```

Determines whether this input method is enabled.
An input method that is enabled for composition interprets incoming
events for both composition and control purposes, while a
disabled input method does not interpret events for composition.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.isCompositionEnabled

and

when switching from this input method to a different one using the
user interface or

InputContext.selectInputMethod

.

**Returns:** true

if this input method is enabled for
composition;

false

otherwise.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this input method does not
support checking whether it is enabled for composition
**See Also:** setCompositionEnabled(boolean)

- reconvert

```java
void reconvert()
```

Starts the reconversion operation. The input method obtains the
text to be reconverted from the current client component using the

InputMethodRequests.getSelectedText

method. It can use other

InputMethodRequests

methods to request additional information required for the
reconversion operation. The composed and committed text
produced by the operation is sent to the client component as a
sequence of

InputMethodEvent

s. If the given text
cannot be reconverted, the same text should be sent to the
client component as committed text.

This method is called by

InputContext.reconvert

.

**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the input method does not
support the reconversion operation.

- dispatchEvent

```java
void dispatchEvent​(
AWTEvent
event)
```

Dispatches the event to the input method. If input method support is
enabled for the focused component, incoming events of certain types
are dispatched to the current input method for this component before
they are dispatched to the component's methods or event listeners.
The input method decides whether it needs to handle the event. If it
does, it also calls the event's

consume

method; this
causes the event to not get dispatched to the component's event
processing methods or event listeners.

Events are dispatched if they are instances of InputEvent or its
subclasses.
This includes instances of the AWT classes KeyEvent and MouseEvent.

This method is called by

InputContext.dispatchEvent

.

**Parameters:** event

- the event being dispatched to the input method
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

event

is null

- notifyClientWindowChange

```java
void notifyClientWindowChange​(
Rectangle
bounds)
```

Notifies this input method of changes in the client window
location or state. This method is called while this input
method is the current input method of its input context and
notifications for it are enabled (see

InputMethodContext.enableClientWindowNotification

). Calls
to this method are temporarily suspended if the input context's

removeNotify

method is called, and resume when the input method is activated
for a new client component. It is called in the following
situations:

- when the window containing the current client component changes
in location, size, visibility, iconification state, or when the
window is closed.
- from

enableClientWindowNotification(inputMethod, true)

if the current client component exists,
- when activating the input method for the first time after it
called

enableClientWindowNotification(inputMethod, true)

if during the call no current client component was
available,
- when activating the input method for a new client component
after the input context's removeNotify method has been
called.

**Parameters:** bounds

- client window's

bounds

on the screen; or null if
the client window is iconified or invisible

- activate

```java
void activate()
```

Activates the input method for immediate input processing.

If an input method provides its own windows, it should make sure
at this point that all necessary windows are open and visible.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.dispatchEvent

when a client component receives a FOCUS_GAINED event,

when switching to this input method from a different one using the
user interface or

InputContext.selectInputMethod

.

The method is only called when the input method is inactive.
A newly instantiated input method is assumed to be inactive.

- deactivate

```java
void deactivate​(boolean isTemporary)
```

Deactivates the input method.
The isTemporary argument has the same meaning as in

FocusEvent.isTemporary

.

If an input method provides its own windows, only windows that relate
to the current composition (such as a lookup choice window) should be
closed at this point.
It is possible that the input method will be immediately activated again
for a different client component, and closing and reopening more
persistent windows (such as a control panel) would create unnecessary
screen flicker.
Before an instance of a different input method class is activated,

hideWindows()

is called on the current input method.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.dispatchEvent

when a client component receives a FOCUS_LOST event,

when switching from this input method to a different one using the
user interface or

InputContext.selectInputMethod

,

before

removeNotify

if the current client component is
removed.

The method is only called when the input method is active.

**Parameters:** isTemporary

- whether the focus change is temporary

- hideWindows

```java
void hideWindows()
```

Closes or hides all windows opened by this input method instance or
its class.

This method is called

- before calling

activate

on an instance of a different input
method class,

before calling

dispose

on this input method.

The method is only called when the input method is inactive.

- removeNotify

```java
void removeNotify()
```

Notifies the input method that a client component has been
removed from its containment hierarchy, or that input method
support has been disabled for the component.

This method is called by

InputContext.removeNotify

.

The method is only called when the input method is inactive.

- endComposition

```java
void endComposition()
```

Ends any input composition that may currently be going on in this
context. Depending on the platform and possibly user preferences,
this may commit or delete uncommitted text. Any changes to the text
are communicated to the active component using an input method event.

A text editing component may call this in a variety of situations,
for example, when the user moves the insertion point within the text
(but outside the composed text), or when the component's text is
saved to a file or copied to the clipboard.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.endComposition

,

by

InputContext.dispatchEvent

when switching to a different client component

when switching from this input method to a different one using the
user interface or

InputContext.selectInputMethod

.

- dispose

```java
void dispose()
```

Releases the resources used by this input method.
In particular, the input method should dispose windows and close files that are no
longer needed.

This method is called by

InputContext.dispose

.

The method is only called when the input method is inactive.
No method of this interface is called on this instance after dispose.

- getControlObject

```java
Object
getControlObject()
```

Returns a control object from this input method, or null. A
control object provides methods that control the behavior of the
input method or obtain information from the input method. The type
of the object is an input method specific class. Clients have to
compare the result against known input method control object
classes and cast to the appropriate class to invoke the methods
provided.

This method is called by

InputContext.getInputMethodControlObject

.

**Returns:** a control object from this input method, or null

endComposition

```java
void endComposition()
```

Ends any input composition that may currently be going on in this
context. Depending on the platform and possibly user preferences,
this may commit or delete uncommitted text. Any changes to the text
are communicated to the active component using an input method event.

A text editing component may call this in a variety of situations,
for example, when the user moves the insertion point within the text
(but outside the composed text), or when the component's text is
saved to a file or copied to the clipboard.

This method is called

- by

InputContext.endComposition

,

by

InputContext.dispatchEvent

when switching to a different client component

when switching from this input method to a different one using the
user interface or
