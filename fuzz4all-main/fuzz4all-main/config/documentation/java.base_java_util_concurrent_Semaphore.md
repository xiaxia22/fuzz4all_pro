# Class Semaphore

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\concurrent\Semaphore.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Semaphore

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

A counting semaphore. Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of
permits. Each

acquire()

blocks if necessary until a permit is
available, and then takes it. Each

release()

adds a permit,
potentially releasing a blocking acquirer.
However, no actual permit objects are used; the

Semaphore

just
keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.

Semaphores are often used to restrict the number of threads than can
access some (physical or logical) resource. For example, here is
a class that uses a semaphore to control access to a pool of items:

```java
class Pool {
private static final int MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE, true);

public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
available.acquire();
return getNextAvailableItem();
}

public void putItem(Object x) {
if (markAsUnused(x))
available.release();
}

// Not a particularly efficient data structure; just for demo

protected Object[] items = ... whatever kinds of items being managed
protected boolean[] used = new boolean[MAX_AVAILABLE];

protected synchronized Object getNextAvailableItem() {
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
if (!used[i]) {
used[i] = true;
return items[i];
}
}
return null; // not reached
}

protected synchronized boolean markAsUnused(Object item) {
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
if (item == items[i]) {
if (used[i]) {
used[i] = false;
return true;
} else
return false;
}
}
return false;
}
}
```

Before obtaining an item each thread must acquire a permit from
the semaphore, guaranteeing that an item is available for use. When
the thread has finished with the item it is returned back to the
pool and a permit is returned to the semaphore, allowing another
thread to acquire that item. Note that no synchronization lock is
held when

acquire()

is called as that would prevent an item
from being returned to the pool. The semaphore encapsulates the
synchronization needed to restrict access to the pool, separately
from any synchronization needed to maintain the consistency of the
pool itself.

A semaphore initialized to one, and which is used such that it
only has at most one permit available, can serve as a mutual
exclusion lock. This is more commonly known as a

binary
semaphore

, because it only has two states: one permit
available, or zero permits available. When used in this way, the
binary semaphore has the property (unlike many

Lock

implementations), that the "lock" can be released by a
thread other than the owner (as semaphores have no notion of
ownership). This can be useful in some specialized contexts, such
as deadlock recovery.

The constructor for this class optionally accepts a

fairness

parameter. When set false, this class makes no
guarantees about the order in which threads acquire permits. In
particular,

barging

is permitted, that is, a thread
invoking

acquire()

can be allocated a permit ahead of a
thread that has been waiting - logically the new thread places itself at
the head of the queue of waiting threads. When fairness is set true, the
semaphore guarantees that threads invoking any of the

acquire

methods are selected to obtain permits in the order in
which their invocation of those methods was processed
(first-in-first-out; FIFO). Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
applies to specific internal points of execution within these
methods. So, it is possible for one thread to invoke

acquire

before another, but reach the ordering point after
the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
Also note that the untimed

tryAcquire

methods do not
honor the fairness setting, but will take any permits that are
available.

Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be
initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from
accessing a resource. When using semaphores for other kinds of
synchronization control, the throughput advantages of non-fair
ordering often outweigh fairness considerations.

This class also provides convenience methods to

acquire

and

release

multiple
permits at a time. These methods are generally more efficient and
effective than loops. However, they do not establish any preference
order. For example, if thread A invokes

s.acquire(3

) and
thread B invokes

s.acquire(2)

, and two permits become
available, then there is no guarantee that thread B will obtain
them unless its acquire came first and Semaphore

s

is in
fair mode.

Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
a "release" method such as

release()

happen-before

actions following a successful "acquire" method such as

acquire()

in another thread.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public Semaphore​(int permits)

Creates a

Semaphore

with the given number of
permits and nonfair fairness setting.

**Parameters:**
- permits

- the initial number of permits available.
This value may be negative, in which case releases
must occur before any acquires will be granted.

---

#### public Semaphore​(int permits,
boolean fair)

Creates a

Semaphore

with the given number of
permits and the given fairness setting.

**Parameters:**
- permits

- the initial number of permits available.
This value may be negative, in which case releases
must occur before any acquires will be granted.
- fair

-

true

if this semaphore will guarantee
first-in first-out granting of permits under contention,
else

false

---

### Method Details

#### public void acquire()
throws
InterruptedException

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, blocking until one is
available, or the thread is

interrupted

.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of two things happens:

- Some other thread invokes the

release()

method for this
semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
for a permit,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if the current thread is interrupted

---

#### public void acquireUninterruptibly()

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, blocking until one is
available.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
some other thread invokes the

release()

method for this
semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit.

If the current thread is

interrupted

while waiting for a permit then it will continue to wait, but the
time at which the thread is assigned a permit may change compared to
the time it would have received the permit had no interruption
occurred. When the thread does return from this method its interrupt
status will be set.

---

#### public boolean tryAcquire()

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, only if one is available at the
time of invocation.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
with the value

true

,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then this method will return
immediately with the value

false

.

Even when this semaphore has been set to use a
fair ordering policy, a call to

tryAcquire()

will

immediately acquire a permit if one is available, whether or not
other threads are currently waiting.
This "barging" behavior can be useful in certain
circumstances, even though it breaks fairness. If you want to honor
the fairness setting, then use

tryAcquire(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS)

which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).

**Returns:**
- true

if a permit was acquired and

false

otherwise

---

#### public boolean tryAcquire​(long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, if one becomes available
within the given waiting time and the current thread has not
been

interrupted

.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
with the value

true

,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of three things happens:

- Some other thread invokes the

release()

method for this
semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread; or

The specified waiting time elapses.

If a permit is acquired then the value

true

is returned.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
to acquire a permit,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

If the specified waiting time elapses then the value

false

is returned. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
will not wait at all.

**Parameters:**
- timeout

- the maximum time to wait for a permit
- unit

- the time unit of the

timeout

argument

**Returns:**
- true

if a permit was acquired and

false

if the waiting time elapsed before a permit was acquired

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if the current thread is interrupted

---

#### public void release()

Releases a permit, returning it to the semaphore.

Releases a permit, increasing the number of available permits by
one. If any threads are trying to acquire a permit, then one is
selected and given the permit that was just released. That thread
is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes.

There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
have acquired that permit by calling

acquire()

.
Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention
in the application.

---

#### public void acquire​(int permits)
throws
InterruptedException

Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore,
blocking until all are available,
or the thread is

interrupted

.

Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available,
and returns immediately, reducing the number of available permits
by the given amount. This method has the same effect as the
loop

for (int i = 0; i < permits; ++i) acquire();

except
that it atomically acquires the permits all at once:

If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of two things happens:

- Some other thread invokes one of the

release

methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
for a permit,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.
Any permits that were to be assigned to this thread are instead
assigned to other threads trying to acquire permits, as if
permits had been made available by a call to

release()

.

**Parameters:**
- permits

- the number of permits to acquire

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if the current thread is interrupted
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

permits

is negative

---

#### public void acquireUninterruptibly​(int permits)

Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore,
blocking until all are available.

Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available,
and returns immediately, reducing the number of available permits
by the given amount. This method has the same effect as the
loop

for (int i = 0; i < permits; ++i) acquireUninterruptibly();

except that it atomically acquires the permits all at once:

If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
some other thread invokes one of the

release

methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request.

If the current thread is

interrupted

while waiting for permits then it will continue to wait and its
position in the queue is not affected. When the thread does return
from this method its interrupt status will be set.

**Parameters:**
- permits

- the number of permits to acquire

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

permits

is negative

---

#### public boolean tryAcquire​(int permits)

Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore, only
if all are available at the time of invocation.

Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available, and
returns immediately, with the value

true

,
reducing the number of available permits by the given amount.

If insufficient permits are available then this method will return
immediately with the value

false

and the number of available
permits is unchanged.

Even when this semaphore has been set to use a fair ordering
policy, a call to

tryAcquire

will

immediately acquire a permit if one is available, whether or
not other threads are currently waiting. This
"barging" behavior can be useful in certain
circumstances, even though it breaks fairness. If you want to
honor the fairness setting, then use

tryAcquire(permits, 0, TimeUnit.SECONDS)

which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).

**Parameters:**
- permits

- the number of permits to acquire

**Returns:**
- true

if the permits were acquired and

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

permits

is negative

---

#### public boolean tryAcquire​(int permits,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException

Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore, if all
become available within the given waiting time and the current
thread has not been

interrupted

.

Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available and
returns immediately, with the value

true

,
reducing the number of available permits by the given amount.

If insufficient permits are available then
the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:

- Some other thread invokes one of the

release

methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread; or

The specified waiting time elapses.

If the permits are acquired then the value

true

is returned.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
to acquire the permits,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.
Any permits that were to be assigned to this thread, are instead
assigned to other threads trying to acquire permits, as if
the permits had been made available by a call to

release()

.

If the specified waiting time elapses then the value

false

is returned. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
will not wait at all. Any permits that were to be assigned to this
thread, are instead assigned to other threads trying to acquire
permits, as if the permits had been made available by a call to

release()

.

**Parameters:**
- permits

- the number of permits to acquire
- timeout

- the maximum time to wait for the permits
- unit

- the time unit of the

timeout

argument

**Returns:**
- true

if all permits were acquired and

false

if the waiting time elapsed before all permits were acquired

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if the current thread is interrupted
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

permits

is negative

---

#### public void release​(int permits)

Releases the given number of permits, returning them to the semaphore.

Releases the given number of permits, increasing the number of
available permits by that amount.
If any threads are trying to acquire permits, then one thread
is selected and given the permits that were just released.
If the number of available permits satisfies that thread's request
then that thread is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes;
otherwise the thread will wait until sufficient permits are available.
If there are still permits available
after this thread's request has been satisfied, then those permits
are assigned in turn to other threads trying to acquire permits.

There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
have acquired that permit by calling

acquire

.
Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention
in the application.

**Parameters:**
- permits

- the number of permits to release

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

permits

is negative

---

#### public int availablePermits()

Returns the current number of permits available in this semaphore.

This method is typically used for debugging and testing purposes.

**Returns:**
- the number of permits available in this semaphore

---

#### public int drainPermits()

Acquires and returns all permits that are immediately
available, or if negative permits are available, releases them.
Upon return, zero permits are available.

**Returns:**
- the number of permits acquired or, if negative, the
number released

---

#### protected void reducePermits​(int reduction)

Shrinks the number of available permits by the indicated
reduction. This method can be useful in subclasses that use
semaphores to track resources that become unavailable. This
method differs from

acquire

in that it does not block
waiting for permits to become available.

**Parameters:**
- reduction

- the number of permits to remove

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

reduction

is negative

---

#### public boolean isFair()

Returns

true

if this semaphore has fairness set true.

**Returns:**
- true

if this semaphore has fairness set true

---

#### public final boolean hasQueuedThreads()

Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire. Note that
because cancellations may occur at any time, a

true

return does not guarantee that any other thread will ever
acquire. This method is designed primarily for use in
monitoring of the system state.

**Returns:**
- true

if there may be other threads waiting to
acquire the lock

---

#### public final int getQueueLength()

Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire.
The value is only an estimate because the number of threads may
change dynamically while this method traverses internal data
structures. This method is designed for use in monitoring
system state, not for synchronization control.

**Returns:**
- the estimated number of threads waiting for this lock

---

#### protected
Collection
<
Thread
> getQueuedThreads()

Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire.
Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while
constructing this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort
estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular
order. This method is designed to facilitate construction of
subclasses that provide more extensive monitoring facilities.

**Returns:**
- the collection of threads

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string identifying this semaphore, as well as its state.
The state, in brackets, includes the String

"Permits ="

followed by the number of permits.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a string identifying this semaphore, as well as its state

```java
public class
Semaphore

extends

Serializable
```

A counting semaphore. Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of
permits. Each

acquire()

blocks if necessary until a permit is
available, and then takes it. Each

release()

adds a permit,
potentially releasing a blocking acquirer.
However, no actual permit objects are used; the

Semaphore

just
keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.

Semaphores are often used to restrict the number of threads than can
access some (physical or logical) resource. For example, here is
a class that uses a semaphore to control access to a pool of items:

```java
class Pool {
private static final int MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE, true);

public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
available.acquire();
return getNextAvailableItem();
}

public void putItem(Object x) {
if (markAsUnused(x))
available.release();
}

// Not a particularly efficient data structure; just for demo

protected Object[] items = ... whatever kinds of items being managed
protected boolean[] used = new boolean[MAX_AVAILABLE];

protected synchronized Object getNextAvailableItem() {
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
if (!used[i]) {
used[i] = true;
return items[i];
}
}
return null; // not reached
}

protected synchronized boolean markAsUnused(Object item) {
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
if (item == items[i]) {
if (used[i]) {
used[i] = false;
return true;
} else
return false;
}
}
return false;
}
}
```

Before obtaining an item each thread must acquire a permit from
the semaphore, guaranteeing that an item is available for use. When
the thread has finished with the item it is returned back to the
pool and a permit is returned to the semaphore, allowing another
thread to acquire that item. Note that no synchronization lock is
held when

acquire()

is called as that would prevent an item
from being returned to the pool. The semaphore encapsulates the
synchronization needed to restrict access to the pool, separately
from any synchronization needed to maintain the consistency of the
pool itself.

A semaphore initialized to one, and which is used such that it
only has at most one permit available, can serve as a mutual
exclusion lock. This is more commonly known as a

binary
semaphore

, because it only has two states: one permit
available, or zero permits available. When used in this way, the
binary semaphore has the property (unlike many

Lock

implementations), that the "lock" can be released by a
thread other than the owner (as semaphores have no notion of
ownership). This can be useful in some specialized contexts, such
as deadlock recovery.

The constructor for this class optionally accepts a

fairness

parameter. When set false, this class makes no
guarantees about the order in which threads acquire permits. In
particular,

barging

is permitted, that is, a thread
invoking

acquire()

can be allocated a permit ahead of a
thread that has been waiting - logically the new thread places itself at
the head of the queue of waiting threads. When fairness is set true, the
semaphore guarantees that threads invoking any of the

acquire

methods are selected to obtain permits in the order in
which their invocation of those methods was processed
(first-in-first-out; FIFO). Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
applies to specific internal points of execution within these
methods. So, it is possible for one thread to invoke

acquire

before another, but reach the ordering point after
the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
Also note that the untimed

tryAcquire

methods do not
honor the fairness setting, but will take any permits that are
available.

Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be
initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from
accessing a resource. When using semaphores for other kinds of
synchronization control, the throughput advantages of non-fair
ordering often outweigh fairness considerations.

This class also provides convenience methods to

acquire

and

release

multiple
permits at a time. These methods are generally more efficient and
effective than loops. However, they do not establish any preference
order. For example, if thread A invokes

s.acquire(3

) and
thread B invokes

s.acquire(2)

, and two permits become
available, then there is no guarantee that thread B will obtain
them unless its acquire came first and Semaphore

s

is in
fair mode.

Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
a "release" method such as

release()

happen-before

actions following a successful "acquire" method such as

acquire()

in another thread.

a class that uses a semaphore to control access to a pool of items:

```java

// Not a particularly efficient data structure; just for demo

if (!used[i]) {
used[i] = true;
return items[i];
}
}
return null; // not reached
}

protected synchronized boolean markAsUnused(Object item) {

if (item == items[i]) {
if (used[i]) {
used[i] = false;
return true;
} else
return false;
}
}
return false;
}
}
```

Before obtaining an item each thread must acquire a permit from
the semaphore, guaranteeing that an item is available for use. When
the thread has finished with the item it is returned back to the
pool and a permit is returned to the semaphore, allowing another
thread to acquire that item. Note that no synchronization lock is

binary semaphore has the property (unlike many

Lock

implementations), that the "lock" can be released by a
thread other than the owner (as semaphores have no notion of
ownership). This can be useful in some specialized contexts, such
as deadlock recovery.

The constructor for this class optionally accepts a

fairness

parameter. When set false, this class makes no
guarantees about the order in which threads acquire permits. In
particular,

barging

is permitted, that is, a thread
invoking

acquire()

can be allocated a permit ahead of a
thread that has been waiting - logically the new thread places itself at
the head of the queue of waiting threads. When fairness is set true, the
semaphore guarantees that threads invoking any of the

acquire

methods are selected to obtain permits in the order in
which their invocation of those methods was processed
(first-in-first-out; FIFO). Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
applies to specific internal points of execution within these
methods. So, it is possible for one thread to invoke

acquire

before another, but reach the ordering point after
the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
Also note that the untimed

tryAcquire

methods do not
honor the fairness setting, but will take any permits that are
available.

Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be
initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from
accessing a resource. When using semaphores for other kinds of
synchronization control, the throughput advantages of non-fair
ordering often outweigh fairness considerations.

This class also provides convenience methods to

acquire

and

release

multiple
permits at a time. These methods are generally more efficient and
effective than loops. However, they do not establish any preference
order. For example, if thread A invokes

s.acquire(3

) and
thread B invokes

s.acquire(2)

, and two permits become
available, then there is no guarantee that thread B will obtain
them unless its acquire came first and Semaphore

s

is in
fair mode.

Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
a "release" method such as

release()

happen-before

actions following a successful "acquire" method such as

acquire()

in another thread.

class Pool {
private static final int MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE, true);

public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
available.acquire();
return getNextAvailableItem();
}

public void putItem(Object x) {
if (markAsUnused(x))
available.release();
}

// Not a particularly efficient data structure; just for demo

protected Object[] items = ... whatever kinds of items being managed
protected boolean[] used = new boolean[MAX_AVAILABLE];

protected synchronized Object getNextAvailableItem() {
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
if (!used[i]) {
used[i] = true;
return items[i];
}
}
return null; // not reached
}

protected synchronized boolean markAsUnused(Object item) {
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
if (item == items[i]) {
if (used[i]) {
used[i] = false;
return true;
} else
return false;
}
}
return false;
}
}

Before obtaining an item each thread must acquire a permit from
the semaphore, guaranteeing that an item is available for use. When
the thread has finished with the item it is returned back to the
pool and a permit is returned to the semaphore, allowing another
thread to acquire that item. Note that no synchronization lock is
held when

acquire()

is called as that would prevent an item
from being returned to the pool. The semaphore encapsulates the
synchronization needed to restrict access to the pool, separately
from any synchronization needed to maintain the consistency of the
pool itself.

A semaphore initialized to one, and which is used such that it
only has at most one permit available, can serve as a mutual
exclusion lock. This is more commonly known as a

binary
semaphore

, because it only has two states: one permit
available, or zero permits available. When used in this way, the
binary semaphore has the property (unlike many

Lock

implementations), that the "lock" can be released by a
thread other than the owner (as semaphores have no notion of
ownership). This can be useful in some specialized contexts, such
as deadlock recovery.

The constructor for this class optionally accepts a

fairness

parameter. When set false, this class makes no
guarantees about the order in which threads acquire permits. In
particular,

barging

is permitted, that is, a thread
invoking

acquire()

can be allocated a permit ahead of a
thread that has been waiting - logically the new thread places itself at
the head of the queue of waiting threads. When fairness is set true, the
semaphore guarantees that threads invoking any of the

acquire

methods are selected to obtain permits in the order in
which their invocation of those methods was processed
(first-in-first-out; FIFO). Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
applies to specific internal points of execution within these
methods. So, it is possible for one thread to invoke

acquire

before another, but reach the ordering point after
the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
Also note that the untimed

tryAcquire

methods do not
honor the fairness setting, but will take any permits that are
available.

Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be
initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from
accessing a resource. When using semaphores for other kinds of
synchronization control, the throughput advantages of non-fair
ordering often outweigh fairness considerations.

This class also provides convenience methods to

acquire

and

release

multiple
permits at a time. These methods are generally more efficient and
effective than loops. However, they do not establish any preference
order. For example, if thread A invokes

s.acquire(3

public Semaphore​(int permits)
```

Creates a

Semaphore

with the given number of
permits and nonfair fairness setting.

**Parameters:** permits

- the initial number of permits available.
This value may be negative, in which case releases
must occur before any acquires will be granted.

- Semaphore

```java
public Semaphore​(int permits,
boolean fair)
```

Creates a

Semaphore

with the given number of
permits and the given fairness setting.

**Parameters:** permits

- the initial number of permits available.
This value may be negative, in which case releases
must occur before any acquires will be granted.
**Parameters:** fair

-

true

if this semaphore will guarantee
first-in first-out granting of permits under contention,
else

false

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- acquire

```java
public void acquire()
throws
InterruptedException
```

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, blocking until one is
available, or the thread is

interrupted

.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of two things happens:

- Some other thread invokes the

release()

method for this
semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
for a permit,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if the current thread is interrupted

- acquireUninterruptibly

```java
public void acquireUninterruptibly()
```

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, blocking until one is
available.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
some other thread invokes the

release()

method for this
semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit.

If the current thread is

interrupted

while waiting for a permit then it will continue to wait, but the
time at which the thread is assigned a permit may change compared to
the time it would have received the permit had no interruption
occurred. When the thread does return from this method its interrupt
status will be set.

- tryAcquire

```java
public boolean tryAcquire()
```

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, only if one is available at the
time of invocation.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
with the value

true

,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then this method will return
immediately with the value

false

.

Even when this semaphore has been set to use a
fair ordering policy, a call to

tryAcquire()

will

immediately acquire a permit if one is available, whether or not
other threads are currently waiting.
This "barging" behavior can be useful in certain
circumstances, even though it breaks fairness. If you want to honor
the fairness setting, then use

tryAcquire(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS)

which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).

**Returns:** true

if a permit was acquired and

false

otherwise

- tryAcquire

```java
public boolean tryAcquire​(long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException
```

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, if one becomes available
within the given waiting time and the current thread has not
been

interrupted

.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
with the value

true

,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of three things happens:

- Some other thread invokes the

release()

method for this
semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread; or

The specified waiting time elapses.

If a permit is acquired then the value

true

is returned.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
to acquire a permit,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

If the specified waiting time elapses then the value

false

is returned. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
will not wait at all.

**Parameters:** timeout

- the maximum time to wait for a permit
**Parameters:** unit

- the time unit of the

timeout

argument
**Returns:** true

if a permit was acquired and

false

if the waiting time elapsed before a permit was acquired
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if the current thread is interrupted

- release

```java
public void release()
```

Releases a permit, returning it to the semaphore.

Releases a permit, increasing the number of available permits by
one. If any threads are trying to acquire a permit, then one is
selected and given the permit that was just released. That thread
is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes.

There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
have acquired that permit by calling

acquire()

.
Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention
in the application.

- acquire

```java
public void acquire​(int permits)
throws
InterruptedException
```

Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore,
blocking until all are available,
or the thread is

interrupted

.

Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available,
and returns immediately, reducing the number of available permits
by the given amount. This method has the same effect as the
loop

for (int i = 0; i < permits; ++i) acquire();

except
that it atomically acquires the permits all at once:

If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of two things happens:

- Some other thread invokes one of the

release

methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
for a permit,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.
Any permits that were to be assigned to this thread are instead
assigned to other threads trying to acquire permits, as if
permits had been made available by a call to

release()

.

**Parameters:** permits

- the number of permits to acquire
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if the current thread is interrupted
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

permits

is negative

- acquireUninterruptibly

```java
public void acquireUninterruptibly​(int permits)
```

Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore,
blocking until all are available.

Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available,
and returns immediately, reducing the number of available permits
by the given amount. This method has the same effect as the
loop

for (int i = 0; i < permits; ++i) acquireUninterruptibly();

except that it atomically acquires the permits all at once:

If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
some other thread invokes one of the

release

methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request.

If the current thread is

interrupted

while waiting for permits then it will continue to wait and its
position in the queue is not affected. When the thread does return
from this method its interrupt status will be set.

**Parameters:** permits

- the number of permits to acquire
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

permits

is negative

- tryAcquire

```java
public boolean tryAcquire​(int permits)
```

Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore, only
if all are available at the time of invocation.

Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available, and
returns immediately, with the value

true

,
reducing the number of available permits by the given amount.

If insufficient permits are available then this method will return
immediately with the value

false

and the number of available
permits is unchanged.

Even when this semaphore has been set to use a fair ordering
policy, a call to

tryAcquire

will

immediately acquire a permit if one is available, whether or
not other threads are currently waiting. This
"barging" behavior can be useful in certain
circumstances, even though it breaks fairness. If you want to
honor the fairness setting, then use

tryAcquire(permits, 0, TimeUnit.SECONDS)

which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).

**Parameters:** permits

- the number of permits to acquire
**Returns:** true

if the permits were acquired and

false

otherwise
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

permits

is negative

- tryAcquire

```java
public boolean tryAcquire​(int permits,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException
```

Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore, if all
become available within the given waiting time and the current
thread has not been

interrupted

.

Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available and
returns immediately, with the value

true

,
reducing the number of available permits by the given amount.

If insufficient permits are available then
the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:

- Some other thread invokes one of the

release

methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread; or

The specified waiting time elapses.

If the permits are acquired then the value

true

is returned.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
to acquire the permits,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.
Any permits that were to be assigned to this thread, are instead
assigned to other threads trying to acquire permits, as if
the permits had been made available by a call to

release()

.

If the specified waiting time elapses then the value

is returned. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
will not wait at all. Any permits that were to be assigned to this
thread, are instead assigned to other threads trying to acquire
permits, as if the permits had been made available by a call to

**Parameters:** permits

- the number of permits to acquire
**Parameters:** timeout

- the maximum time to wait for the permits
**Parameters:** unit

- the time unit of the

- release

```java
public void release​(int permits)
```

Releases the given number of permits, returning them to the semaphore.

Releases the given number of permits, increasing the number of
available permits by that amount.
If any threads are trying to acquire permits, then one thread
is selected and given the permits that were just released.
If the number of available permits satisfies that thread's request
then that thread is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes;
otherwise the thread will wait until sufficient permits are available.
If there are still permits available
after this thread's request has been satisfied, then those permits
are assigned in turn to other threads trying to acquire permits.

There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
have acquired that permit by calling

acquire

.
Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention
in the application.

**Parameters:** permits

- the number of permits to release
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

permits

is negative

- availablePermits

```java
public int availablePermits()
```

Returns the current number of permits available in this semaphore.

This method is typically used for debugging and testing purposes.

**Returns:** the number of permits available in this semaphore

- drainPermits

```java
public int drainPermits()
```

Acquires and returns all permits that are immediately
available, or if negative permits are available, releases them.
Upon return, zero permits are available.

**Returns:** the number of permits acquired or, if negative, the
number released

- reducePermits

```java
protected void reducePermits​(int reduction)
```

Shrinks the number of available permits by the indicated
reduction. This method can be useful in subclasses that use
semaphores to track resources that become unavailable. This
method differs from

acquire

in that it does not block
waiting for permits to become available.

**Parameters:** reduction

- the number of permits to remove
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

reduction

is negative

- isFair

```java
public boolean isFair()
```

Returns

true

if this semaphore has fairness set true.

**Returns:** true

if this semaphore has fairness set true

- hasQueuedThreads

```java
public final boolean hasQueuedThreads()
```

Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire. Note that
because cancellations may occur at any time, a

true

return does not guarantee that any other thread will ever
acquire. This method is designed primarily for use in
monitoring of the system state.

**Returns:** true

if there may be other threads waiting to
acquire the lock

- getQueueLength

```java
public final int getQueueLength()
```

Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire.
The value is only an estimate because the number of threads may
change dynamically while this method traverses internal data
structures. This method is designed for use in monitoring
system state, not for synchronization control.

**Returns:** the estimated number of threads waiting for this lock

- getQueuedThreads

```java
protected
Collection
<
Thread
> getQueuedThreads()
```

Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire.
Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while
constructing this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort
estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular
order. This method is designed to facilitate construction of
subclasses that provide more extensive monitoring facilities.

**Returns:** the collection of threads

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string identifying this semaphore, as well as its state.
The state, in brackets, includes the String

Method Detail

- acquire

```java
public void acquire()
throws
InterruptedException
```

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, blocking until one is
available, or the thread is

interrupted

.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of two things happens:

- Some other thread invokes the

release()

method for this
semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
for a permit,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if the current thread is interrupted

- acquireUninterruptibly

```java
public void acquireUninterruptibly()
```

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, blocking until one is
available.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
some other thread invokes the

release()

method for this
semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit.

If the current thread is

interrupted

while waiting for a permit then it will continue to wait, but the
time at which the thread is assigned a permit may change compared to
the time it would have received the permit had no interruption
occurred. When the thread does return from this method its interrupt
status will be set.

- tryAcquire

```java
public boolean tryAcquire()
```

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, only if one is available at the
time of invocation.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
with the value

true

,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then this method will return
immediately with the value

false

.

Even when this semaphore has been set to use a
fair ordering policy, a call to

tryAcquire()

will

immediately acquire a permit if one is available, whether or not
other threads are currently waiting.
This "barging" behavior can be useful in certain
circumstances, even though it breaks fairness. If you want to honor
the fairness setting, then use

tryAcquire(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS)

which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).

**Returns:** true

if a permit was acquired and

false

otherwise

- tryAcquire

```java
public boolean tryAcquire​(long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException
```

Acquires a permit from this semaphore, if one becomes available
within the given waiting time and the current thread has not
been

interrupted

.

Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
with the value

true

,
reducing the number of available permits by one.

If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of three things happens:

- Some other thread invokes the

release()

method for this
semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread; or

The specified waiting time elapses.

If a permit is acquired then the value

true

is returned.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
to acquire a permit,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

If the specified waiting time elapses then the value

false

is returned. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
will not wait at all.

**Parameters:** timeout

- the maximum time to wait for a permit
**Parameters:** unit

- the time unit of the

timeout

argument
**Returns:** true

if a permit was acquired and

false

if the waiting time elapsed before a permit was acquired
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if the current thread is interrupted

- release

```java
public void release()
```

Releases a permit, returning it to the semaphore.

Releases a permit, increasing the number of available permits by
one. If any threads are trying to acquire a permit, then one is
selected and given the permit that was just released. That thread
is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes.

There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
have acquired that permit by calling

acquire()

.

blocking until all are available,
or the thread is

interrupted

.

Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available,
and returns immediately, reducing the number of available permits
by the given amount. This method has the same effect as the
loop

for (int i = 0; i < permits; ++i) acquire();

except
that it atomically acquires the permits all at once:

If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of two things happens:

- Some other thread invokes one of the

release

methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting
for a permit,

then

acquire

in that it does not block
waiting for permits to become available.

isFair

```java
public boolean isFair()
```

Returns

true

if this semaphore has fairness set true.

**Returns:** true

if this semaphore has fairness set true

---

#### isFair

public boolean isFair()

Returns

true

if this semaphore has fairness set true.

hasQueuedThreads

```java
public final boolean hasQueuedThreads()
```

Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire. Note that
because cancellations may occur at any time, a

true

return does not guarantee that any other thread will ever
acquire. This method is designed primarily for use in
monitoring of the system state.

**Returns:** true

if there may be other threads waiting to
acquire the lock

---

#### hasQueuedThreads

public final boolean hasQueuedThreads()

Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire. Note that
because cancellations may occur at any time, a

true

return does not guarantee that any other thread will ever
acquire. This method is designed primarily for use in
monitoring of the system state.

getQueueLength

```java
public final int getQueueLength()
```

Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire.
The value is only an estimate because the number of threads may
change dynamically while this method traverses internal data
structures. This method is designed for use in monitoring
system state, not for synchronization control.

**Returns:** the estimated number of threads waiting for this lock

---

#### getQueueLength

public final int getQueueLength()

Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire.
The value is only an estimate because the number of threads may
change dynamically while this method traverses internal data
structures. This method is designed for use in monitoring
system state, not for synchronization control.

getQueuedThreads

```java
protected
Collection
<
Thread
> getQueuedThreads()
```

Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire.
Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while
constructing this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort
estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular
order. This method is designed to facilitate construction of
subclasses that provide more extensive monitoring facilities.

**Returns:** the collection of threads

---

#### getQueuedThreads

protected

Collection

<

Thread

> getQueuedThreads()

Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire.
Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while
constructing this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort
estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular
order. This method is designed to facilitate construction of
subclasses that provide more extensive monitoring facilities.

toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string identifying this semaphore, as well as its state.
The state, in brackets, includes the String

"Permits ="

followed by the number of permits.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string identifying this semaphore, as well as its state

---

#### toString

public

String

toString()

Returns a string identifying this semaphore, as well as its state.
The state, in brackets, includes the String

"Permits ="

followed by the number of permits.
