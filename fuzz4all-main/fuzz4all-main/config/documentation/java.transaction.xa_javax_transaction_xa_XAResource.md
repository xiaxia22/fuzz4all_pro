# Interface XAResource

**Source:** `java.transaction.xa\javax\transaction\xa\XAResource.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
XAResource
```

The XAResource interface is a Java mapping of the industry standard
XA interface based on the X/Open CAE Specification (Distributed
Transaction Processing: The XA Specification).

The XA interface defines the contract between a Resource Manager
and a Transaction Manager in a distributed transaction processing
(DTP) environment. A JDBC driver or a JMS provider implements
this interface to support the association between a global transaction
and a database or message service connection.

The XAResource interface can be supported by any transactional
resource that is intended to be used by application programs in an
environment where transactions are controlled by an external
transaction manager. An example of such a resource is a database
management system. An application may access data through multiple
database connections. Each database connection is enlisted with
the transaction manager as a transactional resource. The transaction
manager obtains an XAResource for each connection participating
in a global transaction. The transaction manager uses the

start

method
to associate the global transaction with the resource, and it uses the

end

method to disassociate the transaction from
the resource. The resource
manager is responsible for associating the global transaction to all
work performed on its data between the start and end method invocations.

At transaction commit time, the resource managers are informed by
the transaction manager to prepare, commit, or rollback a transaction
according to the two-phase commit protocol.

### Method Details

#### void commit​(
Xid
xid,
boolean onePhase)
throws
XAException

Commits the global transaction specified by xid.

**Parameters:**
- xid

- A global transaction identifier
- onePhase

- If true, the resource manager should use a one-phase
commit protocol to commit the work done on behalf of xid.

**Throws:**
- XAException

- An error has occurred. Possible XAExceptions
are XA_HEURHAZ, XA_HEURCOM, XA_HEURRB, XA_HEURMIX, XAER_RMERR,
XAER_RMFAIL, XAER_NOTA, XAER_INVAL, or XAER_PROTO.

If the resource manager did not commit the transaction and the
paramether onePhase is set to true, the resource manager may throw
one of the XA_RB* exceptions. Upon return, the resource manager has
rolled back the branch's work and has released all held resources.

---

#### void end​(
Xid
xid,
int flags)
throws
XAException

Ends the work performed on behalf of a transaction branch.
The resource manager disassociates the XA resource from the
transaction branch specified and lets the transaction
complete.

If TMSUSPEND is specified in the flags, the transaction branch
is temporarily suspended in an incomplete state. The transaction
context is in a suspended state and must be resumed via the

start

method with TMRESUME specified.

If TMFAIL is specified, the portion of work has failed.
The resource manager may mark the transaction as rollback-only

If TMSUCCESS is specified, the portion of work has completed
successfully.

**Parameters:**
- xid

- A global transaction identifier that is the same as
the identifier used previously in the

start

method.
- flags

- One of TMSUCCESS, TMFAIL, or TMSUSPEND.

**Throws:**
- XAException

- An error has occurred. Possible XAException
values are XAER_RMERR, XAER_RMFAILED, XAER_NOTA, XAER_INVAL,
XAER_PROTO, or XA_RB*.

---

#### void forget​(
Xid
xid)
throws
XAException

Tells the resource manager to forget about a heuristically
completed transaction branch.

**Parameters:**
- xid

- A global transaction identifier.

**Throws:**
- XAException

- An error has occurred. Possible exception
values are XAER_RMERR, XAER_RMFAIL, XAER_NOTA, XAER_INVAL, or
XAER_PROTO.

---

#### int getTransactionTimeout()
throws
XAException

Obtains the current transaction timeout value set for this
XAResource instance. If

XAResource.setTransactionTimeout

was not used prior to invoking this method, the return value
is the default timeout set for the resource manager; otherwise,
the value used in the previous

setTransactionTimeout

call is returned.

**Returns:**
- the transaction timeout value in seconds.

**Throws:**
- XAException

- An error has occurred. Possible exception
values are XAER_RMERR and XAER_RMFAIL.

---

#### boolean isSameRM​(
XAResource
xares)
throws
XAException

This method is called to determine if the resource manager
instance represented by the target object is the same as the
resouce manager instance represented by the parameter

xares

.

**Parameters:**
- xares

- An XAResource object whose resource manager instance
is to be compared with the resource manager instance of the
target object.

**Returns:**
- true

if it's the same RM instance; otherwise

false

.

**Throws:**
- XAException

- An error has occurred. Possible exception
values are XAER_RMERR and XAER_RMFAIL.

---

#### int prepare​(
Xid
xid)
throws

- xid

- A global transaction identifier.

**Returns:**
- A value indicating the resource manager's vote on the
outcome of the transaction. The possible values are: XA_RDONLY
or XA_OK. If the resource manager wants to roll back the
transaction, it should do so by raising an appropriate XAException
in the prepare method.

**Throws:**
- XAException

- An error has occurred. Possible exception
values are: XA_RB*, XAER_RMERR, XAER_RMFAIL, XAER_NOTA, XAER_INVAL,
or XAER_PROTO.

---

#### Xid
[] recover​(int flag)
throws

manager. The transaction manager calls this method during recovery
to obtain the list of transaction branches that are currently in
prepared or heuristically completed states.

**Parameters:**
- flag

- One of TMSTARTRSCAN, TMENDRSCAN, TMNOFLAGS. TMNOFLAGS
must be used when no other flags are set in the parameter.

**Returns:**
- The resource manager returns zero or more XIDs of the
transaction branches that are currently in a prepared or
heuristically completed state. If an error occurs during the
operation, the resource manager should throw the appropriate
XAException.

manager, set the value to zero.

If the timeout operation is performed successfully, the method returns

true

; otherwise

false

. If a resource manager does not
support explicitly setting the transaction timeout value, this method
returns

false

.

**Parameters:**
- seconds

- The transaction timeout value in seconds.

boolean onePhase)
throws
XAException
```

Commits the global transaction specified by xid.

**Parameters:** xid

- A global transaction identifier
**Parameters:** onePhase

- If true, the resource manager should use a one-phase
commit protocol to commit the work done on behalf of xid.
**Throws:** XAException

- An error has occurred. Possible XAExceptions
are XA_HEURHAZ, XA_HEURCOM, XA_HEURRB, XA_HEURMIX, XAER_RMERR,
XAER_RMFAIL, XAER_NOTA, XAER_INVAL, or XAER_PROTO.

If the resource manager did not commit the transaction and the

one of the XA_RB* exceptions. Upon return, the resource manager has
rolled back the branch's work and has released all held resources.

- end

```java
void end​(
Xid
xid,
int flags)
throws
XAException
```

Ends the work performed on behalf of a transaction branch.
The resource manager disassociates the XA resource from the
transaction branch specified and lets the transaction
complete.

If TMSUSPEND is specified in the flags, the transaction branch
is temporarily suspended in an incomplete state. The transaction
context is in a suspended state and must be resumed via the

start

method with TMRESUME specified.

If TMFAIL is specified, the portion of work has failed.
The resource manager may mark the transaction as rollback-only

If TMSUCCESS is specified, the portion of work has completed
successfully.

**Parameters:** xid

- A global transaction identifier that is the same as
the identifier used previously in the

start

method.
**Parameters:** flags

- One of TMSUCCESS, TMFAIL, or TMSUSPEND.
**Throws:** XAException

- An error has occurred. Possible XAException
values are XAER_RMERR, XAER_RMFAILED, XAER_NOTA, XAER_INVAL,
