# Class StackTraceElement

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\StackTraceElement.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
StackTraceElement

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

An element in a stack trace, as returned by

Throwable.getStackTrace()

. Each element represents a single stack frame.
All stack frames except for the one at the top of the stack represent
a method invocation. The frame at the top of the stack represents the
execution point at which the stack trace was generated. Typically,
this is the point at which the throwable corresponding to the stack trace
was created.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

- the fully qualified name of the

Class

containing
the execution point represented by this stack trace element.

---

#### public
String
getMethodName()

Returns the name of the method containing the execution point
represented by this stack trace element. If the execution point is
contained in an instance or class initializer, this method will return
the appropriate

special method name

,

<init>

or

<clinit>

, as per Section 3.9 of

The Java Virtual
Machine Specification

.

**Returns:**
- the name of the method containing the execution point
represented by this stack trace element.

---

#### public boolean isNativeMethod()

Returns true if the method containing the execution point
represented by this stack trace element is a native method.

**Returns:**
- true

if the method containing the execution point
represented by this stack trace element is a native method.

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string representation of this stack trace element.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a string representation of the object.

**See Also:**
- Throwable.printStackTrace()

**API Note:**
- The format of this string depends on the implementation, but the
following examples may be regarded as typical:

- "

com.foo.loader/foo@9.0/com.foo.Main.run(Main.java:101)

"
- See the description below.
- "

com.foo.loader/foo@9.0/com.foo.Main.run(Main.java)

"
- The line number is unavailable.
- "

com.foo.loader/foo@9.0/com.foo.Main.run(Unknown Source)

"
- Neither the file name nor the line number is available.
- "

com.foo.loader/foo@9.0/com.foo.Main.run(Native Method)

"
- The method containing the execution point is a native method.
- "

com.foo.loader//com.foo.bar.App.run(App.java:12)

"
- The class of the execution point is defined in the unnamed module of
the class loader named

com.foo.loader

.
- "

acme@2.1/org.acme.Lib.test(Lib.java:80)

"
- The class of the execution point is defined in

acme

module
loaded by a built-in class loader such as the application class loader.
- "

MyClass.mash(MyClass.java:9)

"
-

MyClass

class is on the application class path.

The first example shows a stack trace element consisting of
three elements, each separated by

"/"

followed with
the source file name and the line number of the source line
containing the execution point.

The first element "

com.foo.loader

" is
the name of the class loader. The second element "

foo@9.0

"
is the module name and version. The third element is the method
containing the execution point; "

com.foo.Main"

" is the
fully-qualified class name and "

run

" is the name of the method.
"

Main.java

" is the source file name and "

101

" is
the line number.

If a class is defined in an

unnamed module

then the second element is omitted as shown in
"

com.foo.loader//com.foo.bar.App.run(App.java:12)

".

If the class loader is a

built-in class loader

or is not named then the first element
and its following

"/"

are omitted as shown in
"

acme@2.1/org.acme.Lib.test(Lib.java:80)

".
If the first element is omitted and the module is an unnamed module,
the second element and its following

"/"

are also omitted
as shown in "

MyClass.mash(MyClass.java:9)

".

The

toString

method may return two different values on two

StackTraceElement

instances that are

equal

, for example one created via the
constructor, and one obtained from

Throwable

or

StackWalker.StackFrame

, where an implementation may
choose to omit some element in the returned string.

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

StackTraceElement

instance representing the same execution
point as this instance. Two stack trace elements

a

equals(a.getModuleName(), b.getModuleName()) &&
equals(a.getModuleVersion(), b.getModuleVersion()) &&
equals(a.getClassName(), b.getClassName()) &&
equals(a.getMethodName(), b.getMethodName())

If the class loader is a

built-in class loader

or is not named then the first element
and its following

"/"

are omitted as shown in
"
