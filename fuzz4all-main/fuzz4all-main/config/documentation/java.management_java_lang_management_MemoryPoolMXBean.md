# Interface MemoryPoolMXBean

**Source:** `java.management\java\lang\management\MemoryPoolMXBean.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
MemoryPoolMXBean

extends
PlatformManagedObject
```

The management interface for a memory pool. A memory pool
represents the memory resource managed by the Java virtual machine
and is managed by one or more

memory managers

.

A Java virtual machine has one or more instances of the
implementation class of this interface. An instance
implementing this interface is
an

MXBean

that can be obtained by calling
the

ManagementFactory.getMemoryPoolMXBeans()

method or
from the

platform MBeanServer

method.

The

ObjectName

for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
a memory pool within an

MBeanServer

is:

java.lang:type=MemoryPool

,name=

pool's name

It can be obtained by calling the

PlatformManagedObject.getObjectName()

method.

Memory Type

The Java virtual machine has a heap for object allocation and also
maintains non-heap memory for the method area and the Java virtual
machine execution. The Java virtual machine can have one or more
memory pools. Each memory pool represents a memory area
of one of the following types:

- heap
- non-heap

Memory Usage Monitoring

A memory pool has the following attributes:

- Memory usage
- Peak memory usage
- Usage Threshold
- Collection Usage Threshold

(only supported by some

garbage-collected

memory pools)

1. Memory Usage

The

getUsage()

method provides an estimate
of the current usage of a memory pool.
For a garbage-collected memory pool, the amount of used memory
includes the memory occupied by all objects in the pool
including both

reachable

and

unreachable

objects.

In general, this method is a lightweight operation for getting
an approximate memory usage. For some memory pools, for example,
when objects are not packed contiguously, this method may be
an expensive operation that requires some computation to determine
the current memory usage. An implementation should document when
this is the case.

2. Peak Memory Usage

The Java virtual machine maintains the peak memory usage of a memory
pool since the virtual machine was started or the peak was reset.
The peak memory usage is returned by the

getPeakUsage()

method
and reset by calling the

resetPeakUsage()

method.

3. Usage Threshold

Each memory pool has a manageable attribute
called the

usage threshold

which has a default value supplied
by the Java virtual machine. The default value is platform-dependent.
The usage threshold can be set via the

setUsageThreshold

method.
If the threshold is set to a positive value, the usage threshold crossing
checking is enabled in this memory pool.
If the usage threshold is set to zero, usage
threshold crossing checking on this memory pool is disabled.
The

isUsageThresholdSupported()

method can
be used to determine if this functionality is supported.

A Java virtual machine performs usage threshold crossing checking on a
memory pool basis at its best appropriate time, typically,
at garbage collection time.
Each memory pool maintains a

usage threshold count

that will get incremented
every time when the Java virtual machine
detects that the memory pool usage is crossing the threshold.

This manageable usage threshold attribute is designed for monitoring the
increasing trend of memory usage with low overhead.
Usage threshold may not be appropriate for some memory pools.
For example, a generational garbage collector, a common garbage collection
algorithm used in many Java virtual machine implementations,
manages two or more generations segregating objects by age.
Most of the objects are allocated in
the

youngest generation

(say a nursery memory pool).
The nursery memory pool is designed to be filled up and
collecting the nursery memory pool will free most of its memory space
since it is expected to contain mostly short-lived objects
and mostly are unreachable at garbage collection time.
In this case, it is more appropriate for the nursery memory pool
not to support a usage threshold. In addition,
if the cost of an object allocation
in one memory pool is very low (for example, just atomic pointer exchange),
the Java virtual machine would probably not support the usage threshold
for that memory pool since the overhead in comparing the usage with
the threshold is higher than the cost of object allocation.

The memory usage of the system can be monitored using

polling

or

threshold notification

mechanisms.

- Polling

An application can continuously monitor its memory usage
by calling either the

getUsage()

method for all
memory pools or the

isUsageThresholdExceeded()

method
for those memory pools that support a usage threshold.
Below is example code that has a thread dedicated for
task distribution and processing. At every interval,
it will determine if it should receive and process new tasks based
on its memory usage. If the memory usage exceeds its usage threshold,
it will redistribute all outstanding tasks to other VMs and
stop receiving new tasks until the memory usage returns
below its usage threshold.

```java
// Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);
....

boolean lowMemory = false;
while (true) {
if (pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded()) {
// potential low memory, so redistribute tasks to other VMs
lowMemory = true;
redistributeTasks();
// stop receiving new tasks
stopReceivingTasks();
} else {
if (lowMemory) {
// resume receiving tasks
lowMemory = false;
resumeReceivingTasks();
}
// processing outstanding task
...
}
// sleep for sometime
try {
Thread.sleep(sometime);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
...
}
}
```

The above example does not differentiate the case where
the memory usage has temporarily dropped below the usage threshold
from the case where the memory usage remains above the threshold
between two iterations. The usage threshold count returned by
the

getUsageThresholdCount()

method
can be used to determine
if the memory usage has returned below the threshold
between two polls.

Below shows another example that takes some action if a
memory pool is under low memory and ignores the memory usage
changes during the action processing time.

```java
// Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold which determines if
// the application will take some action under low memory condition.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

int prevCrossingCount = 0;
while (true) {
// A busy loop to detect when the memory usage
// has exceeded the threshold.
while (!pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded() ||
pool.getUsageThresholdCount() == prevCrossingCount) {
try {
Thread.sleep(sometime)
} catch (InterruptException e) {
....
}
}

// Do some processing such as check for memory usage
// and issue a warning
....

// Gets the current threshold count. The busy loop will then
// ignore any crossing of threshold happens during the processing.
prevCrossingCount = pool.getUsageThresholdCount();
}
```
- Usage Threshold Notifications

Usage threshold notification will be emitted by

MemoryMXBean

.
When the Java virtual machine detects that the memory usage of
a memory pool has reached or exceeded the usage threshold
the virtual machine will trigger the

MemoryMXBean

to emit an

usage threshold exceeded notification

.
Another usage threshold exceeded notification will not be
generated until the usage has fallen below the threshold and
then exceeded it again.

Below is an example code implementing the same logic as the
first example above but using the usage threshold notification
mechanism to detect low memory conditions instead of polling.
In this example code, upon receiving notification, the notification
listener notifies another thread to perform the actual action
such as to redistribute outstanding tasks, stop receiving tasks,
or resume receiving tasks.
The

handleNotification

method should be designed to
do a very minimal amount of work and return without delay to avoid
causing delay in delivering subsequent notifications. Time-consuming
actions should be performed by a separate thread.
The notification listener may be invoked by multiple threads
concurrently; so the tasks performed by the listener
should be properly synchronized.

```java
class MyListener implements javax.management.NotificationListener {
public void handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback) {
String notifType = notification.getType();
if (notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED)) {
// potential low memory, notify another thread
// to redistribute outstanding tasks to other VMs
// and stop receiving new tasks.
lowMemory = true;
notifyAnotherThread(lowMemory);
}
}
}

// Register MyListener with MemoryMXBean
MemoryMXBean mbean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();
NotificationEmitter emitter = (NotificationEmitter) mbean;
MyListener listener = new MyListener();
emitter.addNotificationListener(listener, null, null);

// Assume this pool supports a usage threshold.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

// Usage threshold detection is enabled and notification will be
// handled by MyListener. Continue for other processing.
....
```

There is no guarantee about when the

MemoryMXBean

will emit
a threshold notification and when the notification will be delivered.
When a notification listener is invoked, the memory usage of
the memory pool may have crossed the usage threshold more
than once.
The

MemoryNotificationInfo.getCount()

method returns the number
of times that the memory usage has crossed the usage threshold
at the point in time when the notification was constructed.
It can be compared with the current usage threshold count returned
by the

getUsageThresholdCount()

method to determine if
such situation has occurred.

4. Collection Usage Threshold

Collection usage threshold is a manageable attribute only applicable
to some garbage-collected memory pools.
After a Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming memory
space by recycling unused objects in a memory pool at garbage collection
time, some number of bytes in the memory pools that are garbaged
collected will still be in use. The collection usage threshold
allows a value to be set for this number of bytes such
that if the threshold is exceeded,
a

collection usage threshold exceeded notification

will be emitted by the

MemoryMXBean

.
In addition, the

collection usage threshold count

will then be incremented.

The

isCollectionUsageThresholdSupported()

method can
be used to determine if this functionality is supported.

A Java virtual machine performs collection usage threshold checking
on a memory pool basis. This checking is enabled if the collection
usage threshold is set to a positive value.
If the collection usage threshold is set to zero, this checking
is disabled on this memory pool. Default value is zero.
The Java virtual machine performs the collection usage threshold
checking at garbage collection time.

Some garbage-collected memory pools may
choose not to support the collection usage threshold. For example,
a memory pool is only managed by a continuous concurrent garbage
collector. Objects can be allocated in this memory pool by some thread
while the unused objects are reclaimed by the concurrent garbage
collector simultaneously. Unless there is a well-defined
garbage collection time which is the best appropriate time
to check the memory usage, the collection usage threshold should not
be supported.

The collection usage threshold is designed for monitoring the memory usage
after the Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming
memory space. The collection usage could also be monitored
by the polling and threshold notification mechanism
described above for the

usage threshold

in a similar fashion.

### Additional Sections

#### Interface MemoryPoolMXBean

**All Superinterfaces:** PlatformManagedObject

```java
public interface
MemoryPoolMXBean

extends
PlatformManagedObject
```

The management interface for a memory pool. A memory pool
represents the memory resource managed by the Java virtual machine
and is managed by one or more

memory managers

.

A Java virtual machine has one or more instances of the
implementation class of this interface. An instance
implementing this interface is
an

MXBean

that can be obtained by calling
the

ManagementFactory.getMemoryPoolMXBeans()

method or
from the

platform MBeanServer

method.

The

ObjectName

for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
a memory pool within an

MBeanServer

is:

java.lang:type=MemoryPool

,name=

pool's name

It can be obtained by calling the

PlatformManagedObject.getObjectName()

method.

Memory Type

The Java virtual machine has a heap for object allocation and also
maintains non-heap memory for the method area and the Java virtual
machine execution. The Java virtual machine can have one or more
memory pools. Each memory pool represents a memory area
of one of the following types:

- heap
- non-heap

Memory Usage Monitoring

A memory pool has the following attributes:

- Memory usage
- Peak memory usage
- Usage Threshold
- Collection Usage Threshold

(only supported by some

garbage-collected

memory pools)

1. Memory Usage

The

getUsage()

method provides an estimate
of the current usage of a memory pool.
For a garbage-collected memory pool, the amount of used memory
includes the memory occupied by all objects in the pool
including both

reachable

and

unreachable

objects.

In general, this method is a lightweight operation for getting
an approximate memory usage. For some memory pools, for example,
when objects are not packed contiguously, this method may be
an expensive operation that requires some computation to determine
the current memory usage. An implementation should document when
this is the case.

2. Peak Memory Usage

The Java virtual machine maintains the peak memory usage of a memory
pool since the virtual machine was started or the peak was reset.
The peak memory usage is returned by the

getPeakUsage()

method
and reset by calling the

resetPeakUsage()

method.

3. Usage Threshold

Each memory pool has a manageable attribute
called the

usage threshold

which has a default value supplied
by the Java virtual machine. The default value is platform-dependent.
The usage threshold can be set via the

setUsageThreshold

method.
If the threshold is set to a positive value, the usage threshold crossing
checking is enabled in this memory pool.
If the usage threshold is set to zero, usage
threshold crossing checking on this memory pool is disabled.
The

isUsageThresholdSupported()

method can
be used to determine if this functionality is supported.

A Java virtual machine performs usage threshold crossing checking on a
memory pool basis at its best appropriate time, typically,
at garbage collection time.
Each memory pool maintains a

usage threshold count

that will get incremented
every time when the Java virtual machine
detects that the memory pool usage is crossing the threshold.

This manageable usage threshold attribute is designed for monitoring the
increasing trend of memory usage with low overhead.
Usage threshold may not be appropriate for some memory pools.
For example, a generational garbage collector, a common garbage collection
algorithm used in many Java virtual machine implementations,
manages two or more generations segregating objects by age.
Most of the objects are allocated in
the

youngest generation

(say a nursery memory pool).
The nursery memory pool is designed to be filled up and
collecting the nursery memory pool will free most of its memory space
since it is expected to contain mostly short-lived objects
and mostly are unreachable at garbage collection time.
In this case, it is more appropriate for the nursery memory pool
not to support a usage threshold. In addition,
if the cost of an object allocation
in one memory pool is very low (for example, just atomic pointer exchange),
the Java virtual machine would probably not support the usage threshold
for that memory pool since the overhead in comparing the usage with
the threshold is higher than the cost of object allocation.

The memory usage of the system can be monitored using

polling

or

threshold notification

mechanisms.

- Polling

An application can continuously monitor its memory usage
by calling either the

getUsage()

method for all
memory pools or the

isUsageThresholdExceeded()

method
for those memory pools that support a usage threshold.
Below is example code that has a thread dedicated for
task distribution and processing. At every interval,
it will determine if it should receive and process new tasks based
on its memory usage. If the memory usage exceeds its usage threshold,
it will redistribute all outstanding tasks to other VMs and
stop receiving new tasks until the memory usage returns
below its usage threshold.

```java
// Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);
....

boolean lowMemory = false;
while (true) {
if (pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded()) {
// potential low memory, so redistribute tasks to other VMs
lowMemory = true;
redistributeTasks();
// stop receiving new tasks
stopReceivingTasks();
} else {
if (lowMemory) {
// resume receiving tasks
lowMemory = false;
resumeReceivingTasks();
}
// processing outstanding task
...
}
// sleep for sometime
try {
Thread.sleep(sometime);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
...
}
}
```

The above example does not differentiate the case where
the memory usage has temporarily dropped below the usage threshold
from the case where the memory usage remains above the threshold
between two iterations. The usage threshold count returned by
the

getUsageThresholdCount()

method
can be used to determine
if the memory usage has returned below the threshold
between two polls.

Below shows another example that takes some action if a
memory pool is under low memory and ignores the memory usage
changes during the action processing time.

```java
// Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold which determines if
// the application will take some action under low memory condition.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

int prevCrossingCount = 0;
while (true) {
// A busy loop to detect when the memory usage
// has exceeded the threshold.
while (!pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded() ||
pool.getUsageThresholdCount() == prevCrossingCount) {
try {
Thread.sleep(sometime)
} catch (InterruptException e) {
....
}
}

// Do some processing such as check for memory usage
// and issue a warning
....

// Gets the current threshold count. The busy loop will then
// ignore any crossing of threshold happens during the processing.
prevCrossingCount = pool.getUsageThresholdCount();
}
```
- Usage Threshold Notifications

Usage threshold notification will be emitted by

MemoryMXBean

.
When the Java virtual machine detects that the memory usage of
a memory pool has reached or exceeded the usage threshold
the virtual machine will trigger the

MemoryMXBean

to emit an

usage threshold exceeded notification

.
Another usage threshold exceeded notification will not be
generated until the usage has fallen below the threshold and
then exceeded it again.

Below is an example code implementing the same logic as the
first example above but using the usage threshold notification
mechanism to detect low memory conditions instead of polling.
In this example code, upon receiving notification, the notification
listener notifies another thread to perform the actual action
such as to redistribute outstanding tasks, stop receiving tasks,
or resume receiving tasks.
The

handleNotification

method should be designed to
do a very minimal amount of work and return without delay to avoid
causing delay in delivering subsequent notifications. Time-consuming
actions should be performed by a separate thread.
The notification listener may be invoked by multiple threads
concurrently; so the tasks performed by the listener
should be properly synchronized.

```java
class MyListener implements javax.management.NotificationListener {
public void handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback) {
String notifType = notification.getType();
if (notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED)) {
// potential low memory, notify another thread
// to redistribute outstanding tasks to other VMs
// and stop receiving new tasks.
lowMemory = true;
notifyAnotherThread(lowMemory);
}
}
}

// Register MyListener with MemoryMXBean
MemoryMXBean mbean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();
NotificationEmitter emitter = (NotificationEmitter) mbean;
MyListener listener = new MyListener();
emitter.addNotificationListener(listener, null, null);

// Assume this pool supports a usage threshold.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

// Usage threshold detection is enabled and notification will be
// handled by MyListener. Continue for other processing.
....
```

There is no guarantee about when the

MemoryMXBean

will emit
a threshold notification and when the notification will be delivered.
When a notification listener is invoked, the memory usage of
the memory pool may have crossed the usage threshold more
than once.
The

MemoryNotificationInfo.getCount()

method returns the number
of times that the memory usage has crossed the usage threshold
at the point in time when the notification was constructed.
It can be compared with the current usage threshold count returned
by the

getUsageThresholdCount()

method to determine if
such situation has occurred.

4. Collection Usage Threshold

Collection usage threshold is a manageable attribute only applicable
to some garbage-collected memory pools.
After a Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming memory
space by recycling unused objects in a memory pool at garbage collection
time, some number of bytes in the memory pools that are garbaged
collected will still be in use. The collection usage threshold
allows a value to be set for this number of bytes such
that if the threshold is exceeded,
a

collection usage threshold exceeded notification

will be emitted by the

MemoryMXBean

.
In addition, the

collection usage threshold count

will then be incremented.

The

isCollectionUsageThresholdSupported()

method can
be used to determine if this functionality is supported.

A Java virtual machine performs collection usage threshold checking
on a memory pool basis. This checking is enabled if the collection
usage threshold is set to a positive value.
If the collection usage threshold is set to zero, this checking
is disabled on this memory pool. Default value is zero.
The Java virtual machine performs the collection usage threshold
checking at garbage collection time.

Some garbage-collected memory pools may
choose not to support the collection usage threshold. For example,
a memory pool is only managed by a continuous concurrent garbage
collector. Objects can be allocated in this memory pool by some thread
while the unused objects are reclaimed by the concurrent garbage
collector simultaneously. Unless there is a well-defined
garbage collection time which is the best appropriate time
to check the memory usage, the collection usage threshold should not
be supported.

The collection usage threshold is designed for monitoring the memory usage
after the Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming
memory space. The collection usage could also be monitored
by the polling and threshold notification mechanism
described above for the

usage threshold

in a similar fashion.

The Java virtual machine has a heap for object allocation and also
maintains non-heap memory for the method area and the Java virtual
machine execution. The Java virtual machine can have one or more
memory pools. Each memory pool represents a memory area
of one of the following types:

- heap
- non-heap

Memory Usage Monitoring

A memory pool has the following attributes:

- Memory usage
- Peak memory usage
- Usage Threshold
- Collection Usage Threshold

(only supported by some

garbage-collected

memory pools)

1. Memory Usage

The

getUsage()

method provides an estimate
of the current usage of a memory pool.
For a garbage-collected memory pool, the amount of used memory
includes the memory occupied by all objects in the pool
including both

reachable

and

unreachable

objects.

In general, this method is a lightweight operation for getting
an approximate memory usage. For some memory pools, for example,
when objects are not packed contiguously, this method may be
an expensive operation that requires some computation to determine
the current memory usage. An implementation should document when
this is the case.

2. Peak Memory Usage

The Java virtual machine maintains the peak memory usage of a memory
pool since the virtual machine was started or the peak was reset.
The peak memory usage is returned by the

getPeakUsage()

method
and reset by calling the

resetPeakUsage()

method.

3. Usage Threshold

Each memory pool has a manageable attribute
called the

usage threshold

which has a default value supplied
by the Java virtual machine. The default value is platform-dependent.
The usage threshold can be set via the

setUsageThreshold

method.
If the threshold is set to a positive value, the usage threshold crossing
checking is enabled in this memory pool.
If the usage threshold is set to zero, usage
threshold crossing checking on this memory pool is disabled.
The

isUsageThresholdSupported()

method can
be used to determine if this functionality is supported.

A Java virtual machine performs usage threshold crossing checking on a
memory pool basis at its best appropriate time, typically,
at garbage collection time.
Each memory pool maintains a

usage threshold count

that will get incremented
every time when the Java virtual machine
detects that the memory pool usage is crossing the threshold.

This manageable usage threshold attribute is designed for monitoring the
increasing trend of memory usage with low overhead.
Usage threshold may not be appropriate for some memory pools.
For example, a generational garbage collector, a common garbage collection
algorithm used in many Java virtual machine implementations,
manages two or more generations segregating objects by age.
Most of the objects are allocated in
the

youngest generation

(say a nursery memory pool).
The nursery memory pool is designed to be filled up and
collecting the nursery memory pool will free most of its memory space
since it is expected to contain mostly short-lived objects
and mostly are unreachable at garbage collection time.
In this case, it is more appropriate for the nursery memory pool
not to support a usage threshold. In addition,
if the cost of an object allocation
in one memory pool is very low (for example, just atomic pointer exchange),
the Java virtual machine would probably not support the usage threshold
for that memory pool since the overhead in comparing the usage with
the threshold is higher than the cost of object allocation.

The memory usage of the system can be monitored using

polling

or

threshold notification

mechanisms.

- Polling

An application can continuously monitor its memory usage
by calling either the

getUsage()

method for all
memory pools or the

isUsageThresholdExceeded()

method
for those memory pools that support a usage threshold.
Below is example code that has a thread dedicated for
task distribution and processing. At every interval,
it will determine if it should receive and process new tasks based
on its memory usage. If the memory usage exceeds its usage threshold,
it will redistribute all outstanding tasks to other VMs and
stop receiving new tasks until the memory usage returns
below its usage threshold.

```java
// Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);
....

boolean lowMemory = false;
while (true) {
if (pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded()) {
// potential low memory, so redistribute tasks to other VMs
lowMemory = true;
redistributeTasks();
// stop receiving new tasks
stopReceivingTasks();
} else {
if (lowMemory) {
// resume receiving tasks
lowMemory = false;
resumeReceivingTasks();
}
// processing outstanding task
...
}
// sleep for sometime
try {
Thread.sleep(sometime);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
...
}
}
```

The above example does not differentiate the case where
the memory usage has temporarily dropped below the usage threshold
from the case where the memory usage remains above the threshold
between two iterations. The usage threshold count returned by
the

getUsageThresholdCount()

method
can be used to determine
if the memory usage has returned below the threshold
between two polls.

Below shows another example that takes some action if a
memory pool is under low memory and ignores the memory usage
changes during the action processing time.

```java
// Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold which determines if
// the application will take some action under low memory condition.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

int prevCrossingCount = 0;
while (true) {
// A busy loop to detect when the memory usage
// has exceeded the threshold.
while (!pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded() ||
pool.getUsageThresholdCount() == prevCrossingCount) {
try {
Thread.sleep(sometime)
} catch (InterruptException e) {
....
}
}

// Do some processing such as check for memory usage
// and issue a warning
....

// Gets the current threshold count. The busy loop will then
// ignore any crossing of threshold happens during the processing.
prevCrossingCount = pool.getUsageThresholdCount();
}
```
- Usage Threshold Notifications

Usage threshold notification will be emitted by

MemoryMXBean

.
When the Java virtual machine detects that the memory usage of
a memory pool has reached or exceeded the usage threshold
the virtual machine will trigger the

MemoryMXBean

to emit an

usage threshold exceeded notification

.
Another usage threshold exceeded notification will not be
generated until the usage has fallen below the threshold and
then exceeded it again.

Below is an example code implementing the same logic as the
first example above but using the usage threshold notification
mechanism to detect low memory conditions instead of polling.
In this example code, upon receiving notification, the notification
listener notifies another thread to perform the actual action
such as to redistribute outstanding tasks, stop receiving tasks,
or resume receiving tasks.
The

handleNotification

method should be designed to
do a very minimal amount of work and return without delay to avoid
causing delay in delivering subsequent notifications. Time-consuming
actions should be performed by a separate thread.
The notification listener may be invoked by multiple threads
concurrently; so the tasks performed by the listener
should be properly synchronized.

```java
class MyListener implements javax.management.NotificationListener {
public void handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback) {
String notifType = notification.getType();
if (notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED)) {
// potential low memory, notify another thread
// to redistribute outstanding tasks to other VMs
// and stop receiving new tasks.
lowMemory = true;
notifyAnotherThread(lowMemory);
}
}
}

// Register MyListener with MemoryMXBean
MemoryMXBean mbean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();
NotificationEmitter emitter = (NotificationEmitter) mbean;
MyListener listener = new MyListener();
emitter.addNotificationListener(listener, null, null);

// Assume this pool supports a usage threshold.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

// Usage threshold detection is enabled and notification will be
// handled by MyListener. Continue for other processing.
....
```

There is no guarantee about when the

MemoryMXBean

will emit
a threshold notification and when the notification will be delivered.
When a notification listener is invoked, the memory usage of
the memory pool may have crossed the usage threshold more
than once.
The

MemoryNotificationInfo.getCount()

method returns the number
of times that the memory usage has crossed the usage threshold
at the point in time when the notification was constructed.
It can be compared with the current usage threshold count returned
by the

getUsageThresholdCount()

method to determine if
such situation has occurred.

4. Collection Usage Threshold

Collection usage threshold is a manageable attribute only applicable
to some garbage-collected memory pools.
After a Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming memory
space by recycling unused objects in a memory pool at garbage collection
time, some number of bytes in the memory pools that are garbaged
collected will still be in use. The collection usage threshold
allows a value to be set for this number of bytes such
that if the threshold is exceeded,
a

collection usage threshold exceeded notification

will be emitted by the

MemoryMXBean

.
In addition, the

collection usage threshold count

will then be incremented.

The

isCollectionUsageThresholdSupported()

method can
be used to determine if this functionality is supported.

A Java virtual machine performs collection usage threshold checking
on a memory pool basis. This checking is enabled if the collection
usage threshold is set to a positive value.
If the collection usage threshold is set to zero, this checking
is disabled on this memory pool. Default value is zero.
The Java virtual machine performs the collection usage threshold
checking at garbage collection time.

Some garbage-collected memory pools may
choose not to support the collection usage threshold. For example,
a memory pool is only managed by a continuous concurrent garbage
collector. Objects can be allocated in this memory pool by some thread
while the unused objects are reclaimed by the concurrent garbage
collector simultaneously. Unless there is a well-defined
garbage collection time which is the best appropriate time
to check the memory usage, the collection usage threshold should not
be supported.

The collection usage threshold is designed for monitoring the memory usage
after the Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming
memory space. The collection usage could also be monitored
by the polling and threshold notification mechanism
described above for the

usage threshold

in a similar fashion.

A Java virtual machine has one or more instances of the
implementation class of this interface. An instance
implementing this interface is
an

MXBean

that can be obtained by calling
the

ManagementFactory.getMemoryPoolMXBeans()

method or
from the

platform MBeanServer

method.

The

ObjectName

for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
a memory pool within an

MBeanServer

is:

java.lang:type=MemoryPool

,name=

pool's name

It can be obtained by calling the

PlatformManagedObject.getObjectName()

method.

- Memory usage
- Peak memory usage
- Usage Threshold
- Collection Usage Threshold

(only supported by some

garbage-collected

memory pools)

1. Memory Usage

The

getUsage()

method provides an estimate
of the current usage of a memory pool.
For a garbage-collected memory pool, the amount of used memory
includes the memory occupied by all objects in the pool
including both

reachable

and

unreachable

objects.

In general, this method is a lightweight operation for getting
an approximate memory usage. For some memory pools, for example,
when objects are not packed contiguously, this method may be
an expensive operation that requires some computation to determine
the current memory usage. An implementation should document when
this is the case.

2. Peak Memory Usage

The Java virtual machine maintains the peak memory usage of a memory
pool since the virtual machine was started or the peak was reset.
The peak memory usage is returned by the

getPeakUsage()

method
and reset by calling the

resetPeakUsage()

method.

3. Usage Threshold

Each memory pool has a manageable attribute
called the

usage threshold

which has a default value supplied
by the Java virtual machine. The default value is platform-dependent.
The usage threshold can be set via the

setUsageThreshold

method.
If the threshold is set to a positive value, the usage threshold crossing
checking is enabled in this memory pool.
If the usage threshold is set to zero, usage
threshold crossing checking on this memory pool is disabled.
The

isUsageThresholdSupported()

method can
be used to determine if this functionality is supported.

A Java virtual machine performs usage threshold crossing checking on a
memory pool basis at its best appropriate time, typically,
at garbage collection time.
Each memory pool maintains a

usage threshold count

that will get incremented
every time when the Java virtual machine
detects that the memory pool usage is crossing the threshold.

This manageable usage threshold attribute is designed for monitoring the
increasing trend of memory usage with low overhead.
Usage threshold may not be appropriate for some memory pools.
For example, a generational garbage collector, a common garbage collection
algorithm used in many Java virtual machine implementations,
manages two or more generations segregating objects by age.
Most of the objects are allocated in
the

youngest generation

(say a nursery memory pool).
The nursery memory pool is designed to be filled up and
collecting the nursery memory pool will free most of its memory space
since it is expected to contain mostly short-lived objects
and mostly are unreachable at garbage collection time.
In this case, it is more appropriate for the nursery memory pool
not to support a usage threshold. In addition,
if the cost of an object allocation
in one memory pool is very low (for example, just atomic pointer exchange),
the Java virtual machine would probably not support the usage threshold
for that memory pool since the overhead in comparing the usage with
the threshold is higher than the cost of object allocation.

The memory usage of the system can be monitored using

polling

or

threshold notification

mechanisms.

- Polling

An application can continuously monitor its memory usage
by calling either the

getUsage()

method for all
memory pools or the

isUsageThresholdExceeded()

method
for those memory pools that support a usage threshold.
Below is example code that has a thread dedicated for
task distribution and processing. At every interval,
it will determine if it should receive and process new tasks based
on its memory usage. If the memory usage exceeds its usage threshold,
it will redistribute all outstanding tasks to other VMs and
stop receiving new tasks until the memory usage returns
below its usage threshold.

```java
// Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);
....

boolean lowMemory = false;
while (true) {
if (pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded()) {
// potential low memory, so redistribute tasks to other VMs
lowMemory = true;
redistributeTasks();
// stop receiving new tasks
stopReceivingTasks();
} else {
if (lowMemory) {
// resume receiving tasks
lowMemory = false;
resumeReceivingTasks();
}
// processing outstanding task
...
}
// sleep for sometime
try {
Thread.sleep(sometime);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
...
}
}
```

The above example does not differentiate the case where
the memory usage has temporarily dropped below the usage threshold
from the case where the memory usage remains above the threshold
between two iterations. The usage threshold count returned by
the

getUsageThresholdCount()

method
can be used to determine
if the memory usage has returned below the threshold
between two polls.

Below shows another example that takes some action if a
memory pool is under low memory and ignores the memory usage
changes during the action processing time.

```java
// Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold which determines if
// the application will take some action under low memory condition.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

int prevCrossingCount = 0;
while (true) {
// A busy loop to detect when the memory usage
// has exceeded the threshold.
while (!pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded() ||
pool.getUsageThresholdCount() == prevCrossingCount) {
try {
Thread.sleep(sometime)
} catch (InterruptException e) {
....
}
}

// Do some processing such as check for memory usage
// and issue a warning
....

// Gets the current threshold count. The busy loop will then
// ignore any crossing of threshold happens during the processing.
prevCrossingCount = pool.getUsageThresholdCount();
}
```
- Usage Threshold Notifications

Usage threshold notification will be emitted by

MemoryMXBean

.
When the Java virtual machine detects that the memory usage of
a memory pool has reached or exceeded the usage threshold
the virtual machine will trigger the

MemoryMXBean

to emit an

usage threshold exceeded notification

.
Another usage threshold exceeded notification will not be
generated until the usage has fallen below the threshold and
then exceeded it again.

Below is an example code implementing the same logic as the
first example above but using the usage threshold notification
mechanism to detect low memory conditions instead of polling.
In this example code, upon receiving notification, the notification
listener notifies another thread to perform the actual action
such as to redistribute outstanding tasks, stop receiving tasks,
or resume receiving tasks.
The

handleNotification

method should be designed to
do a very minimal amount of work and return without delay to avoid
causing delay in delivering subsequent notifications. Time-consuming
actions should be performed by a separate thread.
The notification listener may be invoked by multiple threads
concurrently; so the tasks performed by the listener
should be properly synchronized.

```java
class MyListener implements javax.management.NotificationListener {
public void handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback) {
String notifType = notification.getType();
if (notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED)) {
// potential low memory, notify another thread
// to redistribute outstanding tasks to other VMs
// and stop receiving new tasks.
lowMemory = true;
notifyAnotherThread(lowMemory);
}
}
}

// Register MyListener with MemoryMXBean
MemoryMXBean mbean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();
NotificationEmitter emitter = (NotificationEmitter) mbean;
MyListener listener = new MyListener();
emitter.addNotificationListener(listener, null, null);

// Assume this pool supports a usage threshold.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

// Usage threshold detection is enabled and notification will be
// handled by MyListener. Continue for other processing.
....
```

There is no guarantee about when the

MemoryMXBean

will emit
a threshold notification and when the notification will be delivered.
When a notification listener is invoked, the memory usage of
the memory pool may have crossed the usage threshold more
than once.
The

MemoryNotificationInfo.getCount()

method returns the number
of times that the memory usage has crossed the usage threshold
at the point in time when the notification was constructed.
It can be compared with the current usage threshold count returned
by the

getUsageThresholdCount()

method to determine if
such situation has occurred.

4. Collection Usage Threshold

Collection usage threshold is a manageable attribute only applicable
to some garbage-collected memory pools.
After a Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming memory
space by recycling unused objects in a memory pool at garbage collection
time, some number of bytes in the memory pools that are garbaged
collected will still be in use. The collection usage threshold
allows a value to be set for this number of bytes such
that if the threshold is exceeded,
a

collection usage threshold exceeded notification

will be emitted by the

MemoryMXBean

.
In addition, the

collection usage threshold count

will then be incremented.

The

isCollectionUsageThresholdSupported()

method can
be used to determine if this functionality is supported.

A Java virtual machine performs collection usage threshold checking
on a memory pool basis. This checking is enabled if the collection
usage threshold is set to a positive value.
If the collection usage threshold is set to zero, this checking
is disabled on this memory pool. Default value is zero.
The Java virtual machine performs the collection usage threshold
checking at garbage collection time.

Some garbage-collected memory pools may
choose not to support the collection usage threshold. For example,
a memory pool is only managed by a continuous concurrent garbage
collector. Objects can be allocated in this memory pool by some thread
while the unused objects are reclaimed by the concurrent garbage
collector simultaneously. Unless there is a well-defined
garbage collection time which is the best appropriate time
to check the memory usage, the collection usage threshold should not
be supported.

The collection usage threshold is designed for monitoring the memory usage
after the Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming
memory space. The collection usage could also be monitored
by the polling and threshold notification mechanism
described above for the

usage threshold

in a similar fashion.

Another usage threshold exceeded notification will not be
generated until the usage has fallen below the threshold and
then exceeded it again.

Below is an example code implementing the same logic as the
first example above but using the usage threshold notification
mechanism to detect low memory conditions instead of polling.
In this example code, upon receiving notification, the notification
listener notifies another thread to perform the actual action
such as to redistribute outstanding tasks, stop receiving tasks,
or resume receiving tasks.
The

handleNotification

method should be designed to
do a very minimal amount of work and return without delay to avoid
causing delay in delivering subsequent notifications. Time-consuming
actions should be performed by a separate thread.
The notification listener may be invoked by multiple threads
concurrently; so the tasks performed by the listener
should be properly synchronized.

```java
class MyListener implements javax.management.NotificationListener {
public void handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback) {
String notifType = notification.getType();
if (notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED)) {
// potential low memory, notify another thread
// to redistribute outstanding tasks to other VMs
// and stop receiving new tasks.
lowMemory = true;
notifyAnotherThread(lowMemory);
}
}
}

// Register MyListener with MemoryMXBean
MemoryMXBean mbean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();
NotificationEmitter emitter = (NotificationEmitter) mbean;
MyListener listener = new MyListener();
emitter.addNotificationListener(listener, null, null);

// Assume this pool supports a usage threshold.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

// Usage threshold detection is enabled and notification will be
// handled by MyListener. Continue for other processing.
....
```

There is no guarantee about when the

MemoryMXBean

will emit
a threshold notification and when the notification will be delivered.
When a notification listener is invoked, the memory usage of
the memory pool may have crossed the usage threshold more
than once.
The

MemoryNotificationInfo.getCount()

method returns the number
of times that the memory usage has crossed the usage threshold
at the point in time when the notification was constructed.
It can be compared with the current usage threshold count returned
by the

getUsageThresholdCount()

method to determine if
such situation has occurred.

4. Collection Usage Threshold

Collection usage threshold is a manageable attribute only applicable
to some garbage-collected memory pools.
After a Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming memory
space by recycling unused objects in a memory pool at garbage collection
time, some number of bytes in the memory pools that are garbaged
collected will still be in use. The collection usage threshold
allows a value to be set for this number of bytes such
that if the threshold is exceeded,
a

collection usage threshold exceeded notification

will be emitted by the

MemoryMXBean

.
In addition, the

collection usage threshold count

will then be incremented.

The

isCollectionUsageThresholdSupported()

method can
be used to determine if this functionality is supported.

A Java virtual machine performs collection usage threshold checking
on a memory pool basis. This checking is enabled if the collection
usage threshold is set to a positive value.
If the collection usage threshold is set to zero, this checking
is disabled on this memory pool. Default value is zero.
The Java virtual machine performs the collection usage threshold
checking at garbage collection time.

Some garbage-collected memory pools may
choose not to support the collection usage threshold. For example,
a memory pool is only managed by a continuous concurrent garbage
collector. Objects can be allocated in this memory pool by some thread
while the unused objects are reclaimed by the concurrent garbage
collector simultaneously. Unless there is a well-defined
garbage collection time which is the best appropriate time
to check the memory usage, the collection usage threshold should not
be supported.

The collection usage threshold is designed for monitoring the memory usage
after the Java virtual machine has expended effort in reclaiming
memory space. The collection usage could also be monitored
by the polling and threshold notification mechanism
described above for the

usage threshold

in a similar fashion.

The memory usage of the system can be monitored using

polling

or

threshold notification

mechanisms.

- Polling

An application can continuously monitor its memory usage
by calling either the

getUsage()

method for all
memory pools or the

isUsageThresholdExceeded()

method
for those memory pools that support a usage threshold.
Below is example code that has a thread dedicated for
task distribution and processing. At every interval,
it will determine if it should receive and process new tasks based
on its memory usage. If the memory usage exceeds its usage threshold,
it will redistribute all outstanding tasks to other VMs and
stop receiving new tasks until the memory usage returns
below its usage threshold.

```java
// Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);
....

boolean lowMemory = false;
while (true) {
if (pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded()) {
// potential low memory, so redistribute tasks to other VMs
lowMemory = true;
redistributeTasks();
// stop receiving new tasks
stopReceivingTasks();
} else {
if (lowMemory) {
// resume receiving tasks
lowMemory = false;
resumeReceivingTasks();
}
// processing outstanding task
...
}
// sleep for sometime
try {
Thread.sleep(sometime);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
...
}
}
```

The above example does not differentiate the case where
the memory usage has temporarily dropped below the usage threshold
from the case where the memory usage remains above the threshold
between two iterations. The usage threshold count returned by
the

getUsageThresholdCount()

method
can be used to determine
if the memory usage has returned below the threshold
between two polls.

Below shows another example that takes some action if a
memory pool is under low memory and ignores the memory usage
changes during the action processing time.

```java
// Assume the usage threshold is supported for this pool.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold which determines if
// the application will take some action under low memory condition.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

int prevCrossingCount = 0;
while (true) {
// A busy loop to detect when the memory usage
// has exceeded the threshold.
while (!pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded() ||
pool.getUsageThresholdCount() == prevCrossingCount) {
try {
Thread.sleep(sometime)
} catch (InterruptException e) {
....
}
}

// Do some processing such as check for memory usage
// and issue a warning
....

// Gets the current threshold count. The busy loop will then
// ignore any crossing of threshold happens during the processing.
prevCrossingCount = pool.getUsageThresholdCount();
}
```
- Usage Threshold Notifications

Usage threshold notification will be emitted by

MemoryMXBean

.
When the Java virtual machine detects that the memory usage of
a memory pool has reached or exceeded the usage threshold
the virtual machine will trigger the

MemoryMXBean

to emit an

usage threshold exceeded notification

.
Another usage threshold exceeded notification will not be
generated until the usage has fallen below the threshold and
then exceeded it again.

should be properly synchronized.

public void handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback) {
String notifType = notification.getType();
if (notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED)) {
// potential low memory, notify another thread
// to redistribute outstanding tasks to other VMs
// and stop receiving new tasks.
lowMemory = true;
notifyAnotherThread(lowMemory);
}
}
}

// Register MyListener with MemoryMXBean
MemoryMXBean mbean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();
NotificationEmitter emitter = (NotificationEmitter) mbean;
MyListener listener = new MyListener();
emitter.addNotificationListener(listener, null, null);

// Assume this pool supports a usage threshold.
// Set the threshold to myThreshold above which no new tasks
// should be taken.
pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);

#### 4. Collection Usage Threshold

The

getCollectionUsageThreshold

```java
long getCollectionUsageThreshold()
```

Returns the collection usage threshold value of this memory pool
in bytes. The default value is zero. The collection usage
threshold can be changed via the

setCollectionUsageThreshold

method.

**Returns:** the collection usage threshold of this memory pool in bytes.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this memory pool
does not support a collection usage threshold.
**See Also:** isCollectionUsageThresholdSupported()

#### getCollectionUsageThreshold

long getCollectionUsageThreshold()

Returns the collection usage threshold value of this memory pool
in bytes. The default value is zero. The collection usage
threshold can be changed via the

setCollectionUsageThreshold

method.

setCollectionUsageThreshold

```java
void setCollectionUsageThreshold​(long threshold)
```

Sets the collection usage threshold of this memory pool to
the given

threshold

value.
When this threshold is set to positive, the Java virtual machine
will check the memory usage at its best appropriate time after it has
expended effort in recycling unused objects in this memory pool.

The collection usage threshold crossing checking is enabled
in this memory pool if the threshold is set to a positive value.
The collection usage threshold crossing checking is disabled
if it is set to zero.

**Parameters:** threshold

- the new collection usage threshold value in bytes.
Must be non-negative.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

threshold

is negative
or greater than the maximum amount of memory for
this memory pool if defined.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this memory pool
does not support a collection usage threshold.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager
exists and the caller does not have
ManagementPermission("control").

isCollectionUsageThresholdExceeded

```java
boolean isCollectionUsageThresholdExceeded()
```

Tests if the memory usage of this memory pool after
the most recent collection on which the Java virtual
machine has expended effort has reached or
exceeded its collection usage threshold.
This method does not request the Java virtual
machine to perform any garbage collection other than its normal
automatic memory management.

**Returns:** true

if the memory usage of this memory pool
reaches or exceeds the collection usage threshold value
in the most recent collection;

false

otherwise.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this memory pool
does not support a usage threshold.
