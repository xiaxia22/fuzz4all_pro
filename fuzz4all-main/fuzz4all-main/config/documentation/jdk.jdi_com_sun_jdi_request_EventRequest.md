# Interface EventRequest

**Source:** `jdk.jdi\com\sun\jdi\request\EventRequest.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
EventRequest

extends
Mirror
```

Represents a request for notification of an event. Examples include

BreakpointRequest

and

ExceptionRequest

.
When an event occurs for which an enabled request is present,
an

EventSet

will
be placed on the

EventQueue

.
The collection of existing event requests is
managed by the

EventRequestManager

.

The number of events generated for an event request can be controlled
through filters. Filters provide additional constraints that an event
must satisfy before it is placed on the event queue. Multiple filters can
be used by making multiple calls to filter addition methods such as

ExceptionRequest.addClassFilter(java.lang.String classPattern)

.
Filters are added to an event one at a time only while the event is
disabled. Multiple filters are applied with CUT-OFF AND, in the order
it was added to the request. Only events that satisfy all filters are
placed in the event queue.

The set of available filters is dependent on the event request,
some examples of filters are:

- Thread filters allow control over the thread for which events are
generated.

Class filters allow control over the class in which the event
occurs.

Instance filters allow control over the instance in which
the event occurs.

Count filters allow control over the number of times an event
is reported.

Filters can dramatically improve debugger performance by reducing the
amount of event traffic sent from the target VM to the debugger VM.

Any method on

EventRequest

which
takes

EventRequest

as an parameter may throw

VMDisconnectedException

if the target VM is
disconnected and the

VMDisconnectEvent

has been or is
available to be read from the

EventQueue

.

Any method on

EventRequest

which
takes

EventRequest

as an parameter may throw

VMOutOfMemoryException

if the target VM has run out of memory.

### Field Details

#### static final int SUSPEND_NONE

Suspend no threads when the event occurs

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final int SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD

Suspend only the thread which generated the event when the event occurs

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final int SUSPEND_ALL

Suspend all threads when the event occurs

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### boolean isEnabled()

Determines if this event request is currently enabled.

**Returns:**
- true

if enabled;

false

otherwise.

---

#### void setEnabled​(boolean val)

Enables or disables this event request. While this event request is
disabled, the event request will be ignored and the target VM
will not be stopped if any of its threads reaches the
event request. Disabled event requests still exist,
and are included in event request lists such as

EventRequestManager.breakpointRequests()

.

**Parameters:**
- val

-

true

if the event request is to be enabled;

false

otherwise.

**Throws:**
- InvalidRequestStateException

- if this request
has been deleted.
- IllegalThreadStateException

- if this is a StepRequest,

val

is

true

, and the
thread named in the request has died or is not yet started.

---

#### void enable()

Same as

setEnabled(true)

.

**Throws:**
- InvalidRequestStateException

- if this request
has been deleted.
- IllegalThreadStateException

- if this is a StepRequest
and the thread named in the request has died or is not yet started.

---

#### void disable()

Same as

setEnabled(false)

.

**Throws:**
- InvalidRequestStateException

- if this request
has been deleted.

---

#### void addCountFilter​(int count)

Limit the requested event to be reported at most once after a
given number of occurrences. The event is not reported
the first

count - 1

times this filter is reached.
To request a one-off event, call this method with a count of 1.

Once the count reaches 0, any subsequent filters in this request
are applied. If none of those filters cause the event to be
suppressed, the event is reported. Otherwise, the event is not
reported. In either case subsequent events are never reported for
this request.

**Parameters:**
- count

- the number of ocurrences before generating an event.

**Throws:**
- InvalidRequestStateException

- if this request is currently
enabled or has been deleted.
Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

count

is less than one.

---

#### void setSuspendPolicy​(int policy)

Determines the threads to suspend when the requested event occurs
in the target VM. Use

SUSPEND_ALL

to suspend all
threads in the target VM (the default). Use

SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD

to suspend only the thread which generated the event. Use

SUSPEND_NONE

to suspend no threads.

Thread suspensions through events have the same functionality
as explicitly requested suspensions. See

ThreadReference.suspend()

and

VirtualMachine.suspend()

for details.

**Parameters:**
- policy

- the selected suspend policy.

**Throws:**
- InvalidRequestStateException

- if this request is currently
enabled or has been deleted.
Suspend policy may only be set in disabled requests.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the policy argument
contains an illegal value.

---

#### int suspendPolicy()

Returns a value which describes the threads to suspend when the
requested event occurs in the target VM.
The returned value is

SUSPEND_ALL

,

SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD

, or

SUSPEND_NONE

.

**Returns:**
- the current suspend mode for this request

---

#### void putProperty​(
Object
key,

Object
value)

Add an arbitrary key/value "property" to this request.
The property can be used by a client of the JDI to
associate application information with the request;
These client-set properties are not used internally
by the JDI.

The

get/putProperty

methods provide access to
a small per-instance map. This is

not

to be confused
with

Properties

.

If value is null this method will remove the property.

**See Also:**
- getProperty(java.lang.Object)

---

#### Object
getProperty​(
Object
key)

Returns the value of the property with the specified key. Only
properties added with

putProperty(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)

will return
a non-null value.

**Returns:**
- the value of this property or null

**See Also:**
- putProperty(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)

void disable()

Same as

setEnabled(false)

.

addCountFilter

```java
void addCountFilter​(int count)
```

Limit the requested event to be reported at most once after a
given number of occurrences. The event is not reported
the first

count - 1

times this filter is reached.
To request a one-off event, call this method with a count of 1.

Once the count reaches 0, any subsequent filters in this request
are applied. If none of those filters cause the event to be
suppressed, the event is reported. Otherwise, the event is not
reported. In either case subsequent events are never reported for
this request.

**Parameters:** count

- the number of ocurrences before generating an event.
**Throws:** InvalidRequestStateException

- if this request is currently
enabled or has been deleted.
Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

count

is less than one.

setSuspendPolicy

```java
void setSuspendPolicy​(int policy)
```

Determines the threads to suspend when the requested event occurs
in the target VM. Use

SUSPEND_ALL

to suspend all
threads in the target VM (the default). Use

SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD

to suspend only the thread which generated the event. Use

SUSPEND_NONE

to suspend no threads.

Thread suspensions through events have the same functionality
as explicitly requested suspensions. See

ThreadReference.suspend()

and

VirtualMachine.suspend()

for details.

**Parameters:** policy

- the selected suspend policy.
**Throws:** InvalidRequestStateException

- if this request is currently
enabled or has been deleted.
Suspend policy may only be set in disabled requests.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the policy argument
contains an illegal value.

putProperty

```java
void putProperty​(
Object
key,

Object
value)
```

Add an arbitrary key/value "property" to this request.
The property can be used by a client of the JDI to
associate application information with the request;
These client-set properties are not used internally
by the JDI.

The

get/putProperty

methods provide access to
a small per-instance map. This is

not

to be confused
with

Properties

.

If value is null this method will remove the property.

**See Also:** getProperty(java.lang.Object)
