# Class ColorModel

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
ColorModel

extends
Object

implements
Transparency
```

The

ColorModel

abstract class encapsulates the
methods for translating a pixel value to color components
(for example, red, green, and blue) and an alpha component.
In order to render an image to the screen, a printer, or another
image, pixel values must be converted to color and alpha components.
As arguments to or return values from methods of this class,
pixels are represented as 32-bit ints or as arrays of primitive types.
The number, order, and interpretation of color components for a

ColorModel

is specified by its

ColorSpace

.
A

ColorModel

used with pixel data that does not include
alpha information treats all pixels as opaque, which is an alpha
value of 1.0.

This

ColorModel

class supports two representations of
pixel values. A pixel value can be a single 32-bit int or an
array of primitive types. The Java(tm) Platform 1.0 and 1.1 APIs
represented pixels as single

byte

or single

int

values. For purposes of the

ColorModel

class, pixel value arguments were passed as ints. The Java(tm) 2
Platform API introduced additional classes for representing images.
With

BufferedImage

or

RenderedImage

objects, based on

Raster

and

SampleModel

classes, pixel
values might not be conveniently representable as a single int.
Consequently,

ColorModel

now has methods that accept
pixel values represented as arrays of primitive types. The primitive
type used by a particular

ColorModel

object is called its
transfer type.

ColorModel

objects used with images for which pixel values
are not conveniently representable as a single int throw an

IllegalArgumentException

when methods taking a single int pixel
argument are called. Subclasses of

ColorModel

must
specify the conditions under which this occurs. This does not
occur with

DirectColorModel

or

IndexColorModel

objects.

Currently, the transfer types supported by the Java 2D(tm) API are
DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_INT,
DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT, and DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE.
Most rendering operations will perform much faster when using ColorModels
and images based on the first three of these types. In addition, some
image filtering operations are not supported for ColorModels and
images based on the latter three types.
The transfer type for a particular

ColorModel

object is
specified when the object is created, either explicitly or by default.
All subclasses of

ColorModel

must specify what the
possible transfer types are and how the number of elements in the
primitive arrays representing pixels is determined.

For

BufferedImages

, the transfer type of its

Raster

and of the

Raster

object's

SampleModel

(available from the

getTransferType

methods of these classes) must match that
of the

ColorModel

. The number of elements in an array
representing a pixel for the

Raster

and

SampleModel

(available from the

getNumDataElements

methods of these classes) must match
that of the

ColorModel

.

The algorithm used to convert from pixel values to color and alpha
components varies by subclass. For example, there is not necessarily
a one-to-one correspondence between samples obtained from the

SampleModel

of a

BufferedImage

object's

Raster

and color/alpha components. Even when
there is such a correspondence, the number of bits in a sample is not
necessarily the same as the number of bits in the corresponding color/alpha
component. Each subclass must specify how the translation from
pixel values to color/alpha components is done.

Methods in the

ColorModel

class use two different
representations of color and alpha components - a normalized form
and an unnormalized form. In the normalized form, each component is a

float

value between some minimum and maximum values. For
the alpha component, the minimum is 0.0 and the maximum is 1.0. For
color components the minimum and maximum values for each component can
be obtained from the

ColorSpace

object. These values
will often be 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g. normalized component values for the
default sRGB color space range from 0.0 to 1.0), but some color spaces
have component values with different upper and lower limits. These
limits can be obtained using the

getMinValue

and

getMaxValue

methods of the

ColorSpace

class. Normalized color component values are not premultiplied.
All

ColorModels

must support the normalized form.

In the unnormalized
form, each component is an unsigned integral value between 0 and
2

n

- 1, where n is the number of significant bits for a
particular component. If pixel values for a particular

ColorModel

represent color samples premultiplied by
the alpha sample, unnormalized color component values are
also premultiplied. The unnormalized form is used only with instances
of

ColorModel

whose

ColorSpace

has minimum
component values of 0.0 for all components and maximum values of
1.0 for all components.
The unnormalized form for color and alpha components can be a convenient
representation for

ColorModels

whose normalized component
values all lie
between 0.0 and 1.0. In such cases the integral value 0 maps to 0.0 and
the value 2

n

- 1 maps to 1.0. In other cases, such as
when the normalized component values can be either negative or positive,
the unnormalized form is not convenient. Such

ColorModel

objects throw an

IllegalArgumentException

when methods involving
an unnormalized argument are called. Subclasses of

ColorModel

must specify the conditions under which this occurs.

### Field Details

#### protected int pixel_bits

The total number of bits in the pixel.

---

#### protected int transferType

Data type of the array used to represent pixel values.

---

### Constructor Details

#### public ColorModel​(int bits)

Constructs a

ColorModel

that translates pixels of the
specified number of bits to color/alpha components. The color
space is the default RGB

ColorSpace

, which is sRGB.
Pixel values are assumed to include alpha information. If color
and alpha information are represented in the pixel value as
separate spatial bands, the color bands are assumed not to be
premultiplied with the alpha value. The transparency type is
java.awt.Transparency.TRANSLUCENT. The transfer type will be the
smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT,
or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel
(or DataBuffer.TYPE_UNDEFINED if bits is greater
than 32). Since this constructor has no information about the
number of bits per color and alpha component, any subclass calling
this constructor should override any method that requires this
information.

**Parameters:**
- bits

- the number of bits of a pixel

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the number
of bits in

bits

is less than 1

#### protected ColorModel​(int pixel_bits,
int[] bits,

ColorSpace
cspace,
boolean hasAlpha,
boolean isAlphaPremultiplied,
int transparency,
int transferType)

Constructs a

ColorModel

that translates pixel values
to color/alpha components. Color components will be in the
specified

ColorSpace

.

pixel_bits

is the
number of bits in the pixel values. The bits array
specifies the number of significant bits per color and alpha component.
Its length should be the number of components in the

ColorSpace

if there is no alpha information in the
pixel values, or one more than this number if there is alpha
information.

hasAlpha

indicates whether or not alpha
information is present. The

boolean

isAlphaPremultiplied

specifies how to interpret pixel
values in which color and alpha information are represented as
separate spatial bands. If the

boolean

is

true

, color samples are assumed to have been
multiplied by the alpha sample. The

transparency

specifies what alpha values can be represented by this color model.
The transfer type is the type of primitive array used to represent
pixel values. Note that the bits array contains the number of
significant bits per color/alpha component after the translation
from pixel values. For example, for an

IndexColorModel

with

pixel_bits

equal to
16, the bits array might have four elements with each element set
to 8.

**Parameters:**
- pixel_bits

- the number of bits in the pixel values
- bits

- array that specifies the number of significant bits
per color and alpha component
- cspace

- the specified

ColorSpace

if alpha information is present;

false

otherwise
- isAlphaPremultiplied

-

true

if color samples are
assumed to be premultiplied by the alpha samples;

false

otherwise

- the type of the array used to represent pixel
values

**Throws:**

- if the length of
the bit array is less than the number of color or alpha
components in this

ColorModel

, or if the
transparency is not a valid value.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the sum of the number
of bits in

bits

is less than 1 or if
any of the elements in

bits

is less than 0.

### Method Details

#### public static
ColorModel
getRGBdefault()

Returns a

DirectColorModel

that describes the default
format for integer RGB values used in many of the methods in the
AWT image interfaces for the convenience of the programmer.
The color space is the default

The format for the RGB values is an integer with 8 bits
each of alpha, red, green, and blue color components ordered
correspondingly from the most significant byte to the least
significant byte, as in: 0xAARRGGBB. Color components are
not premultiplied by the alpha component. This format does not
necessarily represent the native or the most efficient

ColorModel

- a

DirectColorModel

object describing default
RGB values.

#### public float[] getNormalizedComponents​(int[] components,
int offset,
float[] normComponents,
int normOffset)

Returns an array of all of the color/alpha components in normalized
form, given an unnormalized component array. Unnormalized components
are unsigned integral values between 0 and 2

n

- 1, where
n is the number of bits for a particular component. Normalized
components are float values between a per component minimum and
maximum specified by the

ColorSpace

object for this

ColorModel

. An

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown if color component values for this

ColorModel

are not conveniently representable in the
unnormalized form. If the

normComponents

array is

null

, a new array
will be allocated. The

normComponents

array
will be returned. Color/alpha components are stored in the

normComponents

array starting at

normOffset

(even if the array is allocated by this
method). An

ColorModel

```

The

ColorModel

abstract class encapsulates the
methods for translating a pixel value to color components
(for example, red, green, and blue) and an alpha component.
In order to render an image to the screen, a printer, or another
image, pixel values must be converted to color and alpha components.
As arguments to or return values from methods of this class,
pixels are represented as 32-bit ints or as arrays of primitive types.
The number, order, and interpretation of color components for a

ColorModel

is specified by its

ColorSpace

.
A

ColorModel

used with pixel data that does not include
alpha information treats all pixels as opaque, which is an alpha
value of 1.0.

This

ColorModel

class supports two representations of
pixel values. A pixel value can be a single 32-bit int or an
array of primitive types. The Java(tm) Platform 1.0 and 1.1 APIs
represented pixels as single

byte

or single

int

values. For purposes of the

ColorModel

class, pixel value arguments were passed as ints. The Java(tm) 2
Platform API introduced additional classes for representing images.
With

BufferedImage

or

RenderedImage

objects, based on

Raster

and

SampleModel

classes, pixel
values might not be conveniently representable as a single int.
Consequently,

ColorModel

now has methods that accept
pixel values represented as arrays of primitive types. The primitive
type used by a particular

ColorModel

object is called its
transfer type.

ColorModel

objects used with images for which pixel values
are not conveniently representable as a single int throw an

IllegalArgumentException

when methods taking a single int pixel
argument are called. Subclasses of

ColorModel

must
specify the conditions under which this occurs. This does not
occur with

DirectColorModel

or

IndexColorModel

objects.

Currently, the transfer types supported by the Java 2D(tm) API are
DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_INT,
DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT, and DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE.
Most rendering operations will perform much faster when using ColorModels
and images based on the first three of these types. In addition, some
image filtering operations are not supported for ColorModels and
images based on the latter three types.
The transfer type for a particular

ColorModel

object is
specified when the object is created, either explicitly or by default.
All subclasses of

ColorModel

must specify what the
possible transfer types are and how the number of elements in the
primitive arrays representing pixels is determined.

For

BufferedImages

, the transfer type of its

Raster

and of the

Raster

object's

SampleModel

(available from the

getTransferType

methods of these classes) must match that
of the

ColorModel

. The number of elements in an array
representing a pixel for the

Raster

and

SampleModel

(available from the

getNumDataElements

methods of these classes) must match
that of the

ColorModel

.

The algorithm used to convert from pixel values to color and alpha
components varies by subclass. For example, there is not necessarily
a one-to-one correspondence between samples obtained from the

SampleModel

of a

BufferedImage

object's

Raster

and color/alpha components. Even when
there is such a correspondence, the number of bits in a sample is not
necessarily the same as the number of bits in the corresponding color/alpha
component. Each subclass must specify how the translation from
pixel values to color/alpha components is done.

Methods in the

ColorModel

class use two different
representations of color and alpha components - a normalized form
and an unnormalized form. In the normalized form, each component is a

float

value between some minimum and maximum values. For
the alpha component, the minimum is 0.0 and the maximum is 1.0. For
color components the minimum and maximum values for each component can
be obtained from the

ColorSpace

object. These values
will often be 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g. normalized component values for the
default sRGB color space range from 0.0 to 1.0), but some color spaces
have component values with different upper and lower limits. These
limits can be obtained using the

getMinValue

and

getMaxValue

methods of the

ColorSpace

class. Normalized color component values are not premultiplied.
All

ColorModels

must support the normalized form.

In the unnormalized
form, each component is an unsigned integral value between 0 and
2

n

- 1, where n is the number of significant bits for a
particular component. If pixel values for a particular

ColorModel

represent color samples premultiplied by
the alpha sample, unnormalized color component values are
also premultiplied. The unnormalized form is used only with instances
of

ColorModel

whose

ColorSpace

has minimum
component values of 0.0 for all components and maximum values of
1.0 for all components.
The unnormalized form for color and alpha components can be a convenient
representation for

ColorModels

whose normalized component
values all lie
between 0.0 and 1.0. In such cases the integral value 0 maps to 0.0 and
the value 2

n

- 1 maps to 1.0. In other cases, such as
when the normalized component values can be either negative or positive,
the unnormalized form is not convenient. Such

ColorModel

objects throw an

IllegalArgumentException

when methods involving
an unnormalized argument are called. Subclasses of

ColorModel

must specify the conditions under which this occurs.

images based on the latter three types.
The transfer type for a particular

ColorModel

object is
specified when the object is created, either explicitly or by default.
All subclasses of

ColorModel

must specify what the
possible transfer types are and how the number of elements in the
primitive arrays representing pixels is determined.

For

BufferedImages

, the transfer type of its

Raster

and of the

Raster

object's

SampleModel

(available from the

getTransferType

methods of these classes) must match that
of the

ColorModel

. The number of elements in an array
representing a pixel for the

Raster

and

SampleModel

(available from the

getNumDataElements

methods of these classes) must match
that of the

ColorModel

.

The algorithm used to convert from pixel values to color and alpha
components varies by subclass. For example, there is not necessarily
a one-to-one correspondence between samples obtained from the

SampleModel

of a

BufferedImage

object's

Raster

and color/alpha components. Even when
there is such a correspondence, the number of bits in a sample is not
necessarily the same as the number of bits in the corresponding color/alpha
component. Each subclass must specify how the translation from
pixel values to color/alpha components is done.

Methods in the

ColorModel

class use two different
representations of color and alpha components - a normalized form
and an unnormalized form. In the normalized form, each component is a

float

value between some minimum and maximum values. For
the alpha component, the minimum is 0.0 and the maximum is 1.0. For
color components the minimum and maximum values for each component can
be obtained from the

ColorSpace

object. These values
will often be 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g. normalized component values for the
default sRGB color space range from 0.0 to 1.0), but some color spaces
have component values with different upper and lower limits. These
limits can be obtained using the

getMinValue

and

getMaxValue

methods of the

ColorSpace

class. Normalized color component values are not premultiplied.
All

ColorModels

must support the normalized form.

In the unnormalized
form, each component is an unsigned integral value between 0 and
2

n

- 1, where n is the number of significant bits for a
particular component. If pixel values for a particular

ColorModel

represent color samples premultiplied by
the alpha sample, unnormalized color component values are
also premultiplied. The unnormalized form is used only with instances
of

ColorModel

whose

ColorSpace

has minimum
component values of 0.0 for all components and maximum values of
1.0 for all components.
The unnormalized form for color and alpha components can be a convenient
representation for

ColorModels

whose normalized component
values all lie
between 0.0 and 1.0. In such cases the integral value 0 maps to 0.0 and
the value 2

n

- 1 maps to 1.0. In other cases, such as
when the normalized component values can be either negative or positive,
the unnormalized form is not convenient. Such

ColorModel

objects throw an

IllegalArgumentException

when methods involving
an unnormalized argument are called. Subclasses of

ColorModel

must specify the conditions under which this occurs.

This

ColorModel

class supports two representations of
pixel values. A pixel value can be a single 32-bit int or an
array of primitive types. The Java(tm) Platform 1.0 and 1.1 APIs
represented pixels as single

byte

or single

int

values. For purposes of the

ColorModel

class, pixel value arguments were passed as ints. The Java(tm) 2
Platform API introduced additional classes for representing images.
With

BufferedImage

or

RenderedImage

objects, based on

Raster

and

SampleModel

classes, pixel
values might not be conveniently representable as a single int.
Consequently,

ColorModel

now has methods that accept
pixel values represented as arrays of primitive types. The primitive
type used by a particular

ColorModel

object is called its
transfer type.

ColorModel

objects used with images for which pixel values
are not conveniently representable as a single int throw an

IllegalArgumentException

when methods taking a single int pixel
argument are called. Subclasses of

ColorModel

must
specify the conditions under which this occurs. This does not
occur with

DirectColorModel

or

IndexColorModel

objects.

Currently, the transfer types supported by the Java 2D(tm) API are
DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_INT,
DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT, and DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE.
Most rendering operations will perform much faster when using ColorModels
and images based on the first three of these types. In addition, some
image filtering operations are not supported for ColorModels and
images based on the latter three types.

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- pixel_bits

```java
protected int pixel_bits
```

The total number of bits in the pixel.

- transferType

```java
protected int transferType
```

Data type of the array used to represent pixel values.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- ColorModel

```java
public ColorModel​(int bits)
```

Constructs a

ColorModel

that translates pixels of the
specified number of bits to color/alpha components. The color
space is the default RGB

ColorSpace

, which is sRGB.
Pixel values are assumed to include alpha information. If color
and alpha information are represented in the pixel value as
separate spatial bands, the color bands are assumed not to be
premultiplied with the alpha value. The transparency type is
java.awt.Transparency.TRANSLUCENT. The transfer type will be the
smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT,
or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel
(or DataBuffer.TYPE_UNDEFINED if bits is greater
than 32). Since this constructor has no information about the
number of bits per color and alpha component, any subclass calling
this constructor should override any method that requires this
information.

**Parameters:** bits

- the number of bits of a pixel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the number
of bits in

bits

is less than 1

- ColorModel

```java
protected ColorModel​(int pixel_bits,
int[] bits,

ColorSpace
cspace,
boolean hasAlpha,
boolean isAlphaPremultiplied,
int transparency,
int transferType)
```

Constructs a

ColorModel

that translates pixel values
to color/alpha components. Color components will be in the
specified

ColorSpace

.

pixel_bits

is the
number of bits in the pixel values. The bits array
specifies the number of significant bits per color and alpha component.
Its length should be the number of components in the

ColorSpace

if there is no alpha information in the
pixel values, or one more than this number if there is alpha
information.

hasAlpha

indicates whether or not alpha
information is present. The

boolean

isAlphaPremultiplied

specifies how to interpret pixel
values in which color and alpha information are represented as
separate spatial bands. If the

boolean

is

true

, color samples are assumed to have been
multiplied by the alpha sample. The

transparency

specifies what alpha values can be represented by this color model.
The transfer type is the type of primitive array used to represent
pixel values. Note that the bits array contains the number of
significant bits per color/alpha component after the translation
from pixel values. For example, for an

IndexColorModel

with

pixel_bits

equal to
16, the bits array might have four elements with each element set
to 8.

**Parameters:** pixel_bits

- the number of bits in the pixel values
**Parameters:** bits

- array that specifies the number of significant bits
per color and alpha component
**Parameters:** cspace

- the specified

ColorSpace
**Parameters:** hasAlpha

-

true

if alpha information is present;

false

otherwise
**Parameters:** isAlphaPremultiplied

-

true

if color samples are
assumed to be premultiplied by the alpha samples;

false

otherwise
**Parameters:** transparency

- what alpha values can be represented by this
color model
**Parameters:** transferType

- the type of the array used to represent pixel
values
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the length of
the bit array is less than the number of color or alpha
components in this

ColorModel

, or if the
transparency is not a valid value.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the sum of the number
of bits in

bits

is less than 1 or if
any of the elements in

bits

is less than 0.

The format for the RGB values is an integer with 8 bits
each of alpha, red, green, and blue color components ordered
correspondingly from the most significant byte to the least
significant byte, as in: 0xAARRGGBB. Color components are
not premultiplied by the alpha component. This format does not
necessarily represent the native or the most efficient

ColorModel

for a particular device or for all images.
It is merely used as a common color model format.

. Typically, this order reflects the name
of the color space type. For example, for TYPE_RGB, index 0
corresponds to red, index 1 to green, and index 2
to blue. If this

ColorModel

supports alpha, the alpha
component corresponds to the index following the last color
component.

**Parameters:** componentIdx

- the index of the color/alpha component
**Returns:** the number of bits for the color/alpha component at the
specified index.
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Returns the blue color component for the specified pixel, scaled
from 0 to 255 in the default RGB

ColorSpace

, sRGB. A
color conversion is done if necessary. The pixel value is
specified by an array of data elements of type transferType passed
in as an object reference. The returned value is a non
pre-multiplied value. For example, if the alpha is premultiplied,
this method divides it out before returning the value. If the
alpha value is 0, the blue value will be 0. If

inData

is not a primitive array of type transferType,
a

ClassCastException

is thrown. An

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

is
thrown if

inData

is not large enough to hold a pixel
value for this

method has been deprecated.
Subclasses that override

finalize

in order to perform cleanup
should be modified to use alternative cleanup mechanisms and
to remove the overriding

finalize

method.
When overriding the

finalize

method, its implementation must explicitly
ensure that

super.finalize()

is invoked as described in

Object.finalize()

.

- getAlphaRaster

```java
public
WritableRaster
getAlphaRaster​(
WritableRaster
raster)
```

Returns a

Raster

representing the alpha channel of an
image, extracted from the input

Raster

, provided that
pixel values of this

ColorModel

represent color and
alpha information as separate spatial bands (e.g.

ComponentColorModel

and

DirectColorModel

).
This method assumes that

Raster

objects associated
with such a

ColorModel

store the alpha band, if
present, as the last band of image data. Returns

null

if there is no separate spatial alpha channel associated with this

ColorModel

. If this is an

IndexColorModel

which has alpha in the lookup table,
this method will return

null

since
there is no spatially discrete alpha channel.
This method will create a new

Raster

(but will share
the data array).
Since

ColorModel

is an abstract class, any instance
is an instance of a subclass. Subclasses must override this
method to get any behavior other than returning

null

because the implementation in this abstract class returns

null

.

**Parameters:** raster

Constructor Detail

- ColorModel

```java
public ColorModel​(int bits)
```

Constructs a

ColorModel

that translates pixels of the
specified number of bits to color/alpha components. The color
space is the default RGB

ColorSpace

, which is sRGB.
Pixel values are assumed to include alpha information. If color
and alpha information are represented in the pixel value as
separate spatial bands, the color bands are assumed not to be
premultiplied with the alpha value. The transparency type is
java.awt.Transparency.TRANSLUCENT. The transfer type will be the
smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT,
or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel
(or DataBuffer.TYPE_UNDEFINED if bits is greater
than 32). Since this constructor has no information about the
number of bits per color and alpha component, any subclass calling
this constructor should override any method that requires this
information.

**Parameters:** bits

- the number of bits of a pixel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the number
of bits in

The transfer type is the type of primitive array used to represent
pixel values. Note that the bits array contains the number of
significant bits per color/alpha component after the translation
from pixel values. For example, for an

IndexColorModel

with

pixel_bits

Method Detail

- getRGBdefault

```java
public static
ColorModel
getRGBdefault()
```

Returns a

DirectColorModel

that describes the default
format for integer RGB values used in many of the methods in the
AWT image interfaces for the convenience of the programmer.
The color space is the default

The format for the RGB values is an integer with 8 bits
each of alpha, red, green, and blue color components ordered
correspondingly from the most significant byte to the least
significant byte, as in: 0xAARRGGBB. Color components are
not premultiplied by the alpha component. This format does not
necessarily represent the native or the most efficient

ColorModel

for a particular device or for all images.
It is merely used as a common color model format.

).
This method assumes that

Raster

objects associated
with such a

ColorModel

store the alpha band, if
present, as the last band of image data. Returns

null

if there is no separate spatial alpha channel associated with this

ColorModel

IndexColorModel

which has alpha in the lookup table,
this method will return

null

since
there is no spatially discrete alpha channel.
This method will create a new

Raster

(but will share
the data array).
Since

ColorModel

is an abstract class, any instance
is an instance of a subclass. Subclasses must override this
method to get any behavior other than returning

null

because the implementation in this abstract class returns

null

.

#### Method Detail

getRGBdefault

```java
public static
ColorModel
getRGBdefault()
```

Returns a

DirectColorModel

that describes the default
format for integer RGB values used in many of the methods in the
AWT image interfaces for the convenience of the programmer.
The color space is the default

ColorSpace

, sRGB.
The format for the RGB values is an integer with 8 bits
each of alpha, red, green, and blue color components ordered
correspondingly from the most significant byte to the least
significant byte, as in: 0xAARRGGBB. Color components are
not premultiplied by the alpha component. This format does not
necessarily represent the native or the most efficient

ColorModel

for a particular device or for all images.
It is merely used as a common color model format.

**Returns:** a

DirectColorModel

object describing default
RGB values.

finalize

```java
@Deprecated
(
since
="9")
public void finalize()
```

Deprecated.

The

finalize

method has been deprecated.
Subclasses that override

finalize

in order to perform cleanup
should be modified to use alternative cleanup mechanisms and
to remove the overriding

finalize

method.
When overriding the

finalize

method, its implementation must explicitly
ensure that

super.finalize()

is invoked as described in

Object.finalize()

.
See the specification for

Object.finalize()

for further
information about migration options.

Disposes of system resources associated with this

ColorModel

once this

ColorModel

is no
longer referenced.

**Overrides:** finalize

in class

Object
**See Also:** WeakReference

,

#### finalize

@Deprecated

(

since

="9")
public void finalize()

Disposes of system resources associated with this

ColorModel

once this

ColorModel

is no
longer referenced.

getAlphaRaster

```java
public
WritableRaster
getAlphaRaster​(
WritableRaster
raster)
```

Returns a

Raster

representing the alpha channel of an
image, extracted from the input

Raster

, provided that
pixel values of this

ColorModel

represent color and
alpha information as separate spatial bands (e.g.

ComponentColorModel

and

DirectColorModel

).
This method assumes that

Raster

objects associated
with such a

ColorModel

store the alpha band, if
present, as the last band of image data. Returns

null

if there is no separate spatial alpha channel associated with this

ColorModel

. If this is an

IndexColorModel

which has alpha in the lookup table,
this method will return

null

since
there is no spatially discrete alpha channel.
This method will create a new

Raster

(but will share
the data array).
Since

ColorModel

is an abstract class, any instance
is an instance of a subclass. Subclasses must override this
method to get any behavior other than returning

null

because the implementation in this abstract class returns

null

.

**Parameters:** raster

- the specified

Raster
**Returns:** a

Raster

representing the alpha channel of
an image, obtained from the specified

Raster

.
