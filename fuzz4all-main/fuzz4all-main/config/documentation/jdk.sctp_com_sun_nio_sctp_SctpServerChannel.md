# Class SctpServerChannel

**Source:** `jdk.sctp\com\sun\nio\sctp\SctpServerChannel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
SctpServerChannel

extends
AbstractSelectableChannel
```

A selectable channel for message-oriented listening SCTP sockets.

An

SCTPServerChannel

is created by invoking the

open

method of this class. A newly-created SCTP server
channel is open but not yet bound. An attempt to invoke the

accept

method of an unbound channel will cause the

NotYetBoundException

to be thrown. An SCTP server
channel can be bound by invoking one of the

bind

methods defined by this class.

Socket options are configured using the

setOption

method. SCTP server socket
channels support the following options:

Socket options

Option Name

Description

SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS

The maximum number of streams requested by the local endpoint during
association initialization

Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported. The list
of options supported is obtained by invoking the

supportedOptions

method.

SCTP server channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Closeable

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected SctpServerChannel​(
SelectorProvider
provider)

Initializes a new instance of this class.

**Parameters:**
- provider

- The selector provider for this channel

---

### Method Details

#### public static
SctpServerChannel
open()
throws
IOException

Opens an SCTP server channel.

The new channel's socket is initially unbound; it must be bound
to a specific address via one of its socket's

bind

methods before associations can be accepted.

**Returns:**
- A new SCTP server channel

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If the SCTP protocol is not supported
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpChannel
accept()
throws
IOException

Accepts an association on this channel's socket.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode then this method will
immediately return

null

if there are no pending associations.
Otherwise it will block indefinitely until a new association is
available or an I/O error occurs.

The

SCTPChannel

returned by this method, if any, will be in
blocking mode regardless of the blocking mode of this channel.

If a security manager has been installed then for each new
association this method verifies that the address and port number of the
assocaitions's remote peer are permitted by the security manager's

checkAccept

method.

**Returns:**
- The SCTP channel for the new association, or

null

if this channel is in non-blocking mode and no association is
available to be accepted

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the accept operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the accept operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- NotYetBoundException

- If this channel's socket has not yet been bound
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit
access to the remote peer of the new association
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public final
SctpServerChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local)
throws
IOException

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for associations.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
bind(local, 0);
```

**Parameters:**
- local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
- UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method
denies the operation
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpServerChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local,
int backlog)
throws
IOException

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for associations.

This method is used to establish a relationship between the socket
and the local address. Once a relationship is established then
the socket remains bound until the channel is closed. This relationship
may not necesssarily be with the address

local

as it may be
removed by

unbindAddress

, but there will always be
at least one local address bound to the channel's socket once an
invocation of this method successfully completes.

Once the channel's socket has been successfully bound to a specific
address, that is not automatically assigned, more addresses
may be bound to it using

bindAddress

, or removed
using

unbindAddress

.

The backlog parameter is the maximum number of pending associations
on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation specific. An
implementation may impose an implementation specific maximum length or
may choose to ignore the parameter. If the backlog parameter has the
value

0

, or a negative value, then an implementation specific
default is used.

**Parameters:**
- local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
- backlog

- The maximum number of pending associations

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
- UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method
denies the operation
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpServerChannel
bindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException

Adds the given address to the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown. The

bind

method takes a

SocketAddress

as its argument which typically
contains a port number as well as an address. Addresses subquently bound
using this method are simply addresses as the SCTP port number remains
the same for the lifetime of the channel.

New associations accepted after this method successfully completes
will be associated with the given address.

**Parameters:**
- address

- The address to add to the bound addresses for the socket

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
- AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound to the given address
- IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpServerChannel
unbindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException

Removes the given address from the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown.
If this method is invoked on a channel that does not have

address

as one of its bound addresses, or that has only one
local address bound to it, then this method throws

IllegalUnbindException

.
The initial address that the channel's socket is bound to using

bind

may be removed from the bound addresses for the
channel's socket.

New associations accepted after this method successfully completes
will not be associated with the given address.

**Parameters:**
- address

- The address to remove from the bound addresses for the socket

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
- IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
- IllegalUnbindException

- If the implementation does not support removing addresses from a
listening socket,

address

is not bound to the channel's
socket, or the channel has only one address bound to it
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
Set
<
SocketAddress
> getAllLocalAddresses()
throws
IOException

Returns all of the socket addresses to which this channel's socket is
bound.

**Returns:**
- All the socket addresses that this channel's socket is
bound to, or an empty

Set

Initializes a new instance of this class.

**Parameters:** provider

- The selector provider for this channel

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- open

```java
public static
SctpServerChannel
open()
throws
IOException
```

Opens an SCTP server channel.

The new channel's socket is initially unbound; it must be bound
to a specific address via one of its socket's

bind

methods before associations can be accepted.

**Returns:** A new SCTP server channel
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the SCTP protocol is not supported
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- accept

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
accept()
throws
IOException
```

Accepts an association on this channel's socket.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode then this method will
immediately return

null

if there are no pending associations.
Otherwise it will block indefinitely until a new association is
available or an I/O error occurs.

The

SCTPChannel

returned by this method, if any, will be in
blocking mode regardless of the blocking mode of this channel.

If a security manager has been installed then for each new
association this method verifies that the address and port number of the
assocaitions's remote peer are permitted by the security manager's

checkAccept

method.

**Returns:** The SCTP channel for the new association, or

null

if this channel is in non-blocking mode and no association is
available to be accepted
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the accept operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the accept operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel's socket has not yet been bound
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit
access to the remote peer of the new association
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public final
SctpServerChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local)
throws
IOException
```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for associations.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
bind(local, 0);
```

**Parameters:** local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method
denies the operation
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public abstract
SctpServerChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local,
int backlog)
throws
IOException
```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for associations.

This method is used to establish a relationship between the socket
and the local address. Once a relationship is established then
the socket remains bound until the channel is closed. This relationship
may not necesssarily be with the address

local

as it may be
removed by

unbindAddress

, but there will always be
at least one local address bound to the channel's socket once an
invocation of this method successfully completes.

Once the channel's socket has been successfully bound to a specific
address, that is not automatically assigned, more addresses
may be bound to it using

bindAddress

, or removed
using

unbindAddress

.

The backlog parameter is the maximum number of pending associations
on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation specific. An
implementation may impose an implementation specific maximum length or
may choose to ignore the parameter. If the backlog parameter has the
value

0

, or a negative value, then an implementation specific
default is used.

**Parameters:** local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
**Parameters:** backlog

- The maximum number of pending associations
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

bind

method takes a

SocketAddress

as its argument which typically
contains a port number as well as an address. Addresses subquently bound
using this method are simply addresses as the SCTP port number remains
the same for the lifetime of the channel.

New associations accepted after this method successfully completes
will be associated with the given address.

Method Detail

- open

```java
public static
SctpServerChannel
open()
throws
IOException
```

Opens an SCTP server channel.

The new channel's socket is initially unbound; it must be bound
to a specific address via one of its socket's

bind

methods before associations can be accepted.

**Returns:** A new SCTP server channel
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the SCTP protocol is not supported
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- accept

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
accept()
throws
IOException
```

Accepts an association on this channel's socket.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode then this method will
immediately return

null

if there are no pending associations.
Otherwise it will block indefinitely until a new association is
available or an I/O error occurs.

The

SCTPChannel

returned by this method, if any, will be in
blocking mode regardless of the blocking mode of this channel.

If a security manager has been installed then for each new
association this method verifies that the address and port number of the
assocaitions's remote peer are permitted by the security manager's

checkAccept

method.

**Returns:** The SCTP channel for the new association, or

null

if this channel is in non-blocking mode and no association is
available to be accepted
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the accept operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the accept operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel's socket has not yet been bound
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit
access to the remote peer of the new association
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public final
SctpServerChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local)
throws
IOException
```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for associations.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
bind(local, 0);
```

**Parameters:** local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method
denies the operation
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public abstract
SctpServerChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local,
int backlog)
throws
IOException
```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for associations.

This method is used to establish a relationship between the socket
and the local address. Once a relationship is established then
the socket remains bound until the channel is closed. This relationship
may not necesssarily be with the address

local

as it may be
removed by

unbindAddress

, but there will always be
at least one local address bound to the channel's socket once an
invocation of this method successfully completes.

Once the channel's socket has been successfully bound to a specific
address, that is not automatically assigned, more addresses
may be bound to it using

bindAddress

, or removed
using

unbindAddress

.

The backlog parameter is the maximum number of pending associations
on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation specific. An
implementation may impose an implementation specific maximum length or
may choose to ignore the parameter. If the backlog parameter has the
value

0

, or a negative value, then an implementation specific
default is used.

**Parameters:** local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
**Parameters:** backlog

- The maximum number of pending associations
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method
denies the operation
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bindAddress

```java
public abstract
SctpServerChannel
bindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException
```

Adds the given address to the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown. The

bind

method takes a

SocketAddress

as its argument which typically
contains a port number as well as an address. Addresses subquently bound
using this method are simply addresses as the SCTP port number remains
the same for the lifetime of the channel.

New associations accepted after this method successfully completes
will be associated with the given address.

**Parameters:** address

- The address to add to the bound addresses for the socket
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound to the given address
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- unbindAddress

```java
public abstract
SctpServerChannel
unbindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException
```

Removes the given address from the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown.
If this method is invoked on a channel that does not have

address

as one of its bound addresses, or that has only one
local address bound to it, then this method throws

IllegalUnbindException

.
The initial address that the channel's socket is bound to using

bind

may be removed from the bound addresses for the
channel's socket.

New associations accepted after this method successfully completes
will not be associated with the given address.

**Parameters:** address

- The address to remove from the bound addresses for the socket
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException
