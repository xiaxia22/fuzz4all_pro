# Class UndoManager

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\undo\UndoManager.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
UndoManager

extends
CompoundEdit

implements
UndoableEditListener
```

UndoManager

manages a list of

UndoableEdits

,
providing a way to undo or redo the appropriate edits. There are
two ways to add edits to an

UndoManager

. Add the edit
directly using the

addEdit

method, or add the

UndoManager

to a bean that supports

UndoableEditListener

. The following examples creates
an

UndoManager

and adds it as an

UndoableEditListener

to a

JTextField

:

```java
UndoManager undoManager = new UndoManager();
JTextField tf = ...;
tf.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(undoManager);
```

UndoManager

maintains an ordered list of edits and the
index of the next edit in that list. The index of the next edit is
either the size of the current list of edits, or if

undo

has been invoked it corresponds to the index
of the last significant edit that was undone. When

undo

is invoked all edits from the index of the next
edit to the last significant edit are undone, in reverse order.
For example, consider an

UndoManager

consisting of the
following edits:

A

b

c

D

. Edits with a
upper-case letter in bold are significant, those in lower-case
and italicized are insignificant.

Figure 1

Figure 1

As shown in

figure 1

, if

D

was just added, the
index of the next edit will be 4. Invoking

undo

results in invoking

undo

on

D

and setting the
index of the next edit to 3 (edit

c

), as shown in the following
figure.

Figure 2

Figure 2

The last significant edit is

A

, so that invoking

undo

again invokes

undo

on

c

,

b

, and

A

, in that order, setting the index of the
next edit to 0, as shown in the following figure.

Figure 3

Figure 3

Invoking

redo

results in invoking

redo

on
all edits between the index of the next edit and the next
significant edit (or the end of the list). Continuing with the previous
example if

redo

were invoked,

redo

would in
turn be invoked on

A

,

b

and

c

. In addition
the index of the next edit is set to 3 (as shown in

figure 2

).

Adding an edit to an

UndoManager

results in
removing all edits from the index of the next edit to the end of
the list. Continuing with the previous example, if a new edit,

e

, is added the edit

D

is removed from the list
(after having

die

invoked on it). If

c

is not
incorporated by the next edit
(

c

.addEdit(

e

)

returns true), or replaced
by it (

e

.replaceEdit(

c

)

returns true),
the new edit is added after

c

, as shown in the following
figure.

Figure 4

Figure 4

Once

end

has been invoked on an

UndoManager

the superclass behavior is used for all

UndoableEdit

methods. Refer to

CompoundEdit

for more details on its
behavior.

Unlike the rest of Swing, this class is thread safe.

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public UndoManager()

Creates a new

UndoManager

.

---

### Method Details

#### public int getLimit()

Returns the maximum number of edits this

UndoManager

holds. A value less than 0 indicates the number of edits is not
limited.

**Returns:**
- the maximum number of edits this

UndoManager

holds

**See Also:**
- addEdit(javax.swing.undo.UndoableEdit)

,

setLimit(int)

---

#### public void discardAllEdits()

Empties the undo manager sending each edit a

die

message
in the process.

**See Also:**
- AbstractUndoableEdit.die()

---

#### protected void trimForLimit()

Reduces the number of queued edits to a range of size limit,
centered on the index of the next edit.

---

#### protected void trimEdits​(int from,
int to)

Removes edits in the specified range.
All edits in the given range (inclusive, and in reverse order)
will have

die

invoked on them and are removed from
the list of edits. This has no effect if

from

>

to

.

**Parameters:**
- from

- the minimum index to remove
- to

- the maximum index to remove

---

#### public void setLimit​(int l)

Sets the maximum number of edits this

UndoManager

holds. A value less than 0 indicates the number of edits is not
limited. If edits need to be discarded to shrink the limit,

die

will be invoked on them in the reverse
order they were added. The default is 100.

**Parameters:**
- l

- the new limit

Figure 2

The last significant edit is

A

, so that invoking

undo

again invokes

undo

on

c

,

b

, and

A

, in that order, setting the index of the
next edit to 0, as shown in the following figure.

Figure 3

Figure 3

Invoking

redo

results in invoking

redo

on
all edits between the index of the next edit and the next
significant edit (or the end of the list). Continuing with the previous
example if

redo

were invoked,

redo

would in
turn be invoked on

A

,

b

and

c

. In addition
the index of the next edit is set to 3 (as shown in

figure 2

).

Adding an edit to an

UndoManager

results in
removing all edits from the index of the next edit to the end of
the list. Continuing with the previous example, if a new edit,

e

, is added the edit

D

is removed from the list
(after having

die

invoked on it). If

c

is not
incorporated by the next edit
(

c

.addEdit(

e

)

returns true), or replaced
by it (

e

.replaceEdit(

c

)

returns true),
the new edit is added after

c

, as shown in the following
figure.

- getLimit

```java
public int getLimit()
```

Returns the maximum number of edits this

UndoManager

holds. A value less than 0 indicates the number of edits is not

- trimEdits

```java
protected void trimEdits​(int from,
int to)
```

Removes edits in the specified range.
All edits in the given range (inclusive, and in reverse order)

- the minimum index to remove
**Parameters:** to

- the maximum index to remove

- setLimit

```java
public void setLimit​(int l)
```

Sets the maximum number of edits this

UndoManager
