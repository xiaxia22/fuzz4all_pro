is inside the boundary
of the

Shape

, as described by the

definition of insideness

.

**Specified by:**
- contains

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- p

- the specified

Point2D

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified

Point2D

is
inside the boundary of the

Shape

---

#### public boolean intersects​(
Rectangle2D
r)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified

Rectangle2D

.
The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the

Rectangle2D

and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the

Rectangle2D

does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Specified by:**
- intersects

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- r

- the specified

Rectangle2D

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

and
the interior of the specified

Rectangle2D

intersect, or are both highly likely to intersect and intersection
calculations would be too expensive to perform;

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- Shape.intersects(double, double, double, double)

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean contains​(
Rectangle2D
r)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the
specified

Rectangle2D

.
The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the

Rectangle2D

are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the

Rectangle2D

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Specified by:**
- contains

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- r

- The specified

Rectangle2D

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the

Rectangle2D

;

false

otherwise or, if the

Shape

contains the

Rectangle2D

and the

intersects

method returns

true

and the containment calculations would be too expensive to
perform.

**See Also:**
- Shape.contains(double, double, double, double)

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public
Rectangle
getBounds()

Returns an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses the

Shape

. Note that there is no guarantee that the
returned

Rectangle

is the smallest bounding box that
encloses the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies entirely within the indicated

Rectangle

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a
tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
representation.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then
it must be inside the returned

Rectangle

bounds object
according to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(x,y)

requires

bounds.contains(x,y)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(x,y)

does not imply

shape.contains(x,y)

**Specified by:**
- getBounds

in interface

Shape

**Returns:**
- an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses
the

Shape

.

**See Also:**
- Shape.getBounds2D()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public
PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at,
double flatness)

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the

Shape

object's boundary and provides access to a
flattened view of the outline of the

Shape

object's geometry.

Only SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, and SEG_CLOSE point types will
be returned by the iterator.

The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled
by the

flatness

parameter, which specifies the
maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed
curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments.
An optional

AffineTransform

can
be specified so that the coordinates returned in the iteration are
transformed accordingly.

**Specified by:**
- getPathIterator

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- at

- an optional

AffineTransform

to be applied to the
coordinates as they are returned in the iteration,
or

null

if untransformed coordinates are desired.
- flatness

- the maximum distance that the line segments used to
approximate the curved segments are allowed to deviate
from any point on the original curve

**Returns:**
- a

PathIterator

object that provides access to
the

Shape

object's flattened geometry.

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public
Object
clone()

Creates a new object of the same class and with the same
contents as this object.

**Overrides:**
- clone

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a clone of this instance.

**Throws:**
- OutOfMemoryError

- if there is not enough memory.

**See Also:**
- Cloneable

**Since:**

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the

Rectangle2D

and the

does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Specified by:** intersects

Shape
**Parameters:** r

- the specified

Rectangle2D
**Returns:** true

if the interior of the

Shape

and
the interior of the specified

Rectangle

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a
tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
representation.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then
it must be inside the returned

Rectangle

bounds object
according to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(x,y)

requires

bounds.contains(x,y)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(x,y)

does not imply

shape.contains(x,y)

getBounds

```java
public
Rectangle
getBounds()
```

Returns an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses the

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a
tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
representation.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

method, then
it must be inside the returned
