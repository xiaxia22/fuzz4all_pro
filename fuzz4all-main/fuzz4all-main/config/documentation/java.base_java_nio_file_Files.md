### Class Description

```java
public final class
Files

extends
Object
```

This class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on files,
directories, or other types of files.

In most cases, the methods defined here will delegate to the associated
file system provider to perform the file operations.

### Method Details

#### public static
InputStream
newInputStream​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException

Opens a file, returning an input stream to read from the file. The stream
will not be buffered, and is not required to support the

mark

or

reset

methods. The
stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Reading
commences at the beginning of the file. Whether the returned stream is

asynchronously closeable

and/or

interruptible

is highly
file system provider specific and therefore not specified.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
If no options are present then it is equivalent to opening the file with
the

READ

option. In addition to the

READ

option, an implementation may also support additional implementation
specific options.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to open
- options

- options specifying how the file is opened

**Returns:**
- a new input stream

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if an invalid combination of options is specified
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

---

#### public static
OutputStream
newOutputStream​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException

Opens or creates a file, returning an output stream that may be used to
write bytes to the file. The resulting stream will not be buffered. The
stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Whether
the returned stream is

asynchronously closeable

and/or

interruptible

is highly file system provider specific and
therefore not specified.

This method opens or creates a file in exactly the manner specified
by the

newByteChannel

method with the exception that the

READ

option may not be present in the array of options. If no options are
present then this method works as if the

CREATE

,

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

,
and

WRITE

options are present. In other
words, it opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't
exist, or initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to a size of

0

if it exists.

Usage Examples:

```java
Path path = ...

// truncate and overwrite an existing file, or create the file if
// it doesn't initially exist
OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(path);

// append to an existing file, fail if the file does not exist
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, APPEND);

// append to an existing file, create file if it doesn't initially exist
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, CREATE, APPEND);

// always create new file, failing if it already exists
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, CREATE_NEW);
```

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to open or create
- options

- options specifying how the file is opened

**Returns:**
- a new output stream

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

options

contains an invalid combination of options
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.

---

#### public static
SeekableByteChannel
newByteChannel​(
Path
path,

Set
<? extends
OpenOption
> options,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException

Opens or creates a file, returning a seekable byte channel to access the
file.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
The

READ

and

WRITE

options determine if the file should be
opened for reading and/or writing. If neither option (or the

APPEND

option) is present then the file is
opened for reading. By default reading or writing commence at the
beginning of the file.

In the addition to

READ

and

WRITE

, the following
options may be present:

Options

Option

Description

APPEND

If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
each invocation of the channel's

write

method first advances
the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
with the

READ

or

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

options.

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
for reading.

CREATE_NEW

If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
the file already exists or is a symbolic link. When creating a file the
check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it
does not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations.
This option is ignored when the file is opened only for reading.

CREATE

If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it
exists, otherwise a new file is created. This option is ignored if the

CREATE_NEW

option is also present or the file is opened only
for reading.

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

When this option is present then the implementation makes a

best effort

attempt to delete the file when closed by the

close

method. If the

close

method is not invoked then a

best effort

attempt is made to
delete the file when the Java virtual machine terminates.

SPARSE

When creating a new file this option is a

hint

that the
new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
a new file.

SYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

DSYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

An implementation may also support additional implementation specific
options.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when a new file is created.

In the case of the default provider, the returned seekable byte channel
is a

FileChannel

.

Usage Examples:

```java
Path path = ...

// open file for reading
ReadableByteChannel rbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(READ)));

// open file for writing to the end of an existing file, creating
// the file if it doesn't already exist
WritableByteChannel wbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE,APPEND));

// create file with initial permissions, opening it for both reading and writing
FileAttribute<Set<PosixFilePermission>> perms = ...
SeekableByteChannel sbc =
Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE_NEW,READ,WRITE), perms);
```

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to open or create
- options

- options specifying how the file is opened
- attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file

**Returns:**
- a new seekable byte channel

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the set contains an invalid combination of options
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported open option is specified or the array contains
attributes that cannot be set atomically when creating the file
- FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file of that name already exists and the

CREATE_NEW

option is specified

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the path if the file is
opened for reading. The

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the path
if the file is opened for writing. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.

**See Also:**
- FileChannel.open(Path,Set,FileAttribute[])

---

#### public static
SeekableByteChannel
newByteChannel​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException

Opens or creates a file, returning a seekable byte channel to access the
file.

This method opens or creates a file in exactly the manner specified
by the

newByteChannel

method.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to open or create
- options

- options specifying how the file is opened

**Returns:**
- a new seekable byte channel

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the set contains an invalid combination of options
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported open option is specified
- FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file of that name already exists and the

CREATE_NEW

option is specified

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the path if the file is
opened for reading. The

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the path
if the file is opened for writing. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.

**See Also:**
- FileChannel.open(Path,OpenOption[])

#### public static
DirectoryStream
<
Path
> newDirectoryStream​(
Path
dir)
throws
IOException

Opens a directory, returning a

DirectoryStream

to iterate over
all entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
stream's

iterator

are of type

Path

, each one representing an entry in the directory. The

Path

objects are obtained as if by

resolving

the
name of the directory entry against

dir

.

When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
stream's

close

method should be invoked after iteration is
completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.

When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
stream is a

SecureDirectoryStream

.

**Parameters:**
- dir

- the path to the directory

**Returns:**
- a new and open

DirectoryStream

object

**Throws:**
- NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

---

#### public static
DirectoryStream
<
Path
> newDirectoryStream​(
Path
dir,

String
glob)
throws
IOException

Opens a directory, returning a

DirectoryStream

to iterate over
the entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
stream's

iterator

are of type

Path

, each one representing an entry in the directory. The

Path

objects are obtained as if by

resolving

the
name of the directory entry against

dir

. The entries returned by
the iterator are filtered by matching the

String

representation
of their file names against the given

globbing

pattern.

For example, suppose we want to iterate over the files ending with
".java" in a directory:

```java
Path dir = ...
try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, "*.java")) {
:
}
```

The globbing pattern is specified by the

getPathMatcher

method.

When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
stream's

close

method should be invoked after iteration is
completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.

When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
stream is a

SecureDirectoryStream

.

**Parameters:**
- dir

- the path to the directory
- glob

- the glob pattern

**Returns:**
- a new and open

DirectoryStream

object

**Throws:**
- PatternSyntaxException

- if the pattern is invalid
- NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

---

#### public static
DirectoryStream
<
Path
> newDirectoryStream​(
Path
dir,

DirectoryStream.Filter
<? super
Path
> filter)
throws
IOException

Opens a directory, returning a

DirectoryStream

to iterate over
the entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
stream's

iterator

are of type

Path

, each one representing an entry in the directory. The

Path

objects are obtained as if by

resolving

the
name of the directory entry against

dir

. The entries returned by
the iterator are filtered by the given

filter

.

When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
stream's

close

method should be invoked after iteration is
completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.

Where the filter terminates due to an uncaught error or runtime
exception then it is propagated to the

hasNext

or

next

method. Where an

IOException

is thrown, it results in the

hasNext

or

next

method throwing a

DirectoryIteratorException

with the

IOException

as the cause.

When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
stream is a

SecureDirectoryStream

.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to iterate over the files in a directory that are
larger than 8K.

```java
DirectoryStream.Filter<Path> filter = new DirectoryStream.Filter<Path>() {
public boolean accept(Path file) throws IOException {
return (Files.size(file) > 8192L);
}
};
Path dir = ...
try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, filter)) {
:
}
```

**Parameters:**
- dir

- the path to the directory
- filter

- the directory stream filter

**Returns:**
- a new and open

DirectoryStream

object

**Throws:**
- NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

#### public static
Path
createFile​(
Path
path,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException

Creates a new and empty file, failing if the file already exists. The
check for the existence of the file and the creation of the new file if
it does not exist are a single operation that is atomic with respect to
all other filesystem activities that might affect the directory.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the file. Each attribute
is identified by its

name

. If more than one
attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but the last
occurrence is ignored.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to create
- attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file

**Returns:**
- the file

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the file
- FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file of that name already exists

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the parent directory does not exist
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the new file.

---

#### public static
Path
createDirectory​(
Path
dir,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException

Creates a new directory. The check for the existence of the file and the
creation of the directory if it does not exist are a single operation
that is atomic with respect to all other filesystem activities that might
affect the directory. The

createDirectories

method should be used where it is required to create all nonexistent
parent directories first.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the directory. Each
attribute is identified by its

name

. If more
than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but
the last occurrence is ignored.

**Parameters:**
- dir

- the directory to create
- attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the directory

**Returns:**
- the directory

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
- FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a directory could not otherwise be created because a file of
that name already exists

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the parent directory does not exist
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the new directory.

---

#### public static
Path
createDirectories​(
Path
dir,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException

Creates a directory by creating all nonexistent parent directories first.
Unlike the

createDirectory

method, an exception
is not thrown if the directory could not be created because it already
exists.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the nonexistent
directories. Each file attribute is identified by its

name

. If more than one attribute of the same name is
included in the array then all but the last occurrence is ignored.

If this method fails, then it may do so after creating some, but not
all, of the parent directories.

**Parameters:**
- dir

- the directory to create
- attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the directory

**Returns:**
- the directory

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
- FileAlreadyExistsException

- if

dir

exists but is not a directory

(optional specific
exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- in the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked prior to attempting to create a directory and
its

checkRead

is
invoked for each parent directory that is checked. If

dir

is not an absolute path then its

toAbsolutePath

may need to be invoked to get its absolute path.
This may invoke the security manager's

checkPropertyAccess

method to check access to the system property

user.dir

---

#### public static
Path
createTempFile​(
Path
dir,

String
prefix,

String
suffix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException

Creates a new empty file in the specified directory, using the given
prefix and suffix strings to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is associated with the same

FileSystem

as the given
directory.

The details as to how the name of the file is constructed is
implementation dependent and therefore not specified. Where possible
the

prefix

and

suffix

are used to construct candidate
names in the same manner as the

File.createTempFile(String,String,File)

method.

As with the

File.createTempFile

methods, this method is only
part of a temporary-file facility. Where used as a

work files

,
the resulting file may be opened using the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option so that the
file is deleted when the appropriate

close

method is invoked.
Alternatively, a

shutdown-hook

, or the

File.deleteOnExit()

mechanism may be used to delete the
file automatically.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the file. Each attribute
is identified by its

name

. If more than one
attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but the last
occurrence is ignored. When no file attributes are specified, then the
resulting file may have more restrictive access permissions to files
created by the

File.createTempFile(String,String,File)

method.

**Parameters:**
- dir

- the path to directory in which to create the file
- prefix

- the prefix string to be used in generating the file's name;
may be

null
- suffix

- the suffix string to be used in generating the file's name;
may be

null

, in which case "

.tmp

" is used
- attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file

**Returns:**
- the path to the newly created file that did not exist before
this method was invoked

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the prefix or suffix parameters cannot be used to generate
a candidate file name
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or

dir

does not exist
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file.

createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException

Creates an empty file in the default temporary-file directory, using
the given prefix and suffix to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is associated with the default

FileSystem

.

This method works in exactly the manner specified by the

method for
the case that the

dir

parameter is the temporary-file directory.

**Parameters:**
- prefix

- the prefix string to be used in generating the file's name;

installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file.

---

#### public static
Path
createTempDirectory​(
Path
dir,

String
prefix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException

Creates a new directory in the specified directory, using the given
prefix to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is associated
with the same

FileSystem

as the given directory.

The details as to how the name of the directory is constructed is
implementation dependent and therefore not specified. Where possible
the

prefix

is used to construct candidate names.

As with the

createTempFile

methods, this method is only
part of a temporary-file facility. A

shutdown-hook

, or the

File.deleteOnExit()

mechanism may be
used to delete the directory automatically.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the directory. Each
attribute is identified by its

name

. If more
than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but
the last occurrence is ignored.

---

#### public static
Path
createTempDirectory​(
String
prefix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException

Creates a new directory in the default temporary-file directory, using
the given prefix to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is
associated with the default

FileSystem

.

This method works in exactly the manner specified by

createTempDirectory(Path,String,FileAttribute[])

method for the case
that the

dir

parameter is the temporary-file directory.

**Parameters:**
- prefix

- the prefix string to be used in generating the directory's name;
may be

null
- attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the directory

**Returns:**
- the path to the newly created directory that did not exist before
this method was invoked

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the prefix cannot be used to generate a candidate directory name
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the temporary-file directory does not
exist
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access when creating the
directory.

---

#### public static
Path
createSymbolicLink​(
Path
link,

Path
target,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException

Creates a symbolic link to a target

(optional operation)

.

The

target

parameter is the target of the link. It may be an

absolute

or relative path and may not exist. When
the target is a relative path then file system operations on the resulting
link are relative to the path of the link.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

attributes

to set atomically when creating the link. Each attribute is
identified by its

name

. If more than one attribute
of the same name is included in the array then all but the last occurrence
is ignored.

Where symbolic links are supported, but the underlying

FileStore

does not support symbolic links, then this may fail with an

IOException

. Additionally, some operating systems may require that the
Java virtual machine be started with implementation specific privileges to
create symbolic links, in which case this method may throw

IOException

.

**Parameters:**
- link

- the path of the symbolic link to create
- target

- the target of the symbolic link
- attrs

- the array of attributes to set atomically when creating the
symbolic link

**Returns:**
- the path to the symbolic link

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation does not support symbolic links or the
array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically when
creating the symbolic link
- FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file with the name already exists

(optional specific
exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
is installed, it denies

LinkPermission

("symbolic")

or its

checkWrite

method denies write access to the path of the symbolic link.

---

#### public static
Path
createLink​(
Path
link,

Path
existing)
throws
IOException

Creates a new link (directory entry) for an existing file

(optional
operation)

.

The

link

parameter locates the directory entry to create.
The

existing

parameter is the path to an existing file. This
method creates a new directory entry for the file so that it can be
accessed using

link

as the path. On some file systems this is
known as creating a "hard link". Whether the file attributes are
maintained for the file or for each directory entry is file system
specific and therefore not specified. Typically, a file system requires
that all links (directory entries) for a file be on the same file system.
Furthermore, on some platforms, the Java virtual machine may require to
be started with implementation specific privileges to create hard links
or to create links to directories.

**Parameters:**
- link

- the link (directory entry) to create
- existing

- a path to an existing file

**Returns:**
- the path to the link (directory entry)

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation does not support adding an existing file
to a directory
- FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the entry could not otherwise be created because a file of
that name already exists

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
is installed, it denies

LinkPermission

("hard")

or its

checkWrite

method denies write access to either the link or the
existing file.

---

#### public static void delete​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException

Deletes a file.

An implementation may require to examine the file to determine if the
file is a directory. Consequently this method may not be atomic with respect
to other file system operations. If the file is a symbolic link then the
symbolic link itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted.

If the file is a directory then the directory must be empty. In some
implementations a directory has entries for special files or links that
are created when the directory is created. In such implementations a
directory is considered empty when only the special entries exist.
This method can be used with the

walkFileTree

method to delete a directory and all entries in the directory, or an
entire

file-tree

where required.

On some operating systems it may not be possible to remove a file when
it is open and in use by this Java virtual machine or other programs.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to delete

**Throws:**
- NoSuchFileException

- if the file does not exist

(optional specific exception)
- DirectoryNotEmptyException

- if the file is a directory and could not otherwise be deleted
because the directory is not empty

(optional specific
exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

SecurityManager.checkDelete(String)

method
is invoked to check delete access to the file

---

#### public static boolean deleteIfExists​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException

Deletes a file if it exists.

As with the

delete(Path)

method, an
implementation may need to examine the file to determine if the file is a
directory. Consequently this method may not be atomic with respect to
other file system operations. If the file is a symbolic link, then the
symbolic link itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted.

If the file is a directory then the directory must be empty. In some
implementations a directory has entries for special files or links that
are created when the directory is created. In such implementations a
directory is considered empty when only the special entries exist.

On some operating systems it may not be possible to remove a file when
it is open and in use by this Java virtual machine or other programs.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to delete

**Returns:**
- true

if the file was deleted by this method;

false

if the file could not be deleted because it did not
exist

**Throws:**
- DirectoryNotEmptyException

- if the file is a directory and could not otherwise be deleted
because the directory is not empty

(optional specific
exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

SecurityManager.checkDelete(String)

method
is invoked to check delete access to the file.

#### public static
Path
copy​(
Path
source,

Path
target,

CopyOption
... options)
throws
IOException

Copy a file to a target file.

This method copies a file to the target file with the

options

parameter specifying how the copy is performed. By default, the
copy fails if the target file already exists or is a symbolic link,
except if the source and target are the

same

file, in
which case the method completes without copying the file. File attributes
are not required to be copied to the target file. If symbolic links are
supported, and the file is a symbolic link, then the final target of the
link is copied. If the file is a directory then it creates an empty
directory in the target location (entries in the directory are not
copied). This method can be used with the

walkFileTree

method to copy a directory and all entries in the directory,
or an entire

file-tree

where required.

The

options

parameter may include any of the following:

Options

Option

Description

REPLACE_EXISTING

If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
the link, is replaced.

COPY_ATTRIBUTES

Attempts to copy the file attributes associated with this file to
the target file. The exact file attributes that are copied is platform
and file system dependent and therefore unspecified. Minimally, the

last-modified-time

is
copied to the target file if supported by both the source and target
file stores. Copying of file timestamps may result in precision
loss.

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

Symbolic links are not followed. If the file is a symbolic link,
then the symbolic link itself, not the target of the link, is copied.
It is implementation specific if file attributes can be copied to the
new link. In other words, the

COPY_ATTRIBUTES

option may be
ignored when copying a symbolic link.

An implementation of this interface may support additional
implementation specific options.

Copying a file is not an atomic operation. If an

IOException

is thrown, then it is possible that the target file is incomplete or some
of its file attributes have not been copied from the source file. When
the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified and the target file
exists, then the target file is replaced. The check for the existence of
the file and the creation of the new file may not be atomic with respect
to other file system activities.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to copy a file into a directory, giving it the same file
name as the source file:

```java
Path source = ...
Path newdir = ...
Files.copy(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName());
```

**Parameters:**
- source

- the path to the file to copy
- target

- the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
provider to the source path)
- options

- options specifying how the copy should be done

**Returns:**
- the path to the target file

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
- FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is not specified

(optional
specific exception)
- DirectoryNotEmptyException

- the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the source file, the

checkWrite

is invoked
to check write access to the target file. If a symbolic link is
copied the security manager is invoked to check

LinkPermission

("symbolic")

.

---

#### public static
Path
move​(
Path
source,

Path
target,

CopyOption
... options)
throws
IOException

Move or rename a file to a target file.

By default, this method attempts to move the file to the target
file, failing if the target file exists except if the source and
target are the

same

file, in which case this method
has no effect. If the file is a symbolic link then the symbolic link
itself, not the target of the link, is moved. This method may be
invoked to move an empty directory. In some implementations a directory
has entries for special files or links that are created when the
directory is created. In such implementations a directory is considered
empty when only the special entries exist. When invoked to move a
directory that is not empty then the directory is moved if it does not
require moving the entries in the directory. For example, renaming a
directory on the same

FileStore

will usually not require moving
the entries in the directory. When moving a directory requires that its
entries be moved then this method fails (by throwing an

IOException

). To move a

file tree

may involve copying rather
than moving directories and this can be done using the

copy

method in conjunction with the

Files.walkFileTree

utility method.

The

options

parameter may include any of the following:

Options

Option

Description

REPLACE_EXISTING

If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
the link, is replaced.

ATOMIC_MOVE

The move is performed as an atomic file system operation and all
other options are ignored. If the target file exists then it is
implementation specific if the existing file is replaced or this method
fails by throwing an

IOException

. If the move cannot be
performed as an atomic file system operation then

AtomicMoveNotSupportedException

is thrown. This can arise, for
example, when the target location is on a different

FileStore

and would require that the file be copied, or target location is
associated with a different provider to this object.

An implementation of this interface may support additional
implementation specific options.

Moving a file will copy the

last-modified-time

to the target
file if supported by both source and target file stores. Copying of file
timestamps may result in precision loss. An implementation may also
attempt to copy other file attributes but is not required to fail if the
file attributes cannot be copied. When the move is performed as
a non-atomic operation, and an

IOException

is thrown, then the
state of the files is not defined. The original file and the target file
may both exist, the target file may be incomplete or some of its file
attributes may not been copied from the original file.

Usage Examples:

Suppose we want to rename a file to "newname", keeping the file in the
same directory:

```java
Path source = ...
Files.move(source, source.resolveSibling("newname"));
```

Alternatively, suppose we want to move a file to new directory, keeping
the same file name, and replacing any existing file of that name in the
directory:

```java
Path source = ...
Path newdir = ...
Files.move(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName()), REPLACE_EXISTING);
```

**Parameters:**
- source

- the path to the file to move
- target

- the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
provider to the source path)
- options

- options specifying how the move should be done

**Returns:**
- the path to the target file

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
- FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is not specified

(optional
specific exception)
- DirectoryNotEmptyException

- the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory, or the
source is a non-empty directory containing entries that would
be required to be moved

(optional specific exceptions)
- AtomicMoveNotSupportedException

- if the options array contains the

ATOMIC_MOVE

option but
the file cannot be moved as an atomic file system operation.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to both the source and
target file.

#### public static
Path
readSymbolicLink​(
Path
link)
throws
IOException

Reads the target of a symbolic link

(optional operation)

.

If the file system supports

symbolic
links

then this method is used to read the target of the link, failing
if the file is not a symbolic link. The target of the link need not exist.
The returned

Path

object will be associated with the same file
system as

link

.

**Parameters:**
- link

- the path to the symbolic link

**Returns:**
- a

Path

object representing the target of the link

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation does not support symbolic links
- NotLinkException

- if the target could otherwise not be read because the file
is not a symbolic link

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
is installed, it checks that

FilePermission

has been
granted with the "

readlink

" action to read the link.

---

#### public static
FileStore
getFileStore​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException

Returns the

FileStore

representing the file store where a file
is located.

Once a reference to the

FileStore

is obtained it is
implementation specific if operations on the returned

FileStore

,
or

FileStoreAttributeView

objects obtained from it, continue
to depend on the existence of the file. In particular the behavior is not
defined for the case that the file is deleted or moved to a different
file store.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file

**Returns:**
- the file store where the file is stored

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file, and in
addition it checks

RuntimePermission

("getFileStoreAttributes")

---

#### public static boolean isSameFile​(
Path
path,

Path
path2)
throws
IOException

Tests if two paths locate the same file.

If both

Path

objects are

equal

then this method returns

true

without checking if the file exists.
If the two

Path

objects are associated with different providers
then this method returns

false

. Otherwise, this method checks if
both

Path

objects locate the same file, and depending on the
implementation, may require to open or access both files.

If the file system and files remain static, then this method implements
an equivalence relation for non-null

Paths

.

- It is

reflexive

: for

Path

f

,

isSameFile(f,f)

should return

true

.

It is

symmetric

: for two

Paths

f

and

g

,

isSameFile(f,g)

will equal

isSameFile(g,f)

.

It is

transitive

: for three

Paths

f

,

g

, and

h

, if

isSameFile(f,g)

returns

true

and

isSameFile(g,h)

returns

true

, then

isSameFile(f,h)

will return

true

.

**Parameters:**
- path

- one path to the file
- path2

- the other path

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, the two paths locate the same file

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to both files.

**See Also:**
- BasicFileAttributes.fileKey()

---

#### public static boolean isHidden​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException

Tells whether or not a file is considered

hidden

. The exact
definition of hidden is platform or provider dependent. On UNIX for
example a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with a
period character ('.'). On Windows a file is considered hidden if it
isn't a directory and the DOS

hidden

attribute is set.

Depending on the implementation this method may require to access
the file system to determine if the file is considered hidden.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to test

**Returns:**
- true

if the file is considered hidden

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

---

#### public static
String
probeContentType​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException

Probes the content type of a file.

This method uses the installed

FileTypeDetector

implementations
to probe the given file to determine its content type. Each file type
detector's

probeContentType

is
invoked, in turn, to probe the file type. If the file is recognized then
the content type is returned. If the file is not recognized by any of the
installed file type detectors then a system-default file type detector is
invoked to guess the content type.

A given invocation of the Java virtual machine maintains a system-wide
list of file type detectors. Installed file type detectors are loaded
using the service-provider loading facility defined by the

ServiceLoader

class. Installed file type detectors are loaded using the system class
loader. If the system class loader cannot be found then the platform class
loader is used. File type detectors are typically installed
by placing them in a JAR file on the application class path,
the JAR file contains a provider-configuration file
named

java.nio.file.spi.FileTypeDetector

in the resource directory

META-INF/services

, and the file lists one or more fully-qualified
names of concrete subclass of

FileTypeDetector

that have a zero
argument constructor. If the process of locating or instantiating the
installed file type detectors fails then an unspecified error is thrown.
The ordering that installed providers are located is implementation
specific.

The return value of this method is the string form of the value of a
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) content type as
defined by

RFC 2045:
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet
Message Bodies

. The string is guaranteed to be parsable according
to the grammar in the RFC.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to probe

**Returns:**
- The content type of the file, or

null

if the content
type cannot be determined

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- If a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
permission required by a file type detector implementation.

#### public static <V extends
FileAttributeView
> V getFileAttributeView​(
Path
path,

Class
<V> type,

LinkOption
... options)

Returns a file attribute view of a given type.

A file attribute view provides a read-only or updatable view of a
set of file attributes. This method is intended to be used where the file
attribute view defines type-safe methods to read or update the file
attributes. The

type

parameter is the type of the attribute view
required and the method returns an instance of that type if supported.
The

BasicFileAttributeView

type supports access to the basic
attributes of a file. Invoking this method to select a file attribute
view of that type will always return an instance of that class.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled by the resulting file attribute view for the case that the
file is a symbolic link. By default, symbolic links are followed. If the
option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then
symbolic links are not followed. This option is ignored by implementations
that do not support symbolic links.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want read or set a file's ACL, if supported:

```java
Path path = ...
AclFileAttributeView view = Files.getFileAttributeView(path, AclFileAttributeView.class);
if (view != null) {
List<AclEntry> acl = view.getAcl();
:
}
```

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file
- type

- the

Class

object corresponding to the file attribute view
- options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled

**Returns:**
- a file attribute view of the specified type, or

null

if
the attribute view type is not available

**Type Parameters:**
- V

- The

FileAttributeView

type

---

#### public static <A extends
BasicFileAttributes
> A readAttributes​(
Path
path,

Class
<A> type,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException

Reads a file's attributes as a bulk operation.

The

type

parameter is the type of the attributes required
and this method returns an instance of that type if supported. All
implementations support a basic set of file attributes and so invoking
this method with a

type

parameter of

BasicFileAttributes.class

will not throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is read. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

It is implementation specific if all file attributes are read as an
atomic operation with respect to other file system operations.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to read a file's attributes in bulk:

```java
Path path = ...
BasicFileAttributes attrs = Files.readAttributes(path, BasicFileAttributes.class);
```

Alternatively, suppose we want to read file's POSIX attributes without
following symbolic links:

```java
PosixFileAttributes attrs =
Files.readAttributes(path, PosixFileAttributes.class, NOFOLLOW_LINKS);
```

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file
- type

- the

Class

of the file attributes required
to read
- options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled

**Returns:**
- the file attributes

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if an attributes of the given type are not supported
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file. If this
method is invoked to read security sensitive attributes then the
security manager may be invoke to check for additional permissions.

**Type Parameters:**
- A

- The

BasicFileAttributes

type

---

#### public static
Path
setAttribute​(
Path
path,

String
attribute,

The

attribute

parameter identifies the attribute to be set
and takes the form:

[

view-name

:

]

attribute-name

where square brackets [...] delineate an optional component and the
character

':'

stands for itself.

view-name

is the

name

of a

FileAttributeView

that identifies a set of file attributes. If not
specified then it defaults to

"basic"

, the name of the file
attribute view that identifies the basic set of file attributes common to
many file systems.

attribute-name

is the name of the attribute
within the set.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is set. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to set the DOS "hidden" attribute:

```java
Path path = ...
Files.setAttribute(path, "dos:hidden", true);
```

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file
- attribute

- the attribute to set
- value

- the attribute value
- options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled

**Returns:**
- the given path

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the attribute view is not available
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the attribute name is not specified, or is not recognized, or
the attribute value is of the correct type but has an
inappropriate value
- ClassCastException

- if the attribute value is not of the expected type or is a
collection containing elements that are not of the expected
type
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file. If this method is invoked
to set security sensitive attributes then the security manager
may be invoked to check for additional permissions.

#### public static boolean isSymbolicLink​(
Path
path)

Tests whether a file is a symbolic link.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that the file is not a symbolic link then the file attributes can be
read with the

readAttributes

method and the file type tested with the

BasicFileAttributes.isSymbolicLink()

method.

**Parameters:**
- path

- The path to the file

**Returns:**

installed, its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file.

---

#### public static boolean isDirectory​(
Path
path,

LinkOption
... options)

Tests whether a file is a directory.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is read. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that the file is not a directory then the file attributes can be
read with the

readAttributes

method and the file type tested with the

BasicFileAttributes.isDirectory()

method.

**Parameters:**

installed, its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file.

---

#### public static boolean isRegularFile​(
Path
path,

LinkOption
... options)

Tests whether a file is a regular file with opaque content.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is read. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that the file is not a regular file then the file attributes can be
read with the

readAttributes

method and the file type tested with the

cannot be determined if the file is a regular file or not.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file.

---

#### public static
FileTime
getLastModifiedTime​(
Path
path,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException

Returns a file's last modified time.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is read. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file
- options

- BasicFileAttributes.lastModifiedTime()

---

#### public static
Path
setLastModifiedTime​(
Path
path,

FileTime
time)
throws
IOException

Updates a file's last modified time attribute. The file time is converted
to the epoch and precision supported by the file system. Converting from
finer to coarser granularities result in precision loss. The behavior of
this method when attempting to set the last modified time when it is not
supported by the file system or is outside the range supported by the
underlying file store is not defined. It may or not fail by throwing an

IOException

.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to set the last modified time to the current time:

```java
Path path = ...
FileTime now = FileTime.fromMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());
Files.setLastModifiedTime(path, now);
```

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file
- time

- the new last modified time

---

#### public static long size​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException

Returns the size of a file (in bytes). The size may differ from the
actual size on the file system due to compression, support for sparse
files, or other reasons. The size of files that are not

regular

files is implementation specific and
therefore unspecified.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file

**Returns:**
- the file size, in bytes

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file.

**See Also:**
- BasicFileAttributes.size()

---

#### public static boolean exists​(
Path
path,

LinkOption
... options)

Tests whether a file exists.

The

options

parameter may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated. If this
method indicates the file exists then there is no guarantee that a
subsequent access will succeed. Care should be taken when using this
method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to test
- options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
.

**Returns:**
- true

if the file exists;

false

if the file does
not exist or its existence cannot be determined.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

is invoked to check
read access to the file.

**See Also:**
- notExists(java.nio.file.Path, java.nio.file.LinkOption...)

---

#### public static boolean notExists​(
Path
path,

LinkOption
... options)

Tests whether the file located by this path does not exist. This method
is intended for cases where it is required to take action when it can be
confirmed that a file does not exist.

The

options

parameter may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Note that this method is not the complement of the

exists

method. Where it is not possible to determine if a file exists
or not then both methods return

false

. As with the

exists

method, the result of this method is immediately outdated. If this
method indicates the file does exist then there is no guarantee that a
subsequent attempt to create the file will succeed. Care should be taken
when using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to test
- options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled

**Returns:**
- true

if the file does not exist;

false

if the
file exists or its existence cannot be determined

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

is invoked to check
read access to the file.

---

#### public static boolean isReadable​(
Path
path)

Tests whether a file is readable. This method checks that a file exists
and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges that would
allow it open the file for reading. Depending on the implementation, this
method may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or
other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file.
Consequently, this method may not be atomic with respect to other file
system operations.

Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated, there is
no guarantee that a subsequent attempt to open the file for reading will
succeed (or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken
when using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to check

**Returns:**
- true

if the file exists and is readable;

false

if the file does not exist, read access would be denied because
the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
cannot be determined

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

is invoked to check read access to the file.

---

#### public static boolean isWritable​(
Path
path)

Tests whether a file is writable. This method checks that a file exists
and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges that would
allow it open the file for writing. Depending on the implementation, this
method may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or
other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file.
Consequently, this method may not be atomic with respect to other file
system operations.

Note that result of this method is immediately outdated, there is no
guarantee that a subsequent attempt to open the file for writing will
succeed (or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken
when using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to check

**Returns:**
- true

if the file exists and is writable;

false

if the file does not exist, write access would be denied because
the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
cannot be determined

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

is invoked to check write access to the file.

---

#### public static boolean isExecutable​(
Path
path)

Tests whether a file is executable. This method checks that a file exists
and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges to

execute

the file. The semantics may differ when checking
access to a directory. For example, on UNIX systems, checking for
execute access checks that the Java virtual machine has permission to
search the directory in order to access file or subdirectories.

Depending on the implementation, this method may require to read file
permissions, access control lists, or other file attributes in order to
check the effective access to the file. Consequently, this method may not
be atomic with respect to other file system operations.

Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated, there is
no guarantee that a subsequent attempt to execute the file will succeed
(or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken when
using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file to check

**Returns:**
- true

if the file exists and is executable;

false

if the file does not exist, execute access would be denied because
the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
cannot be determined

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkExec

is invoked to check execute access to the file.

---

#### public static
Path
walkFileTree​(
Path
start,

Set
<
FileVisitOption
> options,
int maxDepth,

FileVisitor
<? super
Path
> visitor)
throws
IOException

Walks a file tree.

This method walks a file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree traversal is

depth-first

with the given

FileVisitor

invoked for each file encountered. File tree traversal
completes when all accessible files in the tree have been visited, or a
visit method returns a result of

TERMINATE

. Where a visit method terminates due an

IOException

,
an uncaught error, or runtime exception, then the traversal is terminated
and the error or exception is propagated to the caller of this method.

For each file encountered this method attempts to read its

BasicFileAttributes

. If the file is not a
directory then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the file attributes. If the file attributes cannot be read,
due to an I/O exception, then the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with the I/O exception.

Where the file is a directory, and the directory could not be opened,
then the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with the I/O exception,
after which, the file tree walk continues, by default, at the next

sibling

of the directory.

Where the directory is opened successfully, then the entries in the
directory, and their

descendants

are visited. When all entries
have been visited, or an I/O error occurs during iteration of the
directory, then the directory is closed and the visitor's

postVisitDirectory

method is invoked.
The file tree walk then continues, by default, at the next

sibling

of the directory.

By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
method. If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then symbolic links are
followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
be read, then this method attempts to get the

BasicFileAttributes

of the link. If they can be read then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the attributes of the link (otherwise the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked as specified above).

If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then this method keeps
track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the

file-key

of directories,
or if file keys are not available, by invoking the

isSameFile

method to test if a directory is the same file as an
ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error, and the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with
an instance of

FileSystemLoopException

.

The

maxDepth

parameter is the maximum number of levels of
directories to visit. A value of

0

means that only the starting
file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of

MAX_VALUE

may be used to indicate that all
levels should be visited. The

visitFile

method is invoked for all
files, including directories, encountered at

maxDepth

, unless the
basic file attributes cannot be read, in which case the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked.

If a visitor returns a result of

null

then

NullPointerException

is thrown.

When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
(or directory), then it is ignored and the visitor is not invoked for
that file (or directory).

**Parameters:**
- start

- the starting file
- options

- options to configure the traversal
- maxDepth

- the maximum number of directory levels to visit
- visitor

- the file visitor to invoke for each file

**Returns:**
- the starting file

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the

maxDepth

parameter is negative
- SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
- IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown by a visitor method

---

#### public static
Path
walkFileTree​(
Path
start,

FileVisitor
<? super
Path
> visitor)
throws
IOException

Walks a file tree.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
walkFileTree(start, EnumSet.noneOf(FileVisitOption.class), Integer.MAX_VALUE, visitor)
```

In other words, it does not follow symbolic links, and visits all levels
of the file tree.

**Parameters:**
- start

- the starting file
- visitor

- the file visitor to invoke for each file

**Returns:**
- the starting file

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
- IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown by a visitor method

... options)
throws
IOException

Opens or creates a file for writing, returning a

BufferedWriter

that may be used to write text to the file in an efficient manner.
The

options

parameter specifies how the file is created or
opened. If no options are present then this method works as if the

CREATE

,

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

, and

WRITE

options are present. In other words, it
opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't exist, or
initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to
a size of

0

if it exists.

The

Writer

methods to write text throw

IOException

if the text cannot be encoded using the specified charset.

**Parameters:**

#### public static long copy​(
InputStream
in,

Path
target,

CopyOption
... options)
throws
IOException

Copies all bytes from an input stream to a file. On return, the input
stream will be at end of stream.

By default, the copy fails if the target file already exists or is a
symbolic link. If the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified, and the target file already exists,
then it is replaced if it is not a non-empty directory. If the target
file exists and is a symbolic link, then the symbolic link is replaced.
In this release, the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is the only option
required to be supported by this method. Additional options may be
supported in future releases.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to
the file, then it may do so after the target file has been created and
after some bytes have been read or written. Consequently the input
stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
It is strongly recommended that the input stream be promptly closed if an
I/O error occurs.

This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream (or
writing to the file). The behavior for the case that the input stream is

asynchronously closed

or the thread interrupted during the copy is
highly input stream and file system provider specific and therefore not
specified.

Usage example

: Suppose we want to capture a web page and save
it to a file:

```java
Path path = ...
URI u = URI.create("http://java.sun.com/");
try (InputStream in = u.toURL().openStream()) {
Files.copy(in, path);
}
```

**Parameters:**
- in

- the input stream to read from
- target

- the path to the file
- options

- options specifying how the copy should be done

**Returns:**
- the number of bytes read or written

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
- FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is not specified

(optional
specific exception)
- DirectoryNotEmptyException

- the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory

(optional specific exception)

*
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if

options

contains a copy option that is not supported
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file. Where the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified, the security
manager's

checkDelete

method is invoked to check that an existing file can be deleted.

---

#### public static long copy​(
Path
source,

OutputStream
out)
throws
IOException

Copies all bytes from a file to an output stream.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the file or writing to the output
stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or written.
Consequently the output stream may be in an inconsistent state. It is
strongly recommended that the output stream be promptly closed if an I/O
error occurs.

This method may block indefinitely writing to the output stream (or
reading from the file). The behavior for the case that the output stream
is

asynchronously closed

or the thread interrupted during the copy
is highly output stream and file system provider specific and therefore
not specified.

Note that if the given output stream is

Flushable

then its

flush

method may need to invoked
after this method completes so as to flush any buffered output.

**Parameters:**
- source

- the path to the file
- out

- the output stream to write to

**Returns:**
- the number of bytes read or written

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

---

#### public static byte[] readAllBytes​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException

Reads all the bytes from a file. The method ensures that the file is
closed when all bytes have been read or an I/O error, or other runtime
exception, is thrown.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read all bytes into a byte array. It is not intended for
reading in large files.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file

**Returns:**
- a byte array containing the bytes read from the file

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs reading from the stream
- OutOfMemoryError

- if an array of the required size cannot be allocated, for
example the file is larger that

2GB
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

---

#### public static
String
readString​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException

Reads all content from a file into a string, decoding from bytes to characters
using the

UTF-8

charset

.
The method ensures that the file is closed when all content have been read
or an I/O error, or other runtime exception, is thrown.

This method is equivalent to:

readString(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file

**Returns:**
- a String containing the content read from the file

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs reading from the file or a malformed or
unmappable byte sequence is read
- OutOfMemoryError

- if the file is extremely large, for example larger than

2GB
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

#### public static
String
readString​(
Path
path,

Charset
cs)
throws
IOException

Reads all characters from a file into a string, decoding from bytes to characters
using the specified

charset

.
The method ensures that the file is closed when all content have been read
or an I/O error, or other runtime exception, is thrown.

This method reads all content including the line separators in the middle
and/or at the end. The resulting string will contain line separators as they
appear in the file.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file
- cs

- the charset to use for decoding

**Returns:**
- a String containing the content read from the file

**Throws:**

#### public static
List
<
String
> readAllLines​(
Path
path,

Charset
cs)
throws
IOException

Read all lines from a file. This method ensures that the file is
closed when all bytes have been read or an I/O error, or other runtime
exception, is thrown. Bytes from the file are decoded into characters
using the specified charset.

This method recognizes the following as line terminators:

- \u000D

followed by

\u000A

,
CARRIAGE RETURN followed by LINE FEED
- \u000A

, LINE FEED
- \u000D

, CARRIAGE RETURN

Additional Unicode line terminators may be recognized in future
releases.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read all lines in a single operation. It is not intended
for reading in large files.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file
- cs

- the charset to use for decoding

**Returns:**
- the lines from the file as a

List

; whether the

List

is modifiable or not is implementation dependent and
therefore not specified

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs reading from the file or a malformed or
unmappable byte sequence is read
- SecurityException

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
Files.readAllLines(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
```

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file

**Returns:**
- the lines from the file as a

List

; whether the

#### public static
Path
write​(
Path
path,
byte[] bytes,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException

Writes bytes to a file. The

options

parameter specifies how
the file is created or opened. If no options are present then this method
works as if the

CREATE

,

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

, and

WRITE

options are present. In other words, it
opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't exist, or
initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to
a size of

0

. All bytes in the byte array are written to the file.
The method ensures that the file is closed when all bytes have been
written (or an I/O error or other runtime exception is thrown). If an I/O
error occurs then it may do so after the file has been created or
truncated, or after some bytes have been written to the file.

Usage example

: By default the method creates a new file or
overwrites an existing file. Suppose you instead want to append bytes
to an existing file:

```java
Path path = ...
byte[] bytes = ...
Files.write(path, bytes, StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
```

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file
- bytes

- the byte array with the bytes to write
- options

- options specifying how the file is opened

**Returns:**
- the path

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

options

contains an invalid combination of options
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs writing to or creating the file
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.

#### public static
Stream
<
Path
> list​(
Path
dir)
throws
IOException

Return a lazily populated

Stream

, the elements of
which are the entries in the directory. The listing is not recursive.

The elements of the stream are

Path

objects that are
obtained as if by

resolving

the name of the
directory entry against

dir

. Some file systems maintain special
links to the directory itself and the directory's parent directory.
Entries representing these links are not included.

The stream is

weakly consistent

. It is thread safe but does
not freeze the directory while iterating, so it may (or may not)
reflect updates to the directory that occur after returning from this
method.

The returned stream contains a reference to an open directory.
The directory is closed by closing the stream.

Operating on a closed stream behaves as if the end of stream
has been reached. Due to read-ahead, one or more elements may be
returned after the stream has been closed.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the directory
after this method has returned, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the method that caused
the access to take place.

**Parameters:**
- dir

- The path to the directory

**Returns:**
- The

Stream

describing the content of the
directory

**Throws:**
- NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when opening the directory
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

**See Also:**
- newDirectoryStream(Path)

**Since:**
- 1.8

**API Note:**
- This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open directory is closed
promptly after the stream's operations have completed.

#### public static
Stream
<
Path
> walk​(
Path
start,
int maxDepth,

FileVisitOption
... options)
throws
IOException

Return a

Stream

that is lazily populated with

Path

by walking the file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree is traversed

depth-first

, the elements in the stream
are

Path

objects that are obtained as if by

resolving

the relative path against

start

.

The

stream

walks the file tree as elements are consumed.
The

Stream

returned is guaranteed to have at least one
element, the starting file itself. For each file visited, the stream
attempts to read its

BasicFileAttributes

. If the file is a
directory and can be opened successfully, entries in the directory, and
their

descendants

will follow the directory in the stream as
they are encountered. When all entries have been visited, then the
directory is closed. The file tree walk then continues at the next

sibling

of the directory.

The stream is

weakly consistent

. It does not freeze the
file tree while iterating, so it may (or may not) reflect updates to
the file tree that occur after returned from this method.

By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
method. If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then symbolic links are
followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
be read, then this method attempts to get the

BasicFileAttributes

of the link.

If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then the stream keeps
track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the

file-key

of directories,
or if file keys are not available, by invoking the

isSameFile

method to test if a directory is the same file as an
ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error with
an instance of

FileSystemLoopException

.

The

maxDepth

parameter is the maximum number of levels of
directories to visit. A value of

0

means that only the starting
file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of

MAX_VALUE

may be used to indicate that all
levels should be visited.

When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
(or directory), then it is ignored and not included in the stream.

The returned stream contains references to one or more open directories.
The directories are closed by closing the stream.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the directory
after this method has returned, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the method that caused
the access to take place.

**Parameters:**
- start

- the starting file
- maxDepth

- the maximum number of directory levels to visit
- options

- options to configure the traversal

**Returns:**
- the

Stream

of

Path

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the

maxDepth

parameter is negative
- SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
- IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown when accessing the starting file.

**Since:**
- 1.8

**API Note:**
- This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open directories are closed
promptly after the stream's operations have completed.

throws
IOException

Return a

Stream

that is lazily populated with

by walking the file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree is traversed

depth-first

, the elements in the stream
are

Path

objects that are obtained as if by

resolving

the relative path against

start

.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
walk(start, Integer.MAX_VALUE, options)
```

In other words, it visits all levels of the file tree.

The returned stream contains references to one or more open directories.
The directories are closed by closing the stream.

**Parameters:**
- start

- the starting file
- options

- options to configure the traversal

**Returns:**
- the

Stream

of

Path

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

throws
IOException

Return a

Stream

that is lazily populated with

Path

by searching for files in a file tree rooted at a given starting
file.

This method walks the file tree in exactly the manner specified by
the

walk

method. For each file encountered, the given

BiPredicate

is invoked with its

Path

and

BasicFileAttributes

. The

Path

object is obtained as if by

resolving

the relative path against

start

and is only included in the returned

Stream

if
the

BiPredicate

returns true. Compare to calling

filter

on the

Stream

returned by

walk

method, this method may be more efficient by
avoiding redundant retrieval of the

BasicFileAttributes

.

The returned stream contains references to one or more open directories.
The directories are closed by closing the stream.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the directory
after returned from this method, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the method that caused
the access to take place.

**Parameters:**
- start

- the starting file
- maxDepth

- the maximum number of directory levels to search
- matcher

- the function used to decide whether a file should be included
in the returned stream
- options

- options to configure the traversal

**Returns:**
- the

Stream

of

Path

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the

maxDepth

parameter is negative
- SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

#### public static
Stream
<
String
> lines​(
Path
path,

Charset
cs)
throws
IOException

Read all lines from a file as a

Stream

. Unlike

readAllLines

, this method does not read
all lines into a

List

, but instead populates lazily as the stream
is consumed.

Bytes from the file are decoded into characters using the specified
charset and the same line terminators as specified by

readAllLines

are supported.

The returned stream contains a reference to an open file. The file
is closed by closing the stream.

The file contents should not be modified during the execution of the
terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream
operation is undefined.

After this method returns, then any subsequent I/O exception that
occurs while reading from the file or when a malformed or unmappable byte
sequence is read, is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

that will
be thrown from the

Stream

method that caused the read to take
place. In case an

IOException

is thrown when closing the file,
it is also wrapped as an

UncheckedIOException

.

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path to the file
- cs

- the charset to use for decoding

**Returns:**
- the lines from the file as a

Stream

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs opening the file
- SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

**See Also:**
- readAllLines(Path, Charset)

,

newBufferedReader(Path, Charset)

,

BufferedReader.lines()

**Since:**
- 1.8

**API Note:**
- This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open file is closed promptly
after the stream's operations have completed.

**Implementation Note:**
- This implementation supports good parallel stream performance for the
standard charsets

UTF-8

,

US-ASCII

and

ISO-8859-1

. Such

line-optimal

charsets have the property that the encoded bytes
of a line feed ('\n') or a carriage return ('\r') are efficiently
identifiable from other encoded characters when randomly accessing the
bytes of the file.

For non-

line-optimal

charsets the stream source's
spliterator has poor splitting properties, similar to that of a
spliterator associated with an iterator or that associated with a stream
returned from

BufferedReader.lines()

. Poor splitting properties
can result in poor parallel stream performance.

For

line-optimal

charsets the stream source's spliterator
has good splitting properties, assuming the file contains a regular
sequence of lines. Good splitting properties can result in good parallel
stream performance. The spliterator for a

line-optimal

charset
takes advantage of the charset properties (a line feed or a carriage
return being efficient identifiable) such that when splitting it can
approximately divide the number of covered lines in half.

#### Methods declared in class java.lang. Object

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- newInputStream

```java
public static
InputStream
newInputStream​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens a file, returning an input stream to read from the file. The stream
will not be buffered, and is not required to support the

mark

or

reset

methods. The
stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Reading
commences at the beginning of the file. Whether the returned stream is

asynchronously closeable

and/or

interruptible

is highly
file system provider specific and therefore not specified.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
If no options are present then it is equivalent to opening the file with
the

READ

option. In addition to the

READ

option, an implementation may also support additional implementation
specific options.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to open
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** a new input stream
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if an invalid combination of options is specified
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

- newOutputStream

```java
public static
OutputStream
newOutputStream​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning an output stream that may be used to
write bytes to the file. The resulting stream will not be buffered. The
stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Whether
the returned stream is

asynchronously closeable

and/or

interruptible

is highly file system provider specific and
therefore not specified.

This method opens or creates a file in exactly the manner specified
by the

newByteChannel

method with the exception that the

READ

option may not be present in the array of options. If no options are
present then this method works as if the

CREATE

,

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

,
and

WRITE

options are present. In other
words, it opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't
exist, or initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to a size of

0

if it exists.

Usage Examples:

```java
Path path = ...

// truncate and overwrite an existing file, or create the file if
// it doesn't initially exist
OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(path);

// append to an existing file, fail if the file does not exist
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, APPEND);

// append to an existing file, create file if it doesn't initially exist
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, CREATE, APPEND);

// always create new file, failing if it already exists
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, CREATE_NEW);
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** a new output stream
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

options

contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.

- newByteChannel

```java
public static
SeekableByteChannel
newByteChannel​(
Path
path,

Set
<? extends
OpenOption
> options,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning a seekable byte channel to access the
file.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
The

READ

and

WRITE

options determine if the file should be
opened for reading and/or writing. If neither option (or the

APPEND

option) is present then the file is
opened for reading. By default reading or writing commence at the
beginning of the file.

In the addition to

READ

and

WRITE

, the following
options may be present:

Options

Option

Description

APPEND

If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
each invocation of the channel's

write

method first advances
the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
with the

READ

or

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

options.

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
for reading.

CREATE_NEW

If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
the file already exists or is a symbolic link. When creating a file the
check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it
does not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations.
This option is ignored when the file is opened only for reading.

CREATE

If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it
exists, otherwise a new file is created. This option is ignored if the

CREATE_NEW

option is also present or the file is opened only
for reading.

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

When this option is present then the implementation makes a

best effort

attempt to delete the file when closed by the

close

method. If the

close

method is not invoked then a

best effort

attempt is made to
delete the file when the Java virtual machine terminates.

SPARSE

When creating a new file this option is a

hint

that the
new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
a new file.

SYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

DSYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

An implementation may also support additional implementation specific
options.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when a new file is created.

In the case of the default provider, the returned seekable byte channel
is a

FileChannel

.

Usage Examples:

```java
Path path = ...

// open file for reading
ReadableByteChannel rbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(READ)));

// open file for writing to the end of an existing file, creating
// the file if it doesn't already exist
WritableByteChannel wbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE,APPEND));

// create file with initial permissions, opening it for both reading and writing
FileAttribute<Set<PosixFilePermission>> perms = ...
SeekableByteChannel sbc =
Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE_NEW,READ,WRITE), perms);
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file
**Returns:** a new seekable byte channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the set contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported open option is specified or the array contains
attributes that cannot be set atomically when creating the file
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file of that name already exists and the

CREATE_NEW

option is specified

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the path if the file is
opened for reading. The

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the path
if the file is opened for writing. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.
**See Also:** FileChannel.open(Path,Set,FileAttribute[])

- newByteChannel

```java
public static
SeekableByteChannel
newByteChannel​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning a seekable byte channel to access the
file.

This method opens or creates a file in exactly the manner specified
by the

newByteChannel

method.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** a new seekable byte channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the set contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported open option is specified
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file of that name already exists and the

CREATE_NEW

option is specified

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the path if the file is
opened for reading. The

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the path
if the file is opened for writing. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.
**See Also:** FileChannel.open(Path,OpenOption[])

- newDirectoryStream

```java
public static
DirectoryStream
<
Path
> newDirectoryStream​(
Path
dir)
throws
IOException
```

Opens a directory, returning a

DirectoryStream

to iterate over
all entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
stream's

iterator

are of type

Path

, each one representing an entry in the directory. The

Path

objects are obtained as if by

resolving

the
name of the directory entry against

dir

.

When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
stream's

close

method should be invoked after iteration is
completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.

When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
stream is a

SecureDirectoryStream

.

**Parameters:** dir

- the path to the directory
**Returns:** a new and open

DirectoryStream

object
**Throws:** NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

- newDirectoryStream

```java
public static
DirectoryStream
<
Path
> newDirectoryStream​(
Path
dir,

String
glob)
throws
IOException
```

Opens a directory, returning a

DirectoryStream

to iterate over
the entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
stream's

iterator

are of type

Path

, each one representing an entry in the directory. The

Path

objects are obtained as if by

resolving

the
name of the directory entry against

dir

. The entries returned by
the iterator are filtered by matching the

String

representation
of their file names against the given

globbing

pattern.

For example, suppose we want to iterate over the files ending with
".java" in a directory:

```java
Path dir = ...
try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, "*.java")) {
:
}
```

The globbing pattern is specified by the

getPathMatcher

method.

When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
stream's

close

method should be invoked after iteration is
completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.

When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
stream is a

SecureDirectoryStream

.

**Parameters:** dir

- the path to the directory
**Parameters:** glob

- the glob pattern
**Returns:** a new and open

DirectoryStream

object
**Throws:** PatternSyntaxException

- if the pattern is invalid
**Throws:** NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

- newDirectoryStream

```java
public static
DirectoryStream
<
Path
> newDirectoryStream​(
Path
dir,

DirectoryStream.Filter
<? super
Path
> filter)
throws
IOException
```

Opens a directory, returning a

DirectoryStream

to iterate over
the entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
stream's

iterator

are of type

Path

, each one representing an entry in the directory. The

Path

objects are obtained as if by

resolving

the
name of the directory entry against

dir

. The entries returned by
the iterator are filtered by the given

filter

.

When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
stream's

close

method should be invoked after iteration is
completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.

Where the filter terminates due to an uncaught error or runtime
exception then it is propagated to the

hasNext

or

next

method. Where an

IOException

is thrown, it results in the

hasNext

or

next

method throwing a

DirectoryIteratorException

with the

IOException

as the cause.

When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
stream is a

SecureDirectoryStream

.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to iterate over the files in a directory that are
larger than 8K.

```java
DirectoryStream.Filter<Path> filter = new DirectoryStream.Filter<Path>() {
public boolean accept(Path file) throws IOException {
return (Files.size(file) > 8192L);
}
};
Path dir = ...
try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, filter)) {
:
}
```

**Parameters:** dir

- the path to the directory
**Parameters:** filter

- the directory stream filter
**Returns:** a new and open

DirectoryStream

object
**Throws:** NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

- createFile

```java
public static
Path
createFile​(
Path
path,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new and empty file, failing if the file already exists. The
check for the existence of the file and the creation of the new file if
it does not exist are a single operation that is atomic with respect to
all other filesystem activities that might affect the directory.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the file. Each attribute
is identified by its

name

. If more than one
attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but the last
occurrence is ignored.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to create
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file
**Returns:** the file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the file
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file of that name already exists

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the parent directory does not exist
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the new file.

- createDirectory

```java
public static
Path
createDirectory​(
Path
dir,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new directory. The check for the existence of the file and the
creation of the directory if it does not exist are a single operation
that is atomic with respect to all other filesystem activities that might
affect the directory. The

createDirectories

method should be used where it is required to create all nonexistent
parent directories first.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the directory. Each
attribute is identified by its

name

. If more
than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but
the last occurrence is ignored.

**Parameters:** dir

- the directory to create
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the directory
**Returns:** the directory
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a directory could not otherwise be created because a file of
that name already exists

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the parent directory does not exist
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the new directory.

- createDirectories

```java
public static
Path
createDirectories​(
Path
dir,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a directory by creating all nonexistent parent directories first.
Unlike the

createDirectory

method, an exception
is not thrown if the directory could not be created because it already
exists.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the nonexistent
directories. Each file attribute is identified by its

name

. If more than one attribute of the same name is
included in the array then all but the last occurrence is ignored.

If this method fails, then it may do so after creating some, but not
all, of the parent directories.

**Parameters:** dir

- the directory to create
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the directory
**Returns:** the directory
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if

dir

exists but is not a directory

(optional specific
exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- in the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked prior to attempting to create a directory and
its

checkRead

is
invoked for each parent directory that is checked. If

dir

is not an absolute path then its

toAbsolutePath

may need to be invoked to get its absolute path.
This may invoke the security manager's

checkPropertyAccess

method to check access to the system property

user.dir

- createTempFile

```java
public static
Path
createTempFile​(
Path
dir,

String
prefix,

String
suffix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new empty file in the specified directory, using the given
prefix and suffix strings to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is associated with the same

FileSystem

as the given
directory.

The details as to how the name of the file is constructed is
implementation dependent and therefore not specified. Where possible
the

prefix

and

suffix

are used to construct candidate
names in the same manner as the

File.createTempFile(String,String,File)

method.

As with the

File.createTempFile

methods, this method is only
part of a temporary-file facility. Where used as a

work files

,
the resulting file may be opened using the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option so that the
file is deleted when the appropriate

close

method is invoked.
Alternatively, a

shutdown-hook

, or the

File.deleteOnExit()

mechanism may be used to delete the
file automatically.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the file. Each attribute
is identified by its

name

. If more than one
attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but the last
occurrence is ignored. When no file attributes are specified, then the
resulting file may have more restrictive access permissions to files
created by the

File.createTempFile(String,String,File)

method.

**Parameters:** dir

- the path to directory in which to create the file
**Parameters:** prefix

- the prefix string to be used in generating the file's name;

a candidate file name
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or

dir

does not exist
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file.

```java
public static
Path
createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates an empty file in the default temporary-file directory, using
the given prefix and suffix to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is associated with the default

FileSystem

.

This method works in exactly the manner specified by the

createTempFile(Path,String,String,FileAttribute[])

method for
the case that the

dir

parameter is the temporary-file directory.

**Parameters:** prefix

- the prefix string to be used in generating the file's name;
may be

null

installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file.

- createTempDirectory

```java
public static
Path
createTempDirectory​(
Path
dir,

String
prefix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new directory in the specified directory, using the given
prefix to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is associated
with the same

FileSystem

as the given directory.

The details as to how the name of the directory is constructed is
implementation dependent and therefore not specified. Where possible
the

prefix

is used to construct candidate names.

As with the

createTempFile

methods, this method is only
part of a temporary-file facility. A

shutdown-hook

, or the

File.deleteOnExit()

mechanism may be
used to delete the directory automatically.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the directory. Each
attribute is identified by its

name

. If more
than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but
the last occurrence is ignored.

**Parameters:** dir

- the path to directory in which to create the directory

method is invoked to check write access when creating the
directory.

- createTempDirectory

```java
public static
Path
createTempDirectory​(
String
prefix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new directory in the default temporary-file directory, using
the given prefix to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is
associated with the default

FileSystem

.

This method works in exactly the manner specified by

createTempDirectory(Path,String,FileAttribute[])

method for the case
that the

dir

parameter is the temporary-file directory.

**Parameters:** prefix

- the prefix string to be used in generating the directory's name;
may be

null
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the directory
**Returns:** the path to the newly created directory that did not exist before
this method was invoked

directory.

- createSymbolicLink

```java
public static
Path
createSymbolicLink​(
Path
link,

Path
target,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a symbolic link to a target

(optional operation)

.

The

target

parameter is the target of the link. It may be an

absolute

or relative path and may not exist. When
the target is a relative path then file system operations on the resulting
link are relative to the path of the link.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

attributes

to set atomically when creating the link. Each attribute is
identified by its

name

. If more than one attribute
of the same name is included in the array then all but the last occurrence
is ignored.

Where symbolic links are supported, but the underlying

FileStore

does not support symbolic links, then this may fail with an

IOException

. Additionally, some operating systems may require that the
Java virtual machine be started with implementation specific privileges to
create symbolic links, in which case this method may throw

IOException

.

**Parameters:** link

- the path of the symbolic link to create
**Parameters:** target

- the target of the symbolic link
**Parameters:** attrs

- the array of attributes to set atomically when creating the
symbolic link
**Returns:** the path to the symbolic link
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation does not support symbolic links or the
array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically when
creating the symbolic link
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file with the name already exists

(optional specific
exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
is installed, it denies

LinkPermission

("symbolic")

or its

checkWrite

method denies write access to the path of the symbolic link.

- createLink

```java
public static
Path
createLink​(
Path
link,

Path
existing)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new link (directory entry) for an existing file

(optional
operation)

.

The

link

parameter locates the directory entry to create.
The

existing

parameter is the path to an existing file. This
method creates a new directory entry for the file so that it can be
accessed using

link

as the path. On some file systems this is
known as creating a "hard link". Whether the file attributes are
maintained for the file or for each directory entry is file system
specific and therefore not specified. Typically, a file system requires
that all links (directory entries) for a file be on the same file system.
Furthermore, on some platforms, the Java virtual machine may require to
be started with implementation specific privileges to create hard links
or to create links to directories.

**Parameters:** link

- the link (directory entry) to create
**Parameters:** existing

- a path to an existing file
**Returns:** the path to the link (directory entry)
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation does not support adding an existing file
to a directory
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the entry could not otherwise be created because a file of
that name already exists

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
is installed, it denies

LinkPermission

("hard")

or its

checkWrite

method denies write access to either the link or the
existing file.

- delete

```java
public static void delete​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Deletes a file.

An implementation may require to examine the file to determine if the
file is a directory. Consequently this method may not be atomic with respect
to other file system operations. If the file is a symbolic link then the
symbolic link itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted.

If the file is a directory then the directory must be empty. In some
implementations a directory has entries for special files or links that
are created when the directory is created. In such implementations a
directory is considered empty when only the special entries exist.
This method can be used with the

walkFileTree

method to delete a directory and all entries in the directory, or an
entire

file-tree

where required.

On some operating systems it may not be possible to remove a file when
it is open and in use by this Java virtual machine or other programs.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to delete
**Throws:** NoSuchFileException

- if the file does not exist

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- if the file is a directory and could not otherwise be deleted
because the directory is not empty

(optional specific
exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

SecurityManager.checkDelete(String)

method
is invoked to check delete access to the file

- deleteIfExists

```java
public static boolean deleteIfExists​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Deletes a file if it exists.

As with the

delete(Path)

method, an
implementation may need to examine the file to determine if the file is a
directory. Consequently this method may not be atomic with respect to
other file system operations. If the file is a symbolic link, then the
symbolic link itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted.

If the file is a directory then the directory must be empty. In some
implementations a directory has entries for special files or links that
are created when the directory is created. In such implementations a
directory is considered empty when only the special entries exist.

On some operating systems it may not be possible to remove a file when
it is open and in use by this Java virtual machine or other programs.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to delete
**Returns:** true

if the file was deleted by this method;

false

if the file could not be deleted because it did not
exist
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- if the file is a directory and could not otherwise be deleted
because the directory is not empty

(optional specific
exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

SecurityManager.checkDelete(String)

method
is invoked to check delete access to the file.

- copy

```java
public static
Path
copy​(
Path
source,

Path
target,

CopyOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Copy a file to a target file.

This method copies a file to the target file with the

options

parameter specifying how the copy is performed. By default, the
copy fails if the target file already exists or is a symbolic link,
except if the source and target are the

same

file, in
which case the method completes without copying the file. File attributes
are not required to be copied to the target file. If symbolic links are
supported, and the file is a symbolic link, then the final target of the
link is copied. If the file is a directory then it creates an empty
directory in the target location (entries in the directory are not
copied). This method can be used with the

walkFileTree

method to copy a directory and all entries in the directory,
or an entire

file-tree

where required.

The

options

parameter may include any of the following:

Options

Option

Description

REPLACE_EXISTING

If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
the link, is replaced.

COPY_ATTRIBUTES

Attempts to copy the file attributes associated with this file to
the target file. The exact file attributes that are copied is platform
and file system dependent and therefore unspecified. Minimally, the

last-modified-time

is
copied to the target file if supported by both the source and target
file stores. Copying of file timestamps may result in precision
loss.

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

Symbolic links are not followed. If the file is a symbolic link,
then the symbolic link itself, not the target of the link, is copied.
It is implementation specific if file attributes can be copied to the
new link. In other words, the

COPY_ATTRIBUTES

option may be
ignored when copying a symbolic link.

An implementation of this interface may support additional
implementation specific options.

Copying a file is not an atomic operation. If an

IOException

is thrown, then it is possible that the target file is incomplete or some
of its file attributes have not been copied from the source file. When
the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified and the target file
exists, then the target file is replaced. The check for the existence of
the file and the creation of the new file may not be atomic with respect
to other file system activities.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to copy a file into a directory, giving it the same file
name as the source file:

```java
Path source = ...
Path newdir = ...
Files.copy(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName());
```

**Parameters:** source

- the path to the file to copy
**Parameters:** target

- the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
provider to the source path)
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the copy should be done
**Returns:** the path to the target file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is not specified

(optional
specific exception)
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the source file, the

checkWrite

is invoked
to check write access to the target file. If a symbolic link is
copied the security manager is invoked to check

LinkPermission

("symbolic")

.

- move

```java
public static
Path
move​(
Path
source,

Path
target,

CopyOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Move or rename a file to a target file.

By default, this method attempts to move the file to the target
file, failing if the target file exists except if the source and
target are the

same

file, in which case this method
has no effect. If the file is a symbolic link then the symbolic link
itself, not the target of the link, is moved. This method may be
invoked to move an empty directory. In some implementations a directory
has entries for special files or links that are created when the
directory is created. In such implementations a directory is considered
empty when only the special entries exist. When invoked to move a
directory that is not empty then the directory is moved if it does not
require moving the entries in the directory. For example, renaming a
directory on the same

FileStore

will usually not require moving
the entries in the directory. When moving a directory requires that its
entries be moved then this method fails (by throwing an

IOException

). To move a

file tree

may involve copying rather
than moving directories and this can be done using the

copy

method in conjunction with the

Files.walkFileTree

utility method.

The

options

parameter may include any of the following:

Options

Option

Description

REPLACE_EXISTING

If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
the link, is replaced.

ATOMIC_MOVE

The move is performed as an atomic file system operation and all
other options are ignored. If the target file exists then it is
implementation specific if the existing file is replaced or this method
fails by throwing an

IOException

. If the move cannot be
performed as an atomic file system operation then

AtomicMoveNotSupportedException

is thrown. This can arise, for
example, when the target location is on a different

FileStore

and would require that the file be copied, or target location is
associated with a different provider to this object.

An implementation of this interface may support additional
implementation specific options.

Moving a file will copy the

last-modified-time

to the target
file if supported by both source and target file stores. Copying of file
timestamps may result in precision loss. An implementation may also
attempt to copy other file attributes but is not required to fail if the
file attributes cannot be copied. When the move is performed as
a non-atomic operation, and an

IOException

is thrown, then the
state of the files is not defined. The original file and the target file
may both exist, the target file may be incomplete or some of its file
attributes may not been copied from the original file.

Usage Examples:

Suppose we want to rename a file to "newname", keeping the file in the
same directory:

```java
Path source = ...
Files.move(source, source.resolveSibling("newname"));
```

Alternatively, suppose we want to move a file to new directory, keeping
the same file name, and replacing any existing file of that name in the
directory:

```java
Path source = ...
Path newdir = ...
Files.move(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName()), REPLACE_EXISTING);
```

**Parameters:** source

- the path to the file to move
**Parameters:** target

- the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
provider to the source path)
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the move should be done
**Returns:** the path to the target file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is not specified

(optional
specific exception)
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory, or the
source is a non-empty directory containing entries that would
be required to be moved

(optional specific exceptions)
**Throws:** AtomicMoveNotSupportedException

- if the options array contains the

ATOMIC_MOVE

option but
the file cannot be moved as an atomic file system operation.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to both the source and
target file.

- readSymbolicLink

```java
public static
Path
readSymbolicLink​(
Path
link)
throws
IOException
```

Reads the target of a symbolic link

(optional operation)

.

If the file system supports

symbolic
links

then this method is used to read the target of the link, failing
if the file is not a symbolic link. The target of the link need not exist.
The returned

Path

object will be associated with the same file
system as

link

.

**Parameters:** link

- the path to the symbolic link
**Returns:** a

Path

object representing the target of the link
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation does not support symbolic links
**Throws:** NotLinkException

- if the target could otherwise not be read because the file
is not a symbolic link

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
is installed, it checks that

FilePermission

has been
granted with the "

readlink

" action to read the link.

- getFileStore

```java
public static
FileStore
getFileStore​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the

FileStore

representing the file store where a file
is located.

Once a reference to the

FileStore

is obtained it is
implementation specific if operations on the returned

FileStore

,
or

FileStoreAttributeView

objects obtained from it, continue
to depend on the existence of the file. In particular the behavior is not
defined for the case that the file is deleted or moved to a different
file store.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** the file store where the file is stored
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file, and in
addition it checks

RuntimePermission

("getFileStoreAttributes")

- isSameFile

```java
public static boolean isSameFile​(
Path
path,

Path
path2)
throws
IOException
```

Tests if two paths locate the same file.

If both

Path

objects are

equal

then this method returns

true

without checking if the file exists.
If the two

Path

objects are associated with different providers
then this method returns

false

. Otherwise, this method checks if
both

Path

objects locate the same file, and depending on the
implementation, may require to open or access both files.

If the file system and files remain static, then this method implements
an equivalence relation for non-null

Paths

.

- It is

reflexive

: for

Path

f

,

isSameFile(f,f)

should return

true

.

It is

symmetric

: for two

Paths

f

and

g

,

isSameFile(f,g)

will equal

isSameFile(g,f)

.

It is

transitive

: for three

Paths

f

,

g

, and

h

, if

isSameFile(f,g)

returns

true

and

isSameFile(g,h)

returns

true

, then

isSameFile(f,h)

will return

true

.

**Parameters:** path

- one path to the file
**Parameters:** path2

- the other path
**Returns:** true

if, and only if, the two paths locate the same file
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to both files.
**See Also:** BasicFileAttributes.fileKey()

- isHidden

```java
public static boolean isHidden​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Tells whether or not a file is considered

hidden

. The exact
definition of hidden is platform or provider dependent. On UNIX for
example a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with a
period character ('.'). On Windows a file is considered hidden if it
isn't a directory and the DOS

hidden

attribute is set.

Depending on the implementation this method may require to access
the file system to determine if the file is considered hidden.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to test
**Returns:** true

if the file is considered hidden
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

- probeContentType

```java
public static
String
probeContentType​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Probes the content type of a file.

This method uses the installed

FileTypeDetector

implementations
to probe the given file to determine its content type. Each file type
detector's

probeContentType

is
invoked, in turn, to probe the file type. If the file is recognized then
the content type is returned. If the file is not recognized by any of the
installed file type detectors then a system-default file type detector is
invoked to guess the content type.

A given invocation of the Java virtual machine maintains a system-wide
list of file type detectors. Installed file type detectors are loaded
using the service-provider loading facility defined by the

ServiceLoader

class. Installed file type detectors are loaded using the system class
loader. If the system class loader cannot be found then the platform class
loader is used. File type detectors are typically installed
by placing them in a JAR file on the application class path,
the JAR file contains a provider-configuration file
named

java.nio.file.spi.FileTypeDetector

in the resource directory

META-INF/services

, and the file lists one or more fully-qualified
names of concrete subclass of

FileTypeDetector

that have a zero
argument constructor. If the process of locating or instantiating the
installed file type detectors fails then an unspecified error is thrown.
The ordering that installed providers are located is implementation
specific.

The return value of this method is the string form of the value of a
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) content type as
defined by

RFC 2045:
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet
Message Bodies

. The string is guaranteed to be parsable according
to the grammar in the RFC.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to probe
**Returns:** The content type of the file, or

null

if the content
type cannot be determined
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
permission required by a file type detector implementation.

- getFileAttributeView

```java
public static <V extends
FileAttributeView
> V getFileAttributeView​(
Path
path,

Class
<V> type,

LinkOption
... options)
```

Returns a file attribute view of a given type.

A file attribute view provides a read-only or updatable view of a
set of file attributes. This method is intended to be used where the file
attribute view defines type-safe methods to read or update the file
attributes. The

type

parameter is the type of the attribute view
required and the method returns an instance of that type if supported.
The

BasicFileAttributeView

type supports access to the basic
attributes of a file. Invoking this method to select a file attribute
view of that type will always return an instance of that class.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled by the resulting file attribute view for the case that the
file is a symbolic link. By default, symbolic links are followed. If the
option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then
symbolic links are not followed. This option is ignored by implementations
that do not support symbolic links.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want read or set a file's ACL, if supported:

```java
Path path = ...
AclFileAttributeView view = Files.getFileAttributeView(path, AclFileAttributeView.class);
if (view != null) {
List<AclEntry> acl = view.getAcl();
:
}
```

**Type Parameters:** V

- The

FileAttributeView

type
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** type

- the

Class

object corresponding to the file attribute view
**Parameters:** options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
**Returns:** a file attribute view of the specified type, or

null

if
the attribute view type is not available

- readAttributes

```java
public static <A extends
BasicFileAttributes
> A readAttributes​(
Path
path,

Class
<A> type,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Reads a file's attributes as a bulk operation.

The

type

parameter is the type of the attributes required
and this method returns an instance of that type if supported. All
implementations support a basic set of file attributes and so invoking
this method with a

type

parameter of

BasicFileAttributes.class

will not throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is read. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

It is implementation specific if all file attributes are read as an
atomic operation with respect to other file system operations.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to read a file's attributes in bulk:

```java
Path path = ...
BasicFileAttributes attrs = Files.readAttributes(path, BasicFileAttributes.class);
```

Alternatively, suppose we want to read file's POSIX attributes without
following symbolic links:

```java
PosixFileAttributes attrs =
Files.readAttributes(path, PosixFileAttributes.class, NOFOLLOW_LINKS);
```

**Type Parameters:** A

- The

BasicFileAttributes

type
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** type

- the

Class

of the file attributes required
to read
**Parameters:** options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
**Returns:** the file attributes
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an attributes of the given type are not supported
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file. If this
method is invoked to read security sensitive attributes then the
security manager may be invoke to check for additional permissions.

- setAttribute

```java
public static
Path
setAttribute​(
Path
path,

String
attribute,

Object
value,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the value of a file attribute.

The

attribute

parameter identifies the attribute to be set
and takes the form:

[

view-name

:

]

attribute-name

where square brackets [...] delineate an optional component and the
character

':'

stands for itself.

view-name

is the

name

of a

FileAttributeView

that identifies a set of file attributes. If not
specified then it defaults to

"basic"

, the name of the file
attribute view that identifies the basic set of file attributes common to
many file systems.

attribute-name

is the name of the attribute
within the set.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is set. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to set the DOS "hidden" attribute:

```java
Path path = ...
Files.setAttribute(path, "dos:hidden", true);
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** attribute

- the attribute to set
**Parameters:** value

the attribute value is of the correct type but has an
inappropriate value
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the attribute value is not of the expected type or is a
collection containing elements that are not of the expected
type
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file. If this method is invoked
to set security sensitive attributes then the security manager
may be invoked to check for additional permissions.

- getAttribute

```java
public static
Object
getAttribute​(
Path
path,

String
attribute,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Reads the value of a file attribute.

The

attribute

parameter identifies the attribute to be read
and takes the form:

[

view-name

:

]

attribute-name

where square brackets [...] delineate an optional component and the
character

':'

stands for itself.

view-name

is the

name

of a

FileAttributeView

that identifies a set of file attributes. If not
specified then it defaults to

"basic"

, the name of the file
attribute view that identifies the basic set of file attributes common to
many file systems.

attribute-name

is the name of the attribute.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is read. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Usage Example:

Suppose we require the user ID of the file owner on a system that
supports a "

unix

" view:

```java
Path path = ...
int uid = (Integer)Files.getAttribute(path, "unix:uid");
```

**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the attribute view is not available
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the attribute name is not specified or is not recognized
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file. If this method is invoked
to read security sensitive attributes then the security manager
may be invoked to check for additional permissions.

- readAttributes

```java
public static
Map
<
String
,​
Object
> readAttributes​(
Path
path,

String
attributes,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Reads a set of file attributes as a bulk operation.

The

attributes

parameter identifies the attributes to be read
and takes the form:

[

view-name

:

]

attribute-list

where square brackets [...] delineate an optional component and the
character

':'

stands for itself.

view-name

is the

name

of a

FileAttributeView

that identifies a set of file attributes. If not
specified then it defaults to

"basic"

, the name of the file
attribute view that identifies the basic set of file attributes common to
many file systems.

The

attribute-list

component is a comma separated list of
one or more names of attributes to read. If the list contains the value

"*"

then all attributes are read. Attributes that are not supported
are ignored and will not be present in the returned map. It is
implementation specific if all attributes are read as an atomic operation
with respect to other file system operations.

The following examples demonstrate possible values for the

attributes

parameter:

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
**Returns:** true

if the file is a regular file;

false

if
the file does not exist, is not a regular file, or it
cannot be determined if the file is a regular file or not.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file.

- getLastModifiedTime

```java
public static
FileTime
getLastModifiedTime​(
Path
path,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a file's last modified time.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is read. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
**Returns:** a

FileTime

representing the time the file was last
modified, or an implementation specific default when a time
stamp to indicate the time of last modification is not supported
by the file system
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file.
**See Also:** BasicFileAttributes.lastModifiedTime()

- setLastModifiedTime

```java
public static
Path
setLastModifiedTime​(
Path
path,

FileTime
time)
throws
IOException
```

Updates a file's last modified time attribute. The file time is converted
to the epoch and precision supported by the file system. Converting from
finer to coarser granularities result in precision loss. The behavior of
this method when attempting to set the last modified time when it is not
supported by the file system or is outside the range supported by the
underlying file store is not defined. It may or not fail by throwing an

IOException

.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to set the last modified time to the current time:

```java
Path path = ...
FileTime now = FileTime.fromMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());
Files.setLastModifiedTime(path, now);
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** time

- the new last modified time
**Returns:** the given path
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file.
**See Also:** BasicFileAttributeView.setTimes(java.nio.file.attribute.FileTime, java.nio.file.attribute.FileTime, java.nio.file.attribute.FileTime)

- size

```java
public static long size​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the size of a file (in bytes). The size may differ from the
actual size on the file system due to compression, support for sparse
files, or other reasons. The size of files that are not

regular

files is implementation specific and
therefore unspecified.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** the file size, in bytes
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file.
**See Also:** BasicFileAttributes.size()

- exists

```java
public static boolean exists​(
Path
path,

LinkOption
... options)
```

Tests whether a file exists.

The

options

parameter may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated. If this
method indicates the file exists then there is no guarantee that a
subsequent access will succeed. Care should be taken when using this
method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to test
**Parameters:** options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
.
**Returns:** true

if the file exists;

false

if the file does
not exist or its existence cannot be determined.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

is invoked to check
read access to the file.
**See Also:** notExists(java.nio.file.Path, java.nio.file.LinkOption...)

- notExists

```java
public static boolean notExists​(
Path
path,

LinkOption
... options)
```

Tests whether the file located by this path does not exist. This method
is intended for cases where it is required to take action when it can be
confirmed that a file does not exist.

The

options

parameter may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Note that this method is not the complement of the

exists

method. Where it is not possible to determine if a file exists
or not then both methods return

false

. As with the

exists

method, the result of this method is immediately outdated. If this
method indicates the file does exist then there is no guarantee that a
subsequent attempt to create the file will succeed. Care should be taken
when using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to test
**Parameters:** options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
**Returns:** true

if the file does not exist;

false

if the
file exists or its existence cannot be determined
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

is invoked to check
read access to the file.

- isReadable

```java
public static boolean isReadable​(
Path
path)
```

Tests whether a file is readable. This method checks that a file exists
and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges that would
allow it open the file for reading. Depending on the implementation, this
method may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or
other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file.
Consequently, this method may not be atomic with respect to other file
system operations.

Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated, there is
no guarantee that a subsequent attempt to open the file for reading will
succeed (or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken
when using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to check
**Returns:** true

if the file exists and is readable;

false

if the file does not exist, read access would be denied because
the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
cannot be determined
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

is invoked to check read access to the file.

- isWritable

```java
public static boolean isWritable​(
Path
path)
```

Tests whether a file is writable. This method checks that a file exists
and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges that would
allow it open the file for writing. Depending on the implementation, this
method may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or
other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file.
Consequently, this method may not be atomic with respect to other file
system operations.

Note that result of this method is immediately outdated, there is no
guarantee that a subsequent attempt to open the file for writing will
succeed (or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken
when using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to check
**Returns:** true

if the file exists and is writable;

false

if the file does not exist, write access would be denied because
the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
cannot be determined
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

is invoked to check write access to the file.

- isExecutable

```java
public static boolean isExecutable​(
Path
path)
```

Tests whether a file is executable. This method checks that a file exists
and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges to

execute

the file. The semantics may differ when checking
access to a directory. For example, on UNIX systems, checking for
execute access checks that the Java virtual machine has permission to
search the directory in order to access file or subdirectories.

Depending on the implementation, this method may require to read file
permissions, access control lists, or other file attributes in order to
check the effective access to the file. Consequently, this method may not
be atomic with respect to other file system operations.

Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated, there is
no guarantee that a subsequent attempt to execute the file will succeed
(or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken when
using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to check
**Returns:** true

if the file exists and is executable;

false

if the file does not exist, execute access would be denied because
the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
cannot be determined
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkExec

is invoked to check execute access to the file.

- walkFileTree

```java
public static
Path
walkFileTree​(
Path
start,

Set
<
FileVisitOption
> options,
int maxDepth,

FileVisitor
<? super
Path
> visitor)
throws
IOException
```

Walks a file tree.

This method walks a file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree traversal is

depth-first

with the given

FileVisitor

invoked for each file encountered. File tree traversal
completes when all accessible files in the tree have been visited, or a
visit method returns a result of

TERMINATE

. Where a visit method terminates due an

IOException

,
an uncaught error, or runtime exception, then the traversal is terminated
and the error or exception is propagated to the caller of this method.

For each file encountered this method attempts to read its

BasicFileAttributes

. If the file is not a
directory then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the file attributes. If the file attributes cannot be read,
due to an I/O exception, then the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with the I/O exception.

Where the file is a directory, and the directory could not be opened,
then the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with the I/O exception,
after which, the file tree walk continues, by default, at the next

sibling

of the directory.

Where the directory is opened successfully, then the entries in the
directory, and their

descendants

are visited. When all entries
have been visited, or an I/O error occurs during iteration of the
directory, then the directory is closed and the visitor's

postVisitDirectory

method is invoked.
The file tree walk then continues, by default, at the next

sibling

of the directory.

By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
method. If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then symbolic links are
followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
be read, then this method attempts to get the

BasicFileAttributes

of the link. If they can be read then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the attributes of the link (otherwise the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked as specified above).

If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then this method keeps
track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the

file-key

of directories,
or if file keys are not available, by invoking the

isSameFile

method to test if a directory is the same file as an
ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error, and the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with
an instance of

FileSystemLoopException

.

The

maxDepth

parameter is the maximum number of levels of
directories to visit. A value of

0

means that only the starting
file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of

MAX_VALUE

may be used to indicate that all
levels should be visited. The

visitFile

method is invoked for all
files, including directories, encountered at

maxDepth

, unless the
basic file attributes cannot be read, in which case the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked.

If a visitor returns a result of

null

then

NullPointerException

is thrown.

When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
(or directory), then it is ignored and the visitor is not invoked for
that file (or directory).

**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** options

- options to configure the traversal
**Parameters:** maxDepth

- the maximum number of directory levels to visit
**Parameters:** visitor

- the file visitor to invoke for each file
**Returns:** the starting file
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

maxDepth

parameter is negative
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown by a visitor method

- walkFileTree

```java
public static
Path
walkFileTree​(
Path
start,

FileVisitor
<? super
Path
> visitor)
throws
IOException
```

Walks a file tree.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
walkFileTree(start, EnumSet.noneOf(FileVisitOption.class), Integer.MAX_VALUE, visitor)
```

In other words, it does not follow symbolic links, and visits all levels
of the file tree.

**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** visitor

- the file visitor to invoke for each file
**Returns:** the starting file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown by a visitor method

- newBufferedReader

```java
public static
BufferedReader
newBufferedReader​(
Path
path,

Charset
cs)
throws
IOException
```

Opens a file for reading, returning a

BufferedReader

that may be
used to read text from the file in an efficient manner. Bytes from the
file are decoded into characters using the specified charset. Reading
commences at the beginning of the file.

The

Reader

methods that read from the file throw

IOException

if a malformed or unmappable byte sequence is read.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** cs

- the charset to use for decoding
**Returns:** a new buffered reader, with default buffer size, to read text
from the file
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs opening the file

... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file for writing, returning a

BufferedWriter

that may be used to write text to the file in an efficient manner.
The

options

parameter specifies how the file is created or
opened. If no options are present then this method works as if the

CREATE

,

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

, and

WRITE

options are present. In other words, it
opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't exist, or
initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to
a size of

0

if it exists.

The

Writer

methods to write text throw

IOException

if the text cannot be encoded using the specified charset.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** cs

- the charset to use for encoding
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** a new buffered writer, with default buffer size, to write text
to the file

**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.
**See Also:** write(Path,Iterable,Charset,OpenOption[])

- newBufferedWriter

```java
public static
BufferedWriter
newBufferedWriter​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file for writing, returning a

BufferedWriter

to write text to the file in an efficient manner. The text is encoded
into bytes for writing using the

UTF-8

charset

.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
Files.newBufferedWriter(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8, options)
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** a new buffered writer, with default buffer size, to write text
to the file
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

options

contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs opening or creating the file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.
**Since:** 1.8

- copy

```java
public static long copy​(
InputStream
in,

Path
target,

CopyOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Copies all bytes from an input stream to a file. On return, the input
stream will be at end of stream.

By default, the copy fails if the target file already exists or is a
symbolic link. If the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified, and the target file already exists,
then it is replaced if it is not a non-empty directory. If the target
file exists and is a symbolic link, then the symbolic link is replaced.
In this release, the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is the only option
required to be supported by this method. Additional options may be
supported in future releases.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to
the file, then it may do so after the target file has been created and
after some bytes have been read or written. Consequently the input
stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
It is strongly recommended that the input stream be promptly closed if an
I/O error occurs.

This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream (or
writing to the file). The behavior for the case that the input stream is

asynchronously closed

or the thread interrupted during the copy is
highly input stream and file system provider specific and therefore not
specified.

Usage example

: Suppose we want to capture a web page and save
it to a file:

```java
Path path = ...
URI u = URI.create("http://java.sun.com/");
try (InputStream in = u.toURL().openStream()) {
Files.copy(in, path);
}
```

**Parameters:** in

- the input stream to read from
**Parameters:** target

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the copy should be done
**Returns:** the number of bytes read or written
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is not specified

(optional
specific exception)
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory

(optional specific exception)

*
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if

options

contains a copy option that is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file. Where the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified, the security
manager's

checkDelete

method is invoked to check that an existing file can be deleted.

- copy

```java
public static long copy​(
Path
source,

OutputStream
out)
throws
IOException
```

Copies all bytes from a file to an output stream.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the file or writing to the output
stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or written.
Consequently the output stream may be in an inconsistent state. It is
strongly recommended that the output stream be promptly closed if an I/O
error occurs.

This method may block indefinitely writing to the output stream (or
reading from the file). The behavior for the case that the output stream
is

asynchronously closed

or the thread interrupted during the copy
is highly output stream and file system provider specific and therefore
not specified.

Note that if the given output stream is

Flushable

then its

flush

method may need to invoked
after this method completes so as to flush any buffered output.

**Parameters:** source

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** out

- the output stream to write to
**Returns:** the number of bytes read or written
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

- readAllBytes

```java
public static byte[] readAllBytes​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Reads all the bytes from a file. The method ensures that the file is
closed when all bytes have been read or an I/O error, or other runtime
exception, is thrown.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read all bytes into a byte array. It is not intended for
reading in large files.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** a byte array containing the bytes read from the file
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs reading from the stream
**Throws:** OutOfMemoryError

- if an array of the required size cannot be allocated, for
example the file is larger that

2GB
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

- readString

```java
public static
String
readString​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Reads all content from a file into a string, decoding from bytes to characters
using the

UTF-8

charset

.
The method ensures that the file is closed when all content have been read
or an I/O error, or other runtime exception, is thrown.

This method is equivalent to:

readString(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** a String containing the content read from the file
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs reading from the file or a malformed or
unmappable byte sequence is read
**Throws:** OutOfMemoryError

- if the file is extremely large, for example larger than

2GB
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.
**Since:** 11

- readString

```java
public static
String
readString​(
Path
path,

Charset
cs)
throws
IOException
```

Reads all characters from a file into a string, decoding from bytes to characters
using the specified

charset

.
The method ensures that the file is closed when all content have been read
or an I/O error, or other runtime exception, is thrown.

This method reads all content including the line separators in the middle
and/or at the end. The resulting string will contain line separators as they
appear in the file.

**API Note:** This method is intended for simple cases where it is appropriate and convenient
to read the content of a file into a String. It is not intended for reading
very large files.
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** cs

- the charset to use for decoding
**Returns:** a String containing the content read from the file
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs reading from the file or a malformed or
unmappable byte sequence is read
**Throws:** OutOfMemoryError

- if the file is extremely large, for example larger than

2GB
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.
**Since:** 11

- readAllLines

```java
public static
List
<
String
> readAllLines​(
Path
path,

Charset
cs)
throws
IOException
```

Read all lines from a file. This method ensures that the file is
closed when all bytes have been read or an I/O error, or other runtime
exception, is thrown. Bytes from the file are decoded into characters
using the specified charset.

This method recognizes the following as line terminators:

- \u000D

followed by

\u000A

,
CARRIAGE RETURN followed by LINE FEED
- \u000A

, LINE FEED
- \u000D

, CARRIAGE RETURN

Additional Unicode line terminators may be recognized in future
releases.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read all lines in a single operation. It is not intended
for reading in large files.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** cs

- the charset to use for decoding
**Returns:** the lines from the file as a

List

; whether the

List

is modifiable or not is implementation dependent and
therefore not specified
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs reading from the file or a malformed or
unmappable byte sequence is read
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.
**See Also:** newBufferedReader(java.nio.file.Path, java.nio.charset.Charset)

- readAllLines

```java
public static
List
<
String
> readAllLines​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Read all lines from a file. Bytes from the file are decoded into characters
using the

UTF-8

charset

.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
Files.readAllLines(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** the lines from the file as a

List

; whether the

List

is modifiable or not is implementation dependent and
therefore not specified
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs reading from the file or a malformed or
unmappable byte sequence is read
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

**Since:** 1.8

- write

```java
public static
Path
write​(
Path
path,
byte[] bytes,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Writes bytes to a file. The

options

parameter specifies how
the file is created or opened. If no options are present then this method
works as if the

CREATE

,

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

, and

WRITE

options are present. In other words, it
opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't exist, or
initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to
a size of

0

. All bytes in the byte array are written to the file.
The method ensures that the file is closed when all bytes have been
written (or an I/O error or other runtime exception is thrown). If an I/O
error occurs then it may do so after the file has been created or
truncated, or after some bytes have been written to the file.

Usage example

: By default the method creates a new file or
overwrites an existing file. Suppose you instead want to append bytes
to an existing file:

```java
Path path = ...
byte[] bytes = ...
Files.write(path, bytes, StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** bytes

- the byte array with the bytes to write
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** the path
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

options

contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** IOException

```java
public static
Path
write​(
Path
path,

Iterable
<? extends
CharSequence
> lines,

```

Write lines of text to a file. Each line is a char sequence and is
written to the file in sequence with each line terminated by the
platform's line separator, as defined by the system property

line.separator

. Characters are encoded into bytes using the specified
charset.

The

options

parameter specifies how the file is created
or opened. If no options are present then this method works as if the

CREATE

,

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

, and

WRITE

options are present. In other words, it
opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't exist, or
initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to
a size of

0

. The method ensures that the file is closed when all
lines have been written (or an I/O error or other runtime exception is
thrown). If an I/O error occurs then it may do so after the file has
been created or truncated, or after some bytes have been written to the
file.

- list

```java
public static
Stream
<
Path
> list​(
Path
dir)
throws
IOException
```

Return a lazily populated

Stream

, the elements of
which are the entries in the directory. The listing is not recursive.

The elements of the stream are

Path

objects that are
obtained as if by

resolving

the name of the
directory entry against

dir

. Some file systems maintain special
links to the directory itself and the directory's parent directory.
Entries representing these links are not included.

The stream is

weakly consistent

. It is thread safe but does
not freeze the directory while iterating, so it may (or may not)
reflect updates to the directory that occur after returning from this
method.

The returned stream contains a reference to an open directory.
The directory is closed by closing the stream.

Operating on a closed stream behaves as if the end of stream
has been reached. Due to read-ahead, one or more elements may be
returned after the stream has been closed.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the directory
after this method has returned, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the method that caused
the access to take place.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open directory is closed
promptly after the stream's operations have completed.
**Parameters:** dir

- The path to the directory
**Returns:** The

Stream

describing the content of the
directory
**Throws:** NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when opening the directory
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.
**Since:** 1.8

- walk

```java
public static
Stream
<
Path
> walk​(
Path
start,
int maxDepth,

FileVisitOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Return a

Stream

that is lazily populated with

Path

by walking the file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree is traversed

depth-first

, the elements in the stream
are

Path

objects that are obtained as if by

resolving

the relative path against

start

.

The

stream

walks the file tree as elements are consumed.
The

Stream

returned is guaranteed to have at least one
element, the starting file itself. For each file visited, the stream
attempts to read its

BasicFileAttributes

. If the file is a
directory and can be opened successfully, entries in the directory, and
their

descendants

will follow the directory in the stream as
they are encountered. When all entries have been visited, then the
directory is closed. The file tree walk then continues at the next

sibling

of the directory.

The stream is

weakly consistent

. It does not freeze the
file tree while iterating, so it may (or may not) reflect updates to
the file tree that occur after returned from this method.

By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
method. If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then symbolic links are
followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
be read, then this method attempts to get the

BasicFileAttributes

of the link.

If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then the stream keeps
track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the

file-key

of directories,
or if file keys are not available, by invoking the

isSameFile

method to test if a directory is the same file as an
ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error with
an instance of

FileSystemLoopException

.

The

maxDepth

parameter is the maximum number of levels of
directories to visit. A value of

0

means that only the starting
file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of

MAX_VALUE

may be used to indicate that all
levels should be visited.

When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
(or directory), then it is ignored and not included in the stream.

The returned stream contains references to one or more open directories.
The directories are closed by closing the stream.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the directory
after this method has returned, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the method that caused
the access to take place.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open directories are closed
promptly after the stream's operations have completed.
**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** maxDepth

- the maximum number of directory levels to visit
**Parameters:** options

- options to configure the traversal
**Returns:** the

Stream

of

Path
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

maxDepth

parameter is negative
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown when accessing the starting file.
**Since:** 1.8

- walk

```java
public static
Stream
<
Path
> walk​(
Path
start,

FileVisitOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Return a

Stream

that is lazily populated with

Path

by walking the file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree is traversed

depth-first

, the elements in the stream
are

Path

objects that are obtained as if by

resolving

the relative path against

start

.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
walk(start, Integer.MAX_VALUE, options)
```

In other words, it visits all levels of the file tree.

The returned stream contains references to one or more open directories.
The directories are closed by closing the stream.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open directories are closed
promptly after the stream's operations have completed.
**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** options

- options to configure the traversal
**Returns:** the

Stream

of

Path
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown when accessing the starting file.
**Since:** 1.8
**See Also:** walk(Path, int, FileVisitOption...)

- find

```java
public static
Stream
<
Path
> find​(
Path
start,
int maxDepth,

BiPredicate
<
Path
,​
BasicFileAttributes
> matcher,

FileVisitOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Return a

Stream

that is lazily populated with

Path

by searching for files in a file tree rooted at a given starting
file.

This method walks the file tree in exactly the manner specified by
the

walk

method. For each file encountered, the given

BiPredicate

is invoked with its

Path

and

BasicFileAttributes

. The

Path

object is obtained as if by

resolving

the relative path against

start

and is only included in the returned

Stream

if
the

BiPredicate

returns true. Compare to calling

filter

on the

Stream

returned by

walk

method, this method may be more efficient by
avoiding redundant retrieval of the

BasicFileAttributes

.

The returned stream contains references to one or more open directories.
The directories are closed by closing the stream.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the directory
after returned from this method, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the method that caused
the access to take place.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open directories are closed
promptly after the stream's operations have completed.
**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** maxDepth

- the maximum number of directory levels to search
**Parameters:** matcher

- the function used to decide whether a file should be included
in the returned stream
**Parameters:** options

- options to configure the traversal
**Returns:** the

Stream

of

Path
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

maxDepth

parameter is negative
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- lines

```java
public static
Stream
<
String
> lines​(
Path
path,

Charset
cs)
throws
IOException
```

Read all lines from a file as a

Stream

. Unlike

readAllLines

, this method does not read
all lines into a

List

, but instead populates lazily as the stream
is consumed.

Bytes from the file are decoded into characters using the specified
charset and the same line terminators as specified by

readAllLines

are supported.

The returned stream contains a reference to an open file. The file
is closed by closing the stream.

The file contents should not be modified during the execution of the
terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream
operation is undefined.

After this method returns, then any subsequent I/O exception that
occurs while reading from the file or when a malformed or unmappable byte
sequence is read, is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

that will
be thrown from the

Stream

method that caused the read to take
place. In case an

IOException

is thrown when closing the file,
it is also wrapped as an

UncheckedIOException

.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open file is closed promptly
after the stream's operations have completed.
**Implementation Note:** This implementation supports good parallel stream performance for the
standard charsets

UTF-8

,

US-ASCII

and

ISO-8859-1

. Such

line-optimal

charsets have the property that the encoded bytes
of a line feed ('\n') or a carriage return ('\r') are efficiently
identifiable from other encoded characters when randomly accessing the
bytes of the file.

For non-

line-optimal

charsets the stream source's
spliterator has poor splitting properties, similar to that of a
spliterator associated with an iterator or that associated with a stream
returned from

BufferedReader.lines()

. Poor splitting properties
can result in poor parallel stream performance.

For

line-optimal

charsets the stream source's spliterator
has good splitting properties, assuming the file contains a regular
sequence of lines. Good splitting properties can result in good parallel
stream performance. The spliterator for a

line-optimal

charset
takes advantage of the charset properties (a line feed or a carriage
return being efficient identifiable) such that when splitting it can
approximately divide the number of covered lines in half.
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** cs

- the charset to use for decoding
**Returns:** the lines from the file as a

Stream
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs opening the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

Read all lines from a file as a

Stream

. Bytes from the file are
decoded into characters using the

UTF-8

charset

.

The returned stream contains a reference to an open file. The file
is closed by closing the stream.

The file contents should not be modified during the execution of the
terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream
operation is undefined.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java

Method Detail

- newInputStream

```java
public static
InputStream
newInputStream​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens a file, returning an input stream to read from the file. The stream
will not be buffered, and is not required to support the

mark

or

reset

methods. The
stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Reading
commences at the beginning of the file. Whether the returned stream is

asynchronously closeable

and/or

interruptible

is highly
file system provider specific and therefore not specified.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
If no options are present then it is equivalent to opening the file with
the

READ

option. In addition to the

READ

option, an implementation may also support additional implementation
specific options.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to open
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** a new input stream
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if an invalid combination of options is specified
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

- newOutputStream

```java
public static
OutputStream
newOutputStream​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning an output stream that may be used to
write bytes to the file. The resulting stream will not be buffered. The
stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Whether
the returned stream is

asynchronously closeable

and/or

interruptible

is highly file system provider specific and
therefore not specified.

This method opens or creates a file in exactly the manner specified
by the

newByteChannel

method with the exception that the

READ

option may not be present in the array of options. If no options are
present then this method works as if the

CREATE

,

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

,
and

WRITE

options are present. In other
words, it opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't
exist, or initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to a size of

0

if it exists.

Usage Examples:

```java
Path path = ...

// truncate and overwrite an existing file, or create the file if
// it doesn't initially exist
OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(path);

// append to an existing file, fail if the file does not exist
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, APPEND);

// append to an existing file, create file if it doesn't initially exist
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, CREATE, APPEND);

// always create new file, failing if it already exists
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, CREATE_NEW);
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** a new output stream
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

options

contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.

- newByteChannel

```java
public static
SeekableByteChannel
newByteChannel​(
Path
path,

Set
<? extends
OpenOption
> options,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning a seekable byte channel to access the
file.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
The

READ

and

WRITE

options determine if the file should be
opened for reading and/or writing. If neither option (or the

APPEND

option) is present then the file is
opened for reading. By default reading or writing commence at the
beginning of the file.

In the addition to

READ

and

WRITE

, the following
options may be present:

Options

Option

Description

APPEND

If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
each invocation of the channel's

write

method first advances
the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
with the

READ

or

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

options.

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
for reading.

CREATE_NEW

If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
the file already exists or is a symbolic link. When creating a file the
check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it
does not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations.
This option is ignored when the file is opened only for reading.

CREATE

If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it
exists, otherwise a new file is created. This option is ignored if the

CREATE_NEW

option is also present or the file is opened only
for reading.

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

When this option is present then the implementation makes a

best effort

attempt to delete the file when closed by the

close

method. If the

close

method is not invoked then a

best effort

attempt is made to
delete the file when the Java virtual machine terminates.

SPARSE

When creating a new file this option is a

hint

that the
new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
a new file.

SYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

DSYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

An implementation may also support additional implementation specific
options.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when a new file is created.

In the case of the default provider, the returned seekable byte channel
is a

FileChannel

.

Usage Examples:

```java
Path path = ...

// open file for reading
ReadableByteChannel rbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(READ)));

// open file for writing to the end of an existing file, creating
// the file if it doesn't already exist
WritableByteChannel wbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE,APPEND));

// create file with initial permissions, opening it for both reading and writing
FileAttribute<Set<PosixFilePermission>> perms = ...
SeekableByteChannel sbc =
Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE_NEW,READ,WRITE), perms);
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file
**Returns:** a new seekable byte channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the set contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported open option is specified or the array contains
attributes that cannot be set atomically when creating the file
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file of that name already exists and the

CREATE_NEW

option is specified

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the path if the file is
opened for reading. The

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the path
if the file is opened for writing. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.

- newByteChannel

```java
public static
SeekableByteChannel
newByteChannel​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning a seekable byte channel to access the
file.

This method opens or creates a file in exactly the manner specified
by the

newByteChannel

method.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** a new seekable byte channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the set contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported open option is specified
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file of that name already exists and the

CREATE_NEW

option is specified

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the path if the file is
opened for reading. The

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the path
if the file is opened for writing. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.
**See Also:** FileChannel.open(Path,OpenOption[])

- newDirectoryStream

```java
public static
DirectoryStream
<
Path
> newDirectoryStream​(
Path
dir)
throws
IOException
```

Opens a directory, returning a

DirectoryStream

to iterate over
all entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
stream's

iterator

are of type

Path

, each one representing an entry in the directory. The

Path

objects are obtained as if by

resolving

the
name of the directory entry against

dir

.

When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
stream's

close

method should be invoked after iteration is
completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.

When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
stream is a

SecureDirectoryStream

.

**Parameters:** dir

- the path to the directory
**Returns:** a new and open

DirectoryStream

object
**Throws:** NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

- newDirectoryStream

```java
public static
DirectoryStream
<
Path
> newDirectoryStream​(
Path
dir,

String
glob)
throws
IOException
```

Opens a directory, returning a

DirectoryStream

to iterate over
the entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
stream's

iterator

are of type

Path

, each one representing an entry in the directory. The

Path

objects are obtained as if by

resolving

the
name of the directory entry against

dir

. The entries returned by
the iterator are filtered by matching the

String

representation
of their file names against the given

globbing

pattern.

For example, suppose we want to iterate over the files ending with
".java" in a directory:

```java
Path dir = ...
try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, "*.java")) {
:
}
```

The globbing pattern is specified by the

getPathMatcher

method.

When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
stream's

close

method should be invoked after iteration is
completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.

When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
stream is a

SecureDirectoryStream

.

**Parameters:** dir

- the path to the directory
**Parameters:** glob

- the glob pattern
**Returns:** a new and open

DirectoryStream

object
**Throws:** PatternSyntaxException

- if the pattern is invalid
**Throws:** NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

- newDirectoryStream

```java
public static
DirectoryStream
<
Path
> newDirectoryStream​(
Path
dir,

DirectoryStream.Filter
<? super
Path
> filter)
throws
IOException
```

Opens a directory, returning a

DirectoryStream

to iterate over
the entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
stream's

iterator

are of type

Path

, each one representing an entry in the directory. The

Path

objects are obtained as if by

resolving

the
name of the directory entry against

dir

. The entries returned by
the iterator are filtered by the given

filter

.

When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
stream's

close

method should be invoked after iteration is
completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.

Where the filter terminates due to an uncaught error or runtime
exception then it is propagated to the

hasNext

or

next

method. Where an

IOException

is thrown, it results in the

hasNext

or

next

method throwing a

DirectoryIteratorException

with the

IOException

as the cause.

When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
stream is a

SecureDirectoryStream

.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to iterate over the files in a directory that are
larger than 8K.

```java
DirectoryStream.Filter<Path> filter = new DirectoryStream.Filter<Path>() {
public boolean accept(Path file) throws IOException {
return (Files.size(file) > 8192L);
}
};
Path dir = ...
try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, filter)) {
:
}
```

**Parameters:** dir

- the path to the directory
**Parameters:** filter

- the directory stream filter
**Returns:** a new and open

DirectoryStream

object
**Throws:** NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

- createFile

```java
public static
Path
createFile​(
Path
path,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new and empty file, failing if the file already exists. The
check for the existence of the file and the creation of the new file if
it does not exist are a single operation that is atomic with respect to
all other filesystem activities that might affect the directory.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the file. Each attribute
is identified by its

name

. If more than one
attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but the last
occurrence is ignored.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to create
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file
**Returns:** the file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the file
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file of that name already exists

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the parent directory does not exist
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the new file.

- createDirectory

```java
public static
Path
createDirectory​(
Path
dir,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new directory. The check for the existence of the file and the
creation of the directory if it does not exist are a single operation
that is atomic with respect to all other filesystem activities that might
affect the directory. The

createDirectories

method should be used where it is required to create all nonexistent
parent directories first.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the directory. Each
attribute is identified by its

name

. If more
than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but
the last occurrence is ignored.

**Parameters:** dir

- the directory to create
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the directory
**Returns:** the directory
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a directory could not otherwise be created because a file of
that name already exists

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the parent directory does not exist
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the new directory.

- createDirectories

```java
public static
Path
createDirectories​(
Path
dir,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a directory by creating all nonexistent parent directories first.
Unlike the

createDirectory

method, an exception
is not thrown if the directory could not be created because it already
exists.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the nonexistent
directories. Each file attribute is identified by its

name

. If more than one attribute of the same name is
included in the array then all but the last occurrence is ignored.

If this method fails, then it may do so after creating some, but not
all, of the parent directories.

**Parameters:** dir

- the directory to create
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the directory
**Returns:** the directory
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if

dir

exists but is not a directory

(optional specific
exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- in the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked prior to attempting to create a directory and
its

checkRead

is
invoked for each parent directory that is checked. If

dir

is not an absolute path then its

toAbsolutePath

may need to be invoked to get its absolute path.
This may invoke the security manager's

checkPropertyAccess

method to check access to the system property

user.dir

- createTempFile

```java
public static
Path
createTempFile​(
Path
dir,

String
prefix,

String
suffix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new empty file in the specified directory, using the given
prefix and suffix strings to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is associated with the same

FileSystem

as the given
directory.

The details as to how the name of the file is constructed is
implementation dependent and therefore not specified. Where possible
the

prefix

and

suffix

are used to construct candidate
names in the same manner as the

File.createTempFile(String,String,File)

method.

As with the

File.createTempFile

methods, this method is only
part of a temporary-file facility. Where used as a

work files

,
the resulting file may be opened using the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option so that the
file is deleted when the appropriate

close

method is invoked.
Alternatively, a

shutdown-hook

, or the

File.deleteOnExit()

mechanism may be used to delete the
file automatically.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the file. Each attribute
is identified by its

name

. If more than one
attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but the last
occurrence is ignored. When no file attributes are specified, then the
resulting file may have more restrictive access permissions to files
created by the

File.createTempFile(String,String,File)

method.

**Parameters:** dir

- the path to directory in which to create the file
**Parameters:** prefix

- the prefix string to be used in generating the file's name;
may be

null

this method was invoked
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the prefix or suffix parameters cannot be used to generate
a candidate file name
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or

dir

does not exist
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file.

public static
Path
createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates an empty file in the default temporary-file directory, using
the given prefix and suffix to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is associated with the default

FileSystem

.

This method works in exactly the manner specified by the

createTempFile(Path,String,String,FileAttribute[])

method for
the case that the

dir

parameter is the temporary-file directory.

**Parameters:** prefix

when creating the directory
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the temporary-file directory does not
exist
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file.

- createTempDirectory

```java
public static
Path
createTempDirectory​(
Path
dir,

String
prefix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new directory in the specified directory, using the given
prefix to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is associated
with the same

FileSystem

as the given directory.

The details as to how the name of the directory is constructed is
implementation dependent and therefore not specified. Where possible
the

prefix

is used to construct candidate names.

As with the

createTempFile

methods, this method is only
part of a temporary-file facility. A

shutdown-hook

, or the

File.deleteOnExit()

mechanism may be
used to delete the directory automatically.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the directory. Each
attribute is identified by its

name

. If more
than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but
the last occurrence is ignored.

**Parameters:** dir

- the path to directory in which to create the directory
**Parameters:** prefix

- the prefix string to be used in generating the directory's name;
may be

null

when creating the directory
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or

dir

does not exist
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access when creating the
directory.

- createTempDirectory

```java
public static
Path
createTempDirectory​(
String
prefix,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new directory in the default temporary-file directory, using
the given prefix to generate its name. The resulting

Path

is
associated with the default

FileSystem

.

This method works in exactly the manner specified by

createTempDirectory(Path,String,FileAttribute[])

method for the case
that the

dir

parameter is the temporary-file directory.

**Parameters:** prefix

- the prefix string to be used in generating the directory's name;
may be

null
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the directory
**Returns:** the path to the newly created directory that did not exist before
this method was invoked
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the prefix cannot be used to generate a candidate directory name
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
when creating the directory
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs or the temporary-file directory does not
exist
**Throws:** SecurityException

method is invoked to check write access when creating the
directory.

- createSymbolicLink

```java
public static
Path
createSymbolicLink​(
Path
link,

Path
target,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a symbolic link to a target

(optional operation)

.

The

target

parameter is the target of the link. It may be an

absolute

or relative path and may not exist. When
the target is a relative path then file system operations on the resulting
link are relative to the path of the link.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

attributes

to set atomically when creating the link. Each attribute is
identified by its

name

. If more than one attribute
of the same name is included in the array then all but the last occurrence
is ignored.

Where symbolic links are supported, but the underlying

FileStore

does not support symbolic links, then this may fail with an

IOException

. Additionally, some operating systems may require that the
Java virtual machine be started with implementation specific privileges to
create symbolic links, in which case this method may throw

IOException

.

**Parameters:** link

- the path of the symbolic link to create
**Parameters:** target

- the target of the symbolic link
**Parameters:** attrs

- the array of attributes to set atomically when creating the
symbolic link
**Returns:** the path to the symbolic link
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation does not support symbolic links or the
array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically when
creating the symbolic link
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file with the name already exists

(optional specific
exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
is installed, it denies

LinkPermission

("symbolic")

or its

checkWrite

method denies write access to the path of the symbolic link.

- createLink

```java
public static
Path
createLink​(
Path
link,

Path
existing)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new link (directory entry) for an existing file

(optional
operation)

.

The

link

parameter locates the directory entry to create.
The

existing

parameter is the path to an existing file. This
method creates a new directory entry for the file so that it can be
accessed using

link

as the path. On some file systems this is
known as creating a "hard link". Whether the file attributes are
maintained for the file or for each directory entry is file system
specific and therefore not specified. Typically, a file system requires
that all links (directory entries) for a file be on the same file system.
Furthermore, on some platforms, the Java virtual machine may require to
be started with implementation specific privileges to create hard links
or to create links to directories.

**Parameters:** link

- the link (directory entry) to create
**Parameters:** existing

- a path to an existing file
**Returns:** the path to the link (directory entry)
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation does not support adding an existing file
to a directory
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the entry could not otherwise be created because a file of
that name already exists

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
is installed, it denies

LinkPermission

("hard")

or its

checkWrite

method denies write access to either the link or the
existing file.

- delete

```java
public static void delete​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Deletes a file.

An implementation may require to examine the file to determine if the
file is a directory. Consequently this method may not be atomic with respect
to other file system operations. If the file is a symbolic link then the
symbolic link itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted.

If the file is a directory then the directory must be empty. In some
implementations a directory has entries for special files or links that
are created when the directory is created. In such implementations a
directory is considered empty when only the special entries exist.
This method can be used with the

walkFileTree

method to delete a directory and all entries in the directory, or an
entire

file-tree

where required.

On some operating systems it may not be possible to remove a file when
it is open and in use by this Java virtual machine or other programs.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to delete
**Throws:** NoSuchFileException

- if the file does not exist

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- if the file is a directory and could not otherwise be deleted
because the directory is not empty

(optional specific
exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

SecurityManager.checkDelete(String)

method
is invoked to check delete access to the file

- deleteIfExists

```java
public static boolean deleteIfExists​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Deletes a file if it exists.

As with the

delete(Path)

method, an
implementation may need to examine the file to determine if the file is a
directory. Consequently this method may not be atomic with respect to
other file system operations. If the file is a symbolic link, then the
symbolic link itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted.

If the file is a directory then the directory must be empty. In some
implementations a directory has entries for special files or links that
are created when the directory is created. In such implementations a
directory is considered empty when only the special entries exist.

On some operating systems it may not be possible to remove a file when
it is open and in use by this Java virtual machine or other programs.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to delete
**Returns:** true

if the file was deleted by this method;

false

if the file could not be deleted because it did not
exist
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- if the file is a directory and could not otherwise be deleted
because the directory is not empty

(optional specific
exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

SecurityManager.checkDelete(String)

method
is invoked to check delete access to the file.

- copy

```java
public static
Path
copy​(
Path
source,

Path
target,

CopyOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Copy a file to a target file.

This method copies a file to the target file with the

options

parameter specifying how the copy is performed. By default, the
copy fails if the target file already exists or is a symbolic link,
except if the source and target are the

same

file, in
which case the method completes without copying the file. File attributes
are not required to be copied to the target file. If symbolic links are
supported, and the file is a symbolic link, then the final target of the
link is copied. If the file is a directory then it creates an empty
directory in the target location (entries in the directory are not
copied). This method can be used with the

walkFileTree

method to copy a directory and all entries in the directory,
or an entire

file-tree

where required.

The

options

parameter may include any of the following:

Options

Option

Description

REPLACE_EXISTING

If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
the link, is replaced.

COPY_ATTRIBUTES

Attempts to copy the file attributes associated with this file to
the target file. The exact file attributes that are copied is platform
and file system dependent and therefore unspecified. Minimally, the

last-modified-time

is
copied to the target file if supported by both the source and target
file stores. Copying of file timestamps may result in precision
loss.

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

Symbolic links are not followed. If the file is a symbolic link,
then the symbolic link itself, not the target of the link, is copied.
It is implementation specific if file attributes can be copied to the
new link. In other words, the

COPY_ATTRIBUTES

option may be
ignored when copying a symbolic link.

An implementation of this interface may support additional
implementation specific options.

Copying a file is not an atomic operation. If an

IOException

is thrown, then it is possible that the target file is incomplete or some
of its file attributes have not been copied from the source file. When
the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified and the target file
exists, then the target file is replaced. The check for the existence of
the file and the creation of the new file may not be atomic with respect
to other file system activities.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to copy a file into a directory, giving it the same file
name as the source file:

```java
Path source = ...
Path newdir = ...
Files.copy(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName());
```

**Parameters:** source

- the path to the file to copy
**Parameters:** target

- the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
provider to the source path)
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the copy should be done
**Returns:** the path to the target file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is not specified

(optional
specific exception)
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the source file, the

checkWrite

is invoked
to check write access to the target file. If a symbolic link is
copied the security manager is invoked to check

LinkPermission

("symbolic")

.

- move

```java
public static
Path
move​(
Path
source,

Path
target,

CopyOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Move or rename a file to a target file.

By default, this method attempts to move the file to the target
file, failing if the target file exists except if the source and
target are the

same

file, in which case this method
has no effect. If the file is a symbolic link then the symbolic link
itself, not the target of the link, is moved. This method may be
invoked to move an empty directory. In some implementations a directory
has entries for special files or links that are created when the
directory is created. In such implementations a directory is considered
empty when only the special entries exist. When invoked to move a
directory that is not empty then the directory is moved if it does not
require moving the entries in the directory. For example, renaming a
directory on the same

FileStore

will usually not require moving
the entries in the directory. When moving a directory requires that its
entries be moved then this method fails (by throwing an

IOException

). To move a

file tree

may involve copying rather
than moving directories and this can be done using the

copy

method in conjunction with the

Files.walkFileTree

utility method.

The

options

parameter may include any of the following:

Options

Option

Description

REPLACE_EXISTING

If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
the link, is replaced.

ATOMIC_MOVE

The move is performed as an atomic file system operation and all
other options are ignored. If the target file exists then it is
implementation specific if the existing file is replaced or this method
fails by throwing an

IOException

. If the move cannot be
performed as an atomic file system operation then

AtomicMoveNotSupportedException

is thrown. This can arise, for
example, when the target location is on a different

FileStore

and would require that the file be copied, or target location is
associated with a different provider to this object.

An implementation of this interface may support additional
implementation specific options.

Moving a file will copy the

last-modified-time

to the target
file if supported by both source and target file stores. Copying of file
timestamps may result in precision loss. An implementation may also
attempt to copy other file attributes but is not required to fail if the
file attributes cannot be copied. When the move is performed as
a non-atomic operation, and an

IOException

is thrown, then the
state of the files is not defined. The original file and the target file
may both exist, the target file may be incomplete or some of its file
attributes may not been copied from the original file.

Usage Examples:

Suppose we want to rename a file to "newname", keeping the file in the
same directory:

```java
Path source = ...
Files.move(source, source.resolveSibling("newname"));
```

Alternatively, suppose we want to move a file to new directory, keeping
the same file name, and replacing any existing file of that name in the
directory:

```java
Path source = ...
Path newdir = ...
Files.move(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName()), REPLACE_EXISTING);
```

**Parameters:** source

- the path to the file to move
**Parameters:** target

- the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
provider to the source path)
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the move should be done
**Returns:** the path to the target file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is not specified

(optional
specific exception)
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory, or the
source is a non-empty directory containing entries that would
be required to be moved

(optional specific exceptions)
**Throws:** AtomicMoveNotSupportedException

- if the options array contains the

ATOMIC_MOVE

option but
the file cannot be moved as an atomic file system operation.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to both the source and
target file.

- readSymbolicLink

```java
public static

readSymbolicLink​(
Path
link)
throws
IOException
```

Reads the target of a symbolic link

(optional operation)

.

If the file system supports

symbolic
links

then this method is used to read the target of the link, failing
if the file is not a symbolic link. The target of the link need not exist.
The returned

Path

object will be associated with the same file
system as

link

.

**Parameters:** link

- the path to the symbolic link
**Returns:** a

Path

object representing the target of the link
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation does not support symbolic links
**Throws:** NotLinkException

- if the target could otherwise not be read because the file
is not a symbolic link

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
is installed, it checks that

FilePermission

has been
granted with the "

readlink

" action to read the link.

- getFileStore

```java
public static
FileStore
getFileStore​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the

FileStore

representing the file store where a file
is located.

Once a reference to the

FileStore

is obtained it is
implementation specific if operations on the returned

FileStore

,
or

FileStoreAttributeView

objects obtained from it, continue
to depend on the existence of the file. In particular the behavior is not
defined for the case that the file is deleted or moved to a different
file store.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** the file store where the file is stored
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file, and in
addition it checks

RuntimePermission

("getFileStoreAttributes")

- isSameFile

```java
public static boolean isSameFile​(
Path
path,

Path
path2)
throws
IOException
```

Tests if two paths locate the same file.

If both

Path

objects are

equal

then this method returns

true

without checking if the file exists.
If the two

Path

objects are associated with different providers
then this method returns

false

. Otherwise, this method checks if
both

Path

objects locate the same file, and depending on the
implementation, may require to open or access both files.

If the file system and files remain static, then this method implements
an equivalence relation for non-null

Paths

.

- It is

reflexive

: for

Path

f

,

isSameFile(f,f)

should return

true

.

It is

symmetric

: for two

Paths

f

and

g

,

isSameFile(f,g)

will equal

isSameFile(g,f)

.

It is

transitive

: for three

Paths

f

,

g

, and

h

, if

isSameFile(f,g)

returns

true

and

isSameFile(g,h)

returns

true

, then

isSameFile(f,h)

will return

true

.

**Parameters:** path

- one path to the file
**Parameters:** path2

- the other path
**Returns:** true

if, and only if, the two paths locate the same file
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to both files.
**See Also:** BasicFileAttributes.fileKey()

- isHidden

```java
public static boolean isHidden​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Tells whether or not a file is considered

hidden

. The exact
definition of hidden is platform or provider dependent. On UNIX for
example a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with a
period character ('.'). On Windows a file is considered hidden if it
isn't a directory and the DOS

hidden

attribute is set.

Depending on the implementation this method may require to access
the file system to determine if the file is considered hidden.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to test
**Returns:** true

if the file is considered hidden
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

- probeContentType

```java
public static
String
probeContentType​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Probes the content type of a file.

This method uses the installed

FileTypeDetector

implementations
to probe the given file to determine its content type. Each file type
detector's

probeContentType

is
invoked, in turn, to probe the file type. If the file is recognized then
the content type is returned. If the file is not recognized by any of the
installed file type detectors then a system-default file type detector is
invoked to guess the content type.

A given invocation of the Java virtual machine maintains a system-wide
list of file type detectors. Installed file type detectors are loaded
using the service-provider loading facility defined by the

ServiceLoader

class. Installed file type detectors are loaded using the system class
loader. If the system class loader cannot be found then the platform class
loader is used. File type detectors are typically installed
by placing them in a JAR file on the application class path,
the JAR file contains a provider-configuration file
named

java.nio.file.spi.FileTypeDetector

in the resource directory

META-INF/services

, and the file lists one or more fully-qualified
names of concrete subclass of

FileTypeDetector

that have a zero
argument constructor. If the process of locating or instantiating the
installed file type detectors fails then an unspecified error is thrown.
The ordering that installed providers are located is implementation
specific.

The return value of this method is the string form of the value of a
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) content type as
defined by

RFC 2045:
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet
Message Bodies

. The string is guaranteed to be parsable according
to the grammar in the RFC.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to probe
**Returns:** The content type of the file, or

null

if the content
type cannot be determined
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
permission required by a file type detector implementation.

- getFileAttributeView

```java
public static <V extends
FileAttributeView
> V getFileAttributeView​(
Path
path,

Class
<V> type,

LinkOption
... options)
```

Returns a file attribute view of a given type.

A file attribute view provides a read-only or updatable view of a
set of file attributes. This method is intended to be used where the file
attribute view defines type-safe methods to read or update the file
attributes. The

type

parameter is the type of the attribute view
required and the method returns an instance of that type if supported.
The

BasicFileAttributeView

type supports access to the basic
attributes of a file. Invoking this method to select a file attribute
view of that type will always return an instance of that class.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled by the resulting file attribute view for the case that the
file is a symbolic link. By default, symbolic links are followed. If the
option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then
symbolic links are not followed. This option is ignored by implementations
that do not support symbolic links.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want read or set a file's ACL, if supported:

```java
Path path = ...
AclFileAttributeView view = Files.getFileAttributeView(path, AclFileAttributeView.class);
if (view != null) {
List<AclEntry> acl = view.getAcl();
:
}
```

**Type Parameters:** V

- The

FileAttributeView

type
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** type

- the

Class

object corresponding to the file attribute view
**Parameters:** options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
**Returns:** a file attribute view of the specified type, or

null

if
the attribute view type is not available

- readAttributes

```java
public static <A extends
BasicFileAttributes
> A readAttributes​(
Path
path,

Class
<A> type,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Reads a file's attributes as a bulk operation.

The

type

parameter is the type of the attributes required
and this method returns an instance of that type if supported. All
implementations support a basic set of file attributes and so invoking
this method with a

type

parameter of

BasicFileAttributes.class

will not throw

UnsupportedOperationException

.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is read. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

It is implementation specific if all file attributes are read as an
atomic operation with respect to other file system operations.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to read a file's attributes in bulk:

```java
Path path = ...
BasicFileAttributes attrs = Files.readAttributes(path, BasicFileAttributes.class);
```

Alternatively, suppose we want to read file's POSIX attributes without
following symbolic links:

```java
PosixFileAttributes attrs =
Files.readAttributes(path, PosixFileAttributes.class, NOFOLLOW_LINKS);
```

**Type Parameters:** A

- The

BasicFileAttributes

type
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** type

- the

Class

of the file attributes required
to read
**Parameters:** options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
**Returns:** the file attributes
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an attributes of the given type are not supported
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file. If this
method is invoked to read security sensitive attributes then the
security manager may be invoke to check for additional permissions.

- setAttribute

```java
public static
Path
setAttribute​(
Path
path,

String
attribute,

Object
value,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the value of a file attribute.

The

attribute

parameter identifies the attribute to be set
and takes the form:

[

view-name

:

]

attribute-name

where square brackets [...] delineate an optional component and the
character

':'

stands for itself.

view-name

is the

name

of a

FileAttributeView

that identifies a set of file attributes. If not
specified then it defaults to

"basic"

, the name of the file
attribute view that identifies the basic set of file attributes common to
many file systems.

attribute-name

is the name of the attribute
within the set.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is set. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to set the DOS "hidden" attribute:

```java
Path path = ...
Files.setAttribute(path, "dos:hidden", true);
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** attribute

- the attribute to set
**Parameters:** value

- the attribute value
**Parameters:** options

the attribute value is of the correct type but has an
inappropriate value
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the attribute value is not of the expected type or is a
collection containing elements that are not of the expected
type
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file. If this method is invoked
to set security sensitive attributes then the security manager
may be invoked to check for additional permissions.

- getAttribute

```java
public static
Object
getAttribute​(
Path
path,

String
attribute,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Reads the value of a file attribute.

The

attribute

parameter identifies the attribute to be read
and takes the form:

[

view-name

:

]

attribute-name

where square brackets [...] delineate an optional component and the
character

':'

stands for itself.

view-name

is the

name

of a

FileAttributeView

that identifies a set of file attributes. If not
specified then it defaults to

"basic"

, the name of the file
attribute view that identifies the basic set of file attributes common to
many file systems.

attribute-name

is the name of the attribute.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
of the link is read. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Usage Example:

Suppose we require the user ID of the file owner on a system that
supports a "

unix

" view:

```java
Path path = ...
int uid = (Integer)Files.getAttribute(path, "unix:uid");
```

**Parameters:** path

**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the attribute name is not specified or is not recognized
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file. If this method is invoked
to read security sensitive attributes then the security manager
may be invoked to check for additional permissions.

- readAttributes

```java
public static
Map
<
String
,​
Object
> readAttributes​(
Path
path,

String
attributes,

LinkOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Reads a set of file attributes as a bulk operation.

The

attributes

parameter identifies the attributes to be read
and takes the form:

[

view-name

:

]

attribute-list

where square brackets [...] delineate an optional component and the
character

':'

stands for itself.

view-name

is the

name

of a

FileAttributeView

that identifies a set of file attributes. If not
specified then it defaults to

"basic"

, the name of the file
attribute view that identifies the basic set of file attributes common to
many file systems.

The

attribute-list

component is a comma separated list of
one or more names of attributes to read. If the list contains the value

"*"

then all attributes are read. Attributes that are not supported
are ignored and will not be present in the returned map. It is
implementation specific if all attributes are read as an atomic operation
with respect to other file system operations.

The following examples demonstrate possible values for the

attributes

parameter:

Path
setLastModifiedTime​(
Path
path,

FileTime
time)
throws
IOException
```

Updates a file's last modified time attribute. The file time is converted
to the epoch and precision supported by the file system. Converting from
finer to coarser granularities result in precision loss. The behavior of
this method when attempting to set the last modified time when it is not
supported by the file system or is outside the range supported by the
underlying file store is not defined. It may or not fail by throwing an

IOException

.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to set the last modified time to the current time:

public static long size​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the size of a file (in bytes). The size may differ from the
actual size on the file system due to compression, support for sparse
files, or other reasons. The size of files that are not

regular

files is implementation specific and
therefore unspecified.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** the file size, in bytes
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file.
**See Also:** BasicFileAttributes.size()

- exists

```java
public static boolean exists​(
Path
path,

LinkOption
... options)
```

Tests whether a file exists.

The

options

parameter may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated. If this
method indicates the file exists then there is no guarantee that a
subsequent access will succeed. Care should be taken when using this
method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to test
**Parameters:** options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
.
**Returns:** true

if the file exists;

false

if the file does
not exist or its existence cannot be determined.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

is invoked to check
read access to the file.
**See Also:** notExists(java.nio.file.Path, java.nio.file.LinkOption...)

- notExists

```java
public static boolean notExists​(
Path
path,

LinkOption
... options)
```

Tests whether the file located by this path does not exist. This method
is intended for cases where it is required to take action when it can be
confirmed that a file does not exist.

The

options

parameter may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
symbolic links are followed. If the option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then symbolic links are not followed.

Note that this method is not the complement of the

exists

method. Where it is not possible to determine if a file exists
or not then both methods return

false

. As with the

exists

method, the result of this method is immediately outdated. If this
method indicates the file does exist then there is no guarantee that a
subsequent attempt to create the file will succeed. Care should be taken
when using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to test
**Parameters:** options

- options indicating how symbolic links are handled
**Returns:** true

if the file does not exist;

false

if the
file exists or its existence cannot be determined
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

is invoked to check
read access to the file.

- isReadable

```java
public static boolean isReadable​(
Path
path)
```

Tests whether a file is readable. This method checks that a file exists
and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges that would
allow it open the file for reading. Depending on the implementation, this
method may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or
other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file.
Consequently, this method may not be atomic with respect to other file
system operations.

Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated, there is
no guarantee that a subsequent attempt to open the file for reading will
succeed (or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken
when using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to check
**Returns:** true

if the file exists and is readable;

false

if the file does not exist, read access would be denied because
the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
cannot be determined
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

is invoked to check read access to the file.

- isWritable

```java
public static boolean isWritable​(
Path
path)
```

Tests whether a file is writable. This method checks that a file exists
and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges that would
allow it open the file for writing. Depending on the implementation, this
method may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or
other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file.
Consequently, this method may not be atomic with respect to other file
system operations.

Note that result of this method is immediately outdated, there is no
guarantee that a subsequent attempt to open the file for writing will
succeed (or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken
when using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to check
**Returns:** true

if the file exists and is writable;

false

if the file does not exist, write access would be denied because
the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
cannot be determined
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

is invoked to check write access to the file.

- isExecutable

```java
public static boolean isExecutable​(
Path
path)
```

Tests whether a file is executable. This method checks that a file exists
and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges to

execute

the file. The semantics may differ when checking
access to a directory. For example, on UNIX systems, checking for
execute access checks that the Java virtual machine has permission to
search the directory in order to access file or subdirectories.

Depending on the implementation, this method may require to read file
permissions, access control lists, or other file attributes in order to
check the effective access to the file. Consequently, this method may not
be atomic with respect to other file system operations.

Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated, there is
no guarantee that a subsequent attempt to execute the file will succeed
(or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken when
using this method in security sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to check
**Returns:** true

if the file exists and is executable;

false

if the file does not exist, execute access would be denied because
the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
cannot be determined
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkExec

is invoked to check execute access to the file.

- walkFileTree

```java
public static
Path
walkFileTree​(
Path
start,

Set
<
FileVisitOption
> options,
int maxDepth,

FileVisitor
<? super
Path
> visitor)
throws
IOException
```

Walks a file tree.

This method walks a file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree traversal is

depth-first

with the given

FileVisitor

invoked for each file encountered. File tree traversal
completes when all accessible files in the tree have been visited, or a
visit method returns a result of

TERMINATE

. Where a visit method terminates due an

IOException

,
an uncaught error, or runtime exception, then the traversal is terminated
and the error or exception is propagated to the caller of this method.

For each file encountered this method attempts to read its

BasicFileAttributes

. If the file is not a
directory then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the file attributes. If the file attributes cannot be read,
due to an I/O exception, then the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with the I/O exception.

Where the file is a directory, and the directory could not be opened,
then the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with the I/O exception,
after which, the file tree walk continues, by default, at the next

sibling

of the directory.

Where the directory is opened successfully, then the entries in the
directory, and their

descendants

are visited. When all entries
have been visited, or an I/O error occurs during iteration of the
directory, then the directory is closed and the visitor's

postVisitDirectory

method is invoked.
The file tree walk then continues, by default, at the next

sibling

of the directory.

By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
method. If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then symbolic links are
followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
be read, then this method attempts to get the

BasicFileAttributes

of the link. If they can be read then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the attributes of the link (otherwise the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked as specified above).

If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then this method keeps
track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the

file-key

of directories,
or if file keys are not available, by invoking the

isSameFile

method to test if a directory is the same file as an
ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error, and the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with
an instance of

FileSystemLoopException

.

The

maxDepth

parameter is the maximum number of levels of
directories to visit. A value of

0

means that only the starting
file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of

MAX_VALUE

may be used to indicate that all
levels should be visited. The

visitFile

method is invoked for all
files, including directories, encountered at

maxDepth

, unless the
basic file attributes cannot be read, in which case the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked.

If a visitor returns a result of

null

then

NullPointerException

is thrown.

When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
(or directory), then it is ignored and the visitor is not invoked for
that file (or directory).

**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** options

- options to configure the traversal
**Parameters:** maxDepth

- the maximum number of directory levels to visit
**Parameters:** visitor

- the file visitor to invoke for each file
**Returns:** the starting file
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

maxDepth

parameter is negative
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown by a visitor method

- walkFileTree

```java
public static
Path
walkFileTree​(
Path
start,

FileVisitor
<? super
Path
> visitor)
throws
IOException
```

Walks a file tree.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
walkFileTree(start, EnumSet.noneOf(FileVisitOption.class), Integer.MAX_VALUE, visitor)
```

In other words, it does not follow symbolic links, and visits all levels
of the file tree.

**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** visitor

- the file visitor to invoke for each file
**Returns:** the starting file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown by a visitor method

BufferedReader

that may be
used to read text from the file in an efficient manner. Bytes from the
file are decoded into characters using the specified charset. Reading
commences at the beginning of the file.

```

Opens or creates a file for writing, returning a

BufferedWriter

that may be used to write text to the file in an efficient manner.
The

options

parameter specifies how the file is created or
opened. If no options are present then this method works as if the

CREATE

,

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

, and

WRITE

options are present. In other words, it
opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't exist, or
initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to
a size of

0

if it exists.

The

Writer

methods to write text throw

Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file for writing, returning a

BufferedWriter

to write text to the file in an efficient manner. The text is encoded
into bytes for writing using the

UTF-8

charset

.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
Files.newBufferedWriter(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8, options)
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** a new buffered writer, with default buffer size, to write text
to the file
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

options

contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs opening or creating the file

**Since:** 1.8

- copy

```java
public static long copy​(
InputStream
in,

Path
target,

CopyOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Copies all bytes from an input stream to a file. On return, the input
stream will be at end of stream.

By default, the copy fails if the target file already exists or is a
symbolic link. If the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified, and the target file already exists,
then it is replaced if it is not a non-empty directory. If the target
file exists and is a symbolic link, then the symbolic link is replaced.
In this release, the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is the only option
required to be supported by this method. Additional options may be
supported in future releases.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to
the file, then it may do so after the target file has been created and
after some bytes have been read or written. Consequently the input
stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
It is strongly recommended that the input stream be promptly closed if an
I/O error occurs.

This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream (or
writing to the file). The behavior for the case that the input stream is

asynchronously closed

or the thread interrupted during the copy is
highly input stream and file system provider specific and therefore not
specified.

Usage example

: Suppose we want to capture a web page and save
it to a file:

```java
Path path = ...
URI u = URI.create("http://java.sun.com/");
try (InputStream in = u.toURL().openStream()) {
Files.copy(in, path);
}
```

**Parameters:** in

- the input stream to read from
**Parameters:** target

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the copy should be done
**Returns:** the number of bytes read or written
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is not specified

(optional
specific exception)
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory

(optional specific exception)

*
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if

options

contains a copy option that is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file. Where the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified, the security
manager's

checkDelete

method is invoked to check that an existing file can be deleted.

- copy

```java
public static long copy​(
Path
source,

OutputStream
out)
throws
IOException
```

Copies all bytes from a file to an output stream.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the file or writing to the output
stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or written.
Consequently the output stream may be in an inconsistent state. It is
strongly recommended that the output stream be promptly closed if an I/O
error occurs.

This method may block indefinitely writing to the output stream (or
reading from the file). The behavior for the case that the output stream
is

asynchronously closed

or the thread interrupted during the copy
is highly output stream and file system provider specific and therefore
not specified.

Note that if the given output stream is

Flushable

then its

flush

method may need to invoked
after this method completes so as to flush any buffered output.

**Parameters:** source

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** out

- the output stream to write to
**Returns:** the number of bytes read or written
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

- readAllBytes

```java

closed when all bytes have been read or an I/O error, or other runtime
exception, is thrown.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read all bytes into a byte array. It is not intended for
reading in large files.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** a byte array containing the bytes read from the file
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs reading from the stream

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

- readString

```java
public static
String
readString​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

or an I/O error, or other runtime exception, is thrown.

This method is equivalent to:

readString(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** a String containing the content read from the file
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs reading from the file or a malformed or
unmappable byte sequence is read

charset

.
The method ensures that the file is closed when all content have been read
or an I/O error, or other runtime exception, is thrown.

This method reads all content including the line separators in the middle
and/or at the end. The resulting string will contain line separators as they
appear in the file.

**API Note:** This method is intended for simple cases where it is appropriate and convenient
to read the content of a file into a String. It is not intended for reading
very large files.
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** cs

- the charset to use for decoding
**Returns:** a String containing the content read from the file

throws
IOException
```

Read all lines from a file. This method ensures that the file is
closed when all bytes have been read or an I/O error, or other runtime
exception, is thrown. Bytes from the file are decoded into characters
using the specified charset.

This method recognizes the following as line terminators:

- \u000D

followed by

\u000A

,
CARRIAGE RETURN followed by LINE FEED
- \u000A

, LINE FEED
- \u000D

, CARRIAGE RETURN

Additional Unicode line terminators may be recognized in future
releases.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read all lines in a single operation. It is not intended
for reading in large files.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** cs

- the charset to use for decoding
**Returns:** the lines from the file as a

List

; whether the

List

is modifiable or not is implementation dependent and
therefore not specified

- write

```java
public static
Path
write​(
Path
path,
byte[] bytes,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

options

parameter specifies how
the file is created or opened. If no options are present then this method
works as if the

CREATE

,

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

, and

WRITE

options are present. In other words, it
opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't exist, or
initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to
a size of

0

. All bytes in the byte array are written to the file.
The method ensures that the file is closed when all bytes have been
written (or an I/O error or other runtime exception is thrown). If an I/O
error occurs then it may do so after the file has been created or
truncated, or after some bytes have been written to the file.

Usage example

: By default the method creates a new file or
overwrites an existing file. Suppose you instead want to append bytes
to an existing file:

**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** the path
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

options

contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs writing to or creating the file, or the
text cannot be encoded using the specified charset
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the file. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.

- list

```java
public static
Stream
<
Path
> list​(
Path
dir)
throws
IOException
```

Return a lazily populated

Stream

, the elements of
which are the entries in the directory. The listing is not recursive.

The elements of the stream are

Path

objects that are
obtained as if by

resolving

the name of the
directory entry against

dir

. Some file systems maintain special
links to the directory itself and the directory's parent directory.
Entries representing these links are not included.

The stream is

weakly consistent

. It is thread safe but does
not freeze the directory while iterating, so it may (or may not)
reflect updates to the directory that occur after returning from this
method.

The returned stream contains a reference to an open directory.
The directory is closed by closing the stream.

Operating on a closed stream behaves as if the end of stream
has been reached. Due to read-ahead, one or more elements may be
returned after the stream has been closed.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the directory
after this method has returned, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the method that caused
the access to take place.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open directory is closed
promptly after the stream's operations have completed.
**Parameters:** dir

- The path to the directory
**Returns:** The

Stream

describing the content of the
directory
**Throws:** NotDirectoryException

- if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
a directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when opening the directory
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the directory.

- walk

```java
public static
Stream
<
Path
> walk​(
Path
start,
int maxDepth,

FileVisitOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Return a

Stream

that is lazily populated with

Path

by walking the file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree is traversed

depth-first

, the elements in the stream
are

Path

objects that are obtained as if by

resolving

the relative path against

start

.

The

stream

walks the file tree as elements are consumed.
The

Stream

returned is guaranteed to have at least one
element, the starting file itself. For each file visited, the stream
attempts to read its

BasicFileAttributes

. If the file is a
directory and can be opened successfully, entries in the directory, and
their

descendants

will follow the directory in the stream as
they are encountered. When all entries have been visited, then the
directory is closed. The file tree walk then continues at the next

sibling

of the directory.

The stream is

weakly consistent

. It does not freeze the
file tree while iterating, so it may (or may not) reflect updates to
the file tree that occur after returned from this method.

By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
method. If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then symbolic links are
followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
be read, then this method attempts to get the

BasicFileAttributes

of the link.

If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then the stream keeps
track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the

file-key

of directories,
or if file keys are not available, by invoking the

isSameFile

method to test if a directory is the same file as an
ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error with
an instance of

FileSystemLoopException

.

The

maxDepth

parameter is the maximum number of levels of
directories to visit. A value of

0

means that only the starting
file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of

MAX_VALUE

may be used to indicate that all
levels should be visited.

When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
(or directory), then it is ignored and not included in the stream.

The returned stream contains references to one or more open directories.
The directories are closed by closing the stream.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the directory
after this method has returned, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the method that caused
the access to take place.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open directories are closed
promptly after the stream's operations have completed.
**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** maxDepth

- the maximum number of directory levels to visit
**Parameters:** options

- options to configure the traversal
**Returns:** the

Stream

of

Path
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

maxDepth

parameter is negative
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown when accessing the starting file.
**Since:** 1.8

- walk

```java
public static
Stream
<
Path
> walk​(
Path
start,

FileVisitOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Return a

Stream

that is lazily populated with

Path

by walking the file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree is traversed

depth-first

, the elements in the stream
are

Path

objects that are obtained as if by

resolving

the relative path against

start

.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
walk(start, Integer.MAX_VALUE, options)
```

In other words, it visits all levels of the file tree.

The returned stream contains references to one or more open directories.
The directories are closed by closing the stream.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open directories are closed
promptly after the stream's operations have completed.
**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** options

- options to configure the traversal
**Returns:** the

Stream

of

Path
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown when accessing the starting file.
**Since:** 1.8
**See Also:** walk(Path, int, FileVisitOption...)

- find

```java
public static
Stream
<
Path
> find​(
Path
start,
int maxDepth,

BiPredicate
<
Path
,​
BasicFileAttributes
> matcher,

FileVisitOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Return a

Stream

that is lazily populated with

Path

by searching for files in a file tree rooted at a given starting
file.

This method walks the file tree in exactly the manner specified by
the

walk

method. For each file encountered, the given

BiPredicate

is invoked with its

Path

and

BasicFileAttributes

. The

Path

object is obtained as if by

resolving

the relative path against

start

and is only included in the returned

Stream

if
the

BiPredicate

returns true. Compare to calling

filter

on the

Stream

returned by

walk

method, this method may be more efficient by
avoiding redundant retrieval of the

BasicFileAttributes

.

The returned stream contains references to one or more open directories.
The directories are closed by closing the stream.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the directory
after returned from this method, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the method that caused
the access to take place.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open directories are closed
promptly after the stream's operations have completed.
**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** maxDepth

- the maximum number of directory levels to search
**Parameters:** matcher

- the function used to decide whether a file should be included
in the returned stream
**Parameters:** options

- options to configure the traversal
**Returns:** the

Stream

of

Path
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

maxDepth

parameter is negative
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown when accessing the starting file.
**Since:** 1.8

- lines

```java
public static
Stream
<
String
> lines​(
Path
path,

Charset
cs)
throws
IOException
```

Read all lines from a file as a

Stream

. Unlike

readAllLines

, this method does not read
all lines into a

List

, but instead populates lazily as the stream
is consumed.

Bytes from the file are decoded into characters using the specified
charset and the same line terminators as specified by

readAllLines

are supported.

The returned stream contains a reference to an open file. The file
is closed by closing the stream.

The file contents should not be modified during the execution of the
terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream
operation is undefined.

After this method returns, then any subsequent I/O exception that
occurs while reading from the file or when a malformed or unmappable byte
sequence is read, is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

that will
be thrown from the

Stream

method that caused the read to take
place. In case an

IOException

is thrown when closing the file,
it is also wrapped as an

UncheckedIOException

.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open file is closed promptly
after the stream's operations have completed.
**Implementation Note:** This implementation supports good parallel stream performance for the
standard charsets

UTF-8

,

US-ASCII

and

ISO-8859-1

. Such

line-optimal

charsets have the property that the encoded bytes
of a line feed ('\n') or a carriage return ('\r') are efficiently
identifiable from other encoded characters when randomly accessing the
bytes of the file.

For non-

line-optimal

charsets the stream source's
spliterator has poor splitting properties, similar to that of a
spliterator associated with an iterator or that associated with a stream
returned from

BufferedReader.lines()

. Poor splitting properties
can result in poor parallel stream performance.

For

line-optimal

charsets the stream source's spliterator
has good splitting properties, assuming the file contains a regular
sequence of lines. Good splitting properties can result in good parallel
stream performance. The spliterator for a

line-optimal

charset
takes advantage of the charset properties (a line feed or a carriage
return being efficient identifiable) such that when splitting it can
approximately divide the number of covered lines in half.
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** cs

- the charset to use for decoding
**Returns:** the lines from the file as a

Stream
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs opening the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.
**Since:** 1.8

```

Read all lines from a file as a

Stream

. Bytes from the file are
decoded into characters using the

UTF-8

charset

.

The returned stream contains a reference to an open file. The file
is closed by closing the stream.

The file contents should not be modified during the execution of the
terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream
operation is undefined.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
Files.lines(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
```

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open file is closed promptly
after the stream's operations have completed.
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** the lines from the file as a

Stream
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs opening the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

#### Method Detail

newInputStream

```java
public static
InputStream
newInputStream​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens a file, returning an input stream to read from the file. The stream
will not be buffered, and is not required to support the

mark

or

reset

methods. The
stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Reading
commences at the beginning of the file. Whether the returned stream is

asynchronously closeable

and/or

interruptible

is highly
file system provider specific and therefore not specified.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
If no options are present then it is equivalent to opening the file with
the

READ

option. In addition to the

READ

option, an implementation may also support additional implementation
specific options.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to open
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** a new input stream
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if an invalid combination of options is specified
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported option is specified
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.

newOutputStream

```java
public static
OutputStream
newOutputStream​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning an output stream that may be used to
write bytes to the file. The resulting stream will not be buffered. The
stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Whether
the returned stream is

asynchronously closeable

and/or

interruptible

is highly file system provider specific and
therefore not specified.

This method opens or creates a file in exactly the manner specified
by the

newByteChannel

method with the exception that the

READ

option may not be present in the array of options. If no options are
present then this method works as if the

CREATE

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

,
and

WRITE

options are present. In other
words, it opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't
exist, or initially truncating an existing

regular-file

to a size of

0

if it exists.

Usage Examples:

```java
Path path = ...

// truncate and overwrite an existing file, or create the file if
// it doesn't initially exist
OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(path);

// append to an existing file, fail if the file does not exist
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, APPEND);

// append to an existing file, create file if it doesn't initially exist
out = Files.newOutputStream(path, CREATE, APPEND);

// always create new file, failing if it already exists

```java
public static
SeekableByteChannel
newByteChannel​(
Path
path,

Set
<? extends
OpenOption
> options,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning a seekable byte channel to access the
file.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
The

READ

and

WRITE

options determine if the file should be
opened for reading and/or writing. If neither option (or the

APPEND

option) is present then the file is
opened for reading. By default reading or writing commence at the
beginning of the file.

In the addition to

READ

and

WRITE

, the following
options may be present:

Options

Option

Description

APPEND

If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
each invocation of the channel's

write

method first advances
the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
with the

READ

or

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

options.

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
for reading.

CREATE_NEW

If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
the file already exists or is a symbolic link. When creating a file the
check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it
does not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations.
This option is ignored when the file is opened only for reading.

CREATE

If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it
exists, otherwise a new file is created. This option is ignored if the

CREATE_NEW

option is also present or the file is opened only
for reading.

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

When this option is present then the implementation makes a

best effort

attempt to delete the file when closed by the

close

method. If the

close

method is not invoked then a

best effort

attempt is made to
delete the file when the Java virtual machine terminates.

SPARSE

When creating a new file this option is a

hint

that the
new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
a new file.

SYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

DSYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

An implementation may also support additional implementation specific
options.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when a new file is created.

In the case of the default provider, the returned seekable byte channel
is a

FileChannel

.

Usage Examples:

```java
Path path = ...

// open file for reading
ReadableByteChannel rbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(READ)));

// open file for writing to the end of an existing file, creating
// the file if it doesn't already exist
WritableByteChannel wbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE,APPEND));

// create file with initial permissions, opening it for both reading and writing
FileAttribute<Set<PosixFilePermission>> perms = ...
SeekableByteChannel sbc =
Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE_NEW,READ,WRITE), perms);
```

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the file is opened
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file
**Returns:** a new seekable byte channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the set contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if an unsupported open option is specified or the array contains
attributes that cannot be set atomically when creating the file
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if a file of that name already exists and the

CREATE_NEW

option is specified

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the path if the file is
opened for reading. The

checkWrite

method is invoked to check write access to the path
if the file is opened for writing. The

checkDelete

method is
invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

option.

```

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
The

READ

and

WRITE

options determine if the file should be
opened for reading and/or writing. If neither option (or the

APPEND

option) is present then the file is
opened for reading. By default reading or writing commence at the
beginning of the file.

In the addition to

READ

and

WRITE

, the following
options may be present:

Options

Option

Description

APPEND

If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
each invocation of the channel's

write

method first advances
the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
with the

READ

or

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

options.

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
for reading.

CREATE_NEW

If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
the file already exists or is a symbolic link. When creating a file the
check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it
does not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations.
This option is ignored when the file is opened only for reading.

CREATE

If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it
exists, otherwise a new file is created. This option is ignored if the

CREATE_NEW

option is also present or the file is opened only
for reading.

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

When this option is present then the implementation makes a

best effort

attempt to delete the file when closed by the

close

method. If the

close

method is not invoked then a

best effort

attempt is made to
delete the file when the Java virtual machine terminates.

SPARSE

When creating a new file this option is a

hint

that the
new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
a new file.

SYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

DSYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

An implementation may also support additional implementation specific
options.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when a new file is created.

In the case of the default provider, the returned seekable byte channel
is a

FileChannel

.

Usage Examples:

```java
Path path = ...

// open file for reading
ReadableByteChannel rbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(READ)));

// open file for writing to the end of an existing file, creating
// the file if it doesn't already exist
WritableByteChannel wbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE,APPEND));

// create file with initial permissions, opening it for both reading and writing
FileAttribute<Set<PosixFilePermission>> perms = ...
SeekableByteChannel sbc =
Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE_NEW,READ,WRITE), perms);

Creates a new directory. The check for the existence of the file and the
creation of the directory if it does not exist are a single operation
that is atomic with respect to all other filesystem activities that might
affect the directory. The

createDirectories

method should be used where it is required to create all nonexistent
parent directories first.

The

attrs

parameter is optional

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the directory. Each
attribute is identified by its

name

. If more
than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but
the last occurrence is ignored.

all, of the parent directories.

**Parameters:** dir

- the directory to create
**Parameters:** attrs

- an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the directory
**Returns:** the directory
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- in the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

method is invoked prior to attempting to create a directory and
its

Deletes a file.

An implementation may require to examine the file to determine if the
file is a directory. Consequently this method may not be atomic with respect
to other file system operations. If the file is a symbolic link then the
symbolic link itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted.

If the file is a directory then the directory must be empty. In some
implementations a directory has entries for special files or links that
are created when the directory is created. In such implementations a
directory is considered empty when only the special entries exist.
This method can be used with the

directory is considered empty when only the special entries exist.

On some operating systems it may not be possible to remove a file when
it is open and in use by this Java virtual machine or other programs.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to delete
**Returns:** true

if the file was deleted by this method;

false

if the file could not be deleted because it did not
exist
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- if the file is a directory and could not otherwise be deleted
because the directory is not empty

(optional specific
exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

SecurityManager.checkDelete(String)

method
is invoked to check delete access to the file.

#### deleteIfExists

public static boolean deleteIfExists​(

Path

path)
throws

IOException

Deletes a file if it exists.

As with the

delete(Path)

method, an
implementation may need to examine the file to determine if the file is a
directory. Consequently this method may not be atomic with respect to
other file system operations. If the file is a symbolic link, then the
symbolic link itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted.

If the file is a directory then the directory must be empty. In some
implementations a directory has entries for special files or links that
are created when the directory is created. In such implementations a
directory is considered empty when only the special entries exist.

On some operating systems it may not be possible to remove a file when
it is open and in use by this Java virtual machine or other programs.

copy

```java
public static
Path
copy​(
Path
source,

Path
target,

CopyOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Copy a file to a target file.

This method copies a file to the target file with the

options

parameter specifying how the copy is performed. By default, the
copy fails if the target file already exists or is a symbolic link,
except if the source and target are the

same

file, in
which case the method completes without copying the file. File attributes
are not required to be copied to the target file. If symbolic links are
supported, and the file is a symbolic link, then the final target of the
link is copied. If the file is a directory then it creates an empty
directory in the target location (entries in the directory are not
copied). This method can be used with the

walkFileTree

method to copy a directory and all entries in the directory,
or an entire

file-tree

where required.

The

options

parameter may include any of the following:

Options

Option

Description

REPLACE_EXISTING

If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
the link, is replaced.

COPY_ATTRIBUTES

Attempts to copy the file attributes associated with this file to
the target file. The exact file attributes that are copied is platform
and file system dependent and therefore unspecified. Minimally, the

last-modified-time

is
copied to the target file if supported by both the source and target
file stores. Copying of file timestamps may result in precision
loss.

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

Symbolic links are not followed. If the file is a symbolic link,
then the symbolic link itself, not the target of the link, is copied.
It is implementation specific if file attributes can be copied to the
new link. In other words, the

COPY_ATTRIBUTES

option may be
ignored when copying a symbolic link.

An implementation of this interface may support additional
implementation specific options.

Copying a file is not an atomic operation. If an

IOException

is thrown, then it is possible that the target file is incomplete or some
of its file attributes have not been copied from the source file. When
the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified and the target file
exists, then the target file is replaced. The check for the existence of
the file and the creation of the new file may not be atomic with respect
to other file system activities.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to copy a file into a directory, giving it the same file
name as the source file:

```java
Path source = ...
Path newdir = ...
Files.copy(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName());
```

**Parameters:** source

- the path to the file to copy
**Parameters:** target

- the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
provider to the source path)
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the copy should be done
**Returns:** the path to the target file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

- if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is not specified

(optional
specific exception)
**Throws:** DirectoryNotEmptyException

- the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory

(optional specific exception)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the source file, the

checkWrite

is invoked
to check write access to the target file. If a symbolic link is
copied the security manager is invoked to check

LinkPermission

("symbolic")

.

Move or rename a file to a target file.

same

file, in which case this method
has no effect. If the file is a symbolic link then the symbolic link
itself, not the target of the link, is moved. This method may be
invoked to move an empty directory. In some implementations a directory
has entries for special files or links that are created when the
directory is created. In such implementations a directory is considered
empty when only the special entries exist. When invoked to move a
directory that is not empty then the directory is moved if it does not
require moving the entries in the directory. For example, renaming a
directory on the same

FileStore

will usually not require moving
the entries in the directory. When moving a directory requires that its
entries be moved then this method fails (by throwing an

IOException

is thrown, then the
state of the files is not defined. The original file and the target file
may both exist, the target file may be incomplete or some of its file

option is specified but the file
cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory, or the
source is a non-empty directory containing entries that would
be required to be moved

(optional specific exceptions)
**Throws:** AtomicMoveNotSupportedException

- if the options array contains the

ATOMIC_MOVE

option but
the file cannot be moved as an atomic file system operation.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkWrite

probeContentType

```java
public static
String
probeContentType​(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
```

Probes the content type of a file.

This method uses the installed

FileTypeDetector

implementations
to probe the given file to determine its content type. Each file type
detector's

probeContentType

is
invoked, in turn, to probe the file type. If the file is recognized then
the content type is returned. If the file is not recognized by any of the
installed file type detectors then a system-default file type detector is
invoked to guess the content type.

A given invocation of the Java virtual machine maintains a system-wide
list of file type detectors. Installed file type detectors are loaded
using the service-provider loading facility defined by the

ServiceLoader

class. Installed file type detectors are loaded using the system class
loader. If the system class loader cannot be found then the platform class
loader is used. File type detectors are typically installed
by placing them in a JAR file on the application class path,
the JAR file contains a provider-configuration file
named

java.nio.file.spi.FileTypeDetector

in the resource directory

META-INF/services

, and the file lists one or more fully-qualified
names of concrete subclass of

FileTypeDetector

that have a zero
argument constructor. If the process of locating or instantiating the
installed file type detectors fails then an unspecified error is thrown.
The ordering that installed providers are located is implementation
specific.

The return value of this method is the string form of the value of a
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) content type as
defined by

RFC 2045:
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet
Message Bodies

. The string is guaranteed to be parsable according
to the grammar in the RFC.

**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file to probe
**Returns:** The content type of the file, or

null

if the content
type cannot be determined
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
permission required by a file type detector implementation.

getFileAttributeView

```java
public static <V extends
FileAttributeView
> V getFileAttributeView​(
Path
path,

Class
<V> type,

LinkOption
... options)
```

Returns a file attribute view of a given type.

A file attribute view provides a read-only or updatable view of a
set of file attributes. This method is intended to be used where the file
attribute view defines type-safe methods to read or update the file
attributes. The

type

parameter is the type of the attribute view
required and the method returns an instance of that type if supported.
The

BasicFileAttributeView

type supports access to the basic
attributes of a file. Invoking this method to select a file attribute
view of that type will always return an instance of that class.

The

options

array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
are handled by the resulting file attribute view for the case that the
file is a symbolic link. By default, symbolic links are followed. If the
option

NOFOLLOW_LINKS

is present then
symbolic links are not followed. This option is ignored by implementations
that do not support symbolic links.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want read or set a file's ACL, if supported:

```java
Path path = ...
AclFileAttributeView view = Files.getFileAttributeView(path, AclFileAttributeView.class);
if (view != null) {
List<AclEntry> acl = view.getAcl();
:
}

Path
walkFileTree​(
Path
start,

Set
<
FileVisitOption
> options,
int maxDepth,

FileVisitor
<? super
Path
> visitor)
throws
IOException
```

Walks a file tree.

This method walks a file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree traversal is

depth-first

with the given

FileVisitor

invoked for each file encountered. File tree traversal
completes when all accessible files in the tree have been visited, or a
visit method returns a result of

TERMINATE

. Where a visit method terminates due an

IOException

,
an uncaught error, or runtime exception, then the traversal is terminated
and the error or exception is propagated to the caller of this method.

For each file encountered this method attempts to read its

BasicFileAttributes

. If the file is not a
directory then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the file attributes. If the file attributes cannot be read,
due to an I/O exception, then the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with the I/O exception.

Where the file is a directory, and the directory could not be opened,
then the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with the I/O exception,
after which, the file tree walk continues, by default, at the next

sibling

of the directory.

Where the directory is opened successfully, then the entries in the
directory, and their

descendants

are visited. When all entries
have been visited, or an I/O error occurs during iteration of the
directory, then the directory is closed and the visitor's

postVisitDirectory

method is invoked.
The file tree walk then continues, by default, at the next

sibling

of the directory.

By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
method. If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then symbolic links are
followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
be read, then this method attempts to get the

BasicFileAttributes

of the link. If they can be read then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the attributes of the link (otherwise the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked as specified above).

If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then this method keeps
track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the

file-key

of directories,
or if file keys are not available, by invoking the

isSameFile

method to test if a directory is the same file as an
ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error, and the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with
an instance of

FileSystemLoopException

.

The

maxDepth

parameter is the maximum number of levels of
directories to visit. A value of

0

means that only the starting
file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of

MAX_VALUE

may be used to indicate that all
levels should be visited. The

visitFile

method is invoked for all
files, including directories, encountered at

maxDepth

, unless the
basic file attributes cannot be read, in which case the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked.

If a visitor returns a result of

null

then

NullPointerException

is thrown.

When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
(or directory), then it is ignored and the visitor is not invoked for
that file (or directory).

**Parameters:** start

- the starting file
**Parameters:** options

- options to configure the traversal
**Parameters:** maxDepth

- the maximum number of directory levels to visit
**Parameters:** visitor

- the file visitor to invoke for each file
**Returns:** the starting file
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

maxDepth

parameter is negative
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
In the case of the default provider, the

checkRead

method is invoked
to check read access to the directory.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error is thrown by a visitor method

0

means that only the starting
file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of

MAX_VALUE

may be used to indicate that all
levels should be visited. The

visitFile

method is invoked for all
files, including directories, encountered at

maxDepth

, unless the
basic file attributes cannot be read, in which case the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked.

If a visitor returns a result of

null

then

NullPointerException

is thrown.

When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
(or directory), then it is ignored and the visitor is not invoked for
that file (or directory).

This method walks a file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree traversal is

depth-first

with the given

FileVisitor

invoked for each file encountered. File tree traversal
completes when all accessible files in the tree have been visited, or a
visit method returns a result of

TERMINATE

. Where a visit method terminates due an

IOException

,
an uncaught error, or runtime exception, then the traversal is terminated
and the error or exception is propagated to the caller of this method.

For each file encountered this method attempts to read its

BasicFileAttributes

. If the file is not a
directory then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the file attributes. If the file attributes cannot be read,
due to an I/O exception, then the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with the I/O exception.

Where the file is a directory, and the directory could not be opened,
then the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with the I/O exception,
after which, the file tree walk continues, by default, at the next

sibling

of the directory.

Where the directory is opened successfully, then the entries in the
directory, and their

descendants

are visited. When all entries
have been visited, or an I/O error occurs during iteration of the
directory, then the directory is closed and the visitor's

postVisitDirectory

method is invoked.
The file tree walk then continues, by default, at the next

sibling

of the directory.

By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
method. If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then symbolic links are
followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
be read, then this method attempts to get the

BasicFileAttributes

of the link. If they can be read then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the attributes of the link (otherwise the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked as specified above).

If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then this method keeps
track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the

file-key

of directories,
or if file keys are not available, by invoking the

isSameFile

method to test if a directory is the same file as an
ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error, and the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked with
an instance of

FileSystemLoopException

.

The

maxDepth

parameter is the maximum number of levels of
directories to visit. A value of

0

means that only the starting
file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of

MAX_VALUE

may be used to indicate that all
levels should be visited. The

visitFile

method is invoked for all
files, including directories, encountered at

maxDepth

, unless the
basic file attributes cannot be read, in which case the

visitFileFailed

method is invoked.

If a visitor returns a result of

null

then

NullPointerException

is thrown.

When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
(or directory), then it is ignored and the visitor is not invoked for
that file (or directory).

For each file encountered this method attempts to read its

BasicFileAttributes

. If the file is not a
directory then the

visitFile

method is
invoked with the file attributes. If the file attributes cannot be read,
due to an I/O exception, then the

copy

```java
public static long copy​(
InputStream

throws
IOException
```

Copies all bytes from an input stream to a file. On return, the input
stream will be at end of stream.

By default, the copy fails if the target file already exists or is a
symbolic link. If the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is specified, and the target file already exists,
then it is replaced if it is not a non-empty directory. If the target
file exists and is a symbolic link, then the symbolic link is replaced.
In this release, the

REPLACE_EXISTING

option is the only option
required to be supported by this method. Additional options may be
supported in future releases.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to
the file, then it may do so after the target file has been created and
after some bytes have been read or written. Consequently the input
stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
It is strongly recommended that the input stream be promptly closed if an
I/O error occurs.

This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream (or
writing to the file). The behavior for the case that the input stream is

asynchronously closed

or the thread interrupted during the copy is
highly input stream and file system provider specific and therefore not
specified.

Usage example

: Suppose we want to capture a web page and save
it to a file:

```java
Path path = ...
URI u = URI.create("http://java.sun.com/");
try (InputStream in = u.toURL().openStream()) {
Files.copy(in, path);
}
```

**Parameters:** in

- the input stream to read from
**Parameters:** target

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** options

- options specifying how the copy should be done
**Returns:** the number of bytes read or written
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
**Throws:** FileAlreadyExistsException

. Some file systems maintain special
links to the directory itself and the directory's parent directory.
Entries representing these links are not included.

The stream is

Return a

Stream

that is lazily populated with

Path

by walking the file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
file tree is traversed

depth-first

, the elements in the stream
are

Path

objects that are obtained as if by

resolving

the relative path against

start

.

The

stream

walks the file tree as elements are consumed.
The

Stream

returned is guaranteed to have at least one
element, the starting file itself. For each file visited, the stream
attempts to read its

BasicFileAttributes

. If the file is a
directory and can be opened successfully, entries in the directory, and
their

descendants

will follow the directory in the stream as
they are encountered. When all entries have been visited, then the
directory is closed. The file tree walk then continues at the next

sibling

of the directory.

The stream is

weakly consistent

. It does not freeze the
file tree while iterating, so it may (or may not) reflect updates to
the file tree that occur after returned from this method.

By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
method. If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then symbolic links are
followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
be read, then this method attempts to get the

BasicFileAttributes

of the link.

If the

options

parameter contains the

FOLLOW_LINKS

option then the stream keeps
track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the

file-key

of directories,
or if file keys are not available, by invoking the

isSameFile

method to test if a directory is the same file as an
ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error with
an instance of

FileSystemLoopException

.

The

maxDepth

parameter is the maximum number of levels of
directories to visit. A value of

0

means that only the starting
file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of

MAX_VALUE

may be used to indicate that all
levels should be visited.

When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
(or directory), then it is ignored and not included in the stream.

The returned stream contains references to one or more open directories.
The directories are closed by closing the stream.

**Parameters:** start

lines

```

Read all lines from a file as a

Stream

. Unlike

readAllLines

, this method does not read
all lines into a

List

, but instead populates lazily as the stream
is consumed.

Bytes from the file are decoded into characters using the specified
charset and the same line terminators as specified by

readAllLines

are supported.

The returned stream contains a reference to an open file. The file
is closed by closing the stream.

The file contents should not be modified during the execution of the
terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream
operation is undefined.

After this method returns, then any subsequent I/O exception that
occurs while reading from the file or when a malformed or unmappable byte
sequence is read, is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

that will
be thrown from the

Stream

method that caused the read to take
place. In case an

IOException

is thrown when closing the file,
it is also wrapped as an

UncheckedIOException

.

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open file is closed promptly
after the stream's operations have completed.
**Implementation Note:** This implementation supports good parallel stream performance for the
standard charsets

UTF-8

,

US-ASCII

and

ISO-8859-1

. Such

line-optimal

charsets have the property that the encoded bytes
of a line feed ('\n') or a carriage return ('\r') are efficiently
identifiable from other encoded characters when randomly accessing the
bytes of the file.

For non-

line-optimal

charsets the stream source's
spliterator has poor splitting properties, similar to that of a
spliterator associated with an iterator or that associated with a stream
returned from

BufferedReader.lines()

. Poor splitting properties
can result in poor parallel stream performance.

For

line-optimal

charsets the stream source's spliterator
has good splitting properties, assuming the file contains a regular
sequence of lines. Good splitting properties can result in good parallel
stream performance. The spliterator for a

line-optimal

charset
takes advantage of the charset properties (a line feed or a carriage
return being efficient identifiable) such that when splitting it can
approximately divide the number of covered lines in half.
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Parameters:** cs

- the charset to use for decoding
**Returns:** the lines from the file as a

Stream
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs opening the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

occurs while reading from the file or when a malformed or unmappable byte
sequence is read, is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

that will
be thrown from the

method that caused the read to take
place. In case an

IOException

is thrown when closing the file,
it is also wrapped as an

Bytes from the file are decoded into characters using the specified
charset and the same line terminators as specified by

readAllLines

The returned stream contains a reference to an open file. The file
is closed by closing the stream.

For non-

line-optimal

charsets the stream source's
spliterator has poor splitting properties, similar to that of a
spliterator associated with an iterator or that associated with a stream
returned from

BufferedReader.lines()

. Poor splitting properties
can result in poor parallel stream performance.

For

line-optimal

charsets the stream source's spliterator
has good splitting properties, assuming the file contains a regular
sequence of lines. Good splitting properties can result in good parallel
stream performance. The spliterator for a

line-optimal

charset
takes advantage of the charset properties (a line feed or a carriage
return being efficient identifiable) such that when splitting it can
approximately divide the number of covered lines in half.

Read all lines from a file as a

Stream

. Bytes from the file are
decoded into characters using the

UTF-8

charset

.

The returned stream contains a reference to an open file. The file
is closed by closing the stream.

The file contents should not be modified during the execution of the
terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream
operation is undefined.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
Files.lines(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
```

**API Note:** This method must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar
control structure to ensure that the stream's open file is closed promptly
after the stream's operations have completed.
**Parameters:** path

- the path to the file
**Returns:** the lines from the file as a

Stream
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs opening the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the

checkRead

method is invoked to check read access to the file.
**Since:** 1.8
