# Class DataFlavor

**Source:** `java.datatransfer\java\awt\datatransfer\DataFlavor.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
DataFlavor

extends
Object

implements
Externalizable
,
Cloneable
```

A

DataFlavor

provides meta information about data.

DataFlavor

is typically used to access data on the clipboard, or during a drag and drop
operation.

An instance of

DataFlavor

encapsulates a content type as defined in

RFC 2045

and

RFC 2046

. A content type is
typically referred to as a MIME type.

A content type consists of a media type (referred to as the primary type), a
subtype, and optional parameters. See

RFC 2045

for details on the
syntax of a MIME type.

The JRE data transfer implementation interprets the parameter
"class" of a MIME type as

a representation class

. The
representation class reflects the class of the object being transferred. In
other words, the representation class is the type of object returned by

Transferable.getTransferData(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor)

. For example, the MIME type of

imageFlavor

is

"image/x-java-image;class=java.awt.Image"

,
the primary type is

image

, the subtype is

x-java-image

, and
the representation class is

java.awt.Image

. When

getTransferData

is invoked with a

DataFlavor

of

imageFlavor

, an instance of

java.awt.Image

is returned. It's
important to note that

DataFlavor

does no error checking against the
representation class. It is up to consumers of

DataFlavor

, such as

Transferable

, to honor the representation class.

Note, if you do not specify a representation class when creating a

DataFlavor

, the default representation class is used. See appropriate
documentation for

DataFlavor

's constructors.

Also,

DataFlavor

instances with the "text" primary MIME
type may have a "charset" parameter. Refer to

RFC 2046

and

selectBestTextFlavor(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor[])

for details on "text" MIME types and
the "charset" parameter.

Equality of

DataFlavors

is determined by the primary type, subtype,
and representation class. Refer to

equals(DataFlavor)

for details.
When determining equality, any optional parameters are ignored. For example,
the following produces two

DataFlavors

that are considered identical:

```java
DataFlavor flavor1 = new DataFlavor(Object.class, "X-test/test; class=<java.lang.Object>; foo=bar");
DataFlavor flavor2 = new DataFlavor(Object.class, "X-test/test; class=<java.lang.Object>; x=y");
// The following returns true.
flavor1.equals(flavor2);
```

As mentioned,

flavor1

and

flavor2

are considered identical.
As such, asking a

Transferable

for either

DataFlavor

returns
the same results.

to Use Drag and Drop and Data Transfer

### Field Details

#### public static final
DataFlavor
stringFlavor

The

DataFlavor

representing a Java Unicode String class, where:

```java
representationClass = java.lang.String
mimeType = "application/x-java-serialized-object"
```

---

#### public static final
DataFlavor
imageFlavor

The

DataFlavor

representing a Java Image class, where:

```java
representationClass = java.awt.Image
mimeType = "image/x-java-image"
```

Will be

null

if

java.awt.Image

is not visible, the

java.desktop

module is not loaded, or the

java.desktop

module is not in the run-time image.

---

#### @Deprecated

public static final
DataFlavor
plainTextFlavor

The

DataFlavor

representing plain text with Unicode encoding,
where:

```java
representationClass = InputStream
mimeType = "text/plain; charset=unicode"
```

This

DataFlavor

has been

deprecated

because:

- Its representation is an InputStream, an 8-bit based representation,
while Unicode is a 16-bit character set
- The charset "unicode" is not well-defined. "unicode" implies a
particular platform's implementation of Unicode, not a cross-platform
implementation

---

#### public static final
String
javaSerializedObjectMimeType

A MIME Content-Type of application/x-java-serialized-object represents a
graph of Java object(s) that have been made persistent.

The representation class associated with this

DataFlavor

identifies the Java type of an object returned as a reference from an
invocation

java.awt.datatransfer.getTransferData

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### public static final
DataFlavor
javaFileListFlavor

To transfer a list of files to/from Java (and the underlying platform) a

DataFlavor

of this type/subtype and representation class of

java.util.List

is used. Each element of the list is
required/guaranteed to be of type

java.io.File

.

---

#### public static final
String
javaJVMLocalObjectMimeType

To transfer a reference to an arbitrary Java object reference that has no
associated MIME Content-type, across a

Transferable

interface
WITHIN THE SAME JVM, a

DataFlavor

with this type/subtype is used,
with a

representationClass

equal to the type of the
class/interface being passed across the

Transferable

.

The object reference returned from

Transferable.getTransferData

for a

DataFlavor

with this MIME Content-Type is required to be an
instance of the representation Class of the

DataFlavor

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### public static final
String
javaRemoteObjectMimeType

In order to pass a live link to a Remote object via a Drag and Drop

ACTION_LINK

operation a Mime Content Type of
application/x-java-remote-object should be used, where the representation
class of the

DataFlavor

represents the type of the

Remote

interface to be transferred.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### public static
DataFlavor
selectionHtmlFlavor

Represents a piece of an HTML markup. The markup consists of the part
selected on the source side. Therefore some tags in the markup may be
unpaired. If the flavor is used to represent the data in a

Transferable

instance, no additional changes will be made. This
DataFlavor instance represents the same HTML markup as DataFlavor
instances which content MIME type does not contain document parameter
and representation class is the String class.

```java
representationClass = String
mimeType = "text/html"
```

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public static
DataFlavor
fragmentHtmlFlavor

Represents a piece of an HTML markup. If possible, the markup received
from a native system is supplemented with pair tags to be a well-formed
HTML markup. If the flavor is used to represent the data in a

Transferable

instance, no additional changes will be made.

```java
representationClass = String
mimeType = "text/html"
```

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public static
DataFlavor
allHtmlFlavor

Represents a piece of an HTML markup. If possible, the markup received
from a native system is supplemented with additional tags to make up a
well-formed HTML document. If the flavor is used to represent the data in
a

Transferable

instance, no additional changes will be made.

```java
representationClass = String
mimeType = "text/html"
```

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

Linux uses the encoding

iso-10646-ucs-2

.

---

#### public static final
DataFlavor
selectBestTextFlavor​(
DataFlavor
[] availableFlavors)

Selects the best text

DataFlavor

from an array of

DataFlavor

s. Only

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

, and equivalent
flavors, and flavors that have a primary MIME type of "text", are
considered for selection.

Flavors are first sorted by their MIME types in the following order:

- "text/sgml"

"text/xml"

"text/html"

"text/rtf"

"text/enriched"

"text/richtext"

"text/uri-list"

"text/tab-separated-values"

"text/t140"

"text/rfc822-headers"

"text/parityfec"

"text/directory"

"text/css"

"text/calendar"

"application/x-java-serialized-object"

"text/plain"

"text/<other>"

For example, "text/sgml" will be selected over "text/html", and

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

will be chosen over

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

.

If two or more flavors share the best MIME type in the array, then that
MIME type will be checked to see if it supports the charset parameter.

The following MIME types support, or are treated as though they support,
the charset parameter:

- "text/sgml"

"text/xml"

"text/html"

"text/enriched"

"text/richtext"

"text/uri-list"

"text/directory"

"text/css"

"text/calendar"

"application/x-java-serialized-object"

"text/plain"

The following MIME types do not support, or are treated as though they do
not support, the charset parameter:

- "text/rtf"

"text/tab-separated-values"

"text/t140"

"text/rfc822-headers"

"text/parityfec"

For "text/<other>" MIME types, the first time the JRE needs to
determine whether the MIME type supports the charset parameter, it will
check whether the parameter is explicitly listed in an arbitrarily chosen

DataFlavor

which uses that MIME type. If so, the JRE will assume
from that point on that the MIME type supports the charset parameter and
will not check again. If the parameter is not explicitly listed, the JRE
will assume from that point on that the MIME type does not support the
charset parameter and will not check again. Because this check is
performed on an arbitrarily chosen

DataFlavor

, developers must
ensure that all

DataFlavor

s with a "text/<other>" MIME type
specify the charset parameter if it is supported by that MIME type.
Developers should never rely on the JRE to substitute the platform's
default charset for a "text/<other>" DataFlavor. Failure to adhere
to this restriction will lead to undefined behavior.

If the best MIME type in the array does not support the charset
parameter, the flavors which share that MIME type will then be sorted by
their representation classes in the following order:

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

,

[B

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, or if no
flavor has one of the three specified representations, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically.

If the best MIME type in the array does support the charset parameter,
the flavors which share that MIME type will then be sorted by their
representation classes in the following order:

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

,

[C

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, and that
representation is one of the four explicitly listed, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically. If, however, no flavor has
one of the four specified representations, the flavors will then be
sorted by their charsets. Unicode charsets, such as "UTF-16", "UTF-8",
"UTF-16BE", "UTF-16LE", and their aliases, are considered best. After
them, the platform default charset and its aliases are selected.
"US-ASCII" and its aliases are worst. All other charsets are chosen in
alphabetical order, but only charsets supported by this implementation of
the Java platform will be considered.

If two or more flavors share the best charset, the flavors will then
again be sorted by their representation classes in the following order:

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

,

[B

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, or if no
flavor has one of the three specified representations, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically.

**Parameters:**
- availableFlavors

- an array of available

DataFlavor

s

**Returns:**
- the best (highest fidelity) flavor according to the rules
specified above, or

null

, if

availableFlavors

is

null

, has zero length, or contains no text flavors

**Since:**
- 1.3

#### public
Reader
getReaderForText​(
Transferable
transferable)
throws
UnsupportedFlavorException
,

IOException

Gets a Reader for a text flavor, decoded, if necessary, for the expected
charset (encoding). The supported representation classes are

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

,

[C

,

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

, and

[B

.

Because text flavors which do not support the charset parameter are
encoded in a non-standard format, this method should not be called for
such flavors. However, in order to maintain backward-compatibility, if
this method is called for such a flavor, this method will treat the
flavor as though it supports the charset parameter and attempt to decode
it accordingly. See

selectBestTextFlavor

for a list of text
flavors which do not support the charset parameter.

**Parameters:**
- transferable

- the

Transferable

whose data will be
requested in this flavor

**Returns:**
- a

Reader

to read the

Transferable

's data

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the representation class is not one
of the seven listed above
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the

Transferable

has

null

data
- NullPointerException

- if the

Transferable

is

null
- UnsupportedEncodingException

- if this flavor's representation is

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

, or

[B

and this flavor's encoding is not supported by this
implementation of the Java platform
- UnsupportedFlavorException

- if the

Transferable

does not
support this flavor
- IOException

- if the data cannot be read because of an I/O error

**See Also:**
- selectBestTextFlavor(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor[])

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
o)

Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.

The

equals

method implements an equivalence relation
on non-null object references:

- It is

reflexive

: for any non-null reference value

x

,

x.equals(x)

should return

true

.

It is

symmetric

: for any non-null reference values

x

and

y

,

x.equals(y)

should return

true

if and only if

y.equals(x)

returns

true

.

It is

transitive

: for any non-null reference values

x

,

y

, and

z

, if

x.equals(y)

returns

true

and

y.equals(z)

returns

true

, then

x.equals(z)

should return

true

.

It is

consistent

: for any non-null reference values

x

and

y

, multiple invocations of

x.equals(y)

consistently return

true

or consistently return

false

, provided no
information used in

equals

comparisons on the
objects is modified.

For any non-null reference value

x

,

x.equals(null)

should return

false

.

The

equals

method for class

Object

implements
the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
that is, for any non-null reference values

x

and

y

, this method returns

true

if and only
if

x

and

y

refer to the same object
(

x == y

has the value

true

).

Note that it is generally necessary to override the

hashCode

method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
general contract for the

hashCode

method, which states
that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

The equals comparison for the

DataFlavor

class is implemented as
follows: Two

DataFlavor

s are considered equal if and only if
their MIME primary type and subtype and representation class are equal.
Additionally, if the primary type is "text", the subtype denotes a text
flavor which supports the charset parameter, and the representation class
is not

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

, or

[C

, the

charset

parameter
must also be equal. If a charset is not explicitly specified for one or
both

DataFlavor

s, the platform default encoding is assumed. See

selectBestTextFlavor

for a list of text flavors which support the
charset parameter.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- o

- the

Object

to compare with

this

#### @Deprecated

public boolean equals​(
String
s)

Compares only the

mimeType

String

and

representationClass

representationClass

needs to be compared, then

equals(new DataFlavor(s))

may be used.

**Parameters:**
- s

- the

mimeType

to compare

**Returns:**
- true

if the String (MimeType) is equal;

false

otherwise or if

s

is

null

---

#### public int hashCode()

Returns hash code for this

DataFlavor

. For two equal

DataFlavor

s, hash codes are equal. For the

String

that
matches

DataFlavor.equals(String)

, it is not guaranteed that

DataFlavor

's hash code is equal to the hash code of the

String

.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a hash code for this

DataFlavor

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

#### public boolean isFlavorTextType()

Returns whether this

DataFlavor

is a valid text flavor for this
implementation of the Java platform. Only flavors equivalent to

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

and

DataFlavor

s with a primary
MIME type of "text" can be valid text flavors.

If this flavor supports the charset parameter, it must be equivalent to

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

, or its representation must be

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

,

[C

,

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

, or

[B

. If the representation is

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

, or

[B

,
then this flavor's

charset

parameter must be supported by this
implementation of the Java platform. If a charset is not specified, then
the platform default charset, which is always supported, is assumed.

If this flavor does not support the charset parameter, its representation
must be

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

, or

[B

.

See

selectBestTextFlavor

for a list of text flavors which support
the charset parameter.

**Returns:**

A

DataFlavor

provides meta information about data.

DataFlavor

is typically used to access data on the clipboard, or during a drag and drop
operation.

An instance of

DataFlavor

encapsulates a content type as defined in

RFC 2045

and

RFC 2046

. A content type is
typically referred to as a MIME type.

A content type consists of a media type (referred to as the primary type), a
subtype, and optional parameters. See

RFC 2045

for details on the
syntax of a MIME type.

The JRE data transfer implementation interprets the parameter
"class" of a MIME type as

a representation class

. The
representation class reflects the class of the object being transferred. In
other words, the representation class is the type of object returned by

Transferable.getTransferData(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor)

. For example, the MIME type of

imageFlavor

is

"image/x-java-image;class=java.awt.Image"

,
the primary type is

image

, the subtype is

x-java-image

, and
the representation class is

java.awt.Image

. When

getTransferData

is invoked with a

DataFlavor

of

imageFlavor

, an instance of

java.awt.Image

is returned. It's
important to note that

DataFlavor

does no error checking against the
representation class. It is up to consumers of

DataFlavor

, such as

Transferable

, to honor the representation class.

Note, if you do not specify a representation class when creating a

DataFlavor

, the default representation class is used. See appropriate
documentation for

DataFlavor

's constructors.

Also,

DataFlavor

instances with the "text" primary MIME
type may have a "charset" parameter. Refer to

RFC 2046

and

selectBestTextFlavor(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor[])

for details on "text" MIME types and
the "charset" parameter.

Equality of

DataFlavors

is determined by the primary type, subtype,
and representation class. Refer to

equals(DataFlavor)

for details.
When determining equality, any optional parameters are ignored. For example,
the following produces two

DataFlavors

that are considered identical:

```java
DataFlavor flavor1 = new DataFlavor(Object.class, "X-test/test; class=<java.lang.Object>; foo=bar");
DataFlavor flavor2 = new DataFlavor(Object.class, "X-test/test; class=<java.lang.Object>; x=y");
// The following returns true.
flavor1.equals(flavor2);
```

As mentioned,

flavor1

and

flavor2

are considered identical.
As such, asking a

Transferable

for either

DataFlavor

returns
the same results.

```java
representationClass = java.lang.String
mimeType = "application/x-java-serialized-object"
```

- imageFlavor

```java
public static final

module is not loaded, or the

java.desktop

module is not in the run-time image.

- plainTextFlavor

```java
@Deprecated

public static final
DataFlavor
plainTextFlavor
```

Deprecated.

as of 1.3. Use

getReaderForText(java.awt.datatransfer.Transferable)

instead of

Transferable.getTransferData(DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor)

.

The

DataFlavor

representing plain text with Unicode encoding,
where:

```java
representationClass = InputStream
mimeType = "text/plain; charset=unicode"
```

This

DataFlavor

has been

deprecated

because:

- Its representation is an InputStream, an 8-bit based representation,
while Unicode is a 16-bit character set
- The charset "unicode" is not well-defined. "unicode" implies a
particular platform's implementation of Unicode, not a cross-platform
implementation

- javaSerializedObjectMimeType

```java
public static final
String
javaSerializedObjectMimeType
```

A MIME Content-Type of application/x-java-serialized-object represents a
graph of Java object(s) that have been made persistent.

The representation class associated with this

DataFlavor

identifies the Java type of an object returned as a reference from an
invocation

java.awt.datatransfer.getTransferData

.

**See Also:** Constant Field Values

- javaFileListFlavor

```java
public static final
DataFlavor
javaFileListFlavor
```

To transfer a list of files to/from Java (and the underlying platform) a

DataFlavor

of this type/subtype and representation class of

java.util.List

is used. Each element of the list is
required/guaranteed to be of type

java.io.File

.

- javaJVMLocalObjectMimeType

```java
public static final
String
javaJVMLocalObjectMimeType
```

To transfer a reference to an arbitrary Java object reference that has no
associated MIME Content-type, across a

Transferable

interface
WITHIN THE SAME JVM, a

DataFlavor

with this type/subtype is used,
with a

representationClass

equal to the type of the
class/interface being passed across the

Transferable

.

The object reference returned from

Transferable.getTransferData

for a

DataFlavor

with this MIME Content-Type is required to be an
instance of the representation Class of the

DataFlavor

.

**See Also:** Constant Field Values

- javaRemoteObjectMimeType

```java
public static final
String
javaRemoteObjectMimeType
```

In order to pass a live link to a Remote object via a Drag and Drop

ACTION_LINK

operation a Mime Content Type of
application/x-java-remote-object should be used, where the representation
class of the

DataFlavor

represents the type of the

Remote

interface to be transferred.

**See Also:** Constant Field Values

- selectionHtmlFlavor

```java
public static
DataFlavor
selectionHtmlFlavor
```

Represents a piece of an HTML markup. The markup consists of the part
selected on the source side. Therefore some tags in the markup may be
unpaired. If the flavor is used to represent the data in a

Transferable

instance, no additional changes will be made. This
DataFlavor instance represents the same HTML markup as DataFlavor
instances which content MIME type does not contain document parameter
and representation class is the String class.

String representation of this

DataFlavor

and its parameters. The

String

contains the name of the

DataFlavor

class, this flavor's MIME type, and its representation class. If this
flavor has a primary MIME type of "text", supports the charset parameter,
and has an encoded representation, the flavor's charset is also included.
See

selectBestTextFlavor

for a list of text flavors which support
the charset parameter.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** string representation of this

DataFlavor
**See Also:** selectBestTextFlavor(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor[])

- getTextPlainUnicodeFlavor

```java
public static final
DataFlavor
getTextPlainUnicodeFlavor()
```

Returns a

DataFlavor

representing plain text with Unicode
encoding, where:

```java
representationClass = java.io.InputStream
mimeType = "text/plain;
charset=<platform default Unicode encoding>"
```

**Implementation Note:** Oracle's implementation for Microsoft Windows and macOS uses
the encoding

utf-16le

. Oracle's implementation for Solaris and
Linux uses the encoding

iso-10646-ucs-2

.
**Returns:** a

DataFlavor

representing plain text with Unicode
encoding
**Since:** 1.3

- selectBestTextFlavor

```java
public static final
DataFlavor
selectBestTextFlavor​(
DataFlavor
[] availableFlavors)
```

Selects the best text

DataFlavor

from an array of

DataFlavor

s. Only

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

, and equivalent
flavors, and flavors that have a primary MIME type of "text", are
considered for selection.

Flavors are first sorted by their MIME types in the following order:

- "text/sgml"

"text/xml"

"text/html"

"text/rtf"

"text/enriched"

"text/richtext"

"text/uri-list"

"text/tab-separated-values"

"text/t140"

"text/rfc822-headers"

"text/parityfec"

"text/directory"

"text/css"

"text/calendar"

"application/x-java-serialized-object"

"text/plain"

"text/<other>"

For example, "text/sgml" will be selected over "text/html", and

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

will be chosen over

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

.

If two or more flavors share the best MIME type in the array, then that
MIME type will be checked to see if it supports the charset parameter.

The following MIME types support, or are treated as though they support,
the charset parameter:

- "text/sgml"

"text/xml"

"text/html"

"text/enriched"

"text/richtext"

"text/uri-list"

"text/directory"

"text/css"

"text/calendar"

"application/x-java-serialized-object"

"text/plain"

The following MIME types do not support, or are treated as though they do
not support, the charset parameter:

- "text/rtf"

"text/tab-separated-values"

"text/t140"

"text/rfc822-headers"

"text/parityfec"

For "text/<other>" MIME types, the first time the JRE needs to
determine whether the MIME type supports the charset parameter, it will
check whether the parameter is explicitly listed in an arbitrarily chosen

DataFlavor

which uses that MIME type. If so, the JRE will assume
from that point on that the MIME type supports the charset parameter and
will not check again. If the parameter is not explicitly listed, the JRE
will assume from that point on that the MIME type does not support the
charset parameter and will not check again. Because this check is
performed on an arbitrarily chosen

DataFlavor

, developers must
ensure that all

DataFlavor

s with a "text/<other>" MIME type
specify the charset parameter if it is supported by that MIME type.
Developers should never rely on the JRE to substitute the platform's
default charset for a "text/<other>" DataFlavor. Failure to adhere
to this restriction will lead to undefined behavior.

If the best MIME type in the array does not support the charset
parameter, the flavors which share that MIME type will then be sorted by
their representation classes in the following order:

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

,

[B

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, or if no
flavor has one of the three specified representations, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically.

If the best MIME type in the array does support the charset parameter,
the flavors which share that MIME type will then be sorted by their
representation classes in the following order:

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

,

[C

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, and that
representation is one of the four explicitly listed, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically. If, however, no flavor has
one of the four specified representations, the flavors will then be
sorted by their charsets. Unicode charsets, such as "UTF-16", "UTF-8",
"UTF-16BE", "UTF-16LE", and their aliases, are considered best. After
them, the platform default charset and its aliases are selected.
"US-ASCII" and its aliases are worst. All other charsets are chosen in
alphabetical order, but only charsets supported by this implementation of
the Java platform will be considered.

If two or more flavors share the best charset, the flavors will then
again be sorted by their representation classes in the following order:

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

,

[B

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, or if no
flavor has one of the three specified representations, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically.

**Parameters:** availableFlavors

- an array of available

DataFlavor

s
**Returns:** the best (highest fidelity) flavor according to the rules
specified above, or

null

, if

availableFlavors

is

null

, has zero length, or contains no text flavors
**Since:** 1.3

- getReaderForText

```java
public
Reader
getReaderForText​(
Transferable
transferable)
throws
UnsupportedFlavorException
,

IOException
```

Gets a Reader for a text flavor, decoded, if necessary, for the expected
charset (encoding). The supported representation classes are

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

,

[C

,

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

, and

[B

.

Because text flavors which do not support the charset parameter are
encoded in a non-standard format, this method should not be called for
such flavors. However, in order to maintain backward-compatibility, if
this method is called for such a flavor, this method will treat the
flavor as though it supports the charset parameter and attempt to decode
it accordingly. See

selectBestTextFlavor

for a list of text
flavors which do not support the charset parameter.

**Parameters:** transferable

Transferable

whose data will be
requested in this flavor

implementation of the Java platform
**Throws:** UnsupportedFlavorException

- if the

Transferable

**Returns:** the Sub MIME type of this

DataFlavor

- getParameter

```java
public
String
getParameter​(
String
paramName)
```

Returns the human presentable name for this

DataFlavor

if

paramName

equals "humanPresentableName". Otherwise returns the
MIME type value associated with

paramName

.

**Parameters:** paramName

- the parameter name requested
**Returns:** the value of the name parameter, or

null

if there is no
associated value

- setHumanPresentableName

```java
public void setHumanPresentableName​(
String
humanPresentableName)
```

Sets the human presentable name for the data format that this

DataFlavor

represents. This name would be localized for different
countries.

**Parameters:** humanPresentableName

- the new human presentable name

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.

The

equals

method implements an equivalence relation
on non-null object references:

- It is

reflexive

: for any non-null reference value

x

,

x.equals(x)

should return

true

.

It is

symmetric

: for any non-null reference values

x

and

y

,

x.equals(y)

should return

true

if and only if

y.equals(x)

returns

true

.

It is

transitive

: for any non-null reference values

x

,

y

, and

z

, if

x.equals(y)

returns

true

and

y.equals(z)

returns

true

, then

x.equals(z)

should return

true

.

It is

consistent

: for any non-null reference values

x

and

y

, multiple invocations of

x.equals(y)

consistently return

true

or consistently return

false

, provided no
information used in

equals

comparisons on the
objects is modified.

For any non-null reference value

x

,

x.equals(null)

should return

false

.

The

equals

method for class

Object

implements
the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
that is, for any non-null reference values

x

and

y

, this method returns

true

if and only
if

x

and

y

refer to the same object
(

x == y

has the value

true

).

Note that it is generally necessary to override the

hashCode

method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
general contract for the

hashCode

method, which states
that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

The equals comparison for the

DataFlavor

class is implemented as
follows: Two

DataFlavor

s are considered equal if and only if
their MIME primary type and subtype and representation class are equal.
Additionally, if the primary type is "text", the subtype denotes a text
flavor which supports the charset parameter, and the representation class
is not

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

, or

[C

, the

charset

parameter
must also be equal. If a charset is not explicitly specified for one or
both

DataFlavor

s, the platform default encoding is assumed. See

selectBestTextFlavor

for a list of text flavors which support the
charset parameter.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** o

- the

Object

to compare with

this
**Returns:** true

if

that

is equivalent to this

DataFlavor

;

false

otherwise
**See Also:** selectBestTextFlavor(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor[])

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
DataFlavor
that)
```

This method has the same behavior as

equals(Object)

. The only
difference being that it takes a

DataFlavor

instance as a
parameter.

**Parameters:** that

- the

DataFlavor

to compare with

this
**Returns:** true

if

that

is equivalent to this

DataFlavor

;

false

otherwise
**See Also:** selectBestTextFlavor(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor[])

- equals

```java
@Deprecated

instead.

Compares only the

mimeType

against the passed in

String

and

representationClass

is not considered in the comparison. If

representationClass

needs to be compared, then

equals(new DataFlavor(s))

may be used.

**Parameters:** s

- the

mimeType

to compare
**Returns:** true

if the String (MimeType) is equal;

false

otherwise or if

s

is

null

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns hash code for this

DataFlavor

. For two equal

DataFlavor

s, hash codes are equal. For the

String

that
matches

DataFlavor.equals(String)

, it is not guaranteed that

DataFlavor

's hash code is equal to the hash code of the

String

.

Method Detail

- tryToLoadClass

```java
protected static final
Class
<?> tryToLoadClass​(
String
className,

ClassLoader
fallback)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
```

Tries to load a class from: the bootstrap loader, the system loader, the
context loader (if one is present) and finally the loader specified.

**Parameters:** className

- the name of the class to be loaded
**Parameters:** fallback

- the fallback loader
**Returns:** the class loaded
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- if class is not found

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

String representation of this

DataFlavor

and its parameters. The
resulting

String

contains the name of the

DataFlavor

class, this flavor's MIME type, and its representation class. If this
flavor has a primary MIME type of "text", supports the charset parameter,
and has an encoded representation, the flavor's charset is also included.
See

selectBestTextFlavor

for a list of text flavors which support
the charset parameter.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** string representation of this

DataFlavor
**See Also:** selectBestTextFlavor(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor[])

- getTextPlainUnicodeFlavor

```java
public static final
DataFlavor
getTextPlainUnicodeFlavor()
```

Returns a

DataFlavor

representing plain text with Unicode
encoding, where:

```java
representationClass = java.io.InputStream
mimeType = "text/plain;
charset=<platform default Unicode encoding>"
```

**Implementation Note:** Oracle's implementation for Microsoft Windows and macOS uses
the encoding

utf-16le

. Oracle's implementation for Solaris and
Linux uses the encoding

iso-10646-ucs-2

.
**Returns:** a

DataFlavor

representing plain text with Unicode
encoding
**Since:** 1.3

- selectBestTextFlavor

```java
public static final
DataFlavor
selectBestTextFlavor​(
DataFlavor
[] availableFlavors)
```

Selects the best text

DataFlavor

from an array of

DataFlavor

s. Only

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

, and equivalent
flavors, and flavors that have a primary MIME type of "text", are
considered for selection.

Flavors are first sorted by their MIME types in the following order:

- "text/sgml"

"text/xml"

"text/html"

"text/rtf"

"text/enriched"

"text/richtext"

"text/uri-list"

"text/tab-separated-values"

"text/t140"

"text/rfc822-headers"

"text/parityfec"

"text/directory"

"text/css"

"text/calendar"

"application/x-java-serialized-object"

"text/plain"

"text/<other>"

For example, "text/sgml" will be selected over "text/html", and

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

will be chosen over

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

.

If two or more flavors share the best MIME type in the array, then that
MIME type will be checked to see if it supports the charset parameter.

The following MIME types support, or are treated as though they support,
the charset parameter:

- "text/sgml"

"text/xml"

"text/html"

"text/enriched"

"text/richtext"

"text/uri-list"

"text/directory"

"text/css"

"text/calendar"

"application/x-java-serialized-object"

"text/plain"

The following MIME types do not support, or are treated as though they do
not support, the charset parameter:

- "text/rtf"

"text/tab-separated-values"

"text/t140"

"text/rfc822-headers"

"text/parityfec"

For "text/<other>" MIME types, the first time the JRE needs to
determine whether the MIME type supports the charset parameter, it will
check whether the parameter is explicitly listed in an arbitrarily chosen

DataFlavor

which uses that MIME type. If so, the JRE will assume
from that point on that the MIME type supports the charset parameter and
will not check again. If the parameter is not explicitly listed, the JRE
will assume from that point on that the MIME type does not support the
charset parameter and will not check again. Because this check is
performed on an arbitrarily chosen

DataFlavor

, developers must
ensure that all

DataFlavor

s with a "text/<other>" MIME type
specify the charset parameter if it is supported by that MIME type.
Developers should never rely on the JRE to substitute the platform's
default charset for a "text/<other>" DataFlavor. Failure to adhere
to this restriction will lead to undefined behavior.

If the best MIME type in the array does not support the charset
parameter, the flavors which share that MIME type will then be sorted by
their representation classes in the following order:

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

,

[B

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, or if no
flavor has one of the three specified representations, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically.

If the best MIME type in the array does support the charset parameter,
the flavors which share that MIME type will then be sorted by their
representation classes in the following order:

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

,

[C

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, and that
representation is one of the four explicitly listed, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically. If, however, no flavor has
one of the four specified representations, the flavors will then be
sorted by their charsets. Unicode charsets, such as "UTF-16", "UTF-8",
"UTF-16BE", "UTF-16LE", and their aliases, are considered best. After
them, the platform default charset and its aliases are selected.
"US-ASCII" and its aliases are worst. All other charsets are chosen in
alphabetical order, but only charsets supported by this implementation of
the Java platform will be considered.

If two or more flavors share the best charset, the flavors will then
again be sorted by their representation classes in the following order:

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

,

[B

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, or if no
flavor has one of the three specified representations, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically.

**Parameters:** availableFlavors

- an array of available

DataFlavor

s
**Returns:** the best (highest fidelity) flavor according to the rules
specified above, or

null

, if

availableFlavors

is

null

, has zero length, or contains no text flavors
**Since:** 1.3

- getReaderForText

```java
public
Reader
getReaderForText​(
Transferable
transferable)
throws
UnsupportedFlavorException
,

IOException
```

Gets a Reader for a text flavor, decoded, if necessary, for the expected
charset (encoding). The supported representation classes are

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

,

[C

,

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

, and

[B

.

Because text flavors which do not support the charset parameter are
encoded in a non-standard format, this method should not be called for
such flavors. However, in order to maintain backward-compatibility, if
this method is called for such a flavor, this method will treat the
flavor as though it supports the charset parameter and attempt to decode
it accordingly. See

selectBestTextFlavor

for a list of text
flavors which do not support the charset parameter.

**Parameters:** transferable

Transferable

whose data will be
requested in this flavor

and this flavor's encoding is not supported by this
implementation of the Java platform
**Throws:** UnsupportedFlavorException

- if the

Transferable

does not
support this flavor

- setHumanPresentableName

```java
public void setHumanPresentableName​(
String
humanPresentableName)
```

Sets the human presentable name for the data format that this

DataFlavor

represents. This name would be localized for different
countries.

**Parameters:** humanPresentableName

- the new human presentable name

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.

The

equals

method implements an equivalence relation
on non-null object references:

- It is

reflexive

: for any non-null reference value

x

,

x.equals(x)

should return

true

.

It is

symmetric

: for any non-null reference values

x

and

y

,

x.equals(y)

should return

true

if and only if

y.equals(x)

returns

true

.

It is

transitive

: for any non-null reference values

x

,

y

, and

z

, if

x.equals(y)

returns

true

and

y.equals(z)

returns

true

, then

x.equals(z)

should return

true

.

It is

consistent

: for any non-null reference values

x

and

y

, multiple invocations of

x.equals(y)

consistently return

true

or consistently return

false

, provided no
information used in

equals

comparisons on the
objects is modified.

For any non-null reference value

x

,

x.equals(null)

should return

false

.

The

equals

method for class

Object

implements
the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
that is, for any non-null reference values

x

and

y

, this method returns

true

if and only
if

x

and

y

refer to the same object
(

x == y

has the value

true

).

Note that it is generally necessary to override the

hashCode

method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
general contract for the

hashCode

method, which states
that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

The equals comparison for the

DataFlavor

class is implemented as
follows: Two

DataFlavor

s are considered equal if and only if
their MIME primary type and subtype and representation class are equal.
Additionally, if the primary type is "text", the subtype denotes a text
flavor which supports the charset parameter, and the representation class
is not

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

, or

[C

, the

charset

parameter
must also be equal. If a charset is not explicitly specified for one or
both

DataFlavor

s, the platform default encoding is assumed. See

selectBestTextFlavor

for a list of text flavors which support the
charset parameter.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** o

- the

Object

to compare with

this
**Returns:** true

if

that

is equivalent to this

DataFlavor

;

false

otherwise
**See Also:** selectBestTextFlavor(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor[])

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
DataFlavor
that)
```

This method has the same behavior as

equals(Object)

. The only
difference being that it takes a

DataFlavor

instance as a
parameter.

**Parameters:** that

- the

DataFlavor

to compare with

this
**Returns:** true

if

that

is equivalent to this

DataFlavor

;

false

otherwise
**See Also:** selectBestTextFlavor(java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor[])

- equals

```java
@Deprecated

public boolean equals​(
String
s)
```

Deprecated.

As inconsistent with

hashCode()

contract, use

isMimeTypeEqual(String)

instead.

Compares only the

mimeType

against the passed in

String

and

representationClass

is not considered in the comparison. If

representationClass

needs to be compared, then

equals(new DataFlavor(s))

may be used.

**Parameters:** s

- the

mimeType

to compare
**Returns:** true

if the String (MimeType) is equal;

false

otherwise or if

s

is

null

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns hash code for this

DataFlavor

. For two equal

DataFlavor

s, hash codes are equal. For the

String

that
matches

DataFlavor.equals(String)

, it is not guaranteed that

DataFlavor

's hash code is equal to the hash code of the

String

.

- isFlavorTextType

```java
public boolean isFlavorTextType()
```

Returns whether this

DataFlavor

is a valid text flavor for this
implementation of the Java platform. Only flavors equivalent to

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

and

DataFlavor

s with a primary
MIME type of "text" can be valid text flavors.

If this flavor supports the charset parameter, it must be equivalent to

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

, or its representation must be

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

,

[C

,

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

, or

[B

. If the representation is

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

, or

[B

,
then this flavor's

charset

parameter must be supported by this
implementation of the Java platform. If a charset is not specified, then
the platform default charset, which is always supported, is assumed.

If this flavor does not support the charset parameter, its representation
must be

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

, or

[B

.

See

selectBestTextFlavor

for a list of text flavors which support
the charset parameter.

- normalizeMimeTypeParameter

```java
@Deprecated

protected
String
normalizeMimeTypeParameter​(
String
parameterName,

String
parameterValue)
```

Deprecated.

This method is never invoked by this implementation from 1.1
onwards

Called on

DataFlavor

for every MIME Type parameter to allow

DataFlavor

subclasses to handle special parameters like the
text/plain

charset

parameters, whose values are case insensitive.
(MIME type parameter values are supposed to be case sensitive.

This method is called for each parameter name/value pair and should
return the normalized representation of the

parameterValue

.

**Parameters:** parameterName

- the parameter name
**Parameters:** parameterValue

- the parameter value
**Returns:** the parameter value

- normalizeMimeType

```java
@Deprecated

protected

mimeType)
```

Deprecated.

This method is never invoked by this implementation from 1.1
onwards

Called for each MIME type string to give

DataFlavor

subtypes the
opportunity to change how the normalization of MIME types is
accomplished. One possible use would be to add default parameter/value
pairs in cases where none are present in the MIME type string passed in.

#### getTextPlainUnicodeFlavor

public static final

DataFlavor

getTextPlainUnicodeFlavor()

Returns a

selectBestTextFlavor

```java
public static final
DataFlavor
selectBestTextFlavor​(
DataFlavor
[] availableFlavors)
```

Selects the best text

DataFlavor

from an array of

DataFlavor

s. Only

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

, and equivalent
flavors, and flavors that have a primary MIME type of "text", are
considered for selection.

Flavors are first sorted by their MIME types in the following order:

- "text/sgml"

"text/xml"

"text/html"

"text/rtf"

"text/enriched"

"text/richtext"

"text/uri-list"

"text/tab-separated-values"

"text/t140"

"text/rfc822-headers"

"text/parityfec"

"text/directory"

"text/css"

"text/calendar"

"application/x-java-serialized-object"

"text/plain"

"text/<other>"

For example, "text/sgml" will be selected over "text/html", and

DataFlavor.stringFlavor

will be chosen over

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

.

If two or more flavors share the best MIME type in the array, then that
MIME type will be checked to see if it supports the charset parameter.

The following MIME types support, or are treated as though they support,
the charset parameter:

- "text/sgml"

"text/xml"

"text/html"

"text/enriched"

"text/richtext"

"text/uri-list"

"text/directory"

"text/css"

"text/calendar"

"application/x-java-serialized-object"

"text/plain"

The following MIME types do not support, or are treated as though they do
not support, the charset parameter:

- "text/rtf"

"text/tab-separated-values"

"text/t140"

"text/rfc822-headers"

"text/parityfec"

For "text/<other>" MIME types, the first time the JRE needs to
determine whether the MIME type supports the charset parameter, it will
check whether the parameter is explicitly listed in an arbitrarily chosen

DataFlavor

which uses that MIME type. If so, the JRE will assume
from that point on that the MIME type supports the charset parameter and
will not check again. If the parameter is not explicitly listed, the JRE
will assume from that point on that the MIME type does not support the
charset parameter and will not check again. Because this check is
performed on an arbitrarily chosen

DataFlavor

, developers must
ensure that all

DataFlavor

s with a "text/<other>" MIME type
specify the charset parameter if it is supported by that MIME type.
Developers should never rely on the JRE to substitute the platform's
default charset for a "text/<other>" DataFlavor. Failure to adhere
to this restriction will lead to undefined behavior.

If the best MIME type in the array does not support the charset
parameter, the flavors which share that MIME type will then be sorted by
their representation classes in the following order:

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

,

[B

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, or if no
flavor has one of the three specified representations, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically.

If the best MIME type in the array does support the charset parameter,
the flavors which share that MIME type will then be sorted by their
representation classes in the following order:

java.io.Reader

,

java.lang.String

,

java.nio.CharBuffer

,

[C

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, and that
representation is one of the four explicitly listed, then one of those
flavors will be chosen non-deterministically. If, however, no flavor has
one of the four specified representations, the flavors will then be
sorted by their charsets. Unicode charsets, such as "UTF-16", "UTF-8",
"UTF-16BE", "UTF-16LE", and their aliases, are considered best. After
them, the platform default charset and its aliases are selected.
"US-ASCII" and its aliases are worst. All other charsets are chosen in
alphabetical order, but only charsets supported by this implementation of
the Java platform will be considered.

If two or more flavors share the best charset, the flavors will then
again be sorted by their representation classes in the following order:

java.io.InputStream

,

java.nio.ByteBuffer

,

[B

,
<all others>.

If two or more flavors share the best representation class, or if no
flavor has one of the three specified representations, then one of those

**Returns:** the best (highest fidelity) flavor according to the rules
specified above, or

null

Developers should never rely on the JRE to substitute the platform's
default charset for a "text/<other>" DataFlavor. Failure to adhere
to this restriction will lead to undefined behavior.

representation is one of the four explicitly listed, then one of those

one of the four specified representations, the flavors will then be
sorted by their charsets. Unicode charsets, such as "UTF-16", "UTF-8",
"UTF-16BE", "UTF-16LE", and their aliases, are considered best. After
them, the platform default charset and its aliases are selected.
"US-ASCII" and its aliases are worst. All other charsets are chosen in
alphabetical order, but only charsets supported by this implementation of
the Java platform will be considered.
