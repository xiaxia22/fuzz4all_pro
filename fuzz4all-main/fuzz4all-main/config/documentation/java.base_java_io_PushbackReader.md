- Always, since mark is not supported

---

#### public void reset()
throws
IOException

Resets the stream. The

reset

method of

PushbackReader

always throws an exception.

---

#### public boolean markSupported()

Tells whether this stream supports the mark() operation, which it does
not.

**Overrides:**
- markSupported

in class

FilterReader

**Returns:**
- true if and only if this stream supports the mark operation.

---

#### public void close()
throws
IOException

Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with
it. Once the stream has been closed, further read(),
unread(), ready(), or skip() invocations will throw an IOException.
Closing a previously closed stream has no effect. This method will block
while there is another thread blocking on the reader.

**Specified by:**
- close

in interface

AutoCloseable
- close

in interface

Closeable
- close

in class

Reader

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public long skip​(long n)
throws
IOException

Skips characters. This method will block until some characters are
available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.

**Overrides:**
- skip

in class

FilterReader

**Parameters:**
- n

- The number of characters to skip

**Returns:**
- The number of characters actually skipped
