# Class LinkedTransferQueue<E>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\concurrent\LinkedTransferQueue.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
LinkedTransferQueue<E>

extends
AbstractQueue
<E>
implements
TransferQueue
<E>,
Serializable
```

An unbounded

TransferQueue

based on linked nodes.
This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out) with respect
to any given producer. The

head

of the queue is that
element that has been on the queue the longest time for some
producer. The

tail

of the queue is that element that has
been on the queue the shortest time for some producer.

Beware that, unlike in most collections, the

size

method
is

NOT

a constant-time operation. Because of the
asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current number
of elements requires a traversal of the elements, and so may report
inaccurate results if this collection is modified during traversal.

Bulk operations that add, remove, or examine multiple elements,
such as

AbstractQueue.addAll(java.util.Collection<? extends E>)

,

removeIf(java.util.function.Predicate<? super E>)

or

forEach(java.util.function.Consumer<? super E>)

,
are

not

guaranteed to be performed atomically.
For example, a

forEach

traversal concurrent with an

addAll

operation might observe only some of the added elements.

This class and its iterator implement all of the

optional

methods of the

Collection

and

Iterator

interfaces.

Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent
collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a

LinkedTransferQueue

happen-before

actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
the

LinkedTransferQueue

in another thread.

This class is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

**Type Parameters:** E

- the type of elements held in this queue

---

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public LinkedTransferQueue()

Creates an initially empty

LinkedTransferQueue

.

---

#### public LinkedTransferQueue​(
Collection
<? extends
E
> c)

Creates a

LinkedTransferQueue

initially containing the elements of the given collection,
added in traversal order of the collection's iterator.

**Parameters:**
- c

- the collection of elements to initially contain

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the specified collection or any
of its elements are null

---

### Method Details

#### public
Object
[] toArray()

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this queue. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this queue

---

#### public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of
the specified array. If the queue fits in the specified array, it
is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the
runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue.

If this queue fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this queue), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the queue is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a queue known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- a

- the array into which the elements of the queue are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this queue

**Throws:**
- ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this queue
- NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection

---

#### public
Spliterator
<
E
> spliterator()

Returns a

Spliterator

over the elements in this queue.

The returned spliterator is

weakly consistent

.

The

Spliterator

reports

Spliterator.CONCURRENT

,

Spliterator.ORDERED

, and

Spliterator.NONNULL

.

**Specified by:**
- spliterator

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
- spliterator

in interface

Iterable

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- a

Spliterator

over the elements in this queue

**Implementation Note:**
- The

Spliterator

implements

trySplit

to permit limited
parallelism.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- LinkedTransferQueue

```java
public LinkedTransferQueue()
```

Creates an initially empty

LinkedTransferQueue

.

- LinkedTransferQueue

```java
public LinkedTransferQueue​(
Collection
<? extends
E
> c)
```

Creates a

LinkedTransferQueue

initially containing the elements of the given collection,
added in traversal order of the collection's iterator.

**Parameters:** c

- the collection of elements to initially contain
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified collection or any
of its elements are null

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- toArray

```java
public
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this queue. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this queue

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of
the specified array. If the queue fits in the specified array, it
is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the
runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue.

If this queue fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this queue), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the queue is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a queue known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Type Parameters:** T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection
**Parameters:** a

- the array into which the elements of the queue are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this queue
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this queue
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

- spliterator

```java
public
Spliterator
<
E
> spliterator()
```

Returns a

Spliterator

over the elements in this queue.

The returned spliterator is

weakly consistent

.

The

Spliterator

reports

Spliterator.CONCURRENT

,

Spliterator.ORDERED

, and

Spliterator.NONNULL

.

- drainTo

```java
public int drainTo​(
Collection
<? super
E
> c)
```

Description copied from interface:

BlockingQueue

Removes all available elements from this queue and adds them
to the given collection. This operation may be more
efficient than repeatedly polling this queue. A failure
encountered while attempting to add elements to
collection

c

may result in elements being in neither,
either or both collections when the associated exception is
thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in

IllegalArgumentException

. Further, the behavior of
this operation is undefined if the specified collection is
modified while the operation is in progress.

**Specified by:** drainTo

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- the collection to transfer elements into
**Returns:** the number of elements transferred
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified collection is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified collection is this
queue, or some property of an element of this queue prevents
it from being added to the specified collection

- drainTo

```java
public int drainTo​(
Collection
<? super

```java
public int size()
```

Returns the number of elements in this queue. If this queue
contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is

NOT

a constant-time operation. Because of the
asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current
number of elements requires an O(n) traversal.

E

>
**Returns:** the number of elements in this queue

- remove

```java
public boolean remove​(
Object
o)

such
that

o.equals(e)

, if this queue contains one or more such
elements.
Returns

true

if this queue contained the specified element
(or equivalently, if this queue changed as a result of the call).

```

Description copied from interface:

Iterable

Performs the given action for each element of the

Iterable

until all elements have been processed or the action throws an
exception. Actions are performed in the order of iteration, if that
order is specified. Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the
caller.

The behavior of this method is unspecified if the action performs
side-effects that modify the underlying source of elements, unless an
overriding class has specified a concurrent modification policy.

#### Method Detail

toArray

```java
public
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this queue. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of
the specified array. If the queue fits in the specified array, it
is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the
runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue.

If this queue fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this queue), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the queue is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a queue known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this queue

- the collection to transfer elements into
**Parameters:** maxElements

- the maximum number of elements to transfer
**Returns:** the number of elements transferred
**Throws:** NullPointerException

#### drainTo

public int drainTo​(

Collection

<? super

E

> c,
int maxElements)

Description copied from interface:

BlockingQueue

Removes at most the given number of available elements from
this queue and adds them to the given collection. A failure
encountered while attempting to add elements to
collection

c

may result in elements being in neither,
either or both collections when the associated exception is
thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in

IllegalArgumentException

. Further, the behavior of
this operation is undefined if the specified collection is
modified while the operation is in progress.

iterator

```java
public
Iterator
<
E
> iterator()
```

Returns an iterator over the elements in this queue in proper sequence.
The elements will be returned in order from first (head) to last (tail).

The returned iterator is

weakly consistent

.

size

```java
public int size()
```

Returns the number of elements in this queue. If this queue
contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is

NOT

a constant-time operation. Because of the
asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current
number of elements requires an O(n) traversal.

remove

```java
public boolean remove​(
Object
o)

Description copied from interface:

Iterable

Performs the given action for each element of the

Iterable

until all elements have been processed or the action throws an
exception. Actions are performed in the order of iteration, if that
order is specified. Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the
caller.

The behavior of this method is unspecified if the action performs
side-effects that modify the underlying source of elements, unless an
overriding class has specified a concurrent modification policy.

**Specified by:** forEach
