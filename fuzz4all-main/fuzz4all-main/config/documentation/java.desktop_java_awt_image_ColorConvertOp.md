# Class ColorConvertOp

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\ColorConvertOp.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ColorConvertOp

extends
Object

implements
BufferedImageOp
,
RasterOp
```

This class performs a pixel-by-pixel color conversion of the data in
the source image. The resulting color values are scaled to the precision
of the destination image. Color conversion can be specified
via an array of ColorSpace objects or an array of ICC_Profile objects.

If the source is a BufferedImage with premultiplied alpha, the
color components are divided by the alpha component before color conversion.
If the destination is a BufferedImage with premultiplied alpha, the
color components are multiplied by the alpha component after conversion.
Rasters are treated as having no alpha channel, i.e. all bands are
color bands.

If a RenderingHints object is specified in the constructor, the
color rendering hint and the dithering hint may be used to control
color conversion.

Note that Source and Destination may be the same object.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public ColorConvertOp​(
RenderingHints
hints)

Constructs a new ColorConvertOp which will convert
from a source color space to a destination color space.
The RenderingHints argument may be null.
This Op can be used only with BufferedImages, and will convert
directly from the ColorSpace of the source image to that of the
destination. The destination argument of the filter method
cannot be specified as null.

**Parameters:**
- hints

- the

RenderingHints

object used to control
the color conversion, or

null

---

#### public ColorConvertOp​(
ColorSpace
cspace,

RenderingHints
hints)

Constructs a new ColorConvertOp from a ColorSpace object.
The RenderingHints argument may be null. This
Op can be used only with BufferedImages, and is primarily useful
when the

filter

method is invoked with a destination argument of null.
In that case, the ColorSpace defines the destination color space
for the destination created by the filter method. Otherwise, the
ColorSpace defines an intermediate space to which the source is
converted before being converted to the destination space.

**Parameters:**
- cspace

- defines the destination

ColorSpace

or an
intermediate

ColorSpace
- hints

- the

RenderingHints

object used to control
the color conversion, or

null

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if cspace is null

---

#### public ColorConvertOp​(
ColorSpace
srcCspace,

ColorSpace
dstCspace,

RenderingHints
hints)

Constructs a new ColorConvertOp from two ColorSpace objects.
The RenderingHints argument may be null.
This Op is primarily useful for calling the filter method on
Rasters, in which case the two ColorSpaces define the operation
to be performed on the Rasters. In that case, the number of bands
in the source Raster must match the number of components in
srcCspace, and the number of bands in the destination Raster
must match the number of components in dstCspace. For BufferedImages,
the two ColorSpaces define intermediate spaces through which the
source is converted before being converted to the destination space.

**Parameters:**
- srcCspace

- the source

ColorSpace
- dstCspace

- the destination

ColorSpace
- hints

- the

RenderingHints

object used to control
the color conversion, or

null

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if either srcCspace or dstCspace is null

---

#### public ColorConvertOp​(
ICC_Profile
[] profiles,

RenderingHints
hints)

Constructs a new ColorConvertOp from an array of ICC_Profiles.
The RenderingHints argument may be null.
The sequence of profiles may include profiles that represent color
spaces, profiles that represent effects, etc. If the whole sequence
does not represent a well-defined color conversion, an exception is
thrown.

For BufferedImages, if the ColorSpace
of the source BufferedImage does not match the requirements of the
first profile in the array,
the first conversion is to an appropriate ColorSpace.
If the requirements of the last profile in the array are not met
by the ColorSpace of the destination BufferedImage,
the last conversion is to the destination's ColorSpace.

For Rasters, the number of bands in the source Raster must match
the requirements of the first profile in the array, and the
number of bands in the destination Raster must match the requirements
of the last profile in the array. The array must have at least two
elements or calling the filter method for Rasters will throw an
IllegalArgumentException.

**Parameters:**
- profiles

- the array of

ICC_Profile

objects
- hints

- the

RenderingHints

object used to control
the color conversion, or

null

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- when the profile sequence does not
specify a well-defined color conversion
- NullPointerException

- if profiles is null

---

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- ColorConvertOp

```java
public ColorConvertOp​(
RenderingHints
hints)
```

Constructs a new ColorConvertOp which will convert
from a source color space to a destination color space.
The RenderingHints argument may be null.
This Op can be used only with BufferedImages, and will convert
directly from the ColorSpace of the source image to that of the
destination. The destination argument of the filter method
cannot be specified as null.

**Parameters:** hints

- the

RenderingHints

object used to control
the color conversion, or

null

- ColorConvertOp

```java
public ColorConvertOp​(
ColorSpace
cspace,

RenderingHints
hints)
```

Constructs a new ColorConvertOp from a ColorSpace object.
The RenderingHints argument may be null. This
Op can be used only with BufferedImages, and is primarily useful
when the

filter

method is invoked with a destination argument of null.
In that case, the ColorSpace defines the destination color space
for the destination created by the filter method. Otherwise, the
ColorSpace defines an intermediate space to which the source is
converted before being converted to the destination space.

**Parameters:** cspace

- defines the destination

ColorSpace

or an
intermediate

ColorSpace
**Parameters:** hints

- the

RenderingHints

object used to control
the color conversion, or

null
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if cspace is null

- ColorConvertOp

```java
public ColorConvertOp​(
ColorSpace
srcCspace,

ColorSpace
dstCspace,

RenderingHints
hints)
```

Constructs a new ColorConvertOp from two ColorSpace objects.
The RenderingHints argument may be null.
This Op is primarily useful for calling the filter method on
Rasters, in which case the two ColorSpaces define the operation
to be performed on the Rasters. In that case, the number of bands
in the source Raster must match the number of components in
srcCspace, and the number of bands in the destination Raster
must match the number of components in dstCspace. For BufferedImages,
the two ColorSpaces define intermediate spaces through which the
source is converted before being converted to the destination space.

**Parameters:** srcCspace

- the source

ColorSpace
**Parameters:** dstCspace

- the destination

ColorSpace
**Parameters:** hints

- the

RenderingHints

object used to control
the color conversion, or

null
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if either srcCspace or dstCspace is null

- ColorConvertOp

```java
public ColorConvertOp​(
ICC_Profile
[] profiles,

RenderingHints
hints)
```

Constructs a new ColorConvertOp from an array of ICC_Profiles.
The RenderingHints argument may be null.
The sequence of profiles may include profiles that represent color
spaces, profiles that represent effects, etc. If the whole sequence
does not represent a well-defined color conversion, an exception is
thrown.

For BufferedImages, if the ColorSpace
of the source BufferedImage does not match the requirements of the
first profile in the array,
the first conversion is to an appropriate ColorSpace.
If the requirements of the last profile in the array are not met
by the ColorSpace of the destination BufferedImage,
the last conversion is to the destination's ColorSpace.

For Rasters, the number of bands in the source Raster must match
the requirements of the first profile in the array, and the
number of bands in the destination Raster must match the requirements
of the last profile in the array. The array must have at least two
elements or calling the filter method for Rasters will throw an
IllegalArgumentException.

**Parameters:** profiles

- the array of

ICC_Profile

objects
**Parameters:** hints

- the

RenderingHints

object used to control
the color conversion, or

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- when the profile sequence does not
specify a well-defined color conversion
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if profiles is null

This Op is primarily useful for calling the filter method on
Rasters, in which case the two ColorSpaces define the operation
to be performed on the Rasters. In that case, the number of bands
in the source Raster must match the number of components in
srcCspace, and the number of bands in the destination Raster
must match the number of components in dstCspace. For BufferedImages,
the two ColorSpaces define intermediate spaces through which the
source is converted before being converted to the destination space.

**Parameters:** srcCspace

- the source

ColorSpace
**Parameters:** dstCspace

- the destination

ColorSpace
**Parameters:** hints

- the

RenderingHints

object used to control
the color conversion, or

spaces, profiles that represent effects, etc. If the whole sequence
does not represent a well-defined color conversion, an exception is
thrown.

For BufferedImages, if the ColorSpace
of the source BufferedImage does not match the requirements of the
first profile in the array,
the first conversion is to an appropriate ColorSpace.
If the requirements of the last profile in the array are not met
by the ColorSpace of the destination BufferedImage,
the last conversion is to the destination's ColorSpace.

For Rasters, the number of bands in the source Raster must match
the requirements of the first profile in the array, and the
number of bands in the destination Raster must match the requirements
of the last profile in the array. The array must have at least two
elements or calling the filter method for Rasters will throw an
IllegalArgumentException.
