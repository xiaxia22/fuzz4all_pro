# Interface ImageOutputStream

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\imageio\stream\ImageOutputStream.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ImageOutputStream

extends
ImageInputStream
,
DataOutput
```

A seekable output stream interface for use by

ImageWriter

s. Various output destinations, such as

OutputStream

s and

File

s, as well as
future fast I/O destinations may be "wrapped" by a suitable
implementation of this interface for use by the Image I/O API.

Unlike a standard

OutputStream

, ImageOutputStream
extends its counterpart,

ImageInputStream

. Thus it is
possible to read from the stream as it is being written. The same
seek and flush positions apply to both reading and writing, although
the semantics for dealing with a non-zero bit offset before a byte-aligned
write are necessarily different from the semantics for dealing with
a non-zero bit offset before a byte-aligned read. When reading bytes,
any bit offset is set to 0 before the read; when writing bytes, a
non-zero bit offset causes the remaining bits in the byte to be written
as 0s. The byte-aligned write then starts at the next byte position.

### Method Details

#### void write​(int b)
throws
IOException

Writes a single byte to the stream at the current position.
The 24 high-order bits of

b

are ignored.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write. Implementers can use the

flushBits

method of

ImageOutputStreamImpl

to guarantee this.

**Specified by:**
- write

in interface

DataOutput

**Parameters:**
- b

- an

int

whose lower 8 bits are to be
written.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### void write​(byte[] b)
throws
IOException

Writes a sequence of bytes to the stream at the current
position. If

b.length

is 0, nothing is written.
The byte

b[0]

is written first, then the byte

b[1]

, and so on.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write.

**Specified by:**
- write

in interface

DataOutput

**Parameters:**

---

#### void write​(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException

position. If

len

is 0, nothing is written.
The byte

b[off]

is written first, then the byte

b[off + 1]

, and so on.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s

the string

s

, taken in order, one byte is written
to the output stream. If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown.

If

s.length

is zero, then no bytes are
written. Otherwise, the character

s[0]

is written
first, then

s[1]

, and so on; the last character
written is

s[s.length-1]

. For each character, one
byte is written, the low-order byte, in exactly the manner of
the

writeByte

method. The high-order eight bits of
each character in the string are ignored.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write.

**Specified by:**
- writeBytes

in interface

DataOutput

**Parameters:**
- s

- a

String

containing the value to be
written.

- NullPointerException

- if

s

is

null

.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### void writeChars​(
String
s)
throws
IOException

Writes a string to the output stream. For every character in
the string

s

, taken in order, two bytes are
written to the output stream, ordered according to the current
byte order setting. If network byte order is being used, the
high-order byte is written first; the order is reversed
otherwise. If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown.

If

s.length

is zero, then no bytes are
written. Otherwise, the character

s[0]

is written
first, then

s[1]

, and so on; the last character
written is

s[s.length-1]

.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write.

**Specified by:**
- writeChars

in interface

DataOutput

**Parameters:**
- s

- a

String

containing the value to be
written.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

s

is

null

.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### void writeUTF​(
String
s)
throws
IOException

Writes two bytes of length information to the output stream in
network byte order, followed by the

modified
UTF-8

representation of every character in the string

s

.
If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown. Each character in
the string

s

is converted to a group of one, two,
or three bytes, depending on the value of the character.

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0001

through

\u007f

, it is
represented by one byte:

```java
(byte)c
```

If a character

c

is

\u0000

or
is in the range

\u0080

through

\u07ff

, then it is represented by two bytes,
to be written in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xc0 | (0x1f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0800

through

uffff

, then it is
represented by three bytes, to be written in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xe0 | (0x0f & (c >> 12)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

First, the total number of bytes needed to represent all
the characters of

s

is calculated. If this number
is larger than

65535

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, this
length is written to the output stream in exactly the manner of
the

writeShort

method; after this, the one-, two-,
or three-byte representation of each character in the string

s

is written.

The current byte order setting is ignored.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write.

Note:

This method should not be used in
the implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8,
because the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with
standard UTF-8.

**Specified by:**
- writeUTF

in interface

DataOutput

**Parameters:**
- s

- a

String

containing the value to be
written.

**Throws:**

representation of

s

requires more than 65536 bytes.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

#### void writeBit​(int bit)
throws
IOException

Writes a single bit, given by the least significant bit of the
argument, to the stream at the current bit offset within the
current byte position. The upper 31 bits of the argument are
ignored. The given bit replaces the previous bit at that
position. The bit offset is advanced by one and reduced modulo
8.

If any bits of a particular byte have never been set
at the time the byte is flushed to the destination, those
bits will be set to 0 automatically.

**Parameters:**
- bit

- an

int

whose least significant bit
is to be written to the stream.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### void writeBits​(long bits,
int numBits)
throws
IOException

Writes a sequence of bits, given by the

numBits

least significant bits of the

bits

argument in
left-to-right order, to the stream at the current bit offset
within the current byte position. The upper

64 - numBits

bits of the argument are ignored. The bit
offset is advanced by

numBits

and reduced modulo
8. Note that a bit offset of 0 always indicates the
most-significant bit of the byte, and bytes of bits are written
out in sequence as they are encountered. Thus bit writes are
always effectively in network byte order. The actual stream
byte order setting is ignored.

Bit data may be accumulated in memory indefinitely, until

flushBefore

is called. At that time, all bit data
prior to the flushed position will be written.

If any bits of a particular byte have never been set
at the time the byte is flushed to the destination, those
bits will be set to 0 automatically.

**Parameters:**
- bits

- a

long

containing the bits to be
written, starting with the bit in position

numBits - 1

down to the least significant bit.
- numBits

- an

int

between 0 and 64, inclusive.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

numBits

is
not between 0 and 64, inclusive.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### void flushBefore​(long pos)
throws
IOException

Flushes all data prior to the given position to the underlying
destination, such as an

OutputStream

or

File

. Attempting to seek to the flushed portion
of the stream will result in an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

.

**Specified by:**
- flushBefore

in interface

ImageInputStream

**Parameters:**
- pos

- a

long

containing the length of the
stream prefix that may be flushed to the destination.

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

pos

lies
in the flushed portion of the stream or past the current stream
position.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- write

```java
void write​(int b)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a single byte to the stream at the current position.
The 24 high-order bits of

b

are ignored.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write. Implementers can use the

flushBits

method of

ImageOutputStreamImpl

to guarantee this.

**Specified by:** write

in interface

DataOutput
**Parameters:** b

- an

int

whose lower 8 bits are to be
written.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- write

```java
void write​(byte[] b)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a sequence of bytes to the stream at the current
position. If

b.length

is 0, nothing is written.
The byte

b[0]

is written first, then the byte

b[1]

, and so on.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write.

**Specified by:** write

in interface

DataOutput
**Parameters:** b

- an array of

byte

s to be written.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

b

is

null

.

- if an I/O error occurs.

- write

```java
void write​(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a sequence of bytes to the stream at the current
position. If

len

is 0, nothing is written.
The byte

b[off]

is written first, then the byte

b[off + 1]

, and so on.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write. Implementers can use the

flushBits

method of

ImageOutputStreamImpl

to guarantee this.

**Specified by:** write

in interface

DataOutput
**Parameters:** b

- an array of

byte

s to be written.
**Parameters:** off

- the start offset in the data.
**Parameters:** len

is

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- writeBoolean

```java
void writeBoolean​(boolean v)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a

boolean

value to the stream. If

v

is true, the value

(byte)1

is
written; if

v

is false, the value

void writeByte​(int v)
throws
IOException
```

Writes the 8 low-order bits of

v

to the
stream. The 24 high-order bits of

v

are ignored.
(This means that

writeByte

does exactly the same
thing as

write

for an integer argument.)

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write.

- writeBytes

```java
void writeBytes​(
String
s)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a string to the output stream. For every character in
the string

s

, taken in order, one byte is written
to the output stream. If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown.

If

s.length

is zero, then no bytes are
written. Otherwise, the character

s[0]

is written
first, then

s[1]

, and so on; the last character
written is

s[s.length-1]

. For each character, one
byte is written, the low-order byte, in exactly the manner of
the

writeByte

method. The high-order eight bits of
each character in the string are ignored.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write.

**Specified by:** writeBytes

in interface

DataOutput
**Parameters:** s

- a

String

containing the value to be
written.

- if

s

is

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- writeChars

```java
void writeChars​(
String
s)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a string to the output stream. For every character in
the string

s

, taken in order, two bytes are
written to the output stream, ordered according to the current
byte order setting. If network byte order is being used, the
high-order byte is written first; the order is reversed
otherwise. If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown.

If

s.length

is zero, then no bytes are
written. Otherwise, the character

s[0]

is written
first, then

s[1]

, and so on; the last character
written is

s[s.length-1]

.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write.

**Specified by:** writeChars

in interface

DataOutput
**Parameters:** s

- a

String

containing the value to be
written.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

s

is

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- writeUTF

```java
void writeUTF​(
String
s)
throws
IOException
```

Writes two bytes of length information to the output stream in
network byte order, followed by the

modified
UTF-8

representation of every character in the string

s

.
If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown. Each character in
the string

s

is converted to a group of one, two,
or three bytes, depending on the value of the character.

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0001

through

\u007f

, it is
represented by one byte:

```java
(byte)c
```

If a character

c

is

\u0000

or
is in the range

\u0080

through

\u07ff

, then it is represented by two bytes,
to be written in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xc0 | (0x1f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0800

through

uffff

, then it is
represented by three bytes, to be written in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xe0 | (0x0f & (c >> 12)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

First, the total number of bytes needed to represent all
the characters of

s

is calculated. If this number
is larger than

65535

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, this
length is written to the output stream in exactly the manner of
the

writeShort

method; after this, the one-, two-,
or three-byte representation of each character in the string

s

is written.

The current byte order setting is ignored.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write.

Note:

This method should not be used in
the implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8,
because the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with
standard UTF-8.

**Specified by:** writeUTF

in interface

DataOutput
**Parameters:** s

- a

String

containing the value to be
written.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

s

is

```java
void writeShorts​(short[] s,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a sequence of shorts to the stream at the current
position. If

len

is 0, nothing is written.
The short

s[off]

is written first, then the short

s[off + 1]

, and so on. The byte order of the
stream is used to determine the order in which the individual
bytes are written.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the
write.

**Parameters:** s

- if an I/O error occurs.

- writeChars

```java
void writeChars​(char[] c,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a sequence of chars to the stream at the current
position. If

len

is 0, nothing is written.
The char

c[off]

is written first, then the char

c[off + 1]

, and so on. The byte order of the
stream is used to determine the order in which the individual
bytes are written.

If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the

throws
IOException
```

Writes a single bit, given by the least significant bit of the
argument, to the stream at the current bit offset within the
current byte position. The upper 31 bits of the argument are
ignored. The given bit replaces the previous bit at that
position. The bit offset is advanced by one and reduced modulo
8.

If any bits of a particular byte have never been set
at the time the byte is flushed to the destination, those
bits will be set to 0 automatically.

**Parameters:** bit

- an

int

whose least significant bit
is to be written to the stream.
**Throws:** IOException

least significant bits of the

bits

argument in
left-to-right order, to the stream at the current bit offset
within the current byte position. The upper

64 - numBits

bits of the argument are ignored. The bit
offset is advanced by

numBits

and reduced modulo
8. Note that a bit offset of 0 always indicates the
most-significant bit of the byte, and bytes of bits are written
out in sequence as they are encountered. Thus bit writes are
always effectively in network byte order. The actual stream
byte order setting is ignored.

Bit data may be accumulated in memory indefinitely, until

flushBefore

is called. At that time, all bit data
prior to the flushed position will be written.

If any bits of a particular byte have never been set
at the time the byte is flushed to the destination, those
bits will be set to 0 automatically.

s

.
If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown. Each character in
the string

s

is converted to a group of one, two,
or three bytes, depending on the value of the character.

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0001

through

\u007f

, it is
represented by one byte:

```java
(byte)c
```

If a character

c

is

\u0000

or
is in the range

\u0080

through

\u07ff

, then it is represented by two bytes,
to be written in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xc0 | (0x1f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0800

through

uffff

, then it is
represented by three bytes, to be written in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xe0 | (0x0f & (c >> 12)))

(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

First, the total number of bytes needed to represent all
the characters of

s

is calculated. If this number
is larger than

65535

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, this
length is written to the output stream in exactly the manner of
the

writeShort

method; after this, the one-, two-,
or three-byte representation of each character in the string

s

is written.

The current byte order setting is ignored.

- if an I/O error occurs.

- writeBits

```java
void writeBits​(long bits,
int numBits)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a sequence of bits, given by the

numBits

least significant bits of the

bits

argument in
left-to-right order, to the stream at the current bit offset
within the current byte position. The upper

64 - numBits

bits of the argument are ignored. The bit
offset is advanced by

numBits

and reduced modulo
8. Note that a bit offset of 0 always indicates the
most-significant bit of the byte, and bytes of bits are written
out in sequence as they are encountered. Thus bit writes are
always effectively in network byte order. The actual stream
byte order setting is ignored.

Bit data may be accumulated in memory indefinitely, until

flushBefore

is called. At that time, all bit data
prior to the flushed position will be written.

If any bits of a particular byte have never been set
at the time the byte is flushed to the destination, those
bits will be set to 0 automatically.

**Parameters:** bits

- a

long

containing the bits to be
written, starting with the bit in position

numBits - 1

down to the least significant bit.
**Parameters:** numBits

- an

int

between 0 and 64, inclusive.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

numBits

is
not between 0 and 64, inclusive.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- flushBefore

```java
void flushBefore​(long pos)
throws
IOException
```

Flushes all data prior to the given position to the underlying
destination, such as an

OutputStream

or

File

. Attempting to seek to the flushed portion
of the stream will result in an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

.

**Specified by:** flushBefore

in interface

ImageInputStream
**Parameters:** pos

- a

long

containing the length of the
stream prefix that may be flushed to the destination.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

pos

lies
in the flushed portion of the stream or past the current stream
position.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
