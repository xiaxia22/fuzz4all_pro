# Class CipherSpi

**Source:** `java.base\javax\crypto\CipherSpi.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
CipherSpi

extends
Object
```

This class defines the

Service Provider Interface

(

SPI

)
for the

Cipher

class.
All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
of a particular cipher algorithm.

In order to create an instance of

Cipher

, which
encapsulates an instance of this

CipherSpi

class, an
application calls one of the

getInstance

factory methods of the

Cipher

engine class and specifies the requested

transformation

.
Optionally, the application may also specify the name of a provider.

A

transformation

is a string that describes the operation (or
set of operations) to be performed on the given input, to produce some
output. A transformation always includes the name of a cryptographic
algorithm (e.g.,

AES

), and may be followed by a feedback mode and
padding scheme.

A transformation is of the form:

- "

algorithm/mode/padding

" or

"

algorithm

"

(in the latter case,
provider-specific default values for the mode and padding scheme are used).
For example, the following is a valid transformation:

```java
Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("
AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
");
```

A provider may supply a separate class for each combination
of

algorithm/mode/padding

, or may decide to provide more generic
classes representing sub-transformations corresponding to

algorithm

or

algorithm/mode

or

algorithm//padding

(note the double slashes),
in which case the requested mode and/or padding are set automatically by
the

getInstance

methods of

Cipher

, which invoke
the

engineSetMode

and

engineSetPadding

methods of the provider's subclass of

CipherSpi

.

A

Cipher

property in a provider master class may have one of
the following formats:

- ```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with
// pluggable mode and padding

Cipher.
algName
```

```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" in the
// specified "mode", with pluggable padding

Cipher.
algName/mode
```

```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with the
// specified "padding", with pluggable mode

Cipher.
algName//padding
```

```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with the
// specified "mode" and "padding"

Cipher.
algName/mode/padding
```

For example, a provider may supply a subclass of

CipherSpi

that implements

AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding

, one that implements

AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding

, one that implements

AES/CFB/PKCS5Padding

, and yet another one that implements

AES/OFB/PKCS5Padding

. That provider would have the following

Cipher

properties in its master class:

- ```java
Cipher.
AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding
```

```java
Cipher.
AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
```

```java
Cipher.
AES/CFB/PKCS5Padding
```

```java
Cipher.
AES/OFB/PKCS5Padding
```

Another provider may implement a class for each of the above modes
(i.e., one class for

ECB

, one for

CBC

, one for

CFB

,
and one for

OFB

), one class for

PKCS5Padding

,
and a generic

AES

class that subclasses from

CipherSpi

.
That provider would have the following

Cipher

properties in its master class:

- ```java
Cipher.
AES
```

The

getInstance

factory method of the

Cipher

engine class follows these rules in order to instantiate a provider's
implementation of

CipherSpi

for a
transformation of the form "

algorithm

":

- Check if the provider has registered a subclass of

CipherSpi

for the specified "

algorithm

".

If the answer is YES, instantiate this
class, for whose mode and padding scheme default values (as supplied by
the provider) are used.

If the answer is NO, throw a

NoSuchAlgorithmException

exception.

The

getInstance

factory method of the

Cipher

engine class follows these rules in order to instantiate a provider's
implementation of

CipherSpi

CipherSpi

for the specified "

algorithm/mode/padding

padding

)

on the new instance.

If the answer is NO, throw a

NoSuchAlgorithmException

exception.

### Method Details

#### protected abstract void engineSetMode​(
String
mode)
throws
NoSuchAlgorithmException

Sets the mode of this cipher.

**Parameters:**
- mode

- the cipher mode

**Throws:**
- NoSuchAlgorithmException

- if the requested cipher mode does
not exist

---

#### protected abstract void engineSetPadding​(
String
padding)
throws
NoSuchPaddingException

Sets the padding mechanism of this cipher.

**Parameters:**
- padding

- the padding mechanism

**Throws:**
- NoSuchPaddingException

- if the requested padding mechanism
does not exist

---

#### protected abstract int engineGetBlockSize()

Returns the block size (in bytes).

**Returns:**
- the block size (in bytes), or 0 if the underlying algorithm is
not a block cipher

---

#### protected abstract int engineGetOutputSize​(int inputLen)

Returns the length in bytes that an output buffer would
need to be in order to hold the result of the next

update

or

doFinal

operation, given the input length

inputLen

(in bytes).

This call takes into account any unprocessed (buffered) data from a
previous

update

call, padding, and AEAD tagging.

The actual output length of the next

update

or

doFinal

call may be smaller than the length returned by
this method.

**Parameters:**
- inputLen

- the input length (in bytes)

**Returns:**
- the required output buffer size (in bytes)

---

#### protected abstract byte[] engineGetIV()

Returns the initialization vector (IV) in a new buffer.

This is useful in the context of password-based encryption or
decryption, where the IV is derived from a user-provided passphrase.

**Returns:**
- the initialization vector in a new buffer, or null if the
underlying algorithm does not use an IV, or if the IV has not yet
been set.

---

#### protected abstract
AlgorithmParameters
engineGetParameters()

Returns the parameters used with this cipher.

The returned parameters may be the same that were used to initialize
this cipher, or may contain a combination of default and random
parameter values used by the underlying cipher implementation if this
cipher requires algorithm parameters but was not initialized with any.

**Returns:**
- the parameters used with this cipher, or null if this cipher
does not use any parameters.

---

#### protected abstract void engineInit​(int opmode,

Key
key,

SecureRandom
random)
throws
InvalidKeyException

Initializes this cipher with a key and a source
of randomness.

The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations:
encryption, decryption, key wrapping or key unwrapping, depending on
the value of

opmode

.

If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters that cannot be
derived from the given

key

, the underlying cipher
implementation is supposed to generate the required parameters itself
(using provider-specific default or random values) if it is being
initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an

InvalidKeyException

if it is being
initialized for decryption or key unwrapping.
The generated parameters can be retrieved using

engineGetParameters

or

engineGetIV

(if the parameter is an IV).

If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be
derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable
provider-specific default values, initialization will
necessarily fail.

If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme)
requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get
them from

random

.

Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all
previously-acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is
equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing
it.

**Parameters:**
- opmode

- the operation mode of this cipher (this is one of
the following:

ENCRYPT_MODE

,

DECRYPT_MODE

,

WRAP_MODE

or

UNWRAP_MODE

)
- key

- the encryption key
- random

- the source of randomness

**Throws:**
- InvalidKeyException

- if the given key is inappropriate for
initializing this cipher, or requires
algorithm parameters that cannot be
determined from the given key.
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if

opmode

is

WRAP_MODE

or

UNWRAP_MODE

is not implemented
by the cipher.

random)
throws
InvalidKeyException
,

InvalidAlgorithmParameterException

Initializes this cipher with a key, a set of
algorithm parameters, and a source of randomness.

The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations:
encryption, decryption, key wrapping or key unwrapping, depending on
the value of

opmode

.

If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters and

params

is null, the underlying cipher implementation is
supposed to generate the required parameters itself (using
provider-specific default or random values) if it is being
initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an

InvalidAlgorithmParameterException

if it is being
initialized for decryption or key unwrapping.
The generated parameters can be retrieved using

engineGetParameters

or

engineGetIV

(if the parameter is an IV).

If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be
derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable
provider-specific default values, initialization will
necessarily fail.

If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme)
requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get
them from

random

.

Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all
previously-acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is
equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing
it.

**Parameters:**

,

DECRYPT_MODE

,

WRAP_MODE

#### Class CipherSpi

java.lang.Object

- javax.crypto.CipherSpi

javax.crypto.CipherSpi

```java
public abstract class
CipherSpi

extends
Object
```

This class defines the

Service Provider Interface

(

SPI

)
for the

Cipher

class.
All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
of a particular cipher algorithm.

In order to create an instance of

Cipher

, which
encapsulates an instance of this

CipherSpi

class, an
application calls one of the

getInstance

factory methods of the

Cipher

engine class and specifies the requested

transformation

.
Optionally, the application may also specify the name of a provider.

A

transformation

is a string that describes the operation (or
set of operations) to be performed on the given input, to produce some
output. A transformation always includes the name of a cryptographic
algorithm (e.g.,

AES

), and may be followed by a feedback mode and
padding scheme.

A transformation is of the form:

- "

algorithm/mode/padding

" or

"

algorithm

"

(in the latter case,
provider-specific default values for the mode and padding scheme are used).
For example, the following is a valid transformation:

```java
Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("
AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
");
```

A provider may supply a separate class for each combination
of

algorithm/mode/padding

, or may decide to provide more generic
classes representing sub-transformations corresponding to

algorithm

or

algorithm/mode

or

algorithm//padding

(note the double slashes),
in which case the requested mode and/or padding are set automatically by
the

getInstance

methods of

Cipher

, which invoke
the

engineSetMode

and

engineSetPadding

methods of the provider's subclass of

CipherSpi

.

A

Cipher

property in a provider master class may have one of
the following formats:

- ```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with
// pluggable mode and padding

Cipher.
algName
```

```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" in the
// specified "mode", with pluggable padding

Cipher.
algName/mode
```

```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with the
// specified "padding", with pluggable mode

Cipher.
algName//padding
```

```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with the
// specified "mode" and "padding"

Cipher.
algName/mode/padding
```

For example, a provider may supply a subclass of

CipherSpi

that implements

AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding

, one that implements

AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding

, one that implements

AES/CFB/PKCS5Padding

, and yet another one that implements

AES/OFB/PKCS5Padding

. That provider would have the following

Cipher

```

```java
Cipher.
AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
```

```java
Cipher.
AES/CFB/PKCS5Padding
```

```java
Cipher.
AES/OFB/PKCS5Padding
```

Another provider may implement a class for each of the above modes
(i.e., one class for

ECB

, one for

CBC

, one for

CFB

,
and one for

OFB

), one class for

PKCS5Padding

public abstract class

CipherSpi

extends

Object

This class defines the

Service Provider Interface

(

SPI

)
for the

Cipher

class.
All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
of a particular cipher algorithm.

In order to create an instance of

Cipher

, which
encapsulates an instance of this

CipherSpi

class, an
application calls one of the

getInstance

factory methods of the

Cipher

engine class and specifies the requested

transformation

.
Optionally, the application may also specify the name of a provider.

A

transformation

is a string that describes the operation (or
set of operations) to be performed on the given input, to produce some
output. A transformation always includes the name of a cryptographic
algorithm (e.g.,

AES

), and may be followed by a feedback mode and
padding scheme.

A transformation is of the form:

- "

algorithm/mode/padding

" or

"

algorithm

"

(in the latter case,
provider-specific default values for the mode and padding scheme are used).
For example, the following is a valid transformation:

```java
Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("
AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
");
```

A provider may supply a separate class for each combination
of

algorithm/mode/padding

, or may decide to provide more generic
classes representing sub-transformations corresponding to

algorithm

or

algorithm/mode

or

algorithm//padding

(note the double slashes),
in which case the requested mode and/or padding are set automatically by
the

getInstance

methods of

Cipher

, which invoke
the

engineSetMode

and

engineSetPadding

methods of the provider's subclass of

CipherSpi

.

A

Cipher

property in a provider master class may have one of
the following formats:

- ```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with

```

```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" in the
// specified "mode", with pluggable padding

Cipher.
algName/mode
```

```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with the
// specified "padding", with pluggable mode

Cipher.
algName//padding
```

```java
// provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with the
// specified "mode" and "padding"

Cipher.
algName/mode/padding
```

For example, a provider may supply a subclass of

CipherSpi

that implements

AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding

, one that implements

AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding

, one that implements

AES/CFB/PKCS5Padding

, and yet another one that implements

AES/OFB/PKCS5Padding

. That provider would have the following

```java

```

```java

```java

(i.e., one class for

String
mode)
throws
NoSuchAlgorithmException
```

Sets the mode of this cipher.

**Parameters:** mode

- the cipher mode
**Throws:** NoSuchAlgorithmException

- if the requested cipher mode does
not exist

- engineSetPadding

```java
protected abstract void engineSetPadding​(
String
padding)
throws
NoSuchPaddingException
```

Sets the padding mechanism of this cipher.

**Parameters:** padding

- the padding mechanism
**Throws:** NoSuchPaddingException

- if the requested padding mechanism
does not exist

- engineGetBlockSize

```java
protected abstract int engineGetBlockSize()
```

Returns the block size (in bytes).

**Returns:** the block size (in bytes), or 0 if the underlying algorithm is
not a block cipher

- engineGetOutputSize

```java
protected abstract int engineGetOutputSize​(int inputLen)
```

Returns the length in bytes that an output buffer would
need to be in order to hold the result of the next

update

or

doFinal

operation, given the input length

inputLen

(in bytes).

This call takes into account any unprocessed (buffered) data from a
previous

update

call, padding, and AEAD tagging.

The actual output length of the next

update

or

doFinal

call may be smaller than the length returned by
this method.

**Parameters:** inputLen

- the input length (in bytes)
**Returns:** the required output buffer size (in bytes)

- engineGetIV

```java
protected abstract byte[] engineGetIV()
```

Returns the initialization vector (IV) in a new buffer.

This is useful in the context of password-based encryption or
decryption, where the IV is derived from a user-provided passphrase.

**Returns:** the initialization vector in a new buffer, or null if the
underlying algorithm does not use an IV, or if the IV has not yet
been set.

- engineGetParameters

```java
protected abstract
AlgorithmParameters
engineGetParameters()
```

Returns the parameters used with this cipher.

The returned parameters may be the same that were used to initialize
this cipher, or may contain a combination of default and random
parameter values used by the underlying cipher implementation if this
cipher requires algorithm parameters but was not initialized with any.

**Returns:** the parameters used with this cipher, or null if this cipher
does not use any parameters.

- engineInit

```java
protected abstract void engineInit​(int opmode,

Key
key,

SecureRandom
random)
throws
InvalidKeyException
```

Initializes this cipher with a key and a source
of randomness.

The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations:
encryption, decryption, key wrapping or key unwrapping, depending on
the value of

opmode

.

If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters that cannot be
derived from the given

key

, the underlying cipher
implementation is supposed to generate the required parameters itself
(using provider-specific default or random values) if it is being
initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an

InvalidKeyException

if it is being
initialized for decryption or key unwrapping.
The generated parameters can be retrieved using

engineGetParameters

or

engineGetIV

(if the parameter is an IV).

If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be
derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable
provider-specific default values, initialization will
necessarily fail.

If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme)
requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get
them from

random

.

Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all
previously-acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is
equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing
it.

**Parameters:** opmode

- the operation mode of this cipher (this is one of
the following:

ENCRYPT_MODE

,

DECRYPT_MODE

,

WRAP_MODE

or

UNWRAP_MODE

)
**Parameters:** key

- the encryption key
**Parameters:** random

- the source of randomness
**Throws:** InvalidKeyException

- if the given key is inappropriate for
initializing this cipher, or requires
algorithm parameters that cannot be
determined from the given key.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if

opmode

is

WRAP_MODE

or

UNWRAP_MODE

is not implemented
by the cipher.

- engineInit

```java
protected abstract void engineInit​(int opmode,

Key
key,

AlgorithmParameterSpec
params,

SecureRandom
random)
throws
InvalidKeyException
,

InvalidAlgorithmParameterException
```

Initializes this cipher with a key, a set of
algorithm parameters, and a source of randomness.

The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations:
encryption, decryption, key wrapping or key unwrapping, depending on
the value of

opmode

.

If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters and

params

is null, the underlying cipher implementation is
supposed to generate the required parameters itself (using
provider-specific default or random values) if it is being
initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an

InvalidAlgorithmParameterException

if it is being
initialized for decryption or key unwrapping.
The generated parameters can be retrieved using

engineGetParameters

or

engineGetIV

(if the parameter is an IV).

If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be
derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable
provider-specific default values, initialization will
necessarily fail.

If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme)
requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get
them from

random

.

Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all
previously-acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is
equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing
it.

parameters are inappropriate for this cipher,
or if this cipher requires
algorithm parameters and

params

is null.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if

opmode

is

WRAP_MODE

or

is not implemented
by the cipher.

AlgorithmParameters
params,

SecureRandom
random)
throws
InvalidKeyException
,

the value of

opmode

.

```

Encrypts or decrypts data in a single-part operation,
or finishes a multiple-part operation.
The data is encrypted or decrypted, depending on how this cipher was
initialized.

All

input.remaining()

bytes starting at

input.position()

are processed.
If an AEAD mode such as GCM/CCM is being used, the authentication
tag is appended in the case of encryption, or verified in the
case of decryption.
The result is stored in the output buffer.
Upon return, the input buffer's position will be equal
to its limit; its limit will not have changed. The output buffer's
position will have advanced by n, where n is the value returned
by this method; the output buffer's limit will not have changed.

If

output.remaining()

bytes are insufficient to
hold the result, a

ShortBufferException

is thrown.

Upon finishing, this method resets this cipher object to the state
it was in when previously initialized via a call to

engineInit

.
That is, the object is reset and available to encrypt or decrypt
(depending on the operation mode that was specified in the call to

engineInit

) more data.

Note: if any exception is thrown, this cipher object may need to
be reset before it can be used again.

Subclasses should consider overriding this method if they can
process ByteBuffers more efficiently than byte arrays.

**Parameters:** input

- the input ByteBuffer
**Parameters:** output

- the output ByteByffer
**Returns:** the number of bytes stored in

output
**Throws:** IllegalBlockSizeException

- if this cipher is a block cipher,
no padding has been requested (only in encryption mode), and the total
input length of the data processed by this cipher is not a multiple of
block size; or if this encryption algorithm is unable to
process the input data provided.
**Throws:** ShortBufferException

- if there is insufficient space in the
output buffer
**Throws:** BadPaddingException

- if this cipher is in decryption mode,
and (un)padding has been requested, but the decrypted data is not
bounded by the appropriate padding bytes
**Throws:** AEADBadTagException

- if this cipher is decrypting in an
AEAD mode (such as GCM/CCM), and the received authentication tag
does not match the calculated value
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if either parameter is

null
**Since:** 1.5

throws
IllegalBlockSizeException
,

InvalidKeyException
```

Wrap a key.

This concrete method has been added to this previously-defined
abstract class. (For backwards compatibility, it cannot be abstract.)
It may be overridden by a provider to wrap a key.
Such an override is expected to throw an IllegalBlockSizeException or
InvalidKeyException (under the specified circumstances),
if the given key cannot be wrapped.
If this method is not overridden, it always throws an
UnsupportedOperationException.

**Parameters:** key

- the key to be wrapped.
**Returns:** the wrapped key.
**Throws:** IllegalBlockSizeException

- if this cipher is a block cipher,
no padding has been requested, and the length of the encoding of the
key to be wrapped is not a multiple of the block size.
**Throws:** InvalidKeyException

- if it is impossible or unsafe to
wrap the key with this cipher (e.g., a hardware protected key is
being passed to a software-only cipher).
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this method is not supported.
