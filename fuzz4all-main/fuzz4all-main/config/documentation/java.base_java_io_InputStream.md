# Class InputStream

**Source:** `java.base\java\io\InputStream.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
InputStream

extends
Object

implements
Closeable
```

This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing
an input stream of bytes.

Applications that need to define a subclass of

InputStream

must always provide a method that returns the next byte of input.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Closeable

,

AutoCloseable

---

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public InputStream()

*No description found.*

---

### Method Details

#### public static
InputStream
nullInputStream()

Returns a new

InputStream

that reads no bytes. The returned
stream is initially open. The stream is closed by calling the

close()

method. Subsequent calls to

close()

have no
effect.

While the stream is open, the

available()

,

read()

,

read(byte[])

,

read(byte[], int, int)

,

readAllBytes()

,

readNBytes(byte[], int, int)

,

readNBytes(int)

,

skip(long)

, and

transferTo()

methods all behave as if end of stream has been
reached. After the stream has been closed, these methods all throw

IOException

.

The

markSupported()

method returns

false

. The

mark()

method does nothing, and the

reset()

method
throws

IOException

.

**Returns:**
- an

InputStream

which contains no bytes

**Since:**
- 11

---

#### public abstract int read()
throws
IOException

Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is
returned as an

int

in the range

0

to

255

. If no byte is available because the end of the stream
has been reached, the value

-1

is returned. This method
blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected,
or an exception is thrown.

A subclass must provide an implementation of this method.

**Returns:**
- the next byte of data, or

-1

if the end of the
stream is reached.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### public int read​(byte[] b)
throws
IOException

Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into
the buffer array

b

. The number of bytes actually read is
returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is
available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.

If the length of

b

is zero, then no bytes are read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at the
end of the file, the value

-1

is returned; otherwise, at
least one byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[0]

, the
next one into

b[1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read is,
at most, equal to the length of

b

. Let

k

be the
number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements

b[0]

through

b[

k

-1]

,
leaving elements

b[

k

]

through

b[b.length-1]

unaffected.

The

read(b)

method for class

InputStream

has the same effect as:

```java
read(b, 0, b.length)
```

**Parameters:**
- b

- the buffer into which the data is read.

**Returns:**
- the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end of
the stream has been reached.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than the end of the file, if the input stream has been closed, or
if some other I/O error occurs.
- NullPointerException

- if

b

is

null

.

**See Also:**
- read(byte[], int, int)

---

#### public int read​(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException

Reads up to

len

bytes of data from the input stream into
an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as

len

bytes, but a smaller number may be read.
The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.

This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is
detected, or an exception is thrown.

If

len

is zero, then no bytes are read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of
file, the value

-1

is returned; otherwise, at least one
byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[off]

, the
next one into

b[off+1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read
is, at most, equal to

len

. Let

k

be the number of
bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements

b[off]

through

b[off+

k

-1]

,
leaving elements

b[off+

k

]

through

b[off+len-1]

unaffected.

In every case, elements

b[0]

through

b[off]

and elements

b[off+len]

through

b[b.length-1]

are unaffected.

The

read(b,

off,

len)

method
for class

InputStream

simply calls the method

read()

repeatedly. If the first such call results in an

IOException

, that exception is returned from the call to
the

read(b,

off,

len)

method. If
any subsequent call to

read()

results in a

IOException

, the exception is caught and treated as if it
were end of file; the bytes read up to that point are stored into

b

and the number of bytes read before the exception
occurred is returned. The default implementation of this method blocks
until the requested amount of input data

len

has been read,
end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. Subclasses are
encouraged to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.

**Parameters:**
- b

- the buffer into which the data is read.
- off

- the start offset in array

b

at which the data is written.
- len

- the maximum number of bytes to read.

**Returns:**
- the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end of
the stream has been reached.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than end of file, or if the input stream has been closed, or if
some other I/O error occurs.
- NullPointerException

- If

b

is

null

.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If

off

is negative,

len

is negative, or

len

is greater than

b.length - off

**See Also:**
- read()

---

#### public byte[] readAllBytes()
throws
IOException

Reads all remaining bytes from the input stream. This method blocks until
all remaining bytes have been read and end of stream is detected, or an
exception is thrown. This method does not close the input stream.

When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
method will return an empty byte array.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read all bytes into a byte array. It is not intended for
reading input streams with large amounts of data.

The behavior for the case where the input stream is

asynchronously
closed

, or the thread interrupted during the read, is highly input
stream specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream, then it may do
so after some, but not all, bytes have been read. Consequently the input
stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
It is strongly recommended that the stream be promptly closed if an I/O
error occurs.

**Returns:**
- a byte array containing the bytes read from this input stream

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- OutOfMemoryError

- if an array of the required size cannot be
allocated.

**Since:**
- 9

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This method invokes

readNBytes(int)

with a length of

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

---

#### public byte[] readNBytes​(int len)
throws
IOException

Reads up to a specified number of bytes from the input stream. This
method blocks until the requested number of bytes have been read, end
of stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. This method does not
close the input stream.

The length of the returned array equals the number of bytes read
from the stream. If

len

is zero, then no bytes are read and
an empty byte array is returned. Otherwise, up to

len

bytes
are read from the stream. Fewer than

len

bytes may be read if
end of stream is encountered.

When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
method will return an empty byte array.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read the specified number of bytes into a byte array. The
total amount of memory allocated by this method is proportional to the
number of bytes read from the stream which is bounded by

len

.
Therefore, the method may be safely called with very large values of

len

provided sufficient memory is available.

The behavior for the case where the input stream is

asynchronously
closed

, or the thread interrupted during the read, is highly input
stream specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream, then it may do
so after some, but not all, bytes have been read. Consequently the input
stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
It is strongly recommended that the stream be promptly closed if an I/O
error occurs.

**Parameters:**
- len

- the maximum number of bytes to read

**Returns:**
- a byte array containing the bytes read from this input stream

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

length

is negative
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- OutOfMemoryError

- if an array of the required size cannot be
allocated.

**Since:**
- 11

**Implementation Note:**
- The number of bytes allocated to read data from this stream and return
the result is bounded by

2*(long)len

, inclusive.

---

#### public int readNBytes​(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException

Reads the requested number of bytes from the input stream into the given
byte array. This method blocks until

len

bytes of input data have
been read, end of stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. The
number of bytes actually read, possibly zero, is returned. This method
does not close the input stream.

In the case where end of stream is reached before

len

bytes
have been read, then the actual number of bytes read will be returned.
When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
method will return zero.

If

len

is zero, then no bytes are read and

0

is
returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read up to

len

bytes.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[off]

, the next
one in to

b[off+1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read is, at
most, equal to

len

. Let

k

be the number of bytes actually
read; these bytes will be stored in elements

b[off]

through

b[off+

k

-1]

, leaving elements

b[off+

k

]

through

b[off+len-1]

unaffected.

The behavior for the case where the input stream is

asynchronously
closed

, or the thread interrupted during the read, is highly input
stream specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream, then it may do
so after some, but not all, bytes of

b

have been updated with
data from the input stream. Consequently the input stream and

b

may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly recommended that the
stream be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.

**Parameters:**
- b

- the byte array into which the data is read
- off

- the start offset in

b

at which the data is written
- len

- the maximum number of bytes to read

**Returns:**
- the actual number of bytes read into the buffer

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
- NullPointerException

- if

b

is

null
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If

off

is negative,

len

is negative, or

len

is greater than

b.length - off

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public long skip​(long n)
throws
IOException

Skips over and discards

n

bytes of data from this input
stream. The

skip

method may, for a variety of reasons, end
up skipping over some smaller number of bytes, possibly

0

.
This may result from any of a number of conditions; reaching end of file
before

n

bytes have been skipped is only one possibility.
The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. If

n

is
negative, the

skip

method for class

InputStream

always
returns 0, and no bytes are skipped. Subclasses may handle the negative
value differently.

The

skip

method implementation of this class creates a
byte array and then repeatedly reads into it until

n

bytes
have been read or the end of the stream has been reached. Subclasses are
encouraged to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
For instance, the implementation may depend on the ability to seek.

**Parameters:**
- n

- the number of bytes to be skipped.

**Returns:**
- the actual number of bytes skipped.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### public int available()
throws
IOException

Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped
over) from this input stream without blocking, which may be 0, or 0 when
end of stream is detected. The read might be on the same thread or
another thread. A single read or skip of this many bytes will not block,
but may read or skip fewer bytes.

Note that while some implementations of

InputStream

will
return the total number of bytes in the stream, many will not. It is
never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate
a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream.

A subclass's implementation of this method may choose to throw an

IOException

if this input stream has been closed by invoking the

close()

method.

The

available

method of

InputStream

always returns

0

.

This method should be overridden by subclasses.

**Returns:**
- an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or
skipped over) from this input stream without blocking or

0

when it reaches the end of the input stream.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### public void close()
throws
IOException

Closes this input stream and releases any system resources associated
with the stream.

The

close

method of

InputStream

does
nothing.

**Specified by:**
- close

in interface

AutoCloseable
- close

in interface

Closeable

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### public void mark​(int readlimit)

Marks the current position in this input stream. A subsequent call to
the

reset

method repositions this stream at the last marked
position so that subsequent reads re-read the same bytes.

The

readlimit

arguments tells this input stream to
allow that many bytes to be read before the mark position gets
invalidated.

The general contract of

mark

is that, if the method

markSupported

returns

true

, the stream somehow
remembers all the bytes read after the call to

mark

and
stands ready to supply those same bytes again if and whenever the method

reset

is called. However, the stream is not required to
remember any data at all if more than

readlimit

bytes are
read from the stream before

reset

is called.

Marking a closed stream should not have any effect on the stream.

The

mark

method of

InputStream

does
nothing.

**Parameters:**
- readlimit

- the maximum limit of bytes that can be read before
the mark position becomes invalid.

**See Also:**
- reset()

---

#### public void reset()
throws
IOException

Repositions this stream to the position at the time the

mark

method was last called on this input stream.

The general contract of

reset

is:

- If the method

markSupported

returns

true

, then:

- If the method

mark

has not been called since
the stream was created, or the number of bytes read from the stream
since

mark

was last called is larger than the argument
to

mark

at that last call, then an

IOException

might be thrown.

If such an

IOException

is not thrown, then the
stream is reset to a state such that all the bytes read since the
most recent call to

mark

(or since the start of the
file, if

mark

has not been called) will be resupplied
to subsequent callers of the

read

method, followed by
any bytes that otherwise would have been the next input data as of
the time of the call to

reset

.

If the method

markSupported

returns

false

, then:

- The call to

reset

may throw an

IOException

.

If an

IOException

is not thrown, then the stream
is reset to a fixed state that depends on the particular type of the
input stream and how it was created. The bytes that will be supplied
to subsequent callers of the

read

method depend on the
particular type of the input stream.

The method

reset

for class

InputStream

does nothing except throw an

IOException

.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if this stream has not been marked or if the
mark has been invalidated.

**See Also:**
- mark(int)

,

IOException

---

#### public boolean markSupported()

Tests if this input stream supports the

mark

and

reset

methods. Whether or not

mark

and

reset

are supported is an invariant property of a
particular input stream instance. The

markSupported

method
of

InputStream

returns

false

.

**Returns:**
- true

if this stream instance supports the mark
and reset methods;

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- mark(int)

,

reset()

---

#### public long transferTo​(
OutputStream
out)
throws
IOException

Reads all bytes from this input stream and writes the bytes to the
given output stream in the order that they are read. On return, this
input stream will be at end of stream. This method does not close either
stream.

This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream, or
writing to the output stream. The behavior for the case where the input
and/or output stream is

asynchronously closed

, or the thread
interrupted during the transfer, is highly input and output stream
specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to the
output stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or
written. Consequently the input stream may not be at end of stream and
one, or both, streams may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly
recommended that both streams be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.

**Parameters:**
- out

- the output stream, non-null

**Returns:**
- the number of bytes transferred

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
- NullPointerException

- if

out

is

null

**Since:**
- 9

```java
public InputStream()
```

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- nullInputStream

```java
public static
InputStream
nullInputStream()
```

Returns a new

InputStream

that reads no bytes. The returned
stream is initially open. The stream is closed by calling the

close()

method. Subsequent calls to

close()

have no
effect.

While the stream is open, the

available()

,

read()

,

read(byte[])

,

read(byte[], int, int)

,

readAllBytes()

,

readNBytes(byte[], int, int)

,

readNBytes(int)

,

skip(long)

, and

transferTo()

methods all behave as if end of stream has been
reached. After the stream has been closed, these methods all throw

IOException

.

The

markSupported()

method returns

false

. The

mark()

method does nothing, and the

reset()

method
throws

IOException

.

**Returns:** an

InputStream

which contains no bytes
**Since:** 11

- read

```java
public abstract int read()
throws
IOException
```

Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is
returned as an

int

in the range

0

to

255

. If no byte is available because the end of the stream
has been reached, the value

-1

is returned. This method
blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected,
or an exception is thrown.

A subclass must provide an implementation of this method.

**Returns:** the next byte of data, or

-1

if the end of the
stream is reached.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- read

```java
public int read​(byte[] b)
throws
IOException
```

Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into
the buffer array

b

. The number of bytes actually read is
returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is
available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.

If the length of

b

is zero, then no bytes are read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at the
end of the file, the value

-1

is returned; otherwise, at
least one byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[0]

, the
next one into

b[1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read is,
at most, equal to the length of

b

. Let

unaffected.

The

read(b)

method for class

InputStream

has the same effect as:

```java
read(b, 0, b.length)
```

**Parameters:** b

- the buffer into which the data is read.
**Returns:** the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end of
the stream has been reached.
**Throws:** IOException

- If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than the end of the file, if the input stream has been closed, or
if some other I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

b

is

null

.
**See Also:** read(byte[], int, int)

- read

```java
public int read​(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException
```

Reads up to

len

bytes of data from the input stream into
an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as

len

bytes, but a smaller number may be read.
The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.

This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is
detected, or an exception is thrown.

If

len

is zero, then no bytes are read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of
file, the value

-1

is returned; otherwise, at least one
byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[off]

, the
next one into

b[off+1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read
is, at most, equal to

len

. Let

k

be the number of
bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements

b[off]

through

b[off+

k

-1]

,
leaving elements

b[off+

k

]

through

b[off+len-1]

unaffected.

In every case, elements

b[0]

through

b[off]

and elements

b[off+len]

through

b[b.length-1]

are unaffected.

The

read(b,

off,

len)

method
for class

InputStream

simply calls the method

read()

repeatedly. If the first such call results in an

IOException

, that exception is returned from the call to
the

read(b,

off,

len)

method. If
any subsequent call to

read()

results in a

IOException

, the exception is caught and treated as if it
were end of file; the bytes read up to that point are stored into

b

and the number of bytes read before the exception
occurred is returned. The default implementation of this method blocks
until the requested amount of input data

len

has been read,
end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. Subclasses are
encouraged to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.

**Parameters:** b

- the buffer into which the data is read.
**Parameters:** off

- the start offset in array

b

at which the data is written.
**Parameters:** len

- the maximum number of bytes to read.
**Returns:** the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end of
the stream has been reached.
**Throws:** IOException

- If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than end of file, or if the input stream has been closed, or if
some other I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

b

is

null

.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If

off

is negative,

len

is negative, or

len

is greater than

b.length - off
**See Also:** read()

- readAllBytes

```java
public byte[] readAllBytes()
throws
IOException
```

Reads all remaining bytes from the input stream. This method blocks until
all remaining bytes have been read and end of stream is detected, or an
exception is thrown. This method does not close the input stream.

When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
method will return an empty byte array.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read all bytes into a byte array. It is not intended for
reading input streams with large amounts of data.

The behavior for the case where the input stream is

asynchronously
closed

, or the thread interrupted during the read, is highly input
stream specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream, then it may do
so after some, but not all, bytes have been read. Consequently the input
stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
It is strongly recommended that the stream be promptly closed if an I/O
error occurs.

**Implementation Requirements:** This method invokes

readNBytes(int)

with a length of

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.
**Returns:** a byte array containing the bytes read from this input stream
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** OutOfMemoryError

- if an array of the required size cannot be
allocated.
**Since:** 9

- readNBytes

```java
public byte[] readNBytes​(int len)
throws
IOException
```

Reads up to a specified number of bytes from the input stream. This
method blocks until the requested number of bytes have been read, end
of stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. This method does not
close the input stream.

The length of the returned array equals the number of bytes read
from the stream. If

len

is zero, then no bytes are read and
an empty byte array is returned. Otherwise, up to

len

bytes
are read from the stream. Fewer than

len

bytes may be read if
end of stream is encountered.

When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
method will return an empty byte array.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read the specified number of bytes into a byte array. The
total amount of memory allocated by this method is proportional to the
number of bytes read from the stream which is bounded by

len

.
Therefore, the method may be safely called with very large values of

len

provided sufficient memory is available.

The behavior for the case where the input stream is

asynchronously
closed

, or the thread interrupted during the read, is highly input
stream specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream, then it may do
so after some, but not all, bytes have been read. Consequently the input
stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
It is strongly recommended that the stream be promptly closed if an I/O
error occurs.

**Implementation Note:** The number of bytes allocated to read data from this stream and return
the result is bounded by

2*(long)len

, inclusive.
**Parameters:** len

- the maximum number of bytes to read
**Returns:** a byte array containing the bytes read from this input stream
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

length

is negative
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** OutOfMemoryError

- if an array of the required size cannot be
allocated.

- readNBytes

```java
public int readNBytes​(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException
```

Reads the requested number of bytes from the input stream into the given
byte array. This method blocks until

len

bytes of input data have
been read, end of stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. The
number of bytes actually read, possibly zero, is returned. This method
does not close the input stream.

In the case where end of stream is reached before

len

bytes
have been read, then the actual number of bytes read will be returned.
When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
method will return zero.

If

len

is zero, then no bytes are read and

0

is
returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read up to

len

bytes.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[off]

, the next
one in to

b[off+1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read is, at
most, equal to

len

. Let

k

be the number of bytes actually
read; these bytes will be stored in elements

b[off]

through

b[off+

k

-1]

, leaving elements

b[off+

k

]

through

b[off+len-1]

unaffected.

The behavior for the case where the input stream is

asynchronously
closed

, or the thread interrupted during the read, is highly input
stream specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream, then it may do
so after some, but not all, bytes of

b

have been updated with
data from the input stream. Consequently the input stream and

b

may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly recommended that the
stream be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.

**Parameters:** b

- the byte array into which the data is read
**Parameters:** off

- the start offset in

b

at which the data is written
**Parameters:** len

- the maximum number of bytes to read
**Returns:** the actual number of bytes read into the buffer
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

b

is

null
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

off

is negative,

len

is negative, or

len

is greater than

b.length - off
**Since:** 9

- skip

```java
public long skip​(long n)
throws
IOException
```

Skips over and discards

n

bytes of data from this input
stream. The

skip

method may, for a variety of reasons, end
up skipping over some smaller number of bytes, possibly

0

.
This may result from any of a number of conditions; reaching end of file
before

n

bytes have been skipped is only one possibility.
The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. If

n

is
negative, the

skip

method for class

InputStream

always
returns 0, and no bytes are skipped. Subclasses may handle the negative
value differently.

The

skip

method implementation of this class creates a
byte array and then repeatedly reads into it until

n

bytes
have been read or the end of the stream has been reached. Subclasses are
encouraged to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
For instance, the implementation may depend on the ability to seek.

**Parameters:** n

- the number of bytes to be skipped.
**Returns:** the actual number of bytes skipped.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- available

```java
public int available()
throws
IOException
```

Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped
over) from this input stream without blocking, which may be 0, or 0 when
end of stream is detected. The read might be on the same thread or
another thread. A single read or skip of this many bytes will not block,
but may read or skip fewer bytes.

Note that while some implementations of

InputStream

will
return the total number of bytes in the stream, many will not. It is
never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate
a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream.

A subclass's implementation of this method may choose to throw an

IOException

if this input stream has been closed by invoking the

close()

method.

The

available

method of

InputStream

always returns

0

.

This method should be overridden by subclasses.

**Returns:** an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or
skipped over) from this input stream without blocking or

0

when it reaches the end of the input stream.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- close

```java
public void close()
throws
IOException
```

Closes this input stream and releases any system resources associated
with the stream.

The

close

method of

InputStream

does
nothing.

**Specified by:** close

in interface

AutoCloseable
**Specified by:** close

in interface

Closeable
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- mark

```java
public void mark​(int readlimit)
```

Marks the current position in this input stream. A subsequent call to
the

reset

method repositions this stream at the last marked
position so that subsequent reads re-read the same bytes.

The

readlimit

arguments tells this input stream to
allow that many bytes to be read before the mark position gets
invalidated.

The general contract of

mark

is that, if the method

markSupported

returns

true

, the stream somehow
remembers all the bytes read after the call to

mark

and
stands ready to supply those same bytes again if and whenever the method

reset

is called. However, the stream is not required to
remember any data at all if more than

readlimit

bytes are
read from the stream before

reset

is called.

Marking a closed stream should not have any effect on the stream.

The

mark

method of

InputStream

does
nothing.

**Parameters:** readlimit

- the maximum limit of bytes that can be read before
the mark position becomes invalid.
**See Also:** reset()

- reset

```java
public void reset()
throws
IOException
```

Repositions this stream to the position at the time the

mark

method was last called on this input stream.

The general contract of

reset

is:

- If the method

markSupported

returns

true

, then:

- If the method

mark

has not been called since
the stream was created, or the number of bytes read from the stream
since

mark

was last called is larger than the argument
to

mark

at that last call, then an

IOException

might be thrown.

If such an

IOException

is not thrown, then the
stream is reset to a state such that all the bytes read since the
most recent call to

mark

(or since the start of the
file, if

mark

has not been called) will be resupplied
to subsequent callers of the

read

method, followed by
any bytes that otherwise would have been the next input data as of
the time of the call to

reset

.

If the method

markSupported

returns

false

, then:

- The call to

reset

may throw an

IOException

.

If an

IOException

is not thrown, then the stream
is reset to a fixed state that depends on the particular type of the
input stream and how it was created. The bytes that will be supplied
to subsequent callers of the

read

method depend on the
particular type of the input stream.

The method

reset

for class

InputStream

does nothing except throw an

IOException

.

**Throws:** IOException

- if this stream has not been marked or if the
mark has been invalidated.
**See Also:** mark(int)

,

IOException

- markSupported

```java
public boolean markSupported()
```

Tests if this input stream supports the

mark

and

reset

methods. Whether or not

mark

and

reset

are supported is an invariant property of a
particular input stream instance. The

markSupported

method
of

InputStream

returns

false

.

**Returns:** true

if this stream instance supports the mark
and reset methods;

false

otherwise.
**See Also:** mark(int)

,

reset()

- transferTo

```java
public long transferTo​(
OutputStream
out)
throws
IOException
```

Reads all bytes from this input stream and writes the bytes to the
given output stream in the order that they are read. On return, this
input stream will be at end of stream. This method does not close either
stream.

This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream, or
writing to the output stream. The behavior for the case where the input
and/or output stream is

asynchronously closed

, or the thread
interrupted during the transfer, is highly input and output stream
specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to the
output stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or
written. Consequently the input stream may not be at end of stream and
one, or both, streams may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly
recommended that both streams be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.

**Parameters:** out

- the output stream, non-null
**Returns:** the number of bytes transferred
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

out

is

null

methods all behave as if end of stream has been
reached. After the stream has been closed, these methods all throw

IOException

.

The

markSupported()

method returns

false

. The

**Since:** 11

- read

```java
public abstract int read()
throws

```

Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is
returned as an

int

in the range

0

to

255

. If no byte is available because the end of the stream
has been reached, the value

-1

is returned. This method
blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected,
or an exception is thrown.

A subclass must provide an implementation of this method.

**Returns:** the next byte of data, or

-1

if the end of the
stream is reached.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- read

```java
public int read​(byte[] b)
throws
IOException
```

Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into
the buffer array

b

. The number of bytes actually read is
returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is
available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.

If the length of

b

is zero, then no bytes are read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at the
end of the file, the value

-1

is returned; otherwise, at
least one byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[0]

, the
next one into

b[1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read is,
at most, equal to the length of

b

. Let

k

**Throws:** IOException

- If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than the end of the file, if the input stream has been closed, or

Skips over and discards

have been read or the end of the stream has been reached. Subclasses are
encouraged to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
For instance, the implementation may depend on the ability to seek.

**Parameters:** n

- the number of bytes to be skipped.
**Returns:** the actual number of bytes skipped.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- available

```java
public int available()
throws
IOException
```

Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped
over) from this input stream without blocking, which may be 0, or 0 when
end of stream is detected. The read might be on the same thread or
another thread. A single read or skip of this many bytes will not block,
but may read or skip fewer bytes.

Note that while some implementations of

InputStream

will
return the total number of bytes in the stream, many will not. It is
never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate
a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream.

A subclass's implementation of this method may choose to throw an

IOException

if this input stream has been closed by invoking the

close()

method.

The

available

method of

InputStream

always returns

0

.

This method should be overridden by subclasses.

**Returns:** an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or
skipped over) from this input stream without blocking or

0

when it reaches the end of the input stream.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- close

```java
public void close()
throws
IOException
```

Closes this input stream and releases any system resources associated
with the stream.

The

close

method of

InputStream

does
nothing.

**Specified by:** close

in interface

AutoCloseable
**Specified by:** close

in interface

Closeable
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- mark

```java
public void mark​(int readlimit)
```

Marks the current position in this input stream. A subsequent call to
the

reset

method repositions this stream at the last marked
position so that subsequent reads re-read the same bytes.

The

readlimit

arguments tells this input stream to
allow that many bytes to be read before the mark position gets
invalidated.

The general contract of

mark

is that, if the method

markSupported

returns

true

, the stream somehow
remembers all the bytes read after the call to

mark

and
stands ready to supply those same bytes again if and whenever the method

reset

is called. However, the stream is not required to
remember any data at all if more than

readlimit

bytes are
read from the stream before

reset

is called.

Marking a closed stream should not have any effect on the stream.

The

mark

method of

InputStream

does
nothing.

**Parameters:** readlimit

- the maximum limit of bytes that can be read before
the mark position becomes invalid.
**See Also:** reset()

- reset

```java
public void reset()
throws
IOException
```

Repositions this stream to the position at the time the

mark

method was last called on this input stream.

The general contract of

reset

is:

- If the method

markSupported

returns

true

, then:

- If the method

mark

has not been called since
the stream was created, or the number of bytes read from the stream
since

mark

was last called is larger than the argument
to

mark

at that last call, then an

IOException

might be thrown.

If such an

IOException

is not thrown, then the
stream is reset to a state such that all the bytes read since the
most recent call to

mark

(or since the start of the
file, if

mark

has not been called) will be resupplied
to subsequent callers of the

read

method, followed by
any bytes that otherwise would have been the next input data as of
the time of the call to

reset

.

If the method

markSupported

returns

false

, then:

- The call to

reset

may throw an

IOException

.

If an

IOException

is not thrown, then the stream
is reset to a fixed state that depends on the particular type of the
input stream and how it was created. The bytes that will be supplied
to subsequent callers of the

read

method depend on the
particular type of the input stream.

The method

reset

for class

InputStream

does nothing except throw an

IOException

.

**Throws:** IOException

- if this stream has not been marked or if the
mark has been invalidated.
**See Also:** mark(int)

,

IOException

- markSupported

```java
public boolean markSupported()
```

Tests if this input stream supports the

mark

and

reset

methods. Whether or not

mark

and

reset

are supported is an invariant property of a
particular input stream instance. The

markSupported

method
of

InputStream

returns

false

.

**Returns:** true

if this stream instance supports the mark
and reset methods;

false

otherwise.
**See Also:** mark(int)

,

reset()

- transferTo

```java
public long transferTo​(
OutputStream
out)
throws
IOException
```

Reads all bytes from this input stream and writes the bytes to the
given output stream in the order that they are read. On return, this
input stream will be at end of stream. This method does not close either
stream.

This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream, or
writing to the output stream. The behavior for the case where the input
and/or output stream is

asynchronously closed

, or the thread
interrupted during the transfer, is highly input and output stream
specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to the
output stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or
written. Consequently the input stream may not be at end of stream and
one, or both, streams may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly
recommended that both streams be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.

**Parameters:** out

- the output stream, non-null
**Returns:** the number of bytes transferred
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

out

is

null

Reads all remaining bytes from the input stream. This method blocks until

When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
method will return an empty byte array.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read all bytes into a byte array. It is not intended for
reading input streams with large amounts of data.

The behavior for the case where the input stream is

asynchronously
closed

, or the thread interrupted during the read, is highly input
stream specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream, then it may do
so after some, but not all, bytes have been read. Consequently the input
stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
It is strongly recommended that the stream be promptly closed if an I/O
error occurs.

**Implementation Requirements:** This method invokes

readNBytes(int)

with a length of

Integer.MAX_VALUE

**Returns:** a byte array containing the bytes read from this input stream
**Throws:** IOException

readNBytes

```java

```

Reads up to a specified number of bytes from the input stream. This
method blocks until the requested number of bytes have been read, end
of stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. This method does not
close the input stream.

The length of the returned array equals the number of bytes read
from the stream. If

len

is zero, then no bytes are read and
an empty byte array is returned. Otherwise, up to

len

bytes
are read from the stream. Fewer than

len

bytes may be read if
end of stream is encountered.

When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
method will return an empty byte array.

Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
convenient to read the specified number of bytes into a byte array. The
total amount of memory allocated by this method is proportional to the
number of bytes read from the stream which is bounded by

len

.
Therefore, the method may be safely called with very large values of

len

provided sufficient memory is available.

markSupported

```java
public boolean markSupported()

Tests if this input stream supports the

mark

methods. Whether or not

mark

and

reset

are supported is an invariant property of a
particular input stream instance. The

markSupported

method
of

InputStream

returns

false

**Returns:** true

if this stream instance supports the mark
and reset methods;

false

otherwise.

transferTo

```java
public long transferTo​(
OutputStream
out)
throws
IOException
```

Reads all bytes from this input stream and writes the bytes to the
given output stream in the order that they are read. On return, this
input stream will be at end of stream. This method does not close either
stream.

This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream, or
writing to the output stream. The behavior for the case where the input
and/or output stream is

asynchronously closed

, or the thread
interrupted during the transfer, is highly input and output stream
specific, and therefore not specified.

If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to the
output stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or
written. Consequently the input stream may not be at end of stream and
one, or both, streams may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly
recommended that both streams be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.

**Parameters:** out

- the output stream, non-null
**Returns:** the number of bytes transferred
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

out

is

null
**Since:** 9
