# Interface PrintService

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\print\PrintService.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
PrintService
```

Interface

PrintService

is the factory for a

DocPrintJob

. A

PrintService

describes the capabilities of a printer and can be
queried regarding a printer's supported attributes.

Example:

```java
DocFlavor flavor = DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.POSTSCRIPT;
PrintRequestAttributeSet aset = new HashPrintRequestAttributeSet();
aset.add(MediaSizeName.ISO_A4);
PrintService[] pservices =
PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServices(flavor, aset);
if (pservices.length > 0) {
DocPrintJob pj = pservices[0].createPrintJob();
try {
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("test.ps");
Doc doc = new SimpleDoc(fis, flavor, null);
pj.print(doc, aset);
} catch (FileNotFoundException fe) {
} catch (PrintException e) {
}
}
```

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### String
getName()

Returns a string name for this print service which may be used by
applications to request a particular print service. In a suitable
context, such as a name service, this name must be unique. In some
environments this unique name may be the same as the user friendly
printer name defined as the

PrinterName

attribute.

**Returns:**
- name of the service

---

#### DocPrintJob
createPrintJob()

Creates and returns a

PrintJob

capable of handling data from any
of the supported document flavors.

**Returns:**
- a

DocPrintJob

object

---

#### void addPrintServiceAttributeListener​(
PrintServiceAttributeListener
listener)

Registers a listener for events on this

PrintService

.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- a PrintServiceAttributeListener, which monitors the
status of a print service

**See Also:**
- removePrintServiceAttributeListener(javax.print.event.PrintServiceAttributeListener)

---

#### void removePrintServiceAttributeListener​(
PrintServiceAttributeListener
listener)

Removes the print-service listener from this print service. This means
the listener is no longer interested in

PrintService

events.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- a

PrintServiceAttributeListener

object

**See Also:**
- addPrintServiceAttributeListener(javax.print.event.PrintServiceAttributeListener)

---

#### PrintServiceAttributeSet
getAttributes()

Obtains this print service's set of printer description attributes giving
this Print Service's status. The returned attribute set object is
unmodifiable. The returned attribute set object is a "snapshot" of this
Print Service's attribute set at the time of the

getAttributes()

method call: that is, the returned attribute set's contents will

not

be updated if this print service's attribute set's contents
change in the future. To detect changes in attribute values, call

getAttributes()

again and compare the new attribute set to the
previous attribute set; alternatively, register a listener for print
service events.

**Returns:**
- unmodifiable snapshot of this Print Service's attribute set. May
be empty, but not

null

.

---

#### <T extends
PrintServiceAttribute
> T getAttribute​(
Class
<T> category)

Gets the value of the single specified service attribute. This may be
useful to clients which only need the value of one attribute and want to
minimize overhead.

**Parameters:**
- category

- the category of a

PrintServiceAttribute

supported by this service - may not be

null

**Returns:**
- the value of the supported attribute or

null

if the
attribute is not supported by this service

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the category is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

category

is not a

Class

that implements interface

PrintServiceAttribute

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the type of the specified service attribute

---

#### DocFlavor
[] getSupportedDocFlavors()

Determines the print data formats a client can specify when setting up a
job for this

PrintService

. A print data format is designated by a
"doc flavor" (class

DocFlavor

) consisting of a MIME
type plus a print data representation class.

Note that some doc flavors may not be supported in combination with all
attributes. Use

getUnsupportedAttributes(..)

to validate specific
combinations.

**Returns:**
- array of supported doc flavors, should have at least one element

---

#### boolean isDocFlavorSupported​(
DocFlavor
flavor)

Determines if this print service supports a specific

DocFlavor

.
This is a convenience method to determine if the

DocFlavor

would
be a member of the result of

getSupportedDocFlavors()

.

Note that some doc flavors may not be supported in combination with all
attributes. Use

getUnsupportedAttributes(..)

to validate specific
combinations.

**Parameters:**
- flavor

- the

DocFlavor

to query for support

**Returns:**
- true

if this print service supports the specified

DocFlavor

;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

flavor

is

null

---

#### Class
<?>[] getSupportedAttributeCategories()

Determines the printing attribute categories a client can specify when
setting up a job for this print service. A printing attribute category is
designated by a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

. This method returns just the attribute

categories

that are supported; it does not return the particular
attribute

values

that are supported.

This method returns all the printing attribute categories this print
service supports for any possible job. Some categories may not be
supported in a particular context (ie for a particular

DocFlavor

). Use one of the methods that include a

DocFlavor

to validate the request before submitting it, such as

getSupportedAttributeValues(..)

.

**Returns:**
- array of printing attribute categories that the client can
specify as a doc-level or job-level attribute in a Print Request.
Each element in the array is a

Class

that
implements interface

Attribute

. The array is
empty if no categories are supported.

---

#### boolean isAttributeCategorySupported​(
Class
<? extends
Attribute
> category)

Determines whether a client can specify the given printing attribute
category when setting up a job for this print service. A printing
attribute category is designated by a

Class

that implements
interface

Attribute

. This method
tells whether the attribute

category

is supported; it does not
tell whether a particular attribute

value

is supported.

Some categories may not be supported in a particular context (ie for a
particular

DocFlavor

). Use one of the methods which include a

DocFlavor

to validate the request before submitting it, such as

getSupportedAttributeValues(..)

.

This is a convenience method to determine if the category would be a
member of the result of

getSupportedAttributeCategories()

.

**Parameters:**
- category

- printing attribute category to test. It must be a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

.

**Returns:**
- true

if this print service supports specifying a
doc-level or job-level attribute in

category

in a Print
Request;

false

if it doesn't

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

category

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

category

is not a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

---

#### Object
getDefaultAttributeValue​(
Class
<? extends
Attribute
> category)

Determines this print service's default printing attribute value in the
given category. A printing attribute value is an instance of a class that
implements interface

Attribute

. If a client sets up a
print job and does not specify any attribute value in the given category,
this Print Service will use the default attribute value instead.

Some attributes may not be supported in a particular context (ie for a
particular

DocFlavor

). Use one of the methods that include a

DocFlavor

to validate the request before submitting it, such as

getSupportedAttributeValues(..)

.

Not all attributes have a default value. For example the service will not
have a default value for

RequestingUser

i.e. a

null

return for a supported category means there is no service default value
for that category. Use the

isAttributeCategorySupported(Class)

method to distinguish these cases.

**Parameters:**
- category

- printing attribute category for which the default
attribute value is requested. It must be a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

.

**Returns:**
- default attribute value for

category

, or

null

if
this Print Service does not support specifying a doc-level or
job-level attribute in

category

in a Print Request, or
the service does not have a default value for this attribute

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

category

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

category

is not a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

---

#### Object
getSupportedAttributeValues​(
Class
<? extends
Attribute
> category,

DocFlavor
flavor,

AttributeSet
attributes)

Determines the printing attribute values a client can specify in the
given category when setting up a job for this print service. A printing
attribute value is an instance of a class that implements interface

Attribute

.

If

flavor

is

null

and

attributes

is

null

or is an empty set, this method returns all the printing attribute values
this Print Service supports for any possible job. If

flavor

is not

null

or

attributes

is not an empty set, this method
returns just the printing attribute values that are compatible with the
given doc flavor and/or set of attributes. That is, a

null

return
value may indicate that specifying this attribute is incompatible with
the specified DocFlavor. Also if

DocFlavor

is not

null

it
must be a flavor supported by this

PrintService

, else

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

If the

attributes

parameter contains an

Attribute

whose
category is the same as the

category

parameter, the service must
ignore this attribute in the

AttributeSet

.

DocAttribute

s which are to be specified on the

Doc

must
be included in this set to accurately represent the context.

This method returns an

Object

because different printing
attribute categories indicate the supported attribute values in different
ways. The documentation for each printing attribute in package

javax.print.attribute.standard

describes how each attribute indicates its supported values. Possible
ways of indicating support include:

- Return a single instance of the attribute category to indicate that
any value is legal -- used, for example, by an attribute whose value is
an arbitrary text string. (The value of the returned attribute object
is irrelevant.)

Return an array of one or more instances of the attribute category,
containing the legal values -- used, for example, by an attribute with
a list of enumerated values. The type of the array is an array of the
specified attribute category type as returned by its

getCategory(Class)

.

Return a single object (of some class other than the attribute
category) that indicates bounds on the legal values -- used, for
example, by an integer-valued attribute that must lie within a certain
range.

**Parameters:**
- category

- printing attribute category to test. It must be a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

.
- flavor

- doc flavor for a supposed job, or

null
- attributes

- set of printing attributes for a supposed job (both
job-level attributes and document-level attributes), or

null

**Returns:**
- object indicating supported values for

category

, or

null

if this Print Service does not support specifying a
doc-level or job-level attribute in

category

in a Print
Request

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

category

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

category

is not a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

, or

DocFlavor

is not
supported by this service

---

#### boolean isAttributeValueSupported​(
Attribute
attrval,

DocFlavor
flavor,

AttributeSet
attributes)

Determines whether a client can specify the given printing attribute
value when setting up a job for this Print Service. A printing attribute
value is an instance of a class that implements interface

Attribute

.

If

flavor

is

null

and

attributes

is

null

or is an empty set, this method tells whether this Print Service supports
the given printing attribute value for some possible combination of doc
flavor and set of attributes. If

flavor

is not

null

or

attributes

is not an empty set, this method tells whether this
Print Service supports the given printing attribute value in combination
with the given doc flavor and/or set of attributes.

Also if

DocFlavor

is not

null

it must be a flavor
supported by this

PrintService

, else

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

DocAttribute

s which are to be specified on the

Doc

must
be included in this set to accurately represent the context.

This is a convenience method to determine if the value would be a member
of the result of

getSupportedAttributeValues(...)

.

**Parameters:**
- attrval

- printing attribute value to test
- flavor

- doc flavor for a supposed job, or

null
- attributes

- set of printing attributes for a supposed job (both
job-level attributes and document-level attributes), or

null

**Returns:**
- true

if this Print Service supports specifying

attrval

as a doc-level or job-level attribute in a Print
Request,

false

if it doesn't

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

attrval

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if flavor is not supported by this

PrintService

---

#### AttributeSet
getUnsupportedAttributes​(
DocFlavor
flavor,

AttributeSet
attributes)

Identifies the attributes that are unsupported for a print request in the
context of a particular

DocFlavor

. This method is useful for
validating a potential print job and identifying the specific attributes
which cannot be supported. It is important to supply only a supported

DocFlavor

or an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.
If the return value from this method is

null

, all attributes are
supported.

DocAttribute

s which are to be specified on the

Doc

must
be included in this set to accurately represent the context.

If the return value is

non-null

, all attributes in the returned
set are unsupported with this

DocFlavor

. The returned set does
not distinguish attribute categories that are unsupported from
unsupported attribute values.

A supported print request can then be created by removing all unsupported
attributes from the original attribute set, except in the case that the

DocFlavor

is unsupported.

If any attributes are unsupported only because they are in conflict with
other attributes then it is at the discretion of the service to select
the attribute(s) to be identified as the cause of the conflict.

Use

isDocFlavorSupported()

to verify that a

DocFlavor

is
supported before calling this method.

**Parameters:**
- flavor

- doc flavor to test, or

null
- attributes

- set of printing attributes for a supposed job (both
job-level attributes and document-level attributes), or

null

**Returns:**
- null

if this Print Service supports the print request
specification, else the unsupported attributes

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

flavor

is not supported by
this

PrintService

---

#### ServiceUIFactory
getServiceUIFactory()

Returns a factory for UI components which allow users to interact with
the service in various roles. Services which do not provide any UI should
return

null

. Print Services which do provide UI but want to be
supported in an environment with no UI support should ensure that the
factory is not initialised unless the application calls this method to
obtain the factory. See

ServiceUIFactory

for more information.

**Returns:**
- null

or a factory for UI components

---

#### boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Determines if two services are referring to the same underlying service.
Objects encapsulating a print service may not exhibit equality of
reference even though they refer to the same underlying service.

Clients should call this method to determine if two services are
referring to the same underlying service.

Services must implement this method and return

true

only if the
service objects being compared may be used interchangeably by the client.
Services are free to return the same object reference to an underlying
service if that, but clients must not depend on equality of reference.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the reference object with which to compare

**Returns:**
- true

if this service is the same as the obj argument,

false

otherwise

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### int hashCode()

This method should be implemented consistently with

equals(Object)

.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- hash code of this object

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getName

```java
String
getName()
```

Returns a string name for this print service which may be used by
applications to request a particular print service. In a suitable
context, such as a name service, this name must be unique. In some
environments this unique name may be the same as the user friendly
printer name defined as the

PrinterName

attribute.

**Returns:** name of the service

- createPrintJob

```java
DocPrintJob
createPrintJob()
```

Creates and returns a

PrintJob

capable of handling data from any
of the supported document flavors.

**Returns:** a

DocPrintJob

object

- addPrintServiceAttributeListener

```java
void addPrintServiceAttributeListener​(
PrintServiceAttributeListener
listener)
```

Registers a listener for events on this

PrintService

.

**Parameters:** listener

- a PrintServiceAttributeListener, which monitors the
status of a print service
**See Also:** removePrintServiceAttributeListener(javax.print.event.PrintServiceAttributeListener)

- removePrintServiceAttributeListener

```java
void removePrintServiceAttributeListener​(
PrintServiceAttributeListener
listener)
```

Removes the print-service listener from this print service. This means
the listener is no longer interested in

PrintService

events.

**Parameters:** listener

- a

PrintServiceAttributeListener

object
**See Also:** addPrintServiceAttributeListener(javax.print.event.PrintServiceAttributeListener)

- getAttributes

```java
PrintServiceAttributeSet
getAttributes()
```

Obtains this print service's set of printer description attributes giving
this Print Service's status. The returned attribute set object is
unmodifiable. The returned attribute set object is a "snapshot" of this
Print Service's attribute set at the time of the

getAttributes()

method call: that is, the returned attribute set's contents will

not

be updated if this print service's attribute set's contents
change in the future. To detect changes in attribute values, call

getAttributes()

again and compare the new attribute set to the
previous attribute set; alternatively, register a listener for print
service events.

**Returns:** unmodifiable snapshot of this Print Service's attribute set. May
be empty, but not

null

.

- getAttribute

```java
<T extends
PrintServiceAttribute
> T getAttribute​(
Class
<T> category)
```

Gets the value of the single specified service attribute. This may be
useful to clients which only need the value of one attribute and want to
minimize overhead.

**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the specified service attribute
**Parameters:** category

- the category of a

PrintServiceAttribute

supported by this service - may not be

null
**Returns:** the value of the supported attribute or

null

if the
attribute is not supported by this service
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the category is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

category

is not a

Class

that implements interface

PrintServiceAttribute

- getSupportedDocFlavors

```java
DocFlavor
[] getSupportedDocFlavors()
```

Determines the print data formats a client can specify when setting up a
job for this

PrintService

. A print data format is designated by a
"doc flavor" (class

DocFlavor

) consisting of a MIME
type plus a print data representation class.

Note that some doc flavors may not be supported in combination with all
attributes. Use

getUnsupportedAttributes(..)

to validate specific
combinations.

**Returns:** array of supported doc flavors, should have at least one element

- isDocFlavorSupported

```java
boolean isDocFlavorSupported​(
DocFlavor
flavor)
```

Determines if this print service supports a specific

DocFlavor

.
This is a convenience method to determine if the

DocFlavor

would
be a member of the result of

getSupportedDocFlavors()

.

Note that some doc flavors may not be supported in combination with all
attributes. Use

getUnsupportedAttributes(..)

to validate specific
combinations.

**Parameters:** flavor

- the

DocFlavor

to query for support
**Returns:** true

if this print service supports the specified

DocFlavor

;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

flavor

is

null

- getSupportedAttributeCategories

```java
Class
<?>[] getSupportedAttributeCategories()
```

Determines the printing attribute categories a client can specify when
setting up a job for this print service. A printing attribute category is
designated by a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

. This method returns just the attribute

categories

that are supported; it does not return the particular
attribute

values

that are supported.

This method returns all the printing attribute categories this print
service supports for any possible job. Some categories may not be
supported in a particular context (ie for a particular

DocFlavor

). Use one of the methods that include a

DocFlavor

to validate the request before submitting it, such as

getSupportedAttributeValues(..)

.

**Returns:** array of printing attribute categories that the client can
specify as a doc-level or job-level attribute in a Print Request.
Each element in the array is a

Class

that
implements interface

Attribute

. The array is
empty if no categories are supported.

- isAttributeCategorySupported

```java
boolean isAttributeCategorySupported​(
Class
<? extends
Attribute
> category)
```

Determines whether a client can specify the given printing attribute
category when setting up a job for this print service. A printing
attribute category is designated by a

Class

that implements
interface

Attribute

. This method
tells whether the attribute

category

is supported; it does not
tell whether a particular attribute

value

is supported.

Some categories may not be supported in a particular context (ie for a
particular

DocFlavor

). Use one of the methods which include a

DocFlavor

to validate the request before submitting it, such as

getSupportedAttributeValues(..)

.

This is a convenience method to determine if the category would be a
member of the result of

getSupportedAttributeCategories()

.

**Parameters:** category

- printing attribute category to test. It must be a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

.
**Returns:** true

if this print service supports specifying a
doc-level or job-level attribute in

category

in a Print
Request;

false

if it doesn't
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

category

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

category

is not a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

- getDefaultAttributeValue

```java
Object
getDefaultAttributeValue​(
Class
<? extends
Attribute
> category)
```

Determines this print service's default printing attribute value in the
given category. A printing attribute value is an instance of a class that
implements interface

Attribute

. If a client sets up a
print job and does not specify any attribute value in the given category,
this Print Service will use the default attribute value instead.

Some attributes may not be supported in a particular context (ie for a
particular

DocFlavor

). Use one of the methods that include a

DocFlavor

to validate the request before submitting it, such as

getSupportedAttributeValues(..)

.

Not all attributes have a default value. For example the service will not
have a default value for

RequestingUser

i.e. a

null

return for a supported category means there is no service default value
for that category. Use the

isAttributeCategorySupported(Class)

method to distinguish these cases.

**Parameters:** category

- printing attribute category for which the default
attribute value is requested. It must be a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

.
**Returns:** default attribute value for

category

, or

null

if
this Print Service does not support specifying a doc-level or
job-level attribute in

category

in a Print Request, or
the service does not have a default value for this attribute
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

category

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

category

is not a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

- getSupportedAttributeValues

```java
Object
getSupportedAttributeValues​(
Class
<? extends
Attribute
> category,

DocFlavor
flavor,

AttributeSet
attributes)
```

Determines the printing attribute values a client can specify in the
given category when setting up a job for this print service. A printing
attribute value is an instance of a class that implements interface

Attribute

.

If

flavor

is

null

and

attributes

is

null

or is an empty set, this method returns all the printing attribute values
this Print Service supports for any possible job. If

flavor

is not

null

or

attributes

is not an empty set, this method
returns just the printing attribute values that are compatible with the
given doc flavor and/or set of attributes. That is, a

null

return
value may indicate that specifying this attribute is incompatible with
the specified DocFlavor. Also if

DocFlavor

is not

null

it
must be a flavor supported by this

PrintService

, else

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

If the

attributes

parameter contains an

Attribute

whose
category is the same as the

category

parameter, the service must
ignore this attribute in the

AttributeSet

.

DocAttribute

s which are to be specified on the

Doc

must
be included in this set to accurately represent the context.

This method returns an

Object

because different printing
attribute categories indicate the supported attribute values in different
ways. The documentation for each printing attribute in package

javax.print.attribute.standard

describes how each attribute indicates its supported values. Possible
ways of indicating support include:

- Return a single instance of the attribute category to indicate that
any value is legal -- used, for example, by an attribute whose value is
an arbitrary text string. (The value of the returned attribute object
is irrelevant.)

Return an array of one or more instances of the attribute category,
containing the legal values -- used, for example, by an attribute with
a list of enumerated values. The type of the array is an array of the
specified attribute category type as returned by its

getCategory(Class)

.

Return a single object (of some class other than the attribute
category) that indicates bounds on the legal values -- used, for
example, by an integer-valued attribute that must lie within a certain
range.

**Parameters:** category

- printing attribute category to test. It must be a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

.
**Parameters:** flavor

- doc flavor for a supposed job, or

null
**Parameters:** attributes

- set of printing attributes for a supposed job (both
job-level attributes and document-level attributes), or

null
**Returns:** object indicating supported values for

category

, or

null

if this Print Service does not support specifying a
doc-level or job-level attribute in

category

in a Print
Request
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

category

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

category

is not a

Class

that implements interface

Attribute

, or

DocFlavor

is not
supported by this service

- isAttributeValueSupported

```java
boolean isAttributeValueSupported​(
Attribute
attrval,

DocFlavor
flavor,

AttributeSet
attributes)
```

Determines whether a client can specify the given printing attribute
value when setting up a job for this Print Service. A printing attribute
value is an instance of a class that implements interface

Attribute

.

If

flavor

is

null

and

attributes

is

null

or is an empty set, this method tells whether this Print Service supports
the given printing attribute value for some possible combination of doc
flavor and set of attributes. If

flavor

is not

null

or

attributes

is not an empty set, this method tells whether this
Print Service supports the given printing attribute value in combination
with the given doc flavor and/or set of attributes.

Also if

DocFlavor

is not

null

it must be a flavor
supported by this

PrintService

, else

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

DocAttribute

s which are to be specified on the

Doc

must
be included in this set to accurately represent the context.

This is a convenience method to determine if the value would be a member
of the result of

getSupportedAttributeValues(...)

.

**Parameters:** attrval

- printing attribute value to test
**Parameters:** flavor

- doc flavor for a supposed job, or

null
**Parameters:** attributes

- set of printing attributes for a supposed job (both
job-level attributes and document-level attributes), or

null
**Returns:** true

if this Print Service supports specifying

attrval

as a doc-level or job-level attribute in a Print
Request,

false

if it doesn't
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

attrval

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if flavor is not supported by this

PrintService

- getUnsupportedAttributes

```java
AttributeSet
getUnsupportedAttributes​(
DocFlavor
flavor,

AttributeSet
attributes)
```

Identifies the attributes that are unsupported for a print request in the
context of a particular

DocFlavor

. This method is useful for
validating a potential print job and identifying the specific attributes
which cannot be supported. It is important to supply only a supported

DocFlavor

or an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.
If the return value from this method is

null

, all attributes are
supported.

DocAttribute

s which are to be specified on the

Doc

must
be included in this set to accurately represent the context.

If the return value is

non-null

, all attributes in the returned
set are unsupported with this

DocFlavor

. The returned set does
not distinguish attribute categories that are unsupported from
unsupported attribute values.

A supported print request can then be created by removing all unsupported
attributes from the original attribute set, except in the case that the

DocFlavor

is unsupported.

If any attributes are unsupported only because they are in conflict with
other attributes then it is at the discretion of the service to select
the attribute(s) to be identified as the cause of the conflict.

Use

isDocFlavorSupported()

to verify that a

DocFlavor

is
supported before calling this method.

**Parameters:** flavor

- doc flavor to test, or

null
**Parameters:** attributes

- set of printing attributes for a supposed job (both
job-level attributes and document-level attributes), or

null
**Returns:** null

if this Print Service supports the print request
specification, else the unsupported attributes
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

flavor

is not supported by
this

PrintService

- getServiceUIFactory

```java
ServiceUIFactory
getServiceUIFactory()
```

Returns a factory for UI components which allow users to interact with
the service in various roles. Services which do not provide any UI should
return

null

. Print Services which do provide UI but want to be
supported in an environment with no UI support should ensure that the
factory is not initialised unless the application calls this method to
obtain the factory. See

ServiceUIFactory

for more information.

**Returns:** null

or a factory for UI components

- equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Determines if two services are referring to the same underlying service.
Objects encapsulating a print service may not exhibit equality of
reference even though they refer to the same underlying service.

Clients should call this method to determine if two services are
referring to the same underlying service.

Services must implement this method and return

true

only if the
service objects being compared may be used interchangeably by the client.
Services are free to return the same object reference to an underlying
service if that, but clients must not depend on equality of reference.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the reference object with which to compare
**Returns:** true

if this service is the same as the obj argument,

false

otherwise
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

Method Detail

- getName

```java
String
getName()
```

Returns a string name for this print service which may be used by
applications to request a particular print service. In a suitable
context, such as a name service, this name must be unique. In some
environments this unique name may be the same as the user friendly
printer name defined as the

PrinterName

attribute.

**Returns:** name of the service

void addPrintServiceAttributeListener​(
PrintServiceAttributeListener
listener)
```

Registers a listener for events on this

PrintService

.

**Parameters:** listener

- a PrintServiceAttributeListener, which monitors the
status of a print service
**See Also:** removePrintServiceAttributeListener(javax.print.event.PrintServiceAttributeListener)

- removePrintServiceAttributeListener

```java
void removePrintServiceAttributeListener​(
PrintServiceAttributeListener
listener)
```

Removes the print-service listener from this print service. This means
the listener is no longer interested in

PrintService

events.

**Parameters:** listener

- getAttributes

```java
PrintServiceAttributeSet
getAttributes()
```

Obtains this print service's set of printer description attributes giving
this Print Service's status. The returned attribute set object is
unmodifiable. The returned attribute set object is a "snapshot" of this
Print Service's attribute set at the time of the

getAttributes()

method call: that is, the returned attribute set's contents will

not

be updated if this print service's attribute set's contents
change in the future. To detect changes in attribute values, call

getAttributes()

again and compare the new attribute set to the
previous attribute set; alternatively, register a listener for print
service events.

**Returns:** unmodifiable snapshot of this Print Service's attribute set. May
be empty, but not

null

.

- getAttribute

```java
<T extends
PrintServiceAttribute
> T getAttribute​(

getAttributes

```java
PrintServiceAttributeSet
getAttributes()
```

Obtains this print service's set of printer description attributes giving
this Print Service's status. The returned attribute set object is
unmodifiable. The returned attribute set object is a "snapshot" of this
Print Service's attribute set at the time of the

getAttributes()

method call: that is, the returned attribute set's contents will

not

be updated if this print service's attribute set's contents
change in the future. To detect changes in attribute values, call

getAttributes()

again and compare the new attribute set to the
previous attribute set; alternatively, register a listener for print
service events.

**Returns:** unmodifiable snapshot of this Print Service's attribute set. May
be empty, but not

```

Determines this print service's default printing attribute value in the
given category. A printing attribute value is an instance of a class that
implements interface

Attribute

. If a client sets up a
print job and does not specify any attribute value in the given category,
this Print Service will use the default attribute value instead.

Some attributes may not be supported in a particular context (ie for a
particular

DocFlavor

). Use one of the methods that include a

DocFlavor

to validate the request before submitting it, such as

getSupportedAttributeValues(..)

.

Not all attributes have a default value. For example the service will not
have a default value for

RequestingUser

i.e. a

null

return for a supported category means there is no service default value
for that category. Use the

isAttributeCategorySupported(Class)

method to distinguish these cases.

**Parameters:** category

- printing attribute category for which the default
attribute value is requested. It must be a

Class

that implements interface

This method returns an

Object

because different printing
attribute categories indicate the supported attribute values in different
ways. The documentation for each printing attribute in package

javax.print.attribute.standard

describes how each attribute indicates its supported values. Possible
ways of indicating support include:

- Return a single instance of the attribute category to indicate that
any value is legal -- used, for example, by an attribute whose value is
an arbitrary text string. (The value of the returned attribute object
is irrelevant.)

Return an array of one or more instances of the attribute category,
containing the legal values -- used, for example, by an attribute with
a list of enumerated values. The type of the array is an array of the
specified attribute category type as returned by its

getCategory(Class)

.

Return a single object (of some class other than the attribute
category) that indicates bounds on the legal values -- used, for
example, by an integer-valued attribute that must lie within a certain
range.

**Parameters:** category

- printing attribute category to test. It must be a

not distinguish attribute categories that are unsupported from
unsupported attribute values.

A supported print request can then be created by removing all unsupported
attributes from the original attribute set, except in the case that the

If any attributes are unsupported only because they are in conflict with
other attributes then it is at the discretion of the service to select
the attribute(s) to be identified as the cause of the conflict.

getServiceUIFactory

```java
ServiceUIFactory
getServiceUIFactory()
```

Returns a factory for UI components which allow users to interact with
the service in various roles. Services which do not provide any UI should
return

null

. Print Services which do provide UI but want to be
supported in an environment with no UI support should ensure that the
factory is not initialised unless the application calls this method to
obtain the factory. See

ServiceUIFactory

for more information.

**Returns:** null

or a factory for UI components

equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Determines if two services are referring to the same underlying service.
Objects encapsulating a print service may not exhibit equality of
reference even though they refer to the same underlying service.

Clients should call this method to determine if two services are
referring to the same underlying service.

Services must implement this method and return

true

only if the
service objects being compared may be used interchangeably by the client.
Services are free to return the same object reference to an underlying
service if that, but clients must not depend on equality of reference.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the reference object with which to compare
**Returns:** true

if this service is the same as the obj argument,

false

otherwise
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()
