# Class SctpChannel

**Source:** `jdk.sctp\com\sun\nio\sctp\SctpChannel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
SctpChannel

extends
AbstractSelectableChannel
```

A selectable channel for message-oriented connected SCTP sockets.

An SCTP channel can only control one SCTP association.
An

SCTPChannel

is created by invoking one of the

open

methods of this class. A newly-created channel is open but
not yet connected, that is, there is no association setup with a remote peer.
An attempt to invoke an I/O operation upon an unconnected
channel will cause a

NotYetConnectedException

to be
thrown. An association can be setup by connecting the channel using one of
its

connect

methods. Once connected, the channel remains
connected until it is closed. Whether or not a channel is connected may be
determined by invoking

getRemoteAddresses

.

SCTP channels support

non-blocking connection:

A
channel may be created and the process of establishing the link to
the remote socket may be initiated via the

connect

method
for later completion by the

finishConnect

method.
Whether or not a connection operation is in progress may be determined by
invoking the

isConnectionPending

method.

Socket options are configured using the

setOption

method. An SCTP
channel support the following options:

Socket options

Option Name

Description

SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS

Enables or disables message fragmentation

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

Enables or disables explicit message completion

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

Controls how the presentation of messages occur for the message
receiver

SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS

The maximum number of streams requested by the local endpoint during
association initialization

SCTP_NODELAY

Enables or disable a Nagle-like algorithm

SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR

Requests that the local SCTP stack use the given peer address as the
association primary

SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR

Requests that the peer mark the enclosed address as the association
primary

SO_SNDBUF

The size of the socket send buffer

SO_RCVBUF

The size of the socket receive buffer

SO_LINGER

Linger on close if data is present (when configured in blocking mode
only)

Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported. The list
of options supported is obtained by invoking the

supportedOptions

method.

SCTP channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one thread may be
reading and at most one thread may be writing at any given time. The

connect

and

finishConnect

methods are mutually synchronized against each other, and
an attempt to initiate a send or receive operation while an invocation of one
of these methods is in progress will block until that invocation is complete.

while the connect operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
- UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote peer
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If the SCTP protocol is not supported
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
Association
association()
throws
IOException

Returns the association on this channel's socket.

**Returns:**
- the association, or

null

if the channel's socket is not
connected.

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If the channel is closed
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local)
throws
IOException

Binds the channel's socket to a local address.

This method is used to establish a relationship between the socket
and the local addresses. Once a relationship is established then
the socket remains bound until the channel is closed. This relationship
may not necesssarily be with the address

local

as it may be removed
by

unbindAddress

, but there will always be at least
one local address bound to the channel's socket once an invocation of
this method successfully completes.

Once the channel's socket has been successfully bound to a specific
address, that is not automatically assigned, more addresses
may be bound to it using

bindAddress

, or removed
using

unbindAddress

.

**Parameters:**
- local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on this channel
- AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
- UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method denies
the operation

---

#### public abstract
SctpChannel
bindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException

Adds the given address to the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown. The

bind

method takes a

SocketAddress

as its argument which typically
contains a port number as well as an address. Addresses subquently bound
using this method are simply addresses as the SCTP port number remains
the same for the lifetime of the channel.

Adding addresses to a connected association is optional functionality.
If the endpoint supports dynamic address reconfiguration then it may
send the appropriate message to the peer to change the peers address
lists.

**Parameters:**
- address

- The address to add to the bound addresses for the socket

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
- NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
- AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound to the given address
- IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpChannel
unbindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException

Removes the given address from the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown. If this method is invoked on a channel that does not have

address

as one of its bound addresses or that has only one
local address bound to it, then this method throws

IllegalUnbindException

.
The initial address that the channel's socket is bound to using

bind

may be removed from the bound addresses for the channel's socket.

Removing addresses from a connected association is optional
functionality. If the endpoint supports dynamic address reconfiguration
then it may send the appropriate message to the peer to change the peers
address lists.

**Parameters:**
- address

- The address to remove from the bound addresses for the socket

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
- NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
- IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
- IllegalUnbindException

- If

address

is not bound to the channel's socket. or
the channel has only one address bound to it
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract boolean connect​(
SocketAddress
remote)
throws
IOException

Connects this channel's socket.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode then an invocation of this
method initiates a non-blocking connection operation. If the connection
is established immediately, as can happen with a local connection, then
this method returns

true

. Otherwise this method returns

false

and the connection operation must later be completed by
invoking the

finishConnect

method.

If this channel is in blocking mode then an invocation of this
method will block until the connection is established or an I/O error
occurs.

If a security manager has been installed then this method verifies
that its

checkConnect

method permits connecting to the address and port number of the given
remote peer.

This method may be invoked at any time. If a

send

or

receive

operation upon this channel is invoked while an
invocation of this method is in progress then that operation will first
block until this invocation is complete. If a connection attempt is
initiated but fails, that is, if an invocation of this method throws a
checked exception, then the channel will be closed.

**Parameters:**
- remote

- The remote peer to which this channel is to be connected

**Returns:**
- true

if a connection was established,

false

if
this channel is in non-blocking mode and the connection
operation is in progress

**Throws:**
- AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
- ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the connect operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
- UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote peer
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract boolean connect​(
SocketAddress
remote,
int maxOutStreams,
int maxInStreams)
throws
IOException

Connects this channel's socket.

This is a convience method and is equivalent to evaluating the
following expression:

```java
setOption(SctpStandardSocketOptions.SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS, SctpStandardSocketOption.InitMaxStreams.create(maxInStreams, maxOutStreams))
.connect(remote);
```

The

maxOutStreams

and

maxInStreams

parameters
represent the maximum number of streams that the application wishes to be
able to send to and receive from. They are negotiated with the remote
peer and may be limited by the operating system.

**Parameters:**
- remote

- The remote peer to which this channel is to be connected
- maxOutStreams

- Must be non negative and no larger than

65536

.

0

to use the endpoints default value.
- maxInStreams

- Must be non negative and no larger than

65536

.

0

to use the endpoints default value.

**Returns:**
- true

if a connection was established,

false

if
this channel is in non-blocking mode and the connection operation
is in progress

**Throws:**
- AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
- ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the connect operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
- UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote peer
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract boolean isConnectionPending()

Tells whether or not a connection operation is in progress on this channel.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, a connection operation has been initiated
on this channel but not yet completed by invoking the

finishConnect()

method

---

#### public abstract boolean finishConnect()
throws
IOException

Finishes the process of connecting an SCTP channel.

A non-blocking connection operation is initiated by placing a socket
channel in non-blocking mode and then invoking one of its

connect

methods. Once the connection is established, or the attempt has
failed, the channel will become connectable and this method may
be invoked to complete the connection sequence. If the connection
operation failed then invoking this method will cause an appropriate

IOException

to be thrown.

If this channel is already connected then this method will not block
and will immediately return

true

. If this channel is in
non-blocking mode then this method will return

false

if the
connection process is not yet complete. If this channel is in blocking
mode then this method will block until the connection either completes
or fails, and will always either return

true

or throw a checked
exception describing the failure.

This method may be invoked at any time. If a

send

or

receive

operation upon this channel is invoked while an invocation of this
method is in progress then that operation will first block until this
invocation is complete. If a connection attempt fails, that is, if an
invocation of this method throws a checked exception, then the channel
will be closed.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this channel's socket is now
connected

**Throws:**
- NoConnectionPendingException

- If this channel is not connected and a connection operation
has not been initiated
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the connect operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
Set
<
SocketAddress
> getRemoteAddresses()
throws
IOException

Returns all of the remote addresses to which this channel's socket
is connected.

If the channel is connected to a remote peer that is bound to
multiple addresses then it is these addresses that the channel's socket
is connected.

**Returns:**
- All of the remote addresses to which this channel's socket
is connected, or an empty

Set

if the channel's socket is
not connected

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If the channel is closed
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpChannel
shutdown()
throws
IOException

Shutdown a connection without closing the channel.

Sends a shutdown command to the remote peer, effectively preventing
any new data from being written to the socket by either peer. Further
sends will throw

ClosedChannelException

. The
channel remains open to allow the for any data (and notifications) to be
received that may have been sent by the peer before it received the
shutdown command. If the channel is already shutdown then invoking this
method has no effect.

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

channel has been closed.

**Returns:**
- A set of the socket options supported by this channel

---

#### public final int validOps()

Returns an operation set identifying this channel's supported operations.

SCTP channels support connecting, reading, and writing, so this
method returns

(

SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT

|

SelectionKey.OP_READ

|

SelectionKey.OP_WRITE

)

.

**Specified by:**
- validOps

in class

SelectableChannel

**Returns:**
- The valid-operation set

---

#### public abstract <T>
MessageInfo
receive​(
ByteBuffer
dst,
T attachment,

NotificationHandler
<T> handler)
throws
IOException

Receives a message into the given buffer and/or handles a notification.

If a message or notification is immediately available, or if this
channel is in blocking mode and one eventually becomes available, then
the message or notification is returned or handled, respectively. If this
channel is in non-blocking mode and a message or notification is not
immediately available then this method immediately returns

null

.

If this method receives a message it is copied into the given byte
buffer. The message is transferred into the given byte buffer starting at
its current position and the buffers position is incremented by the
number of bytes read. If there are fewer bytes remaining in the buffer
than are required to hold the message, or the underlying input buffer
does not contain the complete message, then an invocation of

isComplete

on the returned

MessageInfo

will return

false

, and more invocations of this
method will be necessary to completely consume the messgae. Only
one message at a time will be partially delivered in any stream. The
socket option

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

controls various aspects of what interlacing of
messages occurs.

If this method receives a notification then the appropriate method of
the given handler, if there is one, is invoked. If the handler returns

CONTINUE

then this method will try to
receive another message/notification, otherwise, if

RETURN

is returned this method will return

null

. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the handler it will be
propagated up the stack through this method.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has
already initiated a receive operation upon this channel, then an
invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
complete. The given handler is invoked without holding any locks used
to enforce the above synchronization policy, that way handlers
will not stall other threads from receiving. A handler should not invoke
the

receive

method of this channel, if it does an

IllegalReceiveException

will be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- dst

- The buffer into which message bytes are to be transferred
- attachment

- The object to attach to the receive operation; can be

null
- handler

- A handler to handle notifications from the SCTP stack, or

null

to ignore any notifications.

**Returns:**
- The

MessageInfo

,

null

if this channel is in
non-blocking mode and no messages are immediately available or
the notification handler returns

RETURN

after handling a notification

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
- IllegalReceiveException

- If the given handler invokes the

receive

method of this
channel
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- The type of the attachment

---

#### public abstract int send​(
ByteBuffer
src,

MessageInfo
messageInfo)
throws
IOException

Sends a message via this channel.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode and there is sufficient room
in the underlying output buffer, or if this channel is in blocking mode
and sufficient room becomes available, then the remaining bytes in the
given byte buffer are transmitted as a single message. Sending a message
is atomic unless explicit message completion

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

socket option is enabled on this channel's socket.

The message is transferred from the byte buffer as if by a regular

write

operation.

The bytes will be written to the stream number that is specified by

streamNumber

in the given

messageInfo

.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has already
initiated a send operation upon this channel, then an invocation of
this method will block until the first operation is complete.

**Parameters:**
- src

- The buffer containing the message to be sent
- messageInfo

- Ancillary data about the message to be sent

**Returns:**
- The number of bytes sent, which will be either the number of
bytes that were remaining in the messages buffer when this method
was invoked or, if this channel is non-blocking, may be zero if
there was insufficient room for the message in the underlying
output buffer

**Throws:**
- InvalidStreamException

- If

streamNumner

is negative or greater than or equal to
the maximum number of outgoing streams
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

A selectable channel for message-oriented connected SCTP sockets.

An SCTP channel can only control one SCTP association.
An

SCTPChannel

is created by invoking one of the

open

methods of this class. A newly-created channel is open but
not yet connected, that is, there is no association setup with a remote peer.
An attempt to invoke an I/O operation upon an unconnected
channel will cause a

NotYetConnectedException

to be
thrown. An association can be setup by connecting the channel using one of
its

connect

methods. Once connected, the channel remains
connected until it is closed. Whether or not a channel is connected may be
determined by invoking

getRemoteAddresses

.

SCTP channels support

non-blocking connection:

A
channel may be created and the process of establishing the link to
the remote socket may be initiated via the

connect

method
for later completion by the

finishConnect

method.
Whether or not a connection operation is in progress may be determined by
invoking the

isConnectionPending

method.

Socket options are configured using the

setOption

method. An SCTP
channel support the following options:

Socket options

Option Name

Description

SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS

Enables or disables message fragmentation

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

Enables or disables explicit message completion

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

Controls how the presentation of messages occur for the message
receiver

SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS

The maximum number of streams requested by the local endpoint during
association initialization

SCTP_NODELAY

Enables or disable a Nagle-like algorithm

SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR

Requests that the local SCTP stack use the given peer address as the
association primary

SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR

Requests that the peer mark the enclosed address as the association
primary

SO_SNDBUF

The size of the socket send buffer

SO_RCVBUF

The size of the socket receive buffer

SO_LINGER

Linger on close if data is present (when configured in blocking mode
only)

Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported. The list
of options supported is obtained by invoking the

supportedOptions

method.

SCTP channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one thread may be
reading and at most one thread may be writing at any given time. The

connect

and

finishConnect

methods are mutually synchronized against each other, and
an attempt to initiate a send or receive operation while an invocation of one
of these methods is in progress will block until that invocation is complete.

of these methods is in progress will block until that invocation is complete.

An SCTP channel can only control one SCTP association.
An

SCTPChannel

is created by invoking one of the

open

methods of this class. A newly-created channel is open but
not yet connected, that is, there is no association setup with a remote peer.
An attempt to invoke an I/O operation upon an unconnected
channel will cause a

NotYetConnectedException

to be
thrown. An association can be setup by connecting the channel using one of
its

connect

methods. Once connected, the channel remains
connected until it is closed. Whether or not a channel is connected may be
determined by invoking

getRemoteAddresses

.

SCTP channels support

non-blocking connection:

A
channel may be created and the process of establishing the link to
the remote socket may be initiated via the

connect

method
for later completion by the

finishConnect

method.
Whether or not a connection operation is in progress may be determined by
invoking the

isConnectionPending

method.

Socket options are configured using the

setOption

method. An SCTP
channel support the following options:

Socket options

Option Name

Description

SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS

Enables or disables message fragmentation

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

Enables or disables explicit message completion

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

Controls how the presentation of messages occur for the message
receiver

SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS

The maximum number of streams requested by the local endpoint during
association initialization

SCTP_NODELAY

Enables or disable a Nagle-like algorithm

SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR

Requests that the local SCTP stack use the given peer address as the
association primary

SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR

Requests that the peer mark the enclosed address as the association
primary

SO_SNDBUF

The size of the socket send buffer

SO_RCVBUF

The size of the socket receive buffer

SO_LINGER

Linger on close if data is present (when configured in blocking mode
only)

Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported. The list
of options supported is obtained by invoking the

supportedOptions

method.

SCTP channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one thread may be
reading and at most one thread may be writing at any given time. The

connect

and

finishConnect

methods are mutually synchronized against each other, and
an attempt to initiate a send or receive operation while an invocation of one
of these methods is in progress will block until that invocation is complete.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- SctpChannel

```java
protected SctpChannel​(
SelectorProvider
provider)
```

Initializes a new instance of this class.

**Parameters:** provider

- The selector provider for this channel

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- open

```java
public static
SctpChannel
open()
throws
IOException
```

Opens an SCTP channel.

The new channel is unbound and unconnected.

**Returns:** A new SCTP channel
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the SCTP protocol is not supported
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- open

```java
public static
SctpChannel
open​(
SocketAddress
remote,
int maxOutStreams,
int maxInStreams)
throws
IOException
```

Opens an SCTP channel and connects it to a remote address.

This is a convenience method and is equivalent to evaluating the
following expression:

```java
open().connect(remote, maxOutStreams, maxInStreams);
```

**Parameters:** remote

- The remote address to which the new channel is to be connected
**Parameters:** maxOutStreams

- The number of streams that the application wishes to be able
to send to. Must be non negative and no larger than

65536

.

0

to use the endpoints default value.
**Parameters:** maxInStreams

- The maximum number of inbound streams the application is prepared
to support. Must be non negative and no larger than

65536

.

0

to use the endpoints default value.
**Returns:** A new SCTP channel connected to the given address
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the connect operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote peer
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the SCTP protocol is not supported
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- association

```java
public abstract
Association
association()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the association on this channel's socket.

**Returns:** the association, or

null

if the channel's socket is not
connected.
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If the channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local)
throws
IOException
```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address.

This method is used to establish a relationship between the socket
and the local addresses. Once a relationship is established then
the socket remains bound until the channel is closed. This relationship
may not necesssarily be with the address

local

as it may be removed
by

unbindAddress

, but there will always be at least
one local address bound to the channel's socket once an invocation of
this method successfully completes.

Once the channel's socket has been successfully bound to a specific
address, that is not automatically assigned, more addresses
may be bound to it using

bindAddress

, or removed
using

unbindAddress

.

**Parameters:** local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on this channel
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method denies
the operation

- bindAddress

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
bindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException
```

Adds the given address to the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown. The

bind

method takes a

SocketAddress

as its argument which typically
contains a port number as well as an address. Addresses subquently bound
using this method are simply addresses as the SCTP port number remains
the same for the lifetime of the channel.

Adding addresses to a connected association is optional functionality.
If the endpoint supports dynamic address reconfiguration then it may
send the appropriate message to the peer to change the peers address
lists.

**Parameters:** address

- The address to add to the bound addresses for the socket
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound to the given address
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- unbindAddress

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
unbindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException
```

Removes the given address from the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown. If this method is invoked on a channel that does not have

address

as one of its bound addresses or that has only one
local address bound to it, then this method throws

IllegalUnbindException

.
The initial address that the channel's socket is bound to using

bind

may be removed from the bound addresses for the channel's socket.

Removing addresses from a connected association is optional
functionality. If the endpoint supports dynamic address reconfiguration
then it may send the appropriate message to the peer to change the peers
address lists.

**Parameters:** address

- The address to remove from the bound addresses for the socket
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
**Throws:** IllegalUnbindException

- If

address

is not bound to the channel's socket. or
the channel has only one address bound to it
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- connect

```java
public abstract boolean connect​(
SocketAddress
remote)
throws
IOException
```

Connects this channel's socket.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode then an invocation of this
method initiates a non-blocking connection operation. If the connection
is established immediately, as can happen with a local connection, then
this method returns

true

. Otherwise this method returns

false

and the connection operation must later be completed by
invoking the

finishConnect

method.

If this channel is in blocking mode then an invocation of this
method will block until the connection is established or an I/O error
occurs.

If a security manager has been installed then this method verifies
that its

checkConnect

method permits connecting to the address and port number of the given
remote peer.

This method may be invoked at any time. If a

send

or

receive

operation upon this channel is invoked while an
invocation of this method is in progress then that operation will first
block until this invocation is complete. If a connection attempt is
initiated but fails, that is, if an invocation of this method throws a
checked exception, then the channel will be closed.

**Parameters:** remote

- The remote peer to which this channel is to be connected
**Returns:** true

if a connection was established,

false

if
this channel is in non-blocking mode and the connection
operation is in progress
**Throws:** AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the connect operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote peer
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- connect

```java
public abstract boolean connect​(
SocketAddress
remote,
int maxOutStreams,
int maxInStreams)
throws
IOException
```

Connects this channel's socket.

This is a convience method and is equivalent to evaluating the
following expression:

```java
setOption(SctpStandardSocketOptions.SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS, SctpStandardSocketOption.InitMaxStreams.create(maxInStreams, maxOutStreams))
.connect(remote);
```

The

maxOutStreams

and

maxInStreams

parameters
represent the maximum number of streams that the application wishes to be
able to send to and receive from. They are negotiated with the remote
peer and may be limited by the operating system.

**Parameters:** remote

- The remote peer to which this channel is to be connected
**Parameters:** maxOutStreams

- Must be non negative and no larger than

65536

.

0

to use the endpoints default value.
**Parameters:** maxInStreams

- Must be non negative and no larger than

65536

.

0

to use the endpoints default value.
**Returns:** true

if a connection was established,

false

if
this channel is in non-blocking mode and the connection operation
is in progress
**Throws:** AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the connect operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote peer
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- isConnectionPending

```java
public abstract boolean isConnectionPending()
```

Tells whether or not a connection operation is in progress on this channel.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, a connection operation has been initiated
on this channel but not yet completed by invoking the

finishConnect()

method

- finishConnect

```java
public abstract boolean finishConnect()
throws
IOException
```

Finishes the process of connecting an SCTP channel.

A non-blocking connection operation is initiated by placing a socket
channel in non-blocking mode and then invoking one of its

connect

methods. Once the connection is established, or the attempt has
failed, the channel will become connectable and this method may
be invoked to complete the connection sequence. If the connection
operation failed then invoking this method will cause an appropriate

IOException

to be thrown.

If this channel is already connected then this method will not block
and will immediately return

true

. If this channel is in
non-blocking mode then this method will return

false

if the
connection process is not yet complete. If this channel is in blocking
mode then this method will block until the connection either completes
or fails, and will always either return

true

or throw a checked
exception describing the failure.

This method may be invoked at any time. If a

send

or

receive

operation upon this channel is invoked while an invocation of this
method is in progress then that operation will first block until this
invocation is complete. If a connection attempt fails, that is, if an
invocation of this method throws a checked exception, then the channel
will be closed.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this channel's socket is now
connected
**Throws:** NoConnectionPendingException

- If this channel is not connected and a connection operation
has not been initiated
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the connect operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- getAllLocalAddresses

```java
public abstract
Set
<
SocketAddress
> getAllLocalAddresses()
throws
IOException
```

Returns all of the socket addresses to which this channel's socket is
bound.

**Returns:** All the socket addresses that this channel's socket is
bound to, or an empty

Set

if the channel's socket is not
bound
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If the channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- getRemoteAddresses

```java
public abstract
Set
<
SocketAddress
> getRemoteAddresses()
throws
IOException
```

Returns all of the remote addresses to which this channel's socket
is connected.

If the channel is connected to a remote peer that is bound to
multiple addresses then it is these addresses that the channel's socket
is connected.

**Returns:** All of the remote addresses to which this channel's socket
is connected, or an empty

Set

if the channel's socket is
not connected
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

)

.

**Specified by:** validOps

in class

SelectableChannel
**Returns:** The valid-operation set

- receive

```java
public abstract <T>
MessageInfo
receive​(
ByteBuffer
dst,
T attachment,

NotificationHandler
<T> handler)
throws
IOException
```

Receives a message into the given buffer and/or handles a notification.

If a message or notification is immediately available, or if this
channel is in blocking mode and one eventually becomes available, then
the message or notification is returned or handled, respectively. If this
channel is in non-blocking mode and a message or notification is not
immediately available then this method immediately returns

null

.

If this method receives a message it is copied into the given byte
buffer. The message is transferred into the given byte buffer starting at
its current position and the buffers position is incremented by the
number of bytes read. If there are fewer bytes remaining in the buffer
than are required to hold the message, or the underlying input buffer
does not contain the complete message, then an invocation of

isComplete

on the returned

MessageInfo

will return

false

, and more invocations of this
method will be necessary to completely consume the messgae. Only
one message at a time will be partially delivered in any stream. The
socket option

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

controls various aspects of what interlacing of
messages occurs.

If this method receives a notification then the appropriate method of
the given handler, if there is one, is invoked. If the handler returns

CONTINUE

then this method will try to
receive another message/notification, otherwise, if

RETURN

is returned this method will return

null

. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the handler it will be
propagated up the stack through this method.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has
already initiated a receive operation upon this channel, then an
invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
complete. The given handler is invoked without holding any locks used
to enforce the above synchronization policy, that way handlers
will not stall other threads from receiving. A handler should not invoke
the

receive

method of this channel, if it does an

IllegalReceiveException

will be thrown.

**Type Parameters:** T

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** dst

- The buffer into which message bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** attachment

- The object to attach to the receive operation; can be

null
**Parameters:** handler

- A handler to handle notifications from the SCTP stack, or

interrupt status
**Throws:** NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
**Throws:** IllegalReceiveException

- If the given handler invokes the

receive

method of this
channel
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- send

```java
public abstract int send​(
ByteBuffer

MessageInfo
messageInfo)
throws
IOException
```

Sends a message via this channel.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode and there is sufficient room
in the underlying output buffer, or if this channel is in blocking mode
and sufficient room becomes available, then the remaining bytes in the
given byte buffer are transmitted as a single message. Sending a message
is atomic unless explicit message completion

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

socket option is enabled on this channel's socket.

The message is transferred from the byte buffer as if by a regular

write

operation.

The bytes will be written to the stream number that is specified by

streamNumber

in the given

messageInfo

.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has already
initiated a send operation upon this channel, then an invocation of
this method will block until the first operation is complete.

**Parameters:** src

- The buffer containing the message to be sent
**Parameters:** messageInfo

- Ancillary data about the message to be sent
**Returns:** The number of bytes sent, which will be either the number of
bytes that were remaining in the messages buffer when this method

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local)
throws
IOException
```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address.

This method is used to establish a relationship between the socket
and the local addresses. Once a relationship is established then
the socket remains bound until the channel is closed. This relationship
may not necesssarily be with the address

local

as it may be removed
by

unbindAddress

, but there will always be at least
one local address bound to the channel's socket once an invocation of
this method successfully completes.

Once the channel's socket has been successfully bound to a specific
address, that is not automatically assigned, more addresses
may be bound to it using

bindAddress

, or removed
using

unbindAddress

.

**Parameters:** local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method denies
the operation

- bindAddress

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
bindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException
```

Adds the given address to the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown. The

bind

method takes a

SocketAddress

as its argument which typically
contains a port number as well as an address. Addresses subquently bound
using this method are simply addresses as the SCTP port number remains
the same for the lifetime of the channel.

Adding addresses to a connected association is optional functionality.
If the endpoint supports dynamic address reconfiguration then it may
send the appropriate message to the peer to change the peers address
lists.

**Parameters:** address

- The address to add to the bound addresses for the socket
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound to the given address
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- unbindAddress

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
unbindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException
```

Removes the given address from the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown. If this method is invoked on a channel that does not have

address

as one of its bound addresses or that has only one
local address bound to it, then this method throws

IllegalUnbindException

.
The initial address that the channel's socket is bound to using

bind

may be removed from the bound addresses for the channel's socket.

Removing addresses from a connected association is optional
functionality. If the endpoint supports dynamic address reconfiguration
then it may send the appropriate message to the peer to change the peers
address lists.

**Parameters:** address

- The address to remove from the bound addresses for the socket
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
**Throws:** IllegalUnbindException

- If

address

is not bound to the channel's socket. or
the channel has only one address bound to it
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- connect

```java
public abstract boolean connect​(
SocketAddress
remote)
throws
IOException
```

Connects this channel's socket.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode then an invocation of this
method initiates a non-blocking connection operation. If the connection
is established immediately, as can happen with a local connection, then
this method returns

true

. Otherwise this method returns

false

and the connection operation must later be completed by
invoking the

finishConnect

method.

If this channel is in blocking mode then an invocation of this
method will block until the connection is established or an I/O error
occurs.

If a security manager has been installed then this method verifies
that its

checkConnect

method permits connecting to the address and port number of the given
remote peer.

This method may be invoked at any time. If a

send

or

receive

operation upon this channel is invoked while an
invocation of this method is in progress then that operation will first
block until this invocation is complete. If a connection attempt is
initiated but fails, that is, if an invocation of this method throws a
checked exception, then the channel will be closed.

**Parameters:** remote

- The remote peer to which this channel is to be connected
**Returns:** true

if a connection was established,

false

if
this channel is in non-blocking mode and the connection
operation is in progress
**Throws:** AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the connect operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote peer
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- connect

```java
public abstract boolean connect​(
SocketAddress
remote,
int maxOutStreams,
int maxInStreams)
throws
IOException
```

Connects this channel's socket.

This is a convience method and is equivalent to evaluating the
following expression:

```java
setOption(SctpStandardSocketOptions.SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS, SctpStandardSocketOption.InitMaxStreams.create(maxInStreams, maxOutStreams))
.connect(remote);
```

The

maxOutStreams

and

maxInStreams

parameters
represent the maximum number of streams that the application wishes to be
able to send to and receive from. They are negotiated with the remote
peer and may be limited by the operating system.

**Parameters:** remote

- The remote peer to which this channel is to be connected
**Parameters:** maxOutStreams

- Must be non negative and no larger than

65536

.

0

to use the endpoints default value.
**Parameters:** maxInStreams

- Must be non negative and no larger than

65536

.

0

to use the endpoints default value.
**Returns:** true

if a connection was established,

false

if
this channel is in non-blocking mode and the connection operation
is in progress
**Throws:** AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a non-blocking connection operation is already in progress on
this channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed

- If another thread closes this channel
while the connect operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote peer
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- isConnectionPending

```java
public abstract boolean isConnectionPending()
```

Tells whether or not a connection operation is in progress on this channel.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, a connection operation has been initiated
on this channel but not yet completed by invoking the

finishConnect()

method

- finishConnect

```java
public abstract boolean finishConnect()
throws
IOException
```

Finishes the process of connecting an SCTP channel.

A non-blocking connection operation is initiated by placing a socket
channel in non-blocking mode and then invoking one of its

connect

methods. Once the connection is established, or the attempt has
failed, the channel will become connectable and this method may
be invoked to complete the connection sequence. If the connection
operation failed then invoking this method will cause an appropriate

IOException

to be thrown.

If this channel is already connected then this method will not block
and will immediately return

true

. If this channel is in
non-blocking mode then this method will return

false

if the
connection process is not yet complete. If this channel is in blocking
mode then this method will block until the connection either completes
or fails, and will always either return

true

or throw a checked
exception describing the failure.

This method may be invoked at any time. If a

send

or

receive

operation upon this channel is invoked while an invocation of this
method is in progress then that operation will first block until this
invocation is complete. If a connection attempt fails, that is, if an
invocation of this method throws a checked exception, then the channel
will be closed.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this channel's socket is now
connected
**Throws:** NoConnectionPendingException

- If this channel is not connected and a connection operation
has not been initiated
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed

is connected, or an empty

Set

if the channel's socket is
not connected
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

receive

```java
public abstract <T>
MessageInfo
receive​(
ByteBuffer
dst,
T attachment,

NotificationHandler
<T> handler)
throws
IOException
```

Receives a message into the given buffer and/or handles a notification.

If a message or notification is immediately available, or if this
channel is in blocking mode and one eventually becomes available, then
the message or notification is returned or handled, respectively. If this
channel is in non-blocking mode and a message or notification is not
immediately available then this method immediately returns

null

.

If this method receives a message it is copied into the given byte
buffer. The message is transferred into the given byte buffer starting at
its current position and the buffers position is incremented by the
number of bytes read. If there are fewer bytes remaining in the buffer
than are required to hold the message, or the underlying input buffer
does not contain the complete message, then an invocation of

isComplete

on the returned

MessageInfo

will return

false

, and more invocations of this
method will be necessary to completely consume the messgae. Only
one message at a time will be partially delivered in any stream. The
socket option

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

controls various aspects of what interlacing of
messages occurs.

If this method receives a notification then the appropriate method of
the given handler, if there is one, is invoked. If the handler returns

CONTINUE

then this method will try to
receive another message/notification, otherwise, if

RETURN

is returned this method will return

null

. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the handler it will be
propagated up the stack through this method.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has
already initiated a receive operation upon this channel, then an
invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
complete. The given handler is invoked without holding any locks used
to enforce the above synchronization policy, that way handlers
will not stall other threads from receiving. A handler should not invoke
the

receive

method of this channel, if it does an

IllegalReceiveException

will be thrown.

**Type Parameters:** T

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** dst

- The buffer into which message bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** attachment

- The object to attach to the receive operation; can be

null
**Parameters:** handler

- A handler to handle notifications from the SCTP stack, or

null

to ignore any notifications.
**Returns:** The

MessageInfo

,

null

if this channel is in
non-blocking mode and no messages are immediately available or
the notification handler returns

RETURN

after handling a notification
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
**Throws:** IllegalReceiveException

- If the given handler invokes the

receive

method of this
channel
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
