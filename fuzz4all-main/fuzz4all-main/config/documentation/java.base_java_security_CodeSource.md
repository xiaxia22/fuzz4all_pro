### Class Description

```java
public class
CodeSource

extends

This class extends the concept of a codebase to
encapsulate not only the location (URL) but also the certificate chains
that were used to verify signed code originating from that location.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

### Constructor Details

#### public CodeSource​(
URL
url,

Certificate
[] certs)

Constructs a CodeSource and associates it with the specified
location and set of certificates.

**Parameters:**
- url

- the location (URL). It may be

null

.
- certs

- the certificate(s). It may be

null

. The contents
of the array are copied to protect against subsequent modification.

---

#### public CodeSource​(
URL
url,

CodeSigner
[] signers)

Constructs a CodeSource and associates it with the specified
location and set of code signers.

**Parameters:**
- url

- the location (URL). It may be

null

.
- signers

- the code signers. It may be

null

. The contents
of the array are copied to protect against subsequent modification.

**Since:**
- 1.5

### Method Details

#### public int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this object.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a hash code value for this object.

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Tests for equality between the specified object and this
object. Two CodeSource objects are considered equal if their
locations are of identical value and if their signer certificate
chains are of identical value. It is not required that
the certificate chains be in the same order.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to test for equality with this object.

**Returns:**
- true if the objects are considered equal, false otherwise.

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### public final
URL
getLocation()

Returns the location associated with this CodeSource.

**Returns:**
- the location (URL), or

null

if no URL was supplied
during construction.

---

#### public final
Certificate
[] getCertificates()

Returns the certificates associated with this CodeSource.

If this CodeSource object was created using the

CodeSource(URL url, CodeSigner[] signers)

constructor then its certificate chains are extracted and used to
create an array of Certificate objects. Each signer certificate is
followed by its supporting certificate chain (which may be empty).
Each signer certificate and its supporting certificate chain is ordered
bottom-to-top (i.e., with the signer certificate first and the (root)
certificate authority last).

**Returns:**
- a copy of the certificate array, or

null

if there
is none.

---

#### public final
CodeSigner
[] getCodeSigners()

Returns the code signers associated with this CodeSource.

If this CodeSource object was created using the

CodeSource(URL url, java.security.cert.Certificate[] certs)

constructor then its certificate chains are extracted and used to
create an array of CodeSigner objects. Note that only X.509 certificates
are examined - all other certificate types are ignored.

**Returns:**
- a copy of the code signer array, or

null

if there
is none.

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public boolean implies​(
CodeSource
codesource)

Returns true if this CodeSource object "implies" the specified CodeSource.

More specifically, this method makes the following checks.
If any fail, it returns false. If they all succeed, it returns true.

- codesource

must not be null.

If this object's certificates are not null, then all
of this object's certificates must be present in

codesource

's
certificates.

If this object's location (getLocation()) is not null, then the
following checks are made against this object's location and

codesource

's:

- codesource

's location must not be null.

If this object's location
equals

codesource

's location, then return true.

This object's protocol (getLocation().getProtocol()) must be
equal to

codesource

's protocol, ignoring case.

If this object's host (getLocation().getHost()) is not null,
then the SocketPermission
constructed with this object's host must imply the
SocketPermission constructed with

codesource

's host.

If this object's port (getLocation().getPort()) is not
equal to -1 (that is, if a port is specified), it must equal

codesource

's port or default port
(codesource.getLocation().getDefaultPort()).

If this object's file (getLocation().getFile()) doesn't equal

codesource

's file, then the following checks are made:
If this object's file ends with "/-",
then

codesource

's file must start with this object's
file (exclusive the trailing "-").
If this object's file ends with a "/*",
then

codesource

's file must start with this object's
file and must not have any further "/" separators.
If this object's file doesn't end with a "/",
then

codesource

's file must match this object's
file with a '/' appended.

If this object's reference (getLocation().getRef()) is
not null, it must equal

codesource

's reference.

For example, the codesource objects with the following locations
and null certificates all imply
the codesource with the location "http://java.sun.com/classes/foo.jar"
and null certificates:

```java
http:
http://*.sun.com/classes/*
http://java.sun.com/classes/-
http://java.sun.com/classes/foo.jar
```

Note that if this CodeSource has a null location and a null
certificate chain, then it implies every other CodeSource.

**Parameters:**
- codesource

- CodeSource to compare against.

**Returns:**
- true if the specified codesource is implied by this codesource,
false if not.

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string describing this CodeSource, telling its
URL and certificates.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- information about this CodeSource.

file and must not have any further "/" separators.
If this object's file doesn't end with a "/",
then

codesource

's file must match this object's
file with a '/' appended.

If this object's reference (getLocation().getRef()) is
not null, it must equal

codesource

's reference.

For example, the codesource objects with the following locations
and null certificates all imply
the codesource with the location "http://java.sun.com/classes/foo.jar"
and null certificates:

```java
http:
http://*.sun.com/classes/*
http://java.sun.com/classes/-
http://java.sun.com/classes/foo.jar
```

Note that if this CodeSource has a null location and a null
certificate chain, then it implies every other CodeSource.

**Parameters:** codesource

- CodeSource to compare against.
**Returns:** true if the specified codesource is implied by this codesource,
false if not.

#### implies

public boolean implies​(

CodeSource

Returns true if this CodeSource object "implies" the specified CodeSource.

More specifically, this method makes the following checks.
If any fail, it returns false. If they all succeed, it returns true.

- codesource

If this object's certificates are not null, then all
of this object's certificates must be present in

then

codesource

file and must not have any further "/" separators.
If this object's file doesn't end with a "/",
then

not null, it must equal
