# Interface ExceptionEvent

**Source:** `jdk.jdi\com\sun\jdi\event\ExceptionEvent.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ExceptionEvent

extends
LocatableEvent
```

Notification of an exception in the target VM. When an exception
is thrown which satisfies a currently enabled

exception request

,
an

event set

containing an instance of this class will be added
to the VM's event queue.
If the exception is thrown from a non-native method,
the exception event is generated at the location where the
exception is thrown.
If the exception is thrown from a native method, the exception event
is generated at the first non-native location reached after the exception
is thrown.

### Method Details

#### ObjectReference
exception()

Gets the thrown exception object. The exception object is
an instance of

Throwable

or a subclass in the
target VM.

**Returns:**
- an

ObjectReference

which mirrors the thrown object in
the target VM.

---

#### Location
catchLocation()

Gets the location where the exception will be caught. An exception
is considered to be caught if, at the point of the throw, the
current location is dynamically enclosed in a try statement that
handles the exception. (See the JVM specification for details).
If there is such a try statement, the catch location is the
first code index of the appropriate catch clause.

If there are native methods in the call stack at the time of the
exception, there are important restrictions to note about the
returned catch location. In such cases,
it is not possible to predict whether an exception will be handled
by some native method on the call stack.
Thus, it is possible that exceptions considered uncaught
here will, in fact, be handled by a native method and not cause
termination of the target VM. Furthermore, it cannot be assumed that the
catch location returned here will ever be reached by the throwing
thread. If there is
a native frame between the current location and the catch location,
the exception might be handled and cleared in that native method
instead.

Note that the compiler can generate try-catch blocks in some cases
where they are not explicit in the source code; for example,
the code generated for

synchronized

and

finally

blocks can contain implicit try-catch blocks.
If such an implicitly generated try-catch is
present on the call stack at the time of the throw, the exception
will be considered caught even though it appears to be uncaught from
examination of the source code.

**Returns:**
- the

Location

where the exception will be caught or null if
the exception is uncaught.
