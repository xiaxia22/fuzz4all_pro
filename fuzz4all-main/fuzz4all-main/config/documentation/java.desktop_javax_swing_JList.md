# Class JList<E>

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\JList.html`

### Class Description

```java
@JavaBean
(
defaultProperty
="UI",

description
="A component which allows for the selection of one or more objects from a list.")
public class
JList<E>

extends
JComponent

implements
Scrollable
,
Accessible
```

A component that displays a list of objects and allows the user to select
one or more items. A separate model,

ListModel

, maintains the
contents of the list.

It's easy to display an array or Vector of objects, using the

JList

constructor that automatically builds a read-only

ListModel

instance
for you:

```java
// Create a JList that displays strings from an array

String[] data = {"one", "two", "three", "four"};
JList<String> myList = new JList<String>(data);

// Create a JList that displays the superclasses of JList.class, by
// creating it with a Vector populated with this data

Vector<Class<?>> superClasses = new Vector<Class<?>>();
Class<JList> rootClass = javax.swing.JList.class;
for(Class<?> cls = rootClass; cls != null; cls = cls.getSuperclass()) {
superClasses.addElement(cls);
}
JList<Class<?>> myList = new JList<Class<?>>(superClasses);

// The automatically created model is stored in JList's "model"
// property, which you can retrieve

ListModel<Class<?>> model = myList.getModel();
for(int i = 0; i < model.getSize(); i++) {
System.out.println(model.getElementAt(i));
}
```

A

ListModel

can be supplied directly to a

JList

by way of a
constructor or the

setModel

method. The contents need not be static -
the number of items, and the values of items can change over time. A correct

ListModel

implementation notifies the set of

javax.swing.event.ListDataListener

s that have been added to it, each
time a change occurs. These changes are characterized by a

javax.swing.event.ListDataEvent

, which identifies the range of list
indices that have been modified, added, or removed.

JList

's

ListUI

is responsible for keeping the visual representation up to
date with changes, by listening to the model.

Simple, dynamic-content,

JList

applications can use the

DefaultListModel

class to maintain list elements. This class
implements the

ListModel

interface and also provides a

java.util.Vector

-like API. Applications that need a more
custom

ListModel

implementation may instead wish to subclass

AbstractListModel

, which provides basic support for managing and
notifying listeners. For example, a read-only implementation of

AbstractListModel

:

```java
// This list model has about 2^16 elements. Enjoy scrolling.

ListModel<String> bigData = new AbstractListModel<String>() {
public int getSize() { return Short.MAX_VALUE; }
public String getElementAt(int index) { return "Index " + index; }
};
```

The selection state of a

JList

is managed by another separate
model, an instance of

ListSelectionModel

.

JList

is
initialized with a selection model on construction, and also contains
methods to query or set this selection model. Additionally,

JList

provides convenient methods for easily managing the selection. These methods,
such as

setSelectedIndex

and

getSelectedValue

, are cover
methods that take care of the details of interacting with the selection
model. By default,

JList

's selection model is configured to allow any
combination of items to be selected at a time; selection mode

MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION

. The selection mode can be changed
on the selection model directly, or via

JList

's cover method.
Responsibility for updating the selection model in response to user gestures
lies with the list's

ListUI

.

A correct

ListSelectionModel

implementation notifies the set of

javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener

s that have been added to it
each time a change to the selection occurs. These changes are characterized
by a

javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent

, which identifies the range
of the selection change.

The preferred way to listen for changes in list selection is to add

ListSelectionListener

s directly to the

JList

.

JList

then takes care of listening to the selection model and notifying your
listeners of change.

Responsibility for listening to selection changes in order to keep the list's
visual representation up to date lies with the list's

ListUI

.

Painting of cells in a

JList

is handled by a delegate called a
cell renderer, installed on the list as the

cellRenderer

property.
The renderer provides a

java.awt.Component

that is used
like a "rubber stamp" to paint the cells. Each time a cell needs to be
painted, the list's

ListUI

asks the cell renderer for the component,
moves it into place, and has it paint the contents of the cell by way of its

paint

method. A default cell renderer, which uses a

JLabel

component to render, is installed by the lists's

ListUI

. You can
substitute your own renderer using code like this:

```java
// Display an icon and a string for each object in the list.

class MyCellRenderer extends JLabel implements ListCellRenderer<Object> {
static final ImageIcon longIcon = new ImageIcon("long.gif");
static final ImageIcon shortIcon = new ImageIcon("short.gif");

// This is the only method defined by ListCellRenderer.
// We just reconfigure the JLabel each time we're called.

public Component getListCellRendererComponent(
JList<?> list, // the list
Object value, // value to display
int index, // cell index
boolean isSelected, // is the cell selected
boolean cellHasFocus) // does the cell have focus
{
String s = value.toString();
setText(s);
setIcon((s.length() > 10) ? longIcon : shortIcon);
if (isSelected) {
setBackground(list.getSelectionBackground());
setForeground(list.getSelectionForeground());
} else {
setBackground(list.getBackground());
setForeground(list.getForeground());
}
setEnabled(list.isEnabled());
setFont(list.getFont());
setOpaque(true);
return this;
}
}

myList.setCellRenderer(new MyCellRenderer());
```

Another job for the cell renderer is in helping to determine sizing
information for the list. By default, the list's

ListUI

determines
the size of cells by asking the cell renderer for its preferred
size for each list item. This can be expensive for large lists of items.
To avoid these calculations, you can set a

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

on the list, or have these values calculated
automatically based on a single prototype value:

```java
JList<String> bigDataList = new JList<String>(bigData);

// We don't want the JList implementation to compute the width
// or height of all of the list cells, so we give it a string
// that's as big as we'll need for any cell. It uses this to
// compute values for the fixedCellWidth and fixedCellHeight
// properties.

bigDataList.setPrototypeCellValue("Index 1234567890");
```

JList

doesn't implement scrolling directly. To create a list that
scrolls, make it the viewport view of a

JScrollPane

. For example:

```java
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(myList);

// Or in two steps:
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
scrollPane.getViewport().setView(myList);
```

JList

doesn't provide any special handling of double or triple
(or N) mouse clicks, but it's easy to add a

MouseListener

if you
wish to take action on these events. Use the

locationToIndex

method to determine what cell was clicked. For example:

```java
MouseListener mouseListener = new MouseAdapter() {
public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
if (e.getClickCount() == 2) {
int index = list.locationToIndex(e.getPoint());
System.out.println("Double clicked on Item " + index);
}
}
};
list.addMouseListener(mouseListener);
```

### Constructor Details

#### public JList​(
ListModel
<
E
> dataModel)

Constructs a

JList

that displays elements from the specified,

non-null

, model. All

JList

constructors delegate to
this one.

This constructor registers the list with the

ToolTipManager

,
allowing for tooltips to be provided by the cell renderers.

**Parameters:**
- dataModel

- the model for the list

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the model is

null

---

#### public JList​(
E
[] listData)

Constructs a

JList

that displays the elements in
the specified array. This constructor creates a read-only model
for the given array, and then delegates to the constructor that
takes a

ListModel

.

Attempts to pass a

null

value to this method results in
undefined behavior and, most likely, exceptions. The created model
references the given array directly. Attempts to modify the array
after constructing the list results in undefined behavior.

**Parameters:**
- listData

- the array of Objects to be loaded into the data model,

non-null

---

#### public JList​(
Vector
<? extends
E
> listData)

Constructs a

JList

that displays the elements in
the specified

Vector

. This constructor creates a read-only
model for the given

Vector

, and then delegates to the constructor
that takes a

ListModel

.

Attempts to pass a

null

value to this method results in
undefined behavior and, most likely, exceptions. The created model
references the given

Vector

directly. Attempts to modify the

Vector

after constructing the list results in undefined behavior.

**Parameters:**
- listData

- the

Vector

to be loaded into the
data model,

non-null

---

#### public JList()

Constructs a

JList

with an empty, read-only, model.

### Method Details

#### public
ListUI
getUI()

Returns the

ListUI

, the look and feel object that
renders this component.

**Overrides:**
- getUI

in class

JComponent

**Returns:**
- the

ListUI

object that renders this component

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
hidden
=true,

visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The UI object that implements the Component\'s LookAndFeel.")
public void setUI​(
ListUI
ui)

Sets the

ListUI

, the look and feel object that
renders this component.

**Parameters:**
- ui

- the

ListUI

object

**See Also:**
- UIDefaults.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

---

#### public void updateUI()

Resets the

ListUI

property by setting it to the value provided
by the current look and feel. If the current cell renderer was installed
by the developer (rather than the look and feel itself), this also causes
the cell renderer and its children to be updated, by calling

SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI

on it.

**Overrides:**
- updateUI

in class

JComponent

**See Also:**
- UIManager.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

,

SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(java.awt.Component)

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
String
getUIClassID()

Returns

"ListUI"

, the

UIDefaults

key used to look
up the name of the

javax.swing.plaf.ListUI

class that defines
the look and feel for this component.

**Overrides:**
- getUIClassID

in class

JComponent

**Returns:**
- the string "ListUI"

**See Also:**
- JComponent.getUIClassID()

,

UIDefaults.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

---

#### public
E
getPrototypeCellValue()

Returns the "prototypical" cell value -- a value used to calculate a
fixed width and height for cells. This can be

null

if there
is no such value.

**Returns:**
- the value of the

prototypeCellValue

property

**See Also:**
- setPrototypeCellValue(E)

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The cell prototype value, used to compute cell width and height.")
public void setPrototypeCellValue​(
E
prototypeCellValue)

Sets the

prototypeCellValue

property, and then (if the new value
is

non-null

), computes the

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

properties by requesting the cell renderer
component for the given value (and index 0) from the cell renderer, and
using that component's preferred size.

This method is useful when the list is too long to allow the

ListUI

to compute the width/height of each cell, and there is a
single cell value that is known to occupy as much space as any of the
others, a so-called prototype.

While all three of the

prototypeCellValue

,

fixedCellHeight

, and

fixedCellWidth

properties may be
modified by this method,

PropertyChangeEvent

notifications are
only sent when the

prototypeCellValue

property changes.

To see an example which sets this property, see the

class description

above.

The default value of this property is

null

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:**
- prototypeCellValue

- the value on which to base

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

**See Also:**
- getPrototypeCellValue()

,

setFixedCellWidth(int)

,

setFixedCellHeight(int)

,

Container.addPropertyChangeListener(java.beans.PropertyChangeListener)

---

#### public int getFixedCellWidth()

Returns the value of the

fixedCellWidth

property.

**Returns:**
- the fixed cell width

**See Also:**
- setFixedCellWidth(int)

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="Defines a fixed cell width when greater than zero.")
public void setFixedCellWidth​(int width)

Sets a fixed value to be used for the width of every cell in the list.
If

width

is -1, cell widths are computed in the

ListUI

by applying

getPreferredSize

to the cell renderer component
for each list element.

The default value of this property is

-1

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:**
- width

- the width to be used for all cells in the list

**See Also:**
- setPrototypeCellValue(E)

,

=true,

description
="Defines a fixed cell height when greater than zero.")
public void setFixedCellHeight​(int height)

Sets a fixed value to be used for the height of every cell in the list.
If

height

is -1, cell heights are computed in the

ListUI

by applying

getPreferredSize

to the cell renderer component
for each list element.

The default value of this property is

-1

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The component used to draw the cells.")
public void setCellRenderer​(
ListCellRenderer
<? super
E
> cellRenderer)

Sets the delegate that is used to paint each cell in the list.
The job of a cell renderer is discussed in detail in the

class level documentation

.

If the

prototypeCellValue

property is

non-null

,
setting the cell renderer also causes the

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

properties to be re-calculated. Only one

PropertyChangeEvent

is generated however -
for the

cellRenderer

property.

The default value of this property is provided by the

ListUI

delegate, i.e. by the look and feel implementation.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:**
- cellRenderer

- the

ListCellRenderer

that paints list cells

**See Also:**
- getCellRenderer()

#### public int getVisibleRowCount()

Returns the value of the

visibleRowCount

property. See the
documentation for

setVisibleRowCount(int)

for details on how to
interpret this value.

**Returns:**
- the value of the

visibleRowCount

property.

**See Also:**
- setVisibleRowCount(int)

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The preferred number of rows to display without requiring scrolling")
public void setVisibleRowCount​(int visibleRowCount)

Sets the

visibleRowCount

property, which has different meanings
depending on the layout orientation: For a

VERTICAL

layout
orientation, this sets the preferred number of rows to display without
requiring scrolling; for other orientations, it affects the wrapping of
cells.

In

VERTICAL

orientation:

Setting this property affects the return value of the

getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()

method, which is used to
calculate the preferred size of an enclosing viewport. See that method's
documentation for more details.

In

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

and

VERTICAL_WRAP

orientations:

This affects how cells are wrapped. See the documentation of

setLayoutOrientation(int)

for more details.

The default value of this property is

8

.

Calling this method with a negative value results in the property
being set to

0

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:**
- visibleRowCount

- an integer specifying the preferred number of
rows to display without requiring scrolling

**See Also:**
- getVisibleRowCount()

,

getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()

,

setLayoutOrientation(int)

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

---

#### public int getLayoutOrientation()

Returns the layout orientation property for the list:

VERTICAL

if the layout is a single column of cells,

VERTICAL_WRAP

if the
layout is "newspaper style" with the content flowing vertically then
horizontally, or

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

if the layout is "newspaper
style" with the content flowing horizontally then vertically.

**Returns:**
- the value of the

layoutOrientation

property

public void setLayoutOrientation​(int layoutOrientation)

Defines the way list cells are layed out. Consider a

JList

with five cells. Cells can be layed out in one of the following ways:

```java
VERTICAL: 0
1
2
3
4

HORIZONTAL_WRAP: 0 1 2

2
```

A description of these layouts follows:

Describes layouts VERTICAL,HORIZONTAL_WRAP, and VERTICAL_WRAP

Value

Description

VERTICAL

Cells are layed out vertically in a single column.

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

Cells are layed out horizontally, wrapping to a new row as
necessary. If the

visibleRowCount

property is less than or
equal to zero, wrapping is determined by the width of the list;
otherwise wrapping is done in such a way as to ensure

visibleRowCount

rows in the list.

VERTICAL_WRAP

Cells are layed out vertically, wrapping to a new column as
necessary. If the

visibleRowCount

property is less than or
equal to zero, wrapping is determined by the height of the list;
otherwise wrapping is done at

visibleRowCount

rows.

The default value of this property is

VERTICAL

.

**Parameters:**
- layoutOrientation

- the new layout orientation, one of:

VERTICAL

,

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

or

VERTICAL_WRAP

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

layoutOrientation

isn't one of the
allowable values

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public int getFirstVisibleIndex()

Returns the smallest list index that is currently visible.
In a left-to-right

componentOrientation

, the first visible
cell is found closest to the list's upper-left corner. In right-to-left
orientation, it is found closest to the upper-right corner.
If nothing is visible or the list is empty,

-1

is returned.
Note that the returned cell may only be partially visible.

**Returns:**
- the index of the first visible cell

**See Also:**
- getLastVisibleIndex()

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound

public int getLastVisibleIndex()

Returns the largest list index that is currently visible.
If nothing is visible or the list is empty,

-1

is returned.
Note that the returned cell may only be partially visible.

**Returns:**
- the index of the last visible cell

**See Also:**
- getFirstVisibleIndex()

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

---

#### public void ensureIndexIsVisible​(int index)

Scrolls the list within an enclosing viewport to make the specified
cell completely visible. This calls

scrollRectToVisible

with
the bounds of the specified cell. For this method to work, the

JList

must be within a

JViewport

.

If the given index is outside the list's range of cells, this method
results in nothing.

**Parameters:**
- index

- the index of the cell to make visible

**See Also:**
- JComponent.scrollRectToVisible(java.awt.Rectangle)

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
list's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the list's

ListUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
an item and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
list's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:**
- b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true

**See Also:**

,

getDragEnabled()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public boolean getDragEnabled()

Returns whether or not automatic drag handling is enabled.

**Returns:**
- the value of the

dragEnabled

property

**See Also:**
- setDragEnabled(boolean)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public final void setDropMode​(
DropMode
dropMode)

Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility,
the default for this property is

DropMode.USE_SELECTION

.
Usage of one of the other modes is recommended, however, for an
improved user experience.

DropMode.ON

, for instance,
offers similar behavior of showing items as selected, but does so without
affecting the actual selection in the list.

JList

supports the following drop modes:

- DropMode.USE_SELECTION
- DropMode.ON
- DropMode.INSERT
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT

The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a

TransferHandler

that accepts drops.

**Parameters:**
- dropMode

- the drop mode to use

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the drop mode is unsupported
or

null

**See Also:**
- getDropMode()

,

getDropLocation()

,

Returns the drop mode for this component.

**Returns:**

- setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public final
JList.DropLocation
getDropLocation()

Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
or

null

if no location is to currently be shown.

This method is not meant for querying the drop location
from a

TransferHandler

, as the drop location is only
set after the

TransferHandler

's

canImport

has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown.

When this property changes, a property change event with
name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.

By default, responsibility for listening for changes to this property
and indicating the drop location visually lies with the list's

ListUI

, which may paint it directly and/or install a cell
renderer to do so. Developers wishing to implement custom drop location
painting and/or replace the default cell renderer, may need to honor
this property.

**Returns:**
- the drop location

#### public
String
getToolTipText​(
MouseEvent
event)

Returns the tooltip text to be used for the given event. This overrides

JComponent

's

getToolTipText

to first check the cell
renderer component for the cell over which the event occurred, returning
its tooltip text, if any. This implementation allows you to specify
tooltip text on the cell level, by using

setToolTipText

on your
cell renderer component.

Note:

For

JList

to properly display the
tooltips of its renderers in this manner,

JList

must be a
registered component with the

ToolTipManager

. This registration
is done automatically in the constructor. However, if at a later point

JList

is unregistered, by way of a call to

setToolTipText(null)

, tips from the renderers will no longer display.

**Overrides:**
- getToolTipText

in class

JComponent

**Parameters:**
- event

- the

MouseEvent

to fetch the tooltip text for

**Returns:**
- a string containing the tooltip

false

when the drag is finished. This allows listeners to update only
when a change has been finalized, rather than handling all of the
intermediate values.

public
Dimension
getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()

Computes the size of viewport needed to display

visibleRowCount

rows. The value returned by this method depends on the layout
orientation:

VERTICAL

:

This is trivial if both

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

have been set (either explicitly or by specifying a prototype cell value).
The width is simply the

fixedCellWidth

plus the list's horizontal
insets. The height is the

fixedCellHeight

multiplied by the

visibleRowCount

, plus the list's vertical insets.

If either

fixedCellWidth

or

fixedCellHeight

haven't been
specified, heuristics are used. If the model is empty, the width is
the

fixedCellWidth

, if greater than

0

, or a hard-coded
value of

256

. The height is the

fixedCellHeight

multiplied
by

visibleRowCount

, if

fixedCellHeight

is greater than

0

, otherwise it is a hard-coded value of

16

multiplied by

visibleRowCount

.

If the model isn't empty, the width is the preferred size's width,
typically the width of the widest list element. The height is the
height of the cell with index 0 multiplied by the

visibleRowCount

,
plus the list's vertical insets.

VERTICAL_WRAP

or

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

:

This method simply returns the value from

getPreferredSize

.
The list's

ListUI

description
="A component which allows for the selection of one or more objects from a list.")
public class
JList<E>

extends
JComponent

implements
Scrollable
,
Accessible
```

A component that displays a list of objects and allows the user to select
one or more items. A separate model,

ListModel

, maintains the
contents of the list.

It's easy to display an array or Vector of objects, using the

JList

constructor that automatically builds a read-only

ListModel

instance
for you:

```java
// Create a JList that displays strings from an array

String[] data = {"one", "two", "three", "four"};
JList<String> myList = new JList<String>(data);

// Create a JList that displays the superclasses of JList.class, by
// creating it with a Vector populated with this data

Vector<Class<?>> superClasses = new Vector<Class<?>>();
Class<JList> rootClass = javax.swing.JList.class;
for(Class<?> cls = rootClass; cls != null; cls = cls.getSuperclass()) {
superClasses.addElement(cls);
}
JList<Class<?>> myList = new JList<Class<?>>(superClasses);

// The automatically created model is stored in JList's "model"
// property, which you can retrieve

ListModel<Class<?>> model = myList.getModel();
for(int i = 0; i < model.getSize(); i++) {
System.out.println(model.getElementAt(i));
}
```

A

ListModel

can be supplied directly to a

JList

by way of a
constructor or the

setModel

method. The contents need not be static -
the number of items, and the values of items can change over time. A correct

ListModel

implementation notifies the set of

javax.swing.event.ListDataListener

s that have been added to it, each
time a change occurs. These changes are characterized by a

javax.swing.event.ListDataEvent

, which identifies the range of list
indices that have been modified, added, or removed.

JList

's

ListUI

is responsible for keeping the visual representation up to
date with changes, by listening to the model.

Simple, dynamic-content,

JList

applications can use the

DefaultListModel

class to maintain list elements. This class
implements the

ListModel

interface and also provides a

java.util.Vector

-like API. Applications that need a more
custom

ListModel

implementation may instead wish to subclass

AbstractListModel

, which provides basic support for managing and
notifying listeners. For example, a read-only implementation of

AbstractListModel

:

```java
// This list model has about 2^16 elements. Enjoy scrolling.

ListModel<String> bigData = new AbstractListModel<String>() {
public int getSize() { return Short.MAX_VALUE; }
public String getElementAt(int index) { return "Index " + index; }
};
```

The selection state of a

JList

is managed by another separate
model, an instance of

ListSelectionModel

.

JList

is
initialized with a selection model on construction, and also contains
methods to query or set this selection model. Additionally,

JList

provides convenient methods for easily managing the selection. These methods,
such as

setSelectedIndex

and

getSelectedValue

, are cover
methods that take care of the details of interacting with the selection
model. By default,

JList

's selection model is configured to allow any
combination of items to be selected at a time; selection mode

MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION

. The selection mode can be changed
on the selection model directly, or via

JList

's cover method.
Responsibility for updating the selection model in response to user gestures
lies with the list's

ListUI

.

A correct

ListSelectionModel

implementation notifies the set of

javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener

s that have been added to it
each time a change to the selection occurs. These changes are characterized
by a

javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent

, which identifies the range
of the selection change.

The preferred way to listen for changes in list selection is to add

ListSelectionListener

s directly to the

JList

.

JList

then takes care of listening to the selection model and notifying your
listeners of change.

Responsibility for listening to selection changes in order to keep the list's
visual representation up to date lies with the list's

ListUI

.

Painting of cells in a

JList

is handled by a delegate called a
cell renderer, installed on the list as the

cellRenderer

property.
The renderer provides a

java.awt.Component

that is used
like a "rubber stamp" to paint the cells. Each time a cell needs to be
painted, the list's

ListUI

asks the cell renderer for the component,
moves it into place, and has it paint the contents of the cell by way of its

paint

method. A default cell renderer, which uses a

JLabel

component to render, is installed by the lists's

ListUI

. You can
substitute your own renderer using code like this:

```java
// Display an icon and a string for each object in the list.

class MyCellRenderer extends JLabel implements ListCellRenderer<Object> {
static final ImageIcon longIcon = new ImageIcon("long.gif");
static final ImageIcon shortIcon = new ImageIcon("short.gif");

// This is the only method defined by ListCellRenderer.
// We just reconfigure the JLabel each time we're called.

public Component getListCellRendererComponent(
JList<?> list, // the list
Object value, // value to display
int index, // cell index
boolean isSelected, // is the cell selected
boolean cellHasFocus) // does the cell have focus
{
String s = value.toString();
setText(s);
setIcon((s.length() > 10) ? longIcon : shortIcon);
if (isSelected) {
setBackground(list.getSelectionBackground());
setForeground(list.getSelectionForeground());
} else {
setBackground(list.getBackground());
setForeground(list.getForeground());
}
setEnabled(list.isEnabled());
setFont(list.getFont());
setOpaque(true);
return this;
}
}

myList.setCellRenderer(new MyCellRenderer());
```

Another job for the cell renderer is in helping to determine sizing
information for the list. By default, the list's

ListUI

determines
the size of cells by asking the cell renderer for its preferred
size for each list item. This can be expensive for large lists of items.
To avoid these calculations, you can set a

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

on the list, or have these values calculated
automatically based on a single prototype value:

```java
JList<String> bigDataList = new JList<String>(bigData);

// We don't want the JList implementation to compute the width
// or height of all of the list cells, so we give it a string
// that's as big as we'll need for any cell. It uses this to
// compute values for the fixedCellWidth and fixedCellHeight
// properties.

bigDataList.setPrototypeCellValue("Index 1234567890");
```

JList

doesn't implement scrolling directly. To create a list that
scrolls, make it the viewport view of a

JScrollPane

. For example:

```java
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(myList);

// Or in two steps:
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
scrollPane.getViewport().setView(myList);
```

JList

doesn't provide any special handling of double or triple
(or N) mouse clicks, but it's easy to add a

MouseListener

if you
wish to take action on these events. Use the

locationToIndex

method to determine what cell was clicked. For example:

```java
MouseListener mouseListener = new MouseAdapter() {
public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
if (e.getClickCount() == 2) {
int index = list.locationToIndex(e.getPoint());
System.out.println("Double clicked on Item " + index);
}
}
};
list.addMouseListener(mouseListener);
```

javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent

, which identifies the range
of the selection change.

The preferred way to listen for changes in list selection is to add

ListSelectionListener

s directly to the

JList

.

JList

then takes care of listening to the selection model and notifying your
listeners of change.

Responsibility for listening to selection changes in order to keep the list's
visual representation up to date lies with the list's

ListUI

.

Painting of cells in a

JList

is handled by a delegate called a
cell renderer, installed on the list as the

cellRenderer

property.
The renderer provides a

java.awt.Component

that is used
like a "rubber stamp" to paint the cells. Each time a cell needs to be
painted, the list's

ListUI

asks the cell renderer for the component,
moves it into place, and has it paint the contents of the cell by way of its

paint

method. A default cell renderer, which uses a

JLabel

component to render, is installed by the lists's

ListUI

. You can
substitute your own renderer using code like this:

```java
// Display an icon and a string for each object in the list.

class MyCellRenderer extends JLabel implements ListCellRenderer<Object> {
static final ImageIcon longIcon = new ImageIcon("long.gif");
static final ImageIcon shortIcon = new ImageIcon("short.gif");

// This is the only method defined by ListCellRenderer.
// We just reconfigure the JLabel each time we're called.

public Component getListCellRendererComponent(
JList<?> list, // the list
Object value, // value to display
int index, // cell index
boolean isSelected, // is the cell selected
boolean cellHasFocus) // does the cell have focus
{
String s = value.toString();
setText(s);
setIcon((s.length() > 10) ? longIcon : shortIcon);
if (isSelected) {
setBackground(list.getSelectionBackground());
setForeground(list.getSelectionForeground());
} else {
setBackground(list.getBackground());
setForeground(list.getForeground());
}
setEnabled(list.isEnabled());
setFont(list.getFont());
setOpaque(true);
return this;
}
}

myList.setCellRenderer(new MyCellRenderer());
```

Another job for the cell renderer is in helping to determine sizing
information for the list. By default, the list's

ListUI

determines
the size of cells by asking the cell renderer for its preferred
size for each list item. This can be expensive for large lists of items.
To avoid these calculations, you can set a

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

on the list, or have these values calculated
automatically based on a single prototype value:

```java
JList<String> bigDataList = new JList<String>(bigData);

// We don't want the JList implementation to compute the width
// or height of all of the list cells, so we give it a string
// that's as big as we'll need for any cell. It uses this to
// compute values for the fixedCellWidth and fixedCellHeight
// properties.

bigDataList.setPrototypeCellValue("Index 1234567890");
```

JList

doesn't implement scrolling directly. To create a list that
scrolls, make it the viewport view of a

JScrollPane

. For example:

```java
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(myList);

// Or in two steps:
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
scrollPane.getViewport().setView(myList);
```

JList

doesn't provide any special handling of double or triple
(or N) mouse clicks, but it's easy to add a

MouseListener

if you
wish to take action on these events. Use the

locationToIndex

method to determine what cell was clicked. For example:

```java
MouseListener mouseListener = new MouseAdapter() {
public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
if (e.getClickCount() == 2) {
int index = list.locationToIndex(e.getPoint());
System.out.println("Double clicked on Item " + index);
}
}
};
list.addMouseListener(mouseListener);
```

Simple, dynamic-content,

JList

applications can use the

DefaultListModel

class to maintain list elements. This class
implements the

ListModel

interface and also provides a

java.util.Vector

-like API. Applications that need a more
custom

ListModel

implementation may instead wish to subclass

AbstractListModel

, which provides basic support for managing and
notifying listeners. For example, a read-only implementation of

AbstractListModel

:

```java
// This list model has about 2^16 elements. Enjoy scrolling.

ListModel<String> bigData = new AbstractListModel<String>() {
public int getSize() { return Short.MAX_VALUE; }
public String getElementAt(int index) { return "Index " + index; }
};
```

The selection state of a

JList

is managed by another separate
model, an instance of

ListSelectionModel

.

JList

is
initialized with a selection model on construction, and also contains
methods to query or set this selection model. Additionally,

JList

provides convenient methods for easily managing the selection. These methods,
such as

setSelectedIndex

and

getSelectedValue

, are cover
methods that take care of the details of interacting with the selection
model. By default,

JList

's selection model is configured to allow any
combination of items to be selected at a time; selection mode

MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION

. The selection mode can be changed
on the selection model directly, or via

JList

's cover method.
Responsibility for updating the selection model in response to user gestures
lies with the list's

ListUI

.

A correct

ListSelectionModel

implementation notifies the set of

javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener

s that have been added to it
each time a change to the selection occurs. These changes are characterized

like a "rubber stamp" to paint the cells. Each time a cell needs to be
painted, the list's

ListUI

asks the cell renderer for the component,
moves it into place, and has it paint the contents of the cell by way of its

paint

method. A default cell renderer, which uses a

JLabel

component to render, is installed by the lists's

ListUI

. You can
substitute your own renderer using code like this:

```java
// Display an icon and a string for each object in the list.

class MyCellRenderer extends JLabel implements ListCellRenderer<Object> {
static final ImageIcon longIcon = new ImageIcon("long.gif");
static final ImageIcon shortIcon = new ImageIcon("short.gif");

// This is the only method defined by ListCellRenderer.
// We just reconfigure the JLabel each time we're called.

public Component getListCellRendererComponent(
JList<?> list, // the list
Object value, // value to display
int index, // cell index
boolean isSelected, // is the cell selected
boolean cellHasFocus) // does the cell have focus
{
String s = value.toString();
setText(s);
setIcon((s.length() > 10) ? longIcon : shortIcon);
if (isSelected) {
setBackground(list.getSelectionBackground());
setForeground(list.getSelectionForeground());
} else {
setBackground(list.getBackground());
setForeground(list.getForeground());
}
setEnabled(list.isEnabled());
setFont(list.getFont());
setOpaque(true);
return this;
}
}

myList.setCellRenderer(new MyCellRenderer());
```

Another job for the cell renderer is in helping to determine sizing
information for the list. By default, the list's

ListUI

determines
the size of cells by asking the cell renderer for its preferred
size for each list item. This can be expensive for large lists of items.
To avoid these calculations, you can set a

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

on the list, or have these values calculated
automatically based on a single prototype value:

```java
JList<String> bigDataList = new JList<String>(bigData);

// We don't want the JList implementation to compute the width
// or height of all of the list cells, so we give it a string
// that's as big as we'll need for any cell. It uses this to
// compute values for the fixedCellWidth and fixedCellHeight
// properties.

bigDataList.setPrototypeCellValue("Index 1234567890");
```

JList

doesn't implement scrolling directly. To create a list that
scrolls, make it the viewport view of a

JScrollPane

. For example:

```java
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(myList);

// Or in two steps:
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
scrollPane.getViewport().setView(myList);
```

JList

doesn't provide any special handling of double or triple
(or N) mouse clicks, but it's easy to add a

MouseListener

if you
wish to take action on these events. Use the

locationToIndex

method to determine what cell was clicked. For example:

```java
MouseListener mouseListener = new MouseAdapter() {
public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
if (e.getClickCount() == 2) {
int index = list.locationToIndex(e.getPoint());
System.out.println("Double clicked on Item " + index);
}
}
};
list.addMouseListener(mouseListener);
```

selection.

Clears the selection; after calling this method,

isSelectionEmpty

will return

true

.

Returns an instance of

DefaultListSelectionModel

; called
during construction to initialize the list's selection model
property.

ListSelectionListener

s added directly to the list
of selection changes made to the selection model.

Gets the

AccessibleContext

associated with this

JList

.

Returns the anchor selection index.

Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
or

null

if no location is to currently be shown.

Returns the value of the

fixedCellHeight

property.

Returns the value of the

fixedCellWidth

property.

Returns the layout orientation property for the list:

VERTICAL

if the layout is a single column of cells,

VERTICAL_WRAP

if the
layout is "newspaper style" with the content flowing vertically then
horizontally, or

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

if the layout is "newspaper
style" with the content flowing horizontally then vertically.

Returns the lead selection index.

Returns an array of all the

ListSelectionListener

s added
to this

JList

by way of

addListSelectionListener

.

Returns the largest selected cell index, or

-1

if the selection
is empty.

Returns the smallest selected cell index, or

-1

if the selection
is empty.

Returns the data model that holds the list of items displayed
by the

JList

component.

Returns the next list element whose

toString

value
starts with the given prefix.

Computes the size of viewport needed to display

visibleRowCount

rows.

Returns the "prototypical" cell value -- a value used to calculate a
fixed width and height for cells.

Returns the distance to scroll to expose the next or previous block.

Returns

true

if this

JList

is displayed in a

JViewport

and the viewport is taller than the list's
preferred height, or if the layout orientation is

VERTICAL_WRAP

and

visibleRowCount <= 0

; otherwise returns

false

.

Returns

true

if this

JList

is displayed in a

JViewport

and the viewport is wider than the list's
preferred width, or if the layout orientation is

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

and

visibleRowCount <= 0

; otherwise returns

false

.

Returns the distance to scroll to expose the next or previous
row (for vertical scrolling) or column (for horizontal scrolling).

Returns the smallest selected cell index;

when only
a single item is selected in the list.

Returns an array of all of the selected indices, in increasing
order.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- JList

```java
public JList​(
ListModel
<
E
> dataModel)
```

Constructs a

JList

that displays elements from the specified,

non-null

, model. All

JList

constructors delegate to
this one.

This constructor registers the list with the

ToolTipManager

,
allowing for tooltips to be provided by the cell renderers.

**Parameters:** dataModel

- the model for the list
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the model is

null

- JList

```java
public JList​(
E
[] listData)
```

Constructs a

JList

that displays the elements in
the specified array. This constructor creates a read-only model
for the given array, and then delegates to the constructor that
takes a

ListModel

.

Attempts to pass a

null

value to this method results in
undefined behavior and, most likely, exceptions. The created model
references the given array directly. Attempts to modify the array
after constructing the list results in undefined behavior.

**Parameters:** listData

- the array of Objects to be loaded into the data model,

non-null

- JList

```java
public JList​(
Vector
<? extends
E
> listData)
```

Constructs a

JList

that displays the elements in
the specified

Vector

. This constructor creates a read-only
model for the given

Vector

, and then delegates to the constructor
that takes a

ListModel

.

Attempts to pass a

null

value to this method results in
undefined behavior and, most likely, exceptions. The created model
references the given

Vector

directly. Attempts to modify the

Vector

after constructing the list results in undefined behavior.

**Parameters:** listData

- the

Vector

to be loaded into the
data model,

non-null

- JList

```java
public JList()
```

Constructs a

JList

with an empty, read-only, model.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getUI

```java
public
ListUI
getUI()
```

Returns the

ListUI

, the look and feel object that
renders this component.

**Overrides:** getUI

in class

JComponent
**Returns:** the

ListUI

object that renders this component

- setUI

```java
@BeanProperty
(
hidden
=true,

visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The UI object that implements the Component\'s LookAndFeel.")
public void setUI​(
ListUI
ui)
```

Sets the

ListUI

, the look and feel object that
renders this component.

**Parameters:** ui

- the

ListUI

object
**See Also:** UIDefaults.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

- updateUI

```java
public void updateUI()
```

Resets the

ListUI

property by setting it to the value provided
by the current look and feel. If the current cell renderer was installed
by the developer (rather than the look and feel itself), this also causes
the cell renderer and its children to be updated, by calling

SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI

on it.

**Overrides:** updateUI

in class

JComponent
**See Also:** UIManager.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

,

SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(java.awt.Component)

- getUIClassID

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
String
getUIClassID()
```

Returns

"ListUI"

, the

UIDefaults

key used to look
up the name of the

javax.swing.plaf.ListUI

class that defines
the look and feel for this component.

**Overrides:** getUIClassID

in class

JComponent
**Returns:** the string "ListUI"
**See Also:** JComponent.getUIClassID()

,

UIDefaults.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

- getPrototypeCellValue

```java
public
E
getPrototypeCellValue()
```

Returns the "prototypical" cell value -- a value used to calculate a
fixed width and height for cells. This can be

null

if there
is no such value.

**Returns:** the value of the

prototypeCellValue

property
**See Also:** setPrototypeCellValue(E)

- setPrototypeCellValue

```java
@BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The cell prototype value, used to compute cell width and height.")
public void setPrototypeCellValue​(
E
prototypeCellValue)
```

Sets the

prototypeCellValue

property, and then (if the new value
is

non-null

), computes the

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

properties by requesting the cell renderer
component for the given value (and index 0) from the cell renderer, and
using that component's preferred size.

This method is useful when the list is too long to allow the

ListUI

to compute the width/height of each cell, and there is a
single cell value that is known to occupy as much space as any of the
others, a so-called prototype.

While all three of the

prototypeCellValue

,

fixedCellHeight

, and

fixedCellWidth

properties may be
modified by this method,

PropertyChangeEvent

notifications are
only sent when the

prototypeCellValue

property changes.

To see an example which sets this property, see the

class description

above.

The default value of this property is

null

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** prototypeCellValue

- the value on which to base

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight
**See Also:** getPrototypeCellValue()

,

setFixedCellWidth(int)

,

setFixedCellHeight(int)

,

Container.addPropertyChangeListener(java.beans.PropertyChangeListener)

- getFixedCellWidth

```java
public int getFixedCellWidth()
```

Returns the value of the

fixedCellWidth

property.

**Returns:** the fixed cell width
**See Also:** setFixedCellWidth(int)

- setFixedCellWidth

```java
@BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="Defines a fixed cell width when greater than zero.")
public void setFixedCellWidth​(int width)
```

Sets a fixed value to be used for the width of every cell in the list.
If

width

is -1, cell widths are computed in the

ListUI

by applying

getPreferredSize

to the cell renderer component
for each list element.

The default value of this property is

-1

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** width

- the width to be used for all cells in the list
**See Also:** setPrototypeCellValue(E)

,

setFixedCellWidth(int)

,

Container.addPropertyChangeListener(java.beans.PropertyChangeListener)

- getFixedCellHeight

```java
public int getFixedCellHeight()
```

Returns the value of the

fixedCellHeight

property.

**Returns:** the fixed cell height
**See Also:** setFixedCellHeight(int)

- setFixedCellHeight

```java
@BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="Defines a fixed cell height when greater than zero.")
public void setFixedCellHeight​(int height)
```

Sets a fixed value to be used for the height of every cell in the list.
If

height

is -1, cell heights are computed in the

ListUI

by applying

getPreferredSize

to the cell renderer component
for each list element.

The default value of this property is

-1

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** height

- the height to be used for all cells in the list
**See Also:** setPrototypeCellValue(E)

,

setFixedCellWidth(int)

,

Container.addPropertyChangeListener(java.beans.PropertyChangeListener)

- getCellRenderer

```java
public
ListCellRenderer
<? super
E
> getCellRenderer()
```

Returns the object responsible for painting list items.

**Returns:** the value of the

cellRenderer

property
**See Also:** setCellRenderer(javax.swing.ListCellRenderer<? super E>)

- setCellRenderer

```java
@BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The component used to draw the cells.")
public void setCellRenderer​(
ListCellRenderer
<? super
E
> cellRenderer)
```

Sets the delegate that is used to paint each cell in the list.
The job of a cell renderer is discussed in detail in the

class level documentation

.

If the

prototypeCellValue

property is

non-null

,
setting the cell renderer also causes the

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

properties to be re-calculated. Only one

PropertyChangeEvent

is generated however -
for the

cellRenderer

property.

The default value of this property is provided by the

ListUI

delegate, i.e. by the look and feel implementation.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** cellRenderer

- the

ListCellRenderer

that paints list cells
**See Also:** getCellRenderer()

- getSelectionForeground

```java
public
Color
getSelectionForeground()
```

DefaultListCellRenderer

uses this color to draw the foreground
of items in the selected state, as do the renderers installed by most

ListUI

implementations.

**Returns:** the color to draw the foreground of selected items
**See Also:** setSelectionForeground(java.awt.Color)

,

DefaultListCellRenderer

- setSelectionForeground

```java
@BeanProperty

implementations.

The default value of this property is defined by the look and feel
implementation.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** selectionForeground

- the

Color

to use in the foreground
for selected list items
**See Also:** getSelectionForeground()

,

setSelectionBackground(java.awt.Color)

,

JComponent.setForeground(java.awt.Color)

,

of items in the selected state, as do the renderers installed by most

ListUI

implementations.

The default value of this property is defined by the look
and feel implementation.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** selectionBackground

- the

Color

to use for the
background of selected cells

- getVisibleRowCount

```java
public int getVisibleRowCount()
```

Returns the value of the

visibleRowCount

property. See the
documentation for

setVisibleRowCount(int)

for details on how to
interpret this value.

**Returns:** the value of the

visibleRowCount

property.
**See Also:** setVisibleRowCount(int)

- setVisibleRowCount

```java
@BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The preferred number of rows to display without requiring scrolling")
public void setVisibleRowCount​(int visibleRowCount)
```

Sets the

visibleRowCount

property, which has different meanings
depending on the layout orientation: For a

VERTICAL

layout
orientation, this sets the preferred number of rows to display without
requiring scrolling; for other orientations, it affects the wrapping of
cells.

In

VERTICAL

orientation:

Setting this property affects the return value of the

getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()

method, which is used to
calculate the preferred size of an enclosing viewport. See that method's
documentation for more details.

In

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

and

VERTICAL_WRAP

orientations:

This affects how cells are wrapped. See the documentation of

setLayoutOrientation(int)

for more details.

The default value of this property is

8

.

Calling this method with a negative value results in the property
being set to

0

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** visibleRowCount

- an integer specifying the preferred number of
rows to display without requiring scrolling
**See Also:** getVisibleRowCount()

,

getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()

,

setLayoutOrientation(int)

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

,

- getLayoutOrientation

```java
public int getLayoutOrientation()
```

Returns the layout orientation property for the list:

VERTICAL

if the layout is a single column of cells,

VERTICAL_WRAP

if the
layout is "newspaper style" with the content flowing vertically then
horizontally, or

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

if the layout is "newspaper
style" with the content flowing horizontally then vertically.

**Returns:** the value of the

layoutOrientation

property
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setLayoutOrientation(int)

- setLayoutOrientation

```java

=true,

enumerationValues
={"JList.VERTICAL","JList.HORIZONTAL_WRAP","JList.VERTICAL_WRAP"},

description
="Defines the way list cells are layed out.")
public void setLayoutOrientation​(int layoutOrientation)
```

Defines the way list cells are layed out. Consider a

JList

with five cells. Cells can be layed out in one of the following ways:

```java
VERTICAL: 0
1
2
3
4

HORIZONTAL_WRAP: 0 1 2
3 4

VERTICAL_WRAP: 0 3
1 4
2
```

A description of these layouts follows:

Describes layouts VERTICAL,HORIZONTAL_WRAP, and VERTICAL_WRAP

Value

Description

VERTICAL

Cells are layed out vertically in a single column.

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

Cells are layed out horizontally, wrapping to a new row as
necessary. If the

visibleRowCount

property is less than or
equal to zero, wrapping is determined by the width of the list;
otherwise wrapping is done in such a way as to ensure

visibleRowCount

rows in the list.

VERTICAL_WRAP

Cells are layed out vertically, wrapping to a new column as
necessary. If the

visibleRowCount

property is less than or
equal to zero, wrapping is determined by the height of the list;
otherwise wrapping is done at

visibleRowCount

rows.

The default value of this property is

VERTICAL

.

**Parameters:** layoutOrientation

- the new layout orientation, one of:

VERTICAL

,

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

or

VERTICAL_WRAP
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

layoutOrientation

isn't one of the
allowable values
**Since:** 1.4

- getFirstVisibleIndex

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public int getFirstVisibleIndex()
```

Returns the smallest list index that is currently visible.
In a left-to-right

componentOrientation

, the first visible
cell is found closest to the list's upper-left corner. In right-to-left
orientation, it is found closest to the upper-right corner.
If nothing is visible or the list is empty,

-1

is returned.
Note that the returned cell may only be partially visible.

**Returns:** the index of the first visible cell
**See Also:** getLastVisibleIndex()

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

- getLastVisibleIndex

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public int getLastVisibleIndex()
```

Returns the largest list index that is currently visible.
If nothing is visible or the list is empty,

-1

is returned.
Note that the returned cell may only be partially visible.

**Returns:** the index of the last visible cell
**See Also:** getFirstVisibleIndex()

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

- ensureIndexIsVisible

```java
public void ensureIndexIsVisible​(int index)
```

Scrolls the list within an enclosing viewport to make the specified
cell completely visible. This calls

scrollRectToVisible

with
the bounds of the specified cell. For this method to work, the

JList

must be within a

JViewport

.

If the given index is outside the list's range of cells, this method
results in nothing.

**Parameters:** index

- the index of the cell to make visible
**See Also:** JComponent.scrollRectToVisible(java.awt.Rectangle)

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

- setDragEnabled

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)
```

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
list's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the list's

ListUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
an item and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
list's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:** b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

,

getDragEnabled()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDragEnabled

```java
public boolean getDragEnabled()
```

Returns whether or not automatic drag handling is enabled.

**Returns:** the value of the

dragEnabled

property
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setDragEnabled(boolean)

- setDropMode

```java
public final void setDropMode​(
DropMode
dropMode)
```

Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility,
the default for this property is

DropMode.USE_SELECTION

.
Usage of one of the other modes is recommended, however, for an
improved user experience.

DropMode.ON

, for instance,
offers similar behavior of showing items as selected, but does so without
affecting the actual selection in the list.

JList

supports the following drop modes:

- DropMode.USE_SELECTION
- DropMode.ON
- DropMode.INSERT
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT

The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a

TransferHandler

that accepts drops.

**Parameters:** dropMode

- the drop mode to use
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the drop mode is unsupported
or

null
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** getDropMode()

,

getDropLocation()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDropMode

```java
public final
DropMode
getDropMode()
```

Returns the drop mode for this component.

**Returns:** the drop mode for this component
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

- getDropLocation

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public final
JList.DropLocation
getDropLocation()
```

Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
or

null

if no location is to currently be shown.

This method is not meant for querying the drop location
from a

TransferHandler

, as the drop location is only
set after the

TransferHandler

's

canImport

has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown.

When this property changes, a property change event with
name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.

By default, responsibility for listening for changes to this property
and indicating the drop location visually lies with the list's

ListUI

, which may paint it directly and/or install a cell
renderer to do so. Developers wishing to implement custom drop location
painting and/or replace the default cell renderer, may need to honor
this property.

**Returns:** the drop location
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

,

TransferHandler.canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)

- getNextMatch

```java
public int getNextMatch​(
String
prefix,
int startIndex,

Position.Bias
bias)
```

Returns the next list element whose

toString

value
starts with the given prefix.

**Parameters:** prefix

- the string to test for a match
**Parameters:** startIndex

- the index for starting the search
**Parameters:** bias

- the search direction, either
Position.Bias.Forward or Position.Bias.Backward.
**Returns:** the index of the next list element that
starts with the prefix; otherwise

-1
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if prefix is

null

or startIndex is out of bounds
**Since:** 1.4

- getToolTipText

```java
public
String
getToolTipText​(
MouseEvent
event)
```

Returns the tooltip text to be used for the given event. This overrides

JComponent

's

getToolTipText

to first check the cell
renderer component for the cell over which the event occurred, returning
its tooltip text, if any. This implementation allows you to specify
tooltip text on the cell level, by using

setToolTipText

on your
cell renderer component.

Note:

For

JList

to properly display the
tooltips of its renderers in this manner,

JList

must be a
registered component with the

ToolTipManager

. This registration
is done automatically in the constructor. However, if at a later point

JList

is unregistered, by way of a call to

setToolTipText(null)

, tips from the renderers will no longer display.

**Overrides:** getToolTipText

in class

JComponent
**Parameters:** event

- the

MouseEvent

to fetch the tooltip text for
**Returns:** a string containing the tooltip
**See Also:** JComponent.setToolTipText(java.lang.String)

,

JComponent.getToolTipText()

- locationToIndex

```java
public int locationToIndex​(
Point
location)
```

Returns the cell index closest to the given location in the list's
coordinate system. To determine if the cell actually contains the
specified location, compare the point against the cell's bounds,
as provided by

getCellBounds

. This method returns

-1

if the model is empty

- getCellBounds

```java
public
Rectangle
getCellBounds​(int index0,
int index1)
```

Returns the bounding rectangle, in the list's coordinate system,
for the range of cells specified by the two indices.
These indices can be supplied in any order.

If the smaller index is outside the list's range of cells, this method
returns

null

. If the smaller index is valid, but the larger
index is outside the list's range, the bounds of just the first index
is returned. Otherwise, the bounds of the valid range is returned.

This is a cover method that delegates to the method of the same name
in the list's

ListUI

. It returns

null

if the list has
no

ListUI

.

**Parameters:** index0

- the first index in the range

public void setSelectionMode​(int selectionMode)
```

Sets the selection mode for the list. This is a cover method that sets
the selection mode directly on the selection model.

The following list describes the accepted selection modes:

- ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION

-
Only one list index can be selected at a time. In this mode,

setSelectionInterval

and

addSelectionInterval

are
equivalent, both replacing the current selection with the index
represented by the second argument (the "lead").

ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION

- setValueIsAdjusting

```java
public void setValueIsAdjusting​(boolean b)
```

Sets the selection model's

valueIsAdjusting

property. When

true

, upcoming changes to selection should be considered part
of a single change. This property is used internally and developers
typically need not call this method. For example, when the model is being
updated in response to a user drag, the value of the property is set
to

true

when the drag is initiated and set to

false

when the drag is finished. This allows listeners to update only
when a change has been finalized, rather than handling all of the
intermediate values.

You may want to use this directly if making a series of changes
that should be considered part of a single change.

This is a cover method that delegates to the method of the same name on
the list's selection model. See the documentation for

ListSelectionModel.setValueIsAdjusting(boolean)

for
more details.

```

Returns the smallest selected cell index;

the selection

when only
a single item is selected in the list. When multiple items are selected,
it is simply the smallest selected index. Returns

-1

if there is
no selection.

This method is a cover that delegates to

getMinSelectionIndex

.

**Returns:** the smallest selected cell index
**See Also:** getMinSelectionIndex()

,

addListSelectionListener(javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener)

- getSelectedValue

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
E
getSelectedValue()
```

Returns the value for the smallest selected cell index;

the selected value

when only a single item is selected in the
list. When multiple items are selected, it is simply the value for the
smallest selected index. Returns

null

if there is no selection.

This is a convenience method that simply returns the model value for

getMinSelectionIndex

.

**Returns:** the first selected value
**See Also:** getMinSelectionIndex()

,

getModel()

,

addListSelectionListener(javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener)

- setSelectedValue

```java
public void setSelectedValue​(
Object
anObject,
boolean shouldScroll)
```

Selects the specified object from the list.
If the object passed is

null

, the selection is cleared.

**Parameters:** anObject

- the object to select
**Parameters:** shouldScroll

-

true

if the list should scroll to display
the selected object, if one exists; otherwise

false

- getPreferredScrollableViewportSize

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
Dimension
getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()
```

Computes the size of viewport needed to display

visibleRowCount

rows. The value returned by this method depends on the layout
orientation:

VERTICAL

:

This is trivial if both

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

have been set (either explicitly or by specifying a prototype cell value).
The width is simply the

fixedCellWidth

plus the list's horizontal
insets. The height is the

fixedCellHeight

multiplied by the

visibleRowCount

, plus the list's vertical insets.

If either

fixedCellWidth

or

fixedCellHeight

haven't been
specified, heuristics are used. If the model is empty, the width is
the

fixedCellWidth

, if greater than

0

, or a hard-coded
value of

256

. The height is the

fixedCellHeight

multiplied
by

visibleRowCount

, if

fixedCellHeight

is greater than

0

, otherwise it is a hard-coded value of

16

multiplied by

visibleRowCount

.

If the model isn't empty, the width is the preferred size's width,
typically the width of the widest list element. The height is the
height of the cell with index 0 multiplied by the

visibleRowCount

,
plus the list's vertical insets.

VERTICAL_WRAP

or

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

:

This method simply returns the value from

getPreferredSize

.
The list's

ListUI

is expected to override

getPreferredSize

to return an appropriate value.

**Specified by:** getPreferredScrollableViewportSize

in interface

**Returns:** a dimension containing the size of the viewport needed
to display

visibleRowCount

rows
**See Also:** getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()

- getScrollableUnitIncrement

```java
public int getScrollableUnitIncrement​(
Rectangle
visibleRect,
int orientation,
int direction)
```

Returns the distance to scroll to expose the next or previous
row (for vertical scrolling) or column (for horizontal scrolling).

For horizontal scrolling, if the layout orientation is

VERTICAL

,
then the list's font size is returned (or

1

if the font is

null

).

For vertical scrolling, the following rules are used:

- if scrolling down, returns the distance to scroll so that the last
visible element becomes the first completely visible element

if scrolling up, returns the distance to scroll so that the first
visible element becomes the last completely visible element

returns

visibleRect.height

if the list is empty

For horizontal scrolling, when the layout orientation is either

VERTICAL_WRAP

or

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

:

- if scrolling right, returns the distance to scroll so that the
last visible element becomes
the first completely visible element

if scrolling left, returns the distance to scroll so that the first
visible element becomes the last completely visible element

returns

visibleRect.width

if the list is empty

For horizontal scrolling and

VERTICAL

orientation,
returns

visibleRect.width

.

Note that the value of

visibleRect

must be the equal to

this.getVisibleRect()

Method Detail

- getUI

```java
public
ListUI
getUI()
```

Returns the

ListUI

, the look and feel object that
renders this component.

**Overrides:** getUI

in class

JComponent
**Returns:** the

ListUI

object that renders this component

- setUI

```java
@BeanProperty
(
hidden
=true,

visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The UI object that implements the Component\'s LookAndFeel.")
public void setUI​(
ListUI
ui)
```

Sets the

ListUI

, the look and feel object that
renders this component.

**Parameters:** ui

- the

ListUI

object
**See Also:** UIDefaults.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

- updateUI

```java
public void updateUI()
```

Resets the

ListUI

property by setting it to the value provided
by the current look and feel. If the current cell renderer was installed
by the developer (rather than the look and feel itself), this also causes
the cell renderer and its children to be updated, by calling

SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI

on it.

**Overrides:** updateUI

in class

JComponent
**See Also:** UIManager.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

,

SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(java.awt.Component)

- getUIClassID

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
String
getUIClassID()
```

Returns

"ListUI"

, the

UIDefaults

key used to look
up the name of the

javax.swing.plaf.ListUI

class that defines
the look and feel for this component.

**Overrides:** getUIClassID

in class

JComponent
**Returns:** the string "ListUI"
**See Also:** JComponent.getUIClassID()

,

UIDefaults.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

- getPrototypeCellValue

```java
public
E
getPrototypeCellValue()
```

Returns the "prototypical" cell value -- a value used to calculate a
fixed width and height for cells. This can be

null

if there
is no such value.

**Returns:** the value of the

prototypeCellValue

property
**See Also:** setPrototypeCellValue(E)

- setPrototypeCellValue

```java
@BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The cell prototype value, used to compute cell width and height.")
public void setPrototypeCellValue​(
E
prototypeCellValue)
```

Sets the

prototypeCellValue

property, and then (if the new value
is

non-null

), computes the

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

properties by requesting the cell renderer
component for the given value (and index 0) from the cell renderer, and
using that component's preferred size.

This method is useful when the list is too long to allow the

ListUI

to compute the width/height of each cell, and there is a
single cell value that is known to occupy as much space as any of the
others, a so-called prototype.

While all three of the

prototypeCellValue

,

fixedCellHeight

, and

fixedCellWidth

properties may be
modified by this method,

PropertyChangeEvent

notifications are
only sent when the

prototypeCellValue

property changes.

To see an example which sets this property, see the

class description

above.

The default value of this property is

null

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** prototypeCellValue

- the value on which to base

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight
**See Also:** getPrototypeCellValue()

,

**See Also:** setFixedCellWidth(int)

- setFixedCellWidth

```java
@BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="Defines a fixed cell width when greater than zero.")
public void setFixedCellWidth​(int width)
```

Sets a fixed value to be used for the width of every cell in the list.
If

width

is -1, cell widths are computed in the

ListUI

by applying

getPreferredSize

to the cell renderer component
for each list element.

The default value of this property is

-1

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** width

- the width to be used for all cells in the list
**See Also:** setPrototypeCellValue(E)

,

setFixedCellWidth(int)

,

Container.addPropertyChangeListener(java.beans.PropertyChangeListener)

- getFixedCellHeight

description
="Defines a fixed cell height when greater than zero.")
public void setFixedCellHeight​(int height)
```

Sets a fixed value to be used for the height of every cell in the list.
If

height

is -1, cell heights are computed in the

ListUI

by applying

getPreferredSize

to the cell renderer component
for each list element.

The default value of this property is

-1

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** height

- the height to be used for all cells in the list

```

Returns the object responsible for painting list items.

**Returns:** the value of the

cellRenderer

property
**See Also:** setCellRenderer(javax.swing.ListCellRenderer<? super E>)

- setCellRenderer

```java
@BeanProperty
(
visualUpdate
=true,

description
="The component used to draw the cells.")
public void setCellRenderer​(
ListCellRenderer
<? super
E
> cellRenderer)
```

Sets the delegate that is used to paint each cell in the list.
The job of a cell renderer is discussed in detail in the

class level documentation

.

If the

prototypeCellValue

property is

non-null

,
setting the cell renderer also causes the

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

properties to be re-calculated. Only one

PropertyChangeEvent

is generated however -
for the

cellRenderer

property.

The default value of this property is provided by the

ListUI

delegate, i.e. by the look and feel implementation.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

method, which is used to
calculate the preferred size of an enclosing viewport. See that method's
documentation for more details.

In

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

and

VERTICAL_WRAP

orientations:

This affects how cells are wrapped. See the documentation of

setLayoutOrientation(int)

for more details.

The default value of this property is

8

.

Calling this method with a negative value results in the property
being set to

0

.

This is a JavaBeans bound property.

**Parameters:** visibleRowCount

- an integer specifying the preferred number of
rows to display without requiring scrolling
**See Also:** getVisibleRowCount()

,

getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()

,

setLayoutOrientation(int)

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

- getLayoutOrientation

```java
public int getLayoutOrientation()
```

Returns the layout orientation property for the list:

VERTICAL

if the layout is a single column of cells,

VERTICAL_WRAP

if the
layout is "newspaper style" with the content flowing vertically then
horizontally, or

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

if the layout is "newspaper
style" with the content flowing horizontally then vertically.

**Returns:** the value of the

layoutOrientation

property
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setLayoutOrientation(int)

- setLayoutOrientation

```java
@BeanProperty

=true,

enumerationValues
={"JList.VERTICAL","JList.HORIZONTAL_WRAP","JList.VERTICAL_WRAP"},

description
="Defines the way list cells are layed out.")
public void setLayoutOrientation​(int layoutOrientation)
```

Defines the way list cells are layed out. Consider a

JList

with five cells. Cells can be layed out in one of the following ways:

```java
VERTICAL: 0
1
2
3
4

HORIZONTAL_WRAP: 0 1 2
3 4

VERTICAL_WRAP: 0 3
1 4
2
```

A description of these layouts follows:

Describes layouts VERTICAL,HORIZONTAL_WRAP, and VERTICAL_WRAP

Value

Description

VERTICAL

Cells are layed out vertically in a single column.

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

Cells are layed out horizontally, wrapping to a new row as
necessary. If the

visibleRowCount

property is less than or
equal to zero, wrapping is determined by the width of the list;
otherwise wrapping is done in such a way as to ensure

visibleRowCount

rows in the list.

VERTICAL_WRAP

Cells are layed out vertically, wrapping to a new column as
necessary. If the

visibleRowCount

property is less than or
equal to zero, wrapping is determined by the height of the list;
otherwise wrapping is done at

visibleRowCount

rows.

The default value of this property is

VERTICAL

.

**Parameters:** layoutOrientation

- the new layout orientation, one of:

VERTICAL

,

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

or

VERTICAL_WRAP
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

layoutOrientation

isn't one of the
allowable values
**Since:** 1.4

- getFirstVisibleIndex

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public int getFirstVisibleIndex()
```

Returns the smallest list index that is currently visible.
In a left-to-right

componentOrientation

, the first visible
cell is found closest to the list's upper-left corner. In right-to-left
orientation, it is found closest to the upper-right corner.
If nothing is visible or the list is empty,

-1

is returned.
Note that the returned cell may only be partially visible.

**Returns:** the index of the first visible cell
**See Also:** getLastVisibleIndex()

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

- getLastVisibleIndex

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public int getLastVisibleIndex()
```

Returns the largest list index that is currently visible.
If nothing is visible or the list is empty,

-1

is returned.
Note that the returned cell may only be partially visible.

**Returns:** the index of the last visible cell
**See Also:** getFirstVisibleIndex()

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

- ensureIndexIsVisible

```java
public void ensureIndexIsVisible​(int index)
```

Scrolls the list within an enclosing viewport to make the specified
cell completely visible. This calls

scrollRectToVisible

with
the bounds of the specified cell. For this method to work, the

JList

must be within a

JViewport

.

If the given index is outside the list's range of cells, this method
results in nothing.

**Parameters:** index

- the index of the cell to make visible
**See Also:** JComponent.scrollRectToVisible(java.awt.Rectangle)

,

JComponent.getVisibleRect()

- setDragEnabled

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)
```

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
list's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the list's

ListUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
an item and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
list's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:** b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

,

getDragEnabled()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDragEnabled

```java
public boolean getDragEnabled()
```

Returns whether or not automatic drag handling is enabled.

**Returns:** the value of the

dragEnabled

property
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setDragEnabled(boolean)

- setDropMode

```java
public final void setDropMode​(
DropMode
dropMode)
```

Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility,
the default for this property is

DropMode.USE_SELECTION

.
Usage of one of the other modes is recommended, however, for an
improved user experience.

DropMode.ON

, for instance,
offers similar behavior of showing items as selected, but does so without
affecting the actual selection in the list.

JList

supports the following drop modes:

- DropMode.USE_SELECTION
- DropMode.ON
- DropMode.INSERT
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT

The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a

TransferHandler

that accepts drops.

**Parameters:** dropMode

- the drop mode to use
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the drop mode is unsupported
or

null
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** getDropMode()

,

getDropLocation()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDropMode

```java
public final
DropMode
getDropMode()
```

Returns the drop mode for this component.

**Returns:** the drop mode for this component
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

- getDropLocation

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public final
JList.DropLocation
getDropLocation()
```

Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
or

null

if no location is to currently be shown.

This method is not meant for querying the drop location
from a

TransferHandler

, as the drop location is only
set after the

TransferHandler

's

canImport

has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown.

When this property changes, a property change event with
name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.

By default, responsibility for listening for changes to this property
and indicating the drop location visually lies with the list's

ListUI

, which may paint it directly and/or install a cell
renderer to do so. Developers wishing to implement custom drop location
painting and/or replace the default cell renderer, may need to honor
this property.

**Returns:** the drop location
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

,

TransferHandler.canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)

- getNextMatch

```java
public int getNextMatch​(
String
prefix,
int startIndex,

Position.Bias
bias)
```

Returns the next list element whose

toString

value
starts with the given prefix.

**Parameters:** prefix

- the string to test for a match
**Parameters:** startIndex

- the index for starting the search
**Parameters:** bias

- the search direction, either
Position.Bias.Forward or Position.Bias.Backward.
**Returns:** the index of the next list element that
starts with the prefix; otherwise

-1
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if prefix is

null

or startIndex is out of bounds
**Since:** 1.4

- getToolTipText

```java
public
String
getToolTipText​(
MouseEvent
event)
```

Returns the tooltip text to be used for the given event. This overrides

JComponent

's

getToolTipText

to first check the cell
renderer component for the cell over which the event occurred, returning
its tooltip text, if any. This implementation allows you to specify
tooltip text on the cell level, by using

setToolTipText

on your
cell renderer component.

Note:

For

JList

to properly display the
tooltips of its renderers in this manner,

JList

must be a
registered component with the

ToolTipManager

. This registration
is done automatically in the constructor. However, if at a later point

JList

is unregistered, by way of a call to

setToolTipText(null)

, tips from the renderers will no longer display.

**Overrides:** getToolTipText

in class

JComponent
**Parameters:** event

- the

MouseEvent

to fetch the tooltip text for
**Returns:** a string containing the tooltip
**See Also:** JComponent.setToolTipText(java.lang.String)

,

JComponent.getToolTipText()

- locationToIndex

```java
public int locationToIndex​(
Point
location)
```

public
Rectangle
getCellBounds​(int index0,
int index1)
```

Returns the bounding rectangle, in the list's coordinate system,
for the range of cells specified by the two indices.
These indices can be supplied in any order.

If the smaller index is outside the list's range of cells, this method
returns

null

. If the smaller index is valid, but the larger
index is outside the list's range, the bounds of just the first index
is returned. Otherwise, the bounds of the valid range is returned.

This is a cover method that delegates to the method of the same name
in the list's

ListUI

. It returns

null

if the list has
no

ListUI

.

- setValueIsAdjusting

```java
public void setValueIsAdjusting​(boolean b)
```

Sets the selection model's

valueIsAdjusting

property. When

true

, upcoming changes to selection should be considered part
of a single change. This property is used internally and developers
typically need not call this method. For example, when the model is being
updated in response to a user drag, the value of the property is set
to

true

when the drag is initiated and set to

false

when the drag is finished. This allows listeners to update only
when a change has been finalized, rather than handling all of the
intermediate values.

You may want to use this directly if making a series of changes
that should be considered part of a single change.

This is a cover method that delegates to the method of the same name on
the list's selection model. See the documentation for

ListSelectionModel.setValueIsAdjusting(boolean)

```

Returns the smallest selected cell index;

the selection

when only
a single item is selected in the list. When multiple items are selected,
it is simply the smallest selected index. Returns

-1

if there is
no selection.

This method is a cover that delegates to

getMinSelectionIndex

.

**Returns:** the smallest selected cell index

,

addListSelectionListener(javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener)

- getSelectedValue

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound

```

Returns the value for the smallest selected cell index;

the selected value

when only a single item is selected in the
list. When multiple items are selected, it is simply the value for the
smallest selected index. Returns

null

if there is no selection.

This is a convenience method that simply returns the model value for

getMinSelectionIndex

.

**Returns:** the first selected value
**See Also:** getMinSelectionIndex()

,

getModel()

,

addListSelectionListener(javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListener)

- setSelectedValue

```java
public void setSelectedValue​(
Object
anObject,
boolean shouldScroll)
```

Selects the specified object from the list.
If the object passed is

null

, the selection is cleared.

**Parameters:** anObject

- the object to select
**Parameters:** shouldScroll

-

true

if the list should scroll to display
the selected object, if one exists; otherwise

false

- getPreferredScrollableViewportSize

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
Dimension
getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()
```

Computes the size of viewport needed to display

visibleRowCount

rows. The value returned by this method depends on the layout
orientation:

VERTICAL

:

This is trivial if both

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

have been set (either explicitly or by specifying a prototype cell value).
The width is simply the

fixedCellWidth

plus the list's horizontal
insets. The height is the

fixedCellHeight

multiplied by the

visibleRowCount

, plus the list's vertical insets.

If either

fixedCellWidth

or

fixedCellHeight

haven't been
specified, heuristics are used. If the model is empty, the width is
the

fixedCellWidth

, if greater than

0

, or a hard-coded
value of

256

. The height is the

fixedCellHeight

multiplied
by

visibleRowCount

, if

fixedCellHeight

is greater than

0

, otherwise it is a hard-coded value of

16

multiplied by

visibleRowCount

.

If the model isn't empty, the width is the preferred size's width,
typically the width of the widest list element. The height is the
height of the cell with index 0 multiplied by the

visibleRowCount

,
plus the list's vertical insets.

VERTICAL_WRAP

or

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

:

This method simply returns the value from

getPreferredSize

.
The list's

ListUI

is expected to override

getPreferredSize

to return an appropriate value.

**Specified by:** getPreferredScrollableViewportSize

**Returns:** a dimension containing the size of the viewport needed
to display

visibleRowCount

rows
**See Also:** getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()

- getScrollableUnitIncrement

```java
public int getScrollableUnitIncrement​(
Rectangle
visibleRect,
int orientation,

```

Returns the distance to scroll to expose the next or previous
row (for vertical scrolling) or column (for horizontal scrolling).

For horizontal scrolling, if the layout orientation is

VERTICAL

,
then the list's font size is returned (or

1

if the font is

null

).

For vertical scrolling, the following rules are used:

- if scrolling down, returns the distance to scroll so that the last
visible element becomes the first completely visible element

if scrolling up, returns the distance to scroll so that the first
visible element becomes the last completely visible element

returns

visibleRect.height

if the list is empty

For horizontal scrolling, when the layout orientation is either

VERTICAL_WRAP

or

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

:

- if scrolling right, returns the distance to scroll so that the
last visible element becomes
the first completely visible element

if scrolling left, returns the distance to scroll so that the first
visible element becomes the last completely visible element

returns

visibleRect.width

if the list is empty

For horizontal scrolling and

VERTICAL

orientation,
returns

visibleRect.width

.

Note that the value of

visibleRect

must be the equal to

ensureIndexIsVisible

```java
public void ensureIndexIsVisible​(int index)
```

Scrolls the list within an enclosing viewport to make the specified
cell completely visible. This calls

scrollRectToVisible

with
the bounds of the specified cell. For this method to work, the

JList

must be within a

JViewport

.

If the given index is outside the list's range of cells, this method
results in nothing.

**Parameters:** index

setDragEnabled

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description

public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)
```

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
list's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the list's

ListUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
an item and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
list's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:** b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling
**Throws:** HeadlessException

getPreferredScrollableViewportSize

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
Dimension
getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()
```

Computes the size of viewport needed to display

visibleRowCount

rows. The value returned by this method depends on the layout
orientation:

VERTICAL

:

This is trivial if both

fixedCellWidth

and

fixedCellHeight

have been set (either explicitly or by specifying a prototype cell value).
The width is simply the

fixedCellWidth

plus the list's horizontal
insets. The height is the

fixedCellHeight

multiplied by the

visibleRowCount

, plus the list's vertical insets.

If either

fixedCellWidth

or

fixedCellHeight

haven't been
specified, heuristics are used. If the model is empty, the width is
the

fixedCellWidth

, if greater than

0

, or a hard-coded
value of

256

. The height is the

fixedCellHeight

multiplied
by

visibleRowCount

, if

fixedCellHeight

is greater than

0

, otherwise it is a hard-coded value of

16

multiplied by

visibleRowCount

.

If the model isn't empty, the width is the preferred size's width,
typically the width of the widest list element. The height is the
height of the cell with index 0 multiplied by the

visibleRowCount

,
plus the list's vertical insets.

VERTICAL_WRAP

or

HORIZONTAL_WRAP

:

This method simply returns the value from

getPreferredSize

.
The list's

ListUI

is expected to override

getPreferredSize

to return an appropriate value.

**Specified by:** getPreferredScrollableViewportSize
