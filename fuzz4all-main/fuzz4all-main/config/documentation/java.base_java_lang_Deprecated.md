A program element annotated

@Deprecated

is one that programmers
are discouraged from using. An element may be deprecated for any of several
reasons, for example, its usage is likely to lead to errors; it may
be changed incompatibly or removed in a future version; it has been
superseded by a newer, usually preferable alternative; or it is obsolete.

Compilers issue warnings when a deprecated program element is used or
overridden in non-deprecated code. Use of the

@Deprecated

annotation on a local variable declaration or on a parameter declaration
or a package declaration has no effect on the warnings issued by a compiler.

When a module is deprecated, the use of that module in

requires

, but not in

exports

or

opens

clauses causes
a warning to be issued. A module being deprecated does

not

cause
warnings to be issued for uses of types within the module.

This annotation type has a string-valued element

since

. The value
of this element indicates the version in which the annotated program element
was first deprecated.

This annotation type has a boolean-valued element

forRemoval

.
A value of

true

indicates intent to remove the annotated program
element in a future version. A value of

false

indicates that use of
the annotated program element is discouraged, but at the time the program
element was annotated, there was no specific intent to remove it.

**API Note:** It is strongly recommended that the reason for deprecating a program element
be explained in the documentation, using the

@deprecated

javadoc tag. The documentation should also suggest and link to a
recommended replacement API, if applicable. A replacement API often
has subtly different semantics, so such issues should be discussed as
well.

It is recommended that a

since

value be provided with all newly
annotated program elements. Note that

since

cannot be mandatory,
as there are many existing annotations that lack this element value.

There is no defined order among annotation elements. As a matter of
style, the

since

element should be placed first.

The

@Deprecated

annotation should always be present if
the

@deprecated

javadoc tag is present, and vice-versa.
**Since:** 1.5
**See The Java™ Language Specification :** 9.6.4.6 @Deprecated
