# Class LookupOp

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\LookupOp.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
LookupOp

extends
Object

implements
BufferedImageOp
,
RasterOp
```

This class implements a lookup operation from the source
to the destination. The LookupTable object may contain a single array
or multiple arrays, subject to the restrictions below.

For Rasters, the lookup operates on bands. The number of
lookup arrays may be one, in which case the same array is
applied to all bands, or it must equal the number of Source
Raster bands.

For BufferedImages, the lookup operates on color and alpha components.
The number of lookup arrays may be one, in which case the
same array is applied to all color (but not alpha) components.
Otherwise, the number of lookup arrays may
equal the number of Source color components, in which case no
lookup of the alpha component (if present) is performed.
If neither of these cases apply, the number of lookup arrays
must equal the number of Source color components plus alpha components,
in which case lookup is performed for all color and alpha components.
This allows non-uniform rescaling of multi-band BufferedImages.

BufferedImage sources with premultiplied alpha data are treated in the same
manner as non-premultiplied images for purposes of the lookup. That is,
the lookup is done per band on the raw data of the BufferedImage source
without regard to whether the data is premultiplied. If a color conversion
is required to the destination ColorModel, the premultiplied state of
both source and destination will be taken into account for this step.

Images with an IndexColorModel cannot be used.

If a RenderingHints object is specified in the constructor, the
color rendering hint and the dithering hint may be used when color
conversion is required.

This class allows the Source to be the same as the Destination.

**Parameters:** destCM

- the destination's

ColorModel

, which
can be

null

.

```java
public final
Point2D
getPoint2D​(
Point2D
srcPt,

Point2D

filter

```java
public final
BufferedImage
filter​(
BufferedImage
src,

BufferedImage
dst)
```

Performs a lookup operation on a

BufferedImage

.
If the color model in the source image is not the same as that
in the destination image, the pixels will be converted
in the destination. If the destination image is

null

,
a

BufferedImage

will be created with an appropriate

ColorModel

. An

IllegalArgumentException

might be thrown if the number of arrays in the

LookupTable

does not meet the restrictions
stated in the class comment above, or if the source image
has an

IndexColorModel

.

**Specified by:** filter

in interface

BufferedImageOp
**Parameters:** src

- the

BufferedImage

to be filtered
**Parameters:** dst

- the

BufferedImage

in which to
store the results of the filter operation
**Returns:** the filtered

BufferedImage

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the number of arrays in the

LookupTable

does not meet the restrictions
described in the class comments, or if the source image
has an

IndexColorModel

.
