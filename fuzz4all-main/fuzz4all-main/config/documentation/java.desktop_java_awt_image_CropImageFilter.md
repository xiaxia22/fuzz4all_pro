# Class CropImageFilter

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\CropImageFilter.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
CropImageFilter

extends
ImageFilter
```

An ImageFilter class for cropping images.
This class extends the basic ImageFilter Class to extract a given
rectangular region of an existing Image and provide a source for a
new image containing just the extracted region. It is meant to
be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource object to produce
cropped versions of existing images.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** ImageConsumer

,

Cloneable

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public CropImageFilter​(int x,
int y,
int w,
int h)

Constructs a CropImageFilter that extracts the absolute rectangular
region of pixels from its source Image as specified by the x, y,
w, and h parameters.

**Parameters:**
- x

- the x location of the top of the rectangle to be extracted
- y

- the y location of the top of the rectangle to be extracted
- w

- the width of the rectangle to be extracted
- h

- the height of the rectangle to be extracted

---

### Method Details

#### public void setProperties​(
Hashtable
<?,​?> props)

Passes along the properties from the source object after adding a
property indicating the cropped region.
This method invokes

super.setProperties

,
which might result in additional properties being added.

Note: This method is intended to be called by the

ImageProducer

of the

Image

whose pixels
are being filtered. Developers using
this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
this method directly since that operation could interfere
with the filtering operation.

**Parameters:**
- props

- the properties from the source object

---

#### public void setDimensions​(int w,
int h)

Override the source image's dimensions and pass the dimensions
of the rectangular cropped region to the ImageConsumer.

Note: This method is intended to be called by the

ImageProducer

of the

be extracted and passes through only that subset of pixels that
appear in the output region.

Note: This method is intended to be called by the

ImageProducer

of the

Image

whose
pixels are being filtered. Developers using
this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
this method directly since that operation could interfere
with the filtering operation.

**Specified by:**
- setPixels

in interface

ImageConsumer

**Overrides:**
- setPixels

in class

ImageFilter

**Parameters:**
- x

ColorModel
- pixels

- the array of pixels
- off

- the offset into the

pixels

array
- scansize

- the distance from one row of pixels to the next in
the

pixels

array

int h,

ColorModel
model,
int[] pixels,
int off,
int scansize)

Determine if the delivered int pixels intersect the region to
be extracted and pass through only that subset of pixels that
appear in the output region.

Note: This method is intended to be called by the

ImageProducer

of the

Image

whose
pixels are being filtered. Developers using
this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
this method directly since that operation could interfere
with the filtering operation.

**Specified by:**

**Parameters:**
- x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
area of pixels to be set
- y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
area of pixels to be set
- w
