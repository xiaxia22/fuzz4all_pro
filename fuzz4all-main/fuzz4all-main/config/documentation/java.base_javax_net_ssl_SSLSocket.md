# Class SSLSocket

**Source:** `java.base\javax\net\ssl\SSLSocket.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
SSLSocket

extends
Socket
```

This class extends

Socket

and provides secure
sockets using protocols such as the "Secure
Sockets Layer" (SSL) or IETF "Transport Layer Security" (TLS) protocols.

Such sockets are normal stream sockets, but they
add a layer of security protections over the underlying network transport
protocol, such as TCP. Those protections include:

- Integrity Protection

. SSL protects against
modification of messages by an active wiretapper.

Authentication

. In most modes, SSL provides
peer authentication. Servers are usually authenticated,
and clients may be authenticated as requested by servers.

Confidentiality (Privacy Protection)

. In most
modes, SSL encrypts data being sent between client and server.
This protects the confidentiality of data, so that passive
wiretappers won't see sensitive data such as financial
information or personal information of many kinds.

These kinds of protection are specified by a "cipher suite", which
is a combination of cryptographic algorithms used by a given SSL connection.
During the negotiation process, the two endpoints must agree on
a ciphersuite that is available in both environments.
If there is no such suite in common, no SSL connection can
be established, and no data can be exchanged.

The cipher suite used is established by a negotiation process
called "handshaking". The goal of this
process is to create or rejoin a "session", which may protect many
connections over time. After handshaking has completed, you can access
session attributes by using the

getSession

method.
The initial handshake on this connection can be initiated in
one of three ways:

- calling

startHandshake

which explicitly
begins handshakes, or

any attempt to read or write application data on
this socket causes an implicit handshake, or

a call to

getSession

tries to set up a session
if there is no currently valid session, and
an implicit handshake is done.

If handshaking fails for any reason, the

SSLSocket

is closed, and no further communications can be done.

There are two groups of cipher suites which you will need to know
about when managing cipher suites:

- Supported

cipher suites: all the suites which are
supported by the SSL implementation. This list is reported
using

getSupportedCipherSuites

.

Enabled

cipher suites, which may be fewer
than the full set of supported suites. This group is
set using the

setEnabledCipherSuites

method, and
queried using the

getEnabledCipherSuites

method.
Initially, a default set of cipher suites will be enabled on
a new socket that represents the minimum suggested configuration.

Implementation defaults require that only cipher
suites which authenticate servers and provide confidentiality
be enabled by default.
Only if both sides explicitly agree to unauthenticated and/or
non-private (unencrypted) communications will such a ciphersuite be
selected.

When an

SSLSocket

is first created, no handshaking
is done so that applications may first set their communication
preferences: what cipher suites to use, whether the socket should be
in client or server mode, etc.
However, security is always provided by the time that application data
is sent over the connection.

You may register to receive event notification of handshake
completion. This involves
the use of two additional classes.

HandshakeCompletedEvent

objects are passed to

HandshakeCompletedListener

instances,
which are registered by users of this API.

An

SSLSocket

is created by

SSLSocketFactory

,
or by

accept

ing a connection from a

SSLServerSocket

.

A SSL socket must choose to operate in the client or server mode.
This will determine who begins the handshaking process, as well
as which messages should be sent by each party. Each
connection must have one client and one server, or handshaking
will not progress properly. Once the initial handshaking has started, a
socket can not switch between client and server modes, even when
performing renegotiations.

### Method Details

#### public abstract
String
[] getSupportedCipherSuites()

Returns the names of the cipher suites which could be enabled for use
on this connection. Normally, only a subset of these will actually
be enabled by default, since this list may include cipher suites which
do not meet quality of service requirements for those defaults. Such
cipher suites might be useful in specialized applications.

The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
cipher suite names in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation, and may also
include other cipher suites that the provider supports.

**Returns:**
- an array of cipher suite names

**See Also:**
- getEnabledCipherSuites()

,

setEnabledCipherSuites(String [])

---

#### public abstract
String
[] getEnabledCipherSuites()

Returns the names of the SSL cipher suites which are currently
enabled for use on this connection. When an SSLSocket is first
created, all enabled cipher suites support a minimum quality of
service. Thus, in some environments this value might be empty.

Note that even if a suite is enabled, it may never be used. This
can occur if the peer does not support it, or its use is restricted,
or the requisite certificates (and private keys) for the suite are
not available, or an anonymous suite is enabled but authentication
is required.

The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
cipher suite names in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation, and may also
include other cipher suites that the provider supports.

**Returns:**
- an array of cipher suite names

**See Also:**
- getSupportedCipherSuites()

,

setEnabledCipherSuites(String [])

---

#### public abstract void setEnabledCipherSuites​(
String
[] suites)

Sets the cipher suites enabled for use on this connection.

Each cipher suite in the

suites

parameter must have
been listed by getSupportedCipherSuites(), or the method will
fail. Following a successful call to this method, only suites
listed in the

suites

parameter are enabled for use.

Note that the standard list of cipher suite names may be found in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation. Providers
may support cipher suite names not found in this list or might not
use the recommended name for a certain cipher suite.

See

getEnabledCipherSuites()

for more information
on why a specific ciphersuite may never be used on a connection.

**Parameters:**
- suites

- Names of all the cipher suites to enable

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- when one or more of the ciphers
named by the parameter is not supported, or when the
parameter is null.

**See Also:**
- getSupportedCipherSuites()

,

getEnabledCipherSuites()

---

#### public abstract
String
[] getSupportedProtocols()

Returns the names of the protocols which could be enabled for use
on an SSL connection.

**Returns:**
- an array of protocols supported

---

#### public abstract
String
[] getEnabledProtocols()

Returns the names of the protocol versions which are currently
enabled for use on this connection.

Note that even if a protocol is enabled, it may never be used.
This can occur if the peer does not support the protocol, or its
use is restricted, or there are no enabled cipher suites supported
by the protocol.

**Returns:**
- an array of protocols

**See Also:**
- setEnabledProtocols(String [])

---

#### public abstract void setEnabledProtocols​(
String
[] protocols)

Sets the protocol versions enabled for use on this connection.

The protocols must have been listed by

getSupportedProtocols()

as being supported.
Following a successful call to this method, only protocols listed
in the

protocols

parameter are enabled for use.

**Parameters:**
- protocols

- Names of all the protocols to enable.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- when one or more of
the protocols named by the parameter is not supported or
when the protocols parameter is null.

**See Also:**
- getEnabledProtocols()

---

#### public abstract
SSLSession
getSession()

Returns the SSL Session in use by this connection. These can
be long lived, and frequently correspond to an entire login session
for some user. The session specifies a particular cipher suite
which is being actively used by all connections in that session,
as well as the identities of the session's client and server.

This method will initiate the initial handshake if
necessary and then block until the handshake has been
established.

If an error occurs during the initial handshake, this method
returns an invalid session object which reports an invalid
cipher suite of "SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL".

**Returns:**
- the

SSLSession

---

#### public
SSLSession
getHandshakeSession()

Returns the

SSLSession

being constructed during a SSL/TLS
handshake.

TLS protocols may negotiate parameters that are needed when using
an instance of this class, but before the

SSLSession

has
been completely initialized and made available via

getSession

.
For example, the list of valid signature algorithms may restrict
the type of certificates that can be used during TrustManager
decisions, or the maximum TLS fragment packet sizes can be
resized to better support the network environment.

This method provides early access to the

SSLSession

being
constructed. Depending on how far the handshake has progressed,
some data may not yet be available for use. For example, if a
remote server will be sending a Certificate chain, but that chain
has yet not been processed, the

getPeerCertificates

method of

SSLSession

will throw a
SSLPeerUnverifiedException. Once that chain has been processed,

getPeerCertificates

will return the proper value.

Unlike

getSession()

, this method does not initiate the
initial handshake and does not block until handshaking is
complete.

**Returns:**
- null if this instance is not currently handshaking, or
if the current handshake has not progressed far enough to
create a basic SSLSession. Otherwise, this method returns the

SSLSession

currently being negotiated.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.

#### public abstract void addHandshakeCompletedListener​(
HandshakeCompletedListener
listener)

Registers an event listener to receive notifications that an
SSL handshake has completed on this connection.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- the HandShake Completed event listener

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the argument is null.

**See Also:**
- startHandshake()

,

removeHandshakeCompletedListener(HandshakeCompletedListener)

---

#### public abstract void removeHandshakeCompletedListener​(
HandshakeCompletedListener
listener)

Removes a previously registered handshake completion listener.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- the HandShake Completed event listener

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the listener is not registered,
or the argument is null.

**See Also:**
- addHandshakeCompletedListener(HandshakeCompletedListener)

---

#### public abstract void startHandshake()
throws
IOException

Starts an SSL handshake on this connection. Common reasons include
a need to use new encryption keys, to change cipher suites, or to
initiate a new session. To force complete reauthentication, the
current session could be invalidated before starting this handshake.

If data has already been sent on the connection, it continues
to flow during this handshake. When the handshake completes, this
will be signaled with an event.

This method is synchronous for the initial handshake on a connection
and returns when the negotiated handshake is complete. Some
protocols may not support multiple handshakes on an existing socket
and may throw an IOException.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- on a network level error

**See Also:**
- addHandshakeCompletedListener(HandshakeCompletedListener)

---

#### public abstract void setUseClientMode​(boolean mode)

Configures the socket to use client (or server) mode when
handshaking.

This method must be called before any handshaking occurs.
Once handshaking has begun, the mode can not be reset for the
life of this socket.

Servers normally authenticate themselves, and clients
are not required to do so.

**Parameters:**
- mode

- true if the socket should start its handshaking
in "client" mode

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if a mode change is attempted
after the initial handshake has begun.

**See Also:**
- getUseClientMode()

---

#### public abstract boolean getUseClientMode()

Returns true if the socket is set to use client mode when
handshaking.

**Returns:**
- true if the socket should do handshaking
in "client" mode

**See Also:**
- setUseClientMode(boolean)

---

#### public abstract void setNeedClientAuth​(boolean need)

Configures the socket to

require

client authentication. This
option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following:

- client authentication required

client authentication requested

no client authentication desired

Unlike

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

, if this option is set and
the client chooses not to provide authentication information
about itself,

the negotiations will stop and the connection
will be dropped

.

Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
this method or

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

.

**Parameters:**
- need

- set to true if client authentication is required,
or false if no client authentication is desired.

**See Also:**
- getNeedClientAuth()

,

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

,

getWantClientAuth()

,

setUseClientMode(boolean)

---

#### public abstract boolean getNeedClientAuth()

Returns true if the socket will

require

client authentication.
This option is only useful to sockets in the server mode.

---

#### public abstract void setWantClientAuth​(boolean want)

Configures the socket to

request

client authentication.
This option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following:

- client authentication required

client authentication requested

no client authentication desired

Unlike

setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

, if this option is set and
the client chooses not to provide authentication information
about itself,

the negotiations will continue

.

Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
this method or

setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

.

**Parameters:**
- want

- set to true if client authentication is requested,
or false if no client authentication is desired.

---

#### public abstract void setEnableSessionCreation​(boolean flag)

Controls whether new SSL sessions may be established by this socket.
If session creations are not allowed, and there are no
existing sessions to resume, there will be no successful
handshaking.

**Parameters:**

The ciphersuites and protocols of the returned SSLParameters
are always non-null.

**Returns:**
- the SSLParameters in effect for this SSLSocket.

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public void setSSLParameters​(
SSLParameters
params)

Applies SSLParameters to this socket.

This means:

- If

params.getCipherSuites()

is non-null,

setEnabledCipherSuites()

is called with that value.
- If

params.getProtocols()

is non-null,

setEnabledProtocols()

is called with that value.
- If

params.getNeedClientAuth()

or

params.getWantClientAuth()

return

true

,

setNeedClientAuth(true)

and

setWantClientAuth(true)

are called, respectively;
otherwise

setWantClientAuth(false)

is called.
- If

params.getServerNames()

is non-null, the socket will
configure its server names with that value.

,
a connection may be in the middle of a handshake. The
application protocol may or may not yet be available.

**Returns:**
- null if it has not yet been determined if application
protocols might be used for this handshake, an empty

String

if application protocols values will not
be used, or a non-empty application protocol

value for a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
The function overrides any values supplied using

SSLParameters.setApplicationProtocols

and it supports the following
type parameters:

For example, the following call registers a callback function that
examines the TLS handshake parameters and selects an application protocol
name:

```java
serverSocket.setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(

public abstract class
SSLSocket

extends
Socket
```

This class extends

Socket

and provides secure
sockets using protocols such as the "Secure
Sockets Layer" (SSL) or IETF "Transport Layer Security" (TLS) protocols.

Such sockets are normal stream sockets, but they
add a layer of security protections over the underlying network transport
protocol, such as TCP. Those protections include:

- Integrity Protection

. SSL protects against
modification of messages by an active wiretapper.

Authentication

. In most modes, SSL provides
peer authentication. Servers are usually authenticated,
and clients may be authenticated as requested by servers.

Confidentiality (Privacy Protection)

. In most
modes, SSL encrypts data being sent between client and server.
This protects the confidentiality of data, so that passive
wiretappers won't see sensitive data such as financial
information or personal information of many kinds.

These kinds of protection are specified by a "cipher suite", which
is a combination of cryptographic algorithms used by a given SSL connection.
During the negotiation process, the two endpoints must agree on
a ciphersuite that is available in both environments.
If there is no such suite in common, no SSL connection can
be established, and no data can be exchanged.

The cipher suite used is established by a negotiation process
called "handshaking". The goal of this
process is to create or rejoin a "session", which may protect many
connections over time. After handshaking has completed, you can access
session attributes by using the

getSession

method.
The initial handshake on this connection can be initiated in
one of three ways:

- calling

startHandshake

which explicitly
begins handshakes, or

any attempt to read or write application data on
this socket causes an implicit handshake, or

a call to

getSession

tries to set up a session
if there is no currently valid session, and
an implicit handshake is done.

If handshaking fails for any reason, the

SSLSocket

is closed, and no further communications can be done.

There are two groups of cipher suites which you will need to know
about when managing cipher suites:

- Supported

cipher suites: all the suites which are
supported by the SSL implementation. This list is reported
using

getSupportedCipherSuites

.

Enabled

cipher suites, which may be fewer
than the full set of supported suites. This group is
set using the

setEnabledCipherSuites

method, and
queried using the

getEnabledCipherSuites

method.
Initially, a default set of cipher suites will be enabled on
a new socket that represents the minimum suggested configuration.

Implementation defaults require that only cipher
suites which authenticate servers and provide confidentiality
be enabled by default.
Only if both sides explicitly agree to unauthenticated and/or
non-private (unencrypted) communications will such a ciphersuite be
selected.

When an

SSLSocket

is first created, no handshaking
is done so that applications may first set their communication
preferences: what cipher suites to use, whether the socket should be
in client or server mode, etc.
However, security is always provided by the time that application data
is sent over the connection.

You may register to receive event notification of handshake
completion. This involves
the use of two additional classes.

HandshakeCompletedEvent

objects are passed to

HandshakeCompletedListener

instances,
which are registered by users of this API.

An

SSLSocket

is created by

SSLSocketFactory

,
or by

accept

ing a connection from a

SSLServerSocket

.

A SSL socket must choose to operate in the client or server mode.
This will determine who begins the handshaking process, as well
as which messages should be sent by each party. Each
connection must have one client and one server, or handshaking
will not progress properly. Once the initial handshaking has started, a
socket can not switch between client and server modes, even when
performing renegotiations.

**API Note:** When the connection is no longer needed, the client and server
applications should each close both sides of their respective connection.
For

SSLSocket

objects, for example, an application can call

Socket.shutdownOutput()

or

OutputStream.close()

for output strean close and call

Socket.shutdownInput()

or

InputStream.close()

for input stream close. Note that
in some cases, closing the input stream may depend on the peer's output
stream being closed first. If the connection is not closed in an orderly
manner (for example

Socket.shutdownInput()

is called before the
peer's write closure notification has been received), exceptions may
be raised to indicate that an error has occurred. Once an

SSLSocket

is closed, it is not reusable: a new

SSLSocket

must be created.

modes, SSL encrypts data being sent between client and server.
This protects the confidentiality of data, so that passive
wiretappers won't see sensitive data such as financial
information or personal information of many kinds.

These kinds of protection are specified by a "cipher suite", which
is a combination of cryptographic algorithms used by a given SSL connection.
During the negotiation process, the two endpoints must agree on
a ciphersuite that is available in both environments.
If there is no such suite in common, no SSL connection can
be established, and no data can be exchanged.

The cipher suite used is established by a negotiation process
called "handshaking". The goal of this
process is to create or rejoin a "session", which may protect many
connections over time. After handshaking has completed, you can access
session attributes by using the

getSession

method.
The initial handshake on this connection can be initiated in
one of three ways:

- calling

startHandshake

which explicitly
begins handshakes, or

any attempt to read or write application data on
this socket causes an implicit handshake, or

a call to

getSession

tries to set up a session
if there is no currently valid session, and
an implicit handshake is done.

If handshaking fails for any reason, the

SSLSocket

is closed, and no further communications can be done.

There are two groups of cipher suites which you will need to know
about when managing cipher suites:

- Supported

cipher suites: all the suites which are
supported by the SSL implementation. This list is reported
using

getSupportedCipherSuites

.

Enabled

cipher suites, which may be fewer
than the full set of supported suites. This group is
set using the

setEnabledCipherSuites

method, and
queried using the

getEnabledCipherSuites

method.
Initially, a default set of cipher suites will be enabled on
a new socket that represents the minimum suggested configuration.

Implementation defaults require that only cipher
suites which authenticate servers and provide confidentiality
be enabled by default.
Only if both sides explicitly agree to unauthenticated and/or
non-private (unencrypted) communications will such a ciphersuite be
selected.

When an

SSLSocket

is first created, no handshaking
is done so that applications may first set their communication
preferences: what cipher suites to use, whether the socket should be
in client or server mode, etc.
However, security is always provided by the time that application data
is sent over the connection.

You may register to receive event notification of handshake
completion. This involves
the use of two additional classes.

HandshakeCompletedEvent

objects are passed to

HandshakeCompletedListener

instances,
which are registered by users of this API.

An

SSLSocket

is created by

SSLSocketFactory

,
or by

accept

ing a connection from a

SSLServerSocket

.

A SSL socket must choose to operate in the client or server mode.
This will determine who begins the handshaking process, as well
as which messages should be sent by each party. Each
connection must have one client and one server, or handshaking
will not progress properly. Once the initial handshaking has started, a
socket can not switch between client and server modes, even when
performing renegotiations.

Such sockets are normal stream sockets, but they
add a layer of security protections over the underlying network transport
protocol, such as TCP. Those protections include:

- Integrity Protection

. SSL protects against
modification of messages by an active wiretapper.

Authentication

. In most modes, SSL provides
peer authentication. Servers are usually authenticated,
and clients may be authenticated as requested by servers.

Confidentiality (Privacy Protection)

. In most
modes, SSL encrypts data being sent between client and server.
This protects the confidentiality of data, so that passive
wiretappers won't see sensitive data such as financial
information or personal information of many kinds.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getSupportedCipherSuites

```java
public abstract
String
[] getSupportedCipherSuites()
```

Returns the names of the cipher suites which could be enabled for use
on this connection. Normally, only a subset of these will actually
be enabled by default, since this list may include cipher suites which
do not meet quality of service requirements for those defaults. Such
cipher suites might be useful in specialized applications.

The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
cipher suite names in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation, and may also
include other cipher suites that the provider supports.

**Returns:** an array of cipher suite names
**See Also:** getEnabledCipherSuites()

,

setEnabledCipherSuites(String [])

- getEnabledCipherSuites

```java
public abstract
String
[] getEnabledCipherSuites()
```

Returns the names of the SSL cipher suites which are currently
enabled for use on this connection. When an SSLSocket is first
created, all enabled cipher suites support a minimum quality of
service. Thus, in some environments this value might be empty.

Note that even if a suite is enabled, it may never be used. This
can occur if the peer does not support it, or its use is restricted,
or the requisite certificates (and private keys) for the suite are
not available, or an anonymous suite is enabled but authentication
is required.

The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
cipher suite names in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation, and may also
include other cipher suites that the provider supports.

**Returns:** an array of cipher suite names
**See Also:** getSupportedCipherSuites()

,

setEnabledCipherSuites(String [])

- setEnabledCipherSuites

```java
public abstract void setEnabledCipherSuites​(
String
[] suites)
```

Sets the cipher suites enabled for use on this connection.

Each cipher suite in the

suites

parameter must have
been listed by getSupportedCipherSuites(), or the method will
fail. Following a successful call to this method, only suites
listed in the

suites

parameter are enabled for use.

Note that the standard list of cipher suite names may be found in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation. Providers
may support cipher suite names not found in this list or might not
use the recommended name for a certain cipher suite.

See

getEnabledCipherSuites()

for more information
on why a specific ciphersuite may never be used on a connection.

**Parameters:** suites

- Names of all the cipher suites to enable
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- when one or more of the ciphers
named by the parameter is not supported, or when the
parameter is null.
**See Also:** getSupportedCipherSuites()

,

getEnabledCipherSuites()

- getSupportedProtocols

```java
public abstract
String
[] getSupportedProtocols()
```

Returns the names of the protocols which could be enabled for use
on an SSL connection.

**Returns:** an array of protocols supported

- getEnabledProtocols

```java
public abstract
String
[] getEnabledProtocols()
```

Returns the names of the protocol versions which are currently
enabled for use on this connection.

Note that even if a protocol is enabled, it may never be used.
This can occur if the peer does not support the protocol, or its
use is restricted, or there are no enabled cipher suites supported
by the protocol.

**Returns:** an array of protocols
**See Also:** setEnabledProtocols(String [])

- setEnabledProtocols

```java
public abstract void setEnabledProtocols​(
String
[] protocols)
```

Sets the protocol versions enabled for use on this connection.

The protocols must have been listed by

getSupportedProtocols()

as being supported.
Following a successful call to this method, only protocols listed
in the

protocols

parameter are enabled for use.

**Parameters:** protocols

- Names of all the protocols to enable.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- when one or more of
the protocols named by the parameter is not supported or
when the protocols parameter is null.
**See Also:** getEnabledProtocols()

- getSession

```java
public abstract
SSLSession
getSession()
```

Returns the SSL Session in use by this connection. These can
be long lived, and frequently correspond to an entire login session
for some user. The session specifies a particular cipher suite
which is being actively used by all connections in that session,
as well as the identities of the session's client and server.

This method will initiate the initial handshake if
necessary and then block until the handshake has been
established.

If an error occurs during the initial handshake, this method
returns an invalid session object which reports an invalid
cipher suite of "SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL".

**Returns:** the

SSLSession

- getHandshakeSession

```java
public
SSLSession
getHandshakeSession()
```

Returns the

SSLSession

being constructed during a SSL/TLS
handshake.

TLS protocols may negotiate parameters that are needed when using
an instance of this class, but before the

SSLSession

has
been completely initialized and made available via

getSession

.
For example, the list of valid signature algorithms may restrict
the type of certificates that can be used during TrustManager
decisions, or the maximum TLS fragment packet sizes can be
resized to better support the network environment.

This method provides early access to the

SSLSession

being
constructed. Depending on how far the handshake has progressed,
some data may not yet be available for use. For example, if a
remote server will be sending a Certificate chain, but that chain
has yet not been processed, the

getPeerCertificates

method of

SSLSession

will throw a
SSLPeerUnverifiedException. Once that chain has been processed,

getPeerCertificates

will return the proper value.

Unlike

getSession()

, this method does not initiate the
initial handshake and does not block until handshaking is
complete.

**Returns:** null if this instance is not currently handshaking, or
if the current handshake has not progressed far enough to
create a basic SSLSession. Otherwise, this method returns the

SSLSession

currently being negotiated.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.

- addHandshakeCompletedListener

```java
public abstract void addHandshakeCompletedListener​(
HandshakeCompletedListener
listener)
```

Registers an event listener to receive notifications that an
SSL handshake has completed on this connection.

**Parameters:** listener

- the HandShake Completed event listener
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the argument is null.
**See Also:** startHandshake()

,

removeHandshakeCompletedListener(HandshakeCompletedListener)

- removeHandshakeCompletedListener

```java
public abstract void removeHandshakeCompletedListener​(
HandshakeCompletedListener
listener)
```

Removes a previously registered handshake completion listener.

**Parameters:** listener

- the HandShake Completed event listener
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the listener is not registered,
or the argument is null.
**See Also:** addHandshakeCompletedListener(HandshakeCompletedListener)

- startHandshake

```java
public abstract void startHandshake()
throws
IOException
```

Starts an SSL handshake on this connection. Common reasons include
a need to use new encryption keys, to change cipher suites, or to
initiate a new session. To force complete reauthentication, the
current session could be invalidated before starting this handshake.

If data has already been sent on the connection, it continues
to flow during this handshake. When the handshake completes, this
will be signaled with an event.

This method is synchronous for the initial handshake on a connection
and returns when the negotiated handshake is complete. Some
protocols may not support multiple handshakes on an existing socket
and may throw an IOException.

**Throws:** IOException

- on a network level error
**See Also:** addHandshakeCompletedListener(HandshakeCompletedListener)

- setUseClientMode

```java
public abstract void setUseClientMode​(boolean mode)
```

Configures the socket to use client (or server) mode when
handshaking.

This method must be called before any handshaking occurs.
Once handshaking has begun, the mode can not be reset for the
life of this socket.

Servers normally authenticate themselves, and clients
are not required to do so.

**Parameters:** mode

- true if the socket should start its handshaking
in "client" mode
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a mode change is attempted
after the initial handshake has begun.
**See Also:** getUseClientMode()

- getUseClientMode

```java
public abstract boolean getUseClientMode()
```

Returns true if the socket is set to use client mode when
handshaking.

**Returns:** true if the socket should do handshaking
in "client" mode
**See Also:** setUseClientMode(boolean)

- setNeedClientAuth

```java
public abstract void setNeedClientAuth​(boolean need)
```

Configures the socket to

require

client authentication. This
option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following:

- client authentication required

client authentication requested

no client authentication desired

Unlike

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

, if this option is set and
the client chooses not to provide authentication information
about itself,

the negotiations will stop and the connection
will be dropped

.

Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
this method or

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

.

**Parameters:** need

- set to true if client authentication is required,
or false if no client authentication is desired.
**See Also:** getNeedClientAuth()

,

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

,

getWantClientAuth()

,

setUseClientMode(boolean)

- getNeedClientAuth

```java
public abstract boolean getNeedClientAuth()
```

Returns true if the socket will

require

client authentication.
This option is only useful to sockets in the server mode.

**Returns:** true if client authentication is required,
or false if no client authentication is desired.
**See Also:** setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

,

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

,

getWantClientAuth()

,

setUseClientMode(boolean)

- setWantClientAuth

```java
public abstract void setWantClientAuth​(boolean want)
```

Configures the socket to

request

client authentication.
This option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following:

- client authentication required

client authentication requested

no client authentication desired

Unlike

setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

, if this option is set and
the client chooses not to provide authentication information
about itself,

the negotiations will continue

.

Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
this method or

setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

.

**Parameters:** want

- set to true if client authentication is requested,
or false if no client authentication is desired.
**See Also:** getWantClientAuth()

,

setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

,

getNeedClientAuth()

,

setUseClientMode(boolean)

- getWantClientAuth

```java
public abstract boolean getWantClientAuth()
```

Returns true if the socket will

request

client authentication.
This option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

**Returns:** true if client authentication is requested,
or false if no client authentication is desired.
**See Also:** setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

,

getNeedClientAuth()

,

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

,

setUseClientMode(boolean)

- setEnableSessionCreation

```java
public abstract void setEnableSessionCreation​(boolean flag)
```

Controls whether new SSL sessions may be established by this socket.
If session creations are not allowed, and there are no
existing sessions to resume, there will be no successful
handshaking.

**Parameters:** flag

- true indicates that sessions may be created; this
is the default. false indicates that an existing session
must be resumed
**See Also:** getEnableSessionCreation()

- getEnableSessionCreation

```java
public abstract boolean getEnableSessionCreation()
```

Returns true if new SSL sessions may be established by this socket.

**Returns:** true indicates that sessions may be created; this
is the default. false indicates that an existing session
must be resumed
**See Also:** setEnableSessionCreation(boolean)

- getSSLParameters

```java
public
SSLParameters
getSSLParameters()
```

Returns the SSLParameters in effect for this SSLSocket.
The ciphersuites and protocols of the returned SSLParameters
are always non-null.

**Returns:** the SSLParameters in effect for this SSLSocket.
**Since:** 1.6

- setSSLParameters

```java
public void setSSLParameters​(
SSLParameters
params)
```

Applies SSLParameters to this socket.

This means:

- If

params.getCipherSuites()

is non-null,

setEnabledCipherSuites()

is called with that value.
- If

params.getProtocols()

is non-null,

setEnabledProtocols()

is called with that value.
- If

params.getNeedClientAuth()

or

params.getWantClientAuth()

return

true

,

setNeedClientAuth(true)

and

setWantClientAuth(true)

are called, respectively;
otherwise

setWantClientAuth(false)

is called.
- If

params.getServerNames()

is non-null, the socket will
configure its server names with that value.
- If

params.getSNIMatchers()

is non-null, the socket will
configure its SNI matchers with that value.

**Parameters:** params

- the parameters
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the setEnabledCipherSuites() or
the setEnabledProtocols() call fails
**Since:** 1.6

- getApplicationProtocol

```java
public
String
getApplicationProtocol()
```

Returns the most recent application protocol value negotiated for this
connection.

If supported by the underlying SSL/TLS/DTLS implementation,
application name negotiation mechanisms such as

RFC 7301

, the
Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN), can negotiate
application-level values between peers.

**Implementation Requirements:** The implementation in this class throws

UnsupportedOperationException

and performs no other action.
**Returns:** null if it has not yet been determined if application
protocols might be used for this connection, an empty

String

if application protocols values will not
be used, or a non-empty application protocol

String

if a value was successfully negotiated.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.
**Since:** 9

- getHandshakeApplicationProtocol

```java
public
String
getHandshakeApplicationProtocol()
```

Returns the application protocol value negotiated on a SSL/TLS
handshake currently in progress.

Like

getHandshakeSession()

,
a connection may be in the middle of a handshake. The
application protocol may or may not yet be available.

**Implementation Requirements:** The implementation in this class throws

UnsupportedOperationException

and performs no other action.
**Returns:** null if it has not yet been determined if application
protocols might be used for this handshake, an empty

String

if application protocols values will not
be used, or a non-empty application protocol

String

if a value was successfully negotiated.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.
**Since:** 9

- setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

```java
public void setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector​(
BiFunction
<
SSLSocket
,​
List
<
String
>,​
String
> selector)
```

Registers a callback function that selects an application protocol
value for a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
The function overrides any values supplied using

SSLParameters.setApplicationProtocols

and it supports the following
type parameters:

For example, the following call registers a callback function that
examines the TLS handshake parameters and selects an application protocol
name:

```java
serverSocket.setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(
(serverSocket, clientProtocols) -> {
SSLSession session = serverSocket.getHandshakeSession();
return chooseApplicationProtocol(
serverSocket,
clientProtocols,
session.getProtocol(),
session.getCipherSuite());
});
```

**API Note:** This method should be called by TLS server applications before the TLS
handshake begins. Also, this

SSLSocket

should be configured with
parameters that are compatible with the application protocol selected by
the callback function. For example, enabling a poor choice of cipher
suites could result in no suitable application protocol.
See

SSLParameters

.
**Implementation Requirements:** The implementation in this class throws

UnsupportedOperationException

and performs no other action.
**Parameters:** selector

- the callback function, or null to de-register.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.
**Since:** 9

- getHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

```java
public
BiFunction
<
SSLSocket
,​
List
<
String
>,​
String
> getHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector()
```

Retrieves the callback function that selects an application protocol
value during a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
See

setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

for the function's type parameters.

**Implementation Requirements:** The implementation in this class throws

UnsupportedOperationException

and performs no other action.
**Returns:** the callback function, or null if none has been set.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.
**Since:** 9

Method Detail

- getSupportedCipherSuites

```java
public abstract
String
[] getSupportedCipherSuites()
```

Returns the names of the cipher suites which could be enabled for use
on this connection. Normally, only a subset of these will actually
be enabled by default, since this list may include cipher suites which
do not meet quality of service requirements for those defaults. Such
cipher suites might be useful in specialized applications.

The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
cipher suite names in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation, and may also
include other cipher suites that the provider supports.

**Returns:** an array of cipher suite names
**See Also:** getEnabledCipherSuites()

,

setEnabledCipherSuites(String [])

- getEnabledCipherSuites

```java
public abstract
String
[] getEnabledCipherSuites()
```

Returns the names of the SSL cipher suites which are currently
enabled for use on this connection. When an SSLSocket is first
created, all enabled cipher suites support a minimum quality of
service. Thus, in some environments this value might be empty.

Note that even if a suite is enabled, it may never be used. This
can occur if the peer does not support it, or its use is restricted,
or the requisite certificates (and private keys) for the suite are
not available, or an anonymous suite is enabled but authentication
is required.

The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
cipher suite names in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation, and may also
include other cipher suites that the provider supports.

**Returns:** an array of cipher suite names
**See Also:** getSupportedCipherSuites()

,

setEnabledCipherSuites(String [])

- setEnabledCipherSuites

```java
public abstract void setEnabledCipherSuites​(
String
[] suites)
```

Sets the cipher suites enabled for use on this connection.

Each cipher suite in the

suites

parameter must have
been listed by getSupportedCipherSuites(), or the method will
fail. Following a successful call to this method, only suites
listed in the

suites

parameter are enabled for use.

Note that the standard list of cipher suite names may be found in the

JSSE Cipher Suite Names

section of the Java Cryptography
Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation. Providers
may support cipher suite names not found in this list or might not
use the recommended name for a certain cipher suite.

See

getEnabledCipherSuites()

for more information
on why a specific ciphersuite may never be used on a connection.

**Parameters:** suites

- Names of all the cipher suites to enable
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- when one or more of the ciphers
named by the parameter is not supported, or when the
parameter is null.
**See Also:** getSupportedCipherSuites()

,

getEnabledCipherSuites()

- getSupportedProtocols

```java
public abstract
String
[] getSupportedProtocols()
```

Returns the names of the protocols which could be enabled for use
on an SSL connection.

**Returns:** an array of protocols supported

- getEnabledProtocols

```java
public abstract
String
[] getEnabledProtocols()
```

Returns the names of the protocol versions which are currently
enabled for use on this connection.

Note that even if a protocol is enabled, it may never be used.
This can occur if the peer does not support the protocol, or its
use is restricted, or there are no enabled cipher suites supported
by the protocol.

**Returns:** an array of protocols
**See Also:** setEnabledProtocols(String [])

- setEnabledProtocols

```java
public abstract void setEnabledProtocols​(
String
[] protocols)
```

Sets the protocol versions enabled for use on this connection.

The protocols must have been listed by

getSupportedProtocols()

as being supported.
Following a successful call to this method, only protocols listed
in the

protocols

parameter are enabled for use.

**Parameters:** protocols

- Names of all the protocols to enable.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- when one or more of
the protocols named by the parameter is not supported or
when the protocols parameter is null.
**See Also:** getEnabledProtocols()

- getSession

```java
public abstract
SSLSession
getSession()
```

Returns the SSL Session in use by this connection. These can
be long lived, and frequently correspond to an entire login session
for some user. The session specifies a particular cipher suite
which is being actively used by all connections in that session,
as well as the identities of the session's client and server.

This method will initiate the initial handshake if
necessary and then block until the handshake has been
established.

If an error occurs during the initial handshake, this method
returns an invalid session object which reports an invalid
cipher suite of "SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL".

**Returns:** the

SSLSession

- getHandshakeSession

```java
public
SSLSession
getHandshakeSession()
```

Returns the

SSLSession

being constructed during a SSL/TLS
handshake.

TLS protocols may negotiate parameters that are needed when using
an instance of this class, but before the

SSLSession

has
been completely initialized and made available via

getSession

.
For example, the list of valid signature algorithms may restrict
the type of certificates that can be used during TrustManager
decisions, or the maximum TLS fragment packet sizes can be
resized to better support the network environment.

This method provides early access to the

SSLSession

being
constructed. Depending on how far the handshake has progressed,
some data may not yet be available for use. For example, if a
remote server will be sending a Certificate chain, but that chain
has yet not been processed, the

getPeerCertificates

method of

SSLSession

will throw a
SSLPeerUnverifiedException. Once that chain has been processed,

getPeerCertificates

will return the proper value.

Unlike

getSession()

, this method does not initiate the
initial handshake and does not block until handshaking is
complete.

**Returns:** null if this instance is not currently handshaking, or
if the current handshake has not progressed far enough to
create a basic SSLSession. Otherwise, this method returns the

SSLSession

currently being negotiated.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.

- addHandshakeCompletedListener

```java
public abstract void addHandshakeCompletedListener​(
HandshakeCompletedListener
listener)
```

Registers an event listener to receive notifications that an
SSL handshake has completed on this connection.

**Parameters:** listener

- the HandShake Completed event listener
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the argument is null.
**See Also:** startHandshake()

,

removeHandshakeCompletedListener(HandshakeCompletedListener)

- removeHandshakeCompletedListener

```java
public abstract void removeHandshakeCompletedListener​(
HandshakeCompletedListener
listener)
```

Removes a previously registered handshake completion listener.

**Parameters:** listener

- the HandShake Completed event listener
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the listener is not registered,
or the argument is null.
**See Also:** addHandshakeCompletedListener(HandshakeCompletedListener)

- startHandshake

```java
public abstract void startHandshake()
throws
IOException
```

Starts an SSL handshake on this connection. Common reasons include
a need to use new encryption keys, to change cipher suites, or to
initiate a new session. To force complete reauthentication, the
current session could be invalidated before starting this handshake.

If data has already been sent on the connection, it continues
to flow during this handshake. When the handshake completes, this
will be signaled with an event.

This method is synchronous for the initial handshake on a connection
and returns when the negotiated handshake is complete. Some
protocols may not support multiple handshakes on an existing socket
and may throw an IOException.

**Throws:** IOException

- on a network level error
**See Also:** addHandshakeCompletedListener(HandshakeCompletedListener)

- setUseClientMode

```java
public abstract void setUseClientMode​(boolean mode)
```

Configures the socket to use client (or server) mode when
handshaking.

This method must be called before any handshaking occurs.
Once handshaking has begun, the mode can not be reset for the
life of this socket.

Servers normally authenticate themselves, and clients
are not required to do so.

**Parameters:** mode

- true if the socket should start its handshaking
in "client" mode
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a mode change is attempted
after the initial handshake has begun.
**See Also:** getUseClientMode()

- getUseClientMode

```java
public abstract boolean getUseClientMode()
```

Returns true if the socket is set to use client mode when
handshaking.

**Returns:** true if the socket should do handshaking
in "client" mode
**See Also:** setUseClientMode(boolean)

- setNeedClientAuth

```java
public abstract void setNeedClientAuth​(boolean need)
```

Configures the socket to

require

client authentication. This
option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following:

- client authentication required

client authentication requested

no client authentication desired

Unlike

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

, if this option is set and
the client chooses not to provide authentication information
about itself,

the negotiations will stop and the connection
will be dropped

.

Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
this method or

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

.

**Parameters:** need

- set to true if client authentication is required,
or false if no client authentication is desired.
**See Also:** getNeedClientAuth()

,

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

,

getWantClientAuth()

,

setUseClientMode(boolean)

- getNeedClientAuth

```java
public abstract boolean getNeedClientAuth()
```

Returns true if the socket will

require

client authentication.
This option is only useful to sockets in the server mode.

**Returns:** true if client authentication is required,
or false if no client authentication is desired.

,

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

,

getWantClientAuth()

,

setUseClientMode(boolean)

- setWantClientAuth

```java
public abstract void setWantClientAuth​(boolean want)
```

Configures the socket to

request

client authentication.
This option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following:

- client authentication required

client authentication requested

no client authentication desired

Unlike

setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

, if this option is set and
the client chooses not to provide authentication information
about itself,

the negotiations will continue

.

Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
this method or

setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

.

**Parameters:** want

- set to true if client authentication is requested,
or false if no client authentication is desired.
**See Also:** getWantClientAuth()

,

setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

,

getNeedClientAuth()

,

setUseClientMode(boolean)

- getWantClientAuth

```java
public abstract boolean getWantClientAuth()
```

Returns true if the socket will

request

client authentication.
This option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

**Returns:** true if client authentication is requested,
or false if no client authentication is desired.
**See Also:** setNeedClientAuth(boolean)

,

getNeedClientAuth()

,

setWantClientAuth(boolean)

,

setUseClientMode(boolean)

- setEnableSessionCreation

```java
public abstract void setEnableSessionCreation​(boolean flag)
```

Controls whether new SSL sessions may be established by this socket.
If session creations are not allowed, and there are no
existing sessions to resume, there will be no successful
handshaking.

**Parameters:** flag

- true indicates that sessions may be created; this
is the default. false indicates that an existing session
must be resumed
**See Also:** getEnableSessionCreation()

- getEnableSessionCreation

```java
public abstract boolean getEnableSessionCreation()
```

Returns true if new SSL sessions may be established by this socket.

**Returns:** true indicates that sessions may be created; this
is the default. false indicates that an existing session
must be resumed
**See Also:** setEnableSessionCreation(boolean)

- getSSLParameters

```java
public
SSLParameters
getSSLParameters()
```

Returns the SSLParameters in effect for this SSLSocket.
The ciphersuites and protocols of the returned SSLParameters
are always non-null.

**Returns:** the SSLParameters in effect for this SSLSocket.
**Since:** 1.6

- setSSLParameters

```java
public void setSSLParameters​(
SSLParameters
params)
```

Applies SSLParameters to this socket.

This means:

- If

params.getCipherSuites()

is non-null,

setEnabledCipherSuites()

is called with that value.
- If

params.getProtocols()

is non-null,

setEnabledProtocols()

is called with that value.
- If

params.getNeedClientAuth()

or

params.getWantClientAuth()

return

true

,

setNeedClientAuth(true)

and

setWantClientAuth(true)

are called, respectively;
otherwise

setWantClientAuth(false)

is called.
- If

params.getServerNames()

is non-null, the socket will
configure its server names with that value.
- If

params.getSNIMatchers()

is non-null, the socket will
configure its SNI matchers with that value.

**Parameters:** params

- the parameters
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the setEnabledCipherSuites() or
the setEnabledProtocols() call fails
**Since:** 1.6

- getApplicationProtocol

```java
public
String
getApplicationProtocol()
```

Returns the most recent application protocol value negotiated for this
connection.

If supported by the underlying SSL/TLS/DTLS implementation,
application name negotiation mechanisms such as

RFC 7301

, the
Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN), can negotiate
application-level values between peers.

**Implementation Requirements:** The implementation in this class throws

UnsupportedOperationException

and performs no other action.
**Returns:** null if it has not yet been determined if application
protocols might be used for this connection, an empty

String

if application protocols values will not
be used, or a non-empty application protocol

String

if a value was successfully negotiated.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.
**Since:** 9

- getHandshakeApplicationProtocol

```java
public
String
getHandshakeApplicationProtocol()
```

Returns the application protocol value negotiated on a SSL/TLS
handshake currently in progress.

Like

getHandshakeSession()

,
a connection may be in the middle of a handshake. The
application protocol may or may not yet be available.

**Implementation Requirements:** The implementation in this class throws

UnsupportedOperationException

and performs no other action.
**Returns:** null if it has not yet been determined if application
protocols might be used for this handshake, an empty

String

if application protocols values will not
be used, or a non-empty application protocol

String

if a value was successfully negotiated.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.
**Since:** 9

- setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

```java
public void setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector​(
BiFunction
<
SSLSocket
,​
List
<
String
>,​
String
> selector)
```

Registers a callback function that selects an application protocol
value for a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
The function overrides any values supplied using

SSLParameters.setApplicationProtocols

and it supports the following
type parameters:

For example, the following call registers a callback function that
examines the TLS handshake parameters and selects an application protocol
name:

```java
serverSocket.setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(
(serverSocket, clientProtocols) -> {
SSLSession session = serverSocket.getHandshakeSession();
return chooseApplicationProtocol(
serverSocket,
clientProtocols,
session.getProtocol(),
session.getCipherSuite());
});
```

**API Note:** This method should be called by TLS server applications before the TLS
handshake begins. Also, this

SSLSocket

should be configured with
parameters that are compatible with the application protocol selected by
the callback function. For example, enabling a poor choice of cipher
suites could result in no suitable application protocol.
See

SSLParameters

.
**Implementation Requirements:** The implementation in this class throws

UnsupportedOperationException

and performs no other action.
**Parameters:** selector

- the callback function, or null to de-register.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.
**Since:** 9

- getHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

```java
public
BiFunction
<
SSLSocket
,​
List
<
String
>,​
String
> getHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector()
```

Retrieves the callback function that selects an application protocol
value during a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
See

setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

for the function's type parameters.

**Implementation Requirements:** The implementation in this class throws

UnsupportedOperationException

and performs no other action.
**Returns:** the callback function, or null if none has been set.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.
**Since:** 9

getHandshakeSession

```java

Returns the

SSLSession

being constructed during a SSL/TLS
handshake.

TLS protocols may negotiate parameters that are needed when using
an instance of this class, but before the

SSLSession

has
been completely initialized and made available via

getSession

.
For example, the list of valid signature algorithms may restrict
the type of certificates that can be used during TrustManager
decisions, or the maximum TLS fragment packet sizes can be
resized to better support the network environment.

This method provides early access to the

SSLSession

being
constructed. Depending on how far the handshake has progressed,
some data may not yet be available for use. For example, if a
remote server will be sending a Certificate chain, but that chain
has yet not been processed, the

getPeerCertificates

method of

SSLSession

will throw a
SSLPeerUnverifiedException. Once that chain has been processed,

getPeerCertificates

will return the proper value.

Unlike

getSession()

, this method does not initiate the
initial handshake and does not block until handshaking is
complete.

**Returns:** null if this instance is not currently handshaking, or
if the current handshake has not progressed far enough to
create a basic SSLSession. Otherwise, this method returns the

SSLSession

initiate a new session. To force complete reauthentication, the
current session could be invalidated before starting this handshake.

If data has already been sent on the connection, it continues
to flow during this handshake. When the handshake completes, this
will be signaled with an event.

This method is synchronous for the initial handshake on a connection
and returns when the negotiated handshake is complete. Some

setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

```java
public void setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector​(
BiFunction
<
SSLSocket
,​
List
<
String
>,​
String
> selector)
```

Registers a callback function that selects an application protocol
value for a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
The function overrides any values supplied using

SSLParameters.setApplicationProtocols

and it supports the following
type parameters:

For example, the following call registers a callback function that
examines the TLS handshake parameters and selects an application protocol
name:

```java
serverSocket.setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(
(serverSocket, clientProtocols) -> {
SSLSession session = serverSocket.getHandshakeSession();
return chooseApplicationProtocol(
serverSocket,
clientProtocols,
session.getProtocol(),
session.getCipherSuite());
});
```

**API Note:** This method should be called by TLS server applications before the TLS
handshake begins. Also, this

SSLSocket

should be configured with
parameters that are compatible with the application protocol selected by
the callback function. For example, enabling a poor choice of cipher
suites could result in no suitable application protocol.

SSLParameters.setApplicationProtocols

and it supports the following
type parameters:

For example, the following call registers a callback function that
examines the TLS handshake parameters and selects an application protocol
name:

```java
serverSocket.setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(
(serverSocket, clientProtocols) -> {
SSLSession session = serverSocket.getHandshakeSession();
return chooseApplicationProtocol(
serverSocket,
clientProtocols,
session.getProtocol(),
session.getCipherSuite());
});
```

serverSocket.setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(
(serverSocket, clientProtocols) -> {
SSLSession session = serverSocket.getHandshakeSession();
return chooseApplicationProtocol(
serverSocket,
clientProtocols,
session.getProtocol(),
session.getCipherSuite());
});

getHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

```java
public
BiFunction
<
SSLSocket
,​
List
<
String
>,​
String
> getHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector()
```

Retrieves the callback function that selects an application protocol
value during a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
See

setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

for the function's type parameters.

**Implementation Requirements:** The implementation in this class throws

UnsupportedOperationException

and performs no other action.
**Returns:** the callback function, or null if none has been set.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the underlying provider
does not implement the operation.
