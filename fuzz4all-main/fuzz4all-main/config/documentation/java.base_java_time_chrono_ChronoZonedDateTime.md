# Interface ChronoZonedDateTime<D extends ChronoLocalDate >

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\chrono\ChronoZonedDateTime.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ChronoZonedDateTime<D extends
ChronoLocalDate
>

extends
Temporal
,
Comparable
<
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?>>
```

A date-time with a time-zone in an arbitrary chronology,
intended for advanced globalization use cases.

Most applications should declare method signatures, fields and variables
as

ZonedDateTime

, not this interface.

A

ChronoZonedDateTime

is the abstract representation of an offset date-time
where the

Chronology chronology

, or calendar system, is pluggable.
The date-time is defined in terms of fields expressed by

TemporalField

,
where most common implementations are defined in

ChronoField

.
The chronology defines how the calendar system operates and the meaning of
the standard fields.

When to use this interface

The design of the API encourages the use of

ZonedDateTime

rather than this
interface, even in the case where the application needs to deal with multiple
calendar systems. The rationale for this is explored in detail in

ChronoLocalDate

.

Ensure that the discussion in

ChronoLocalDate

has been read and understood
before using this interface.

**Type Parameters:** D

- the concrete type for the date of this date-time

### Method Details

#### static
Comparator
<
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?>> timeLineOrder()

Gets a comparator that compares

ChronoZonedDateTime

in
time-line order ignoring the chronology.

This comparator differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying instant and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the position of the date-time on the instant time-line.
The underlying comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-second and nano-of-second.

**Returns:**
- a comparator that compares in time-line order ignoring the chronology

**See Also:**
- isAfter(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

,

isBefore(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

,

isEqual(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

---

#### static
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)

Obtains an instance of

ChronoZonedDateTime

from a temporal object.

This creates a zoned date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ChronoZonedDateTime

.

The conversion extracts and combines the chronology, date, time and zone
from the temporal object. The behavior is equivalent to using

Chronology.zonedDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

with the extracted chronology.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ChronoZonedDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null

**Returns:**
- the date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

ChronoZonedDateTime

**See Also:**
- Chronology.zonedDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

---

#### default
D
toLocalDate()

Gets the local date part of this date-time.

This returns a local date with the same year, month and day
as this date-time.

**Returns:**
- the date part of this date-time, not null

---

#### default
LocalTime
toLocalTime()

Gets the local time part of this date-time.

This returns a local time with the same hour, minute, second and
nanosecond as this date-time.

**Returns:**
- the time part of this date-time, not null

---

#### ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> toLocalDateTime()

Gets the local date-time part of this date-time.

This returns a local date with the same year, month and day
as this date-time.

**Returns:**
- the local date-time part of this date-time, not null

---

#### default
Chronology
getChronology()

Gets the chronology of this date-time.

The

Chronology

represents the calendar system in use.
The era and other fields in

ChronoField

are defined by the chronology.

**Returns:**
- the chronology, not null

---

#### ZoneOffset
getOffset()

Gets the zone offset, such as '+01:00'.

This is the offset of the local date-time from UTC/Greenwich.

**Returns:**
- the zone offset, not null

---

#### ZoneId
getZone()

Gets the zone ID, such as 'Europe/Paris'.

This returns the stored time-zone id used to determine the time-zone rules.

**Returns:**
- the zone ID, not null

---

#### ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
earlier of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the earlier of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Returns:**
- a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the earlier offset, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if no rules can be found for the zone
- DateTimeException

- if no rules are valid for this date-time

---

#### ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
later of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the later of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Returns:**
- a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the later offset, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if no rules can be found for the zone
- DateTimeException

- if no rules are valid for this date-time

---

#### ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withZoneSameLocal​(
ZoneId
zone)

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the local date-time if possible.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the local date-time.
The local date-time is only changed if it is invalid for the new zone.

To change the zone and adjust the local date-time,
use

withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null

**Returns:**
- a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null

---

#### ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withZoneSameInstant​(
ZoneId
zone)

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the instant.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the instant.
This normally results in a change to the local date-time.

This method is based on retaining the same instant, thus gaps and overlaps
in the local time-line have no effect on the result.

To change the offset while keeping the local time,
use

withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId)

.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null

**Returns:**
- a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

---

#### boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if the specified field can be queried on this date-time.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported fields is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoField

fields.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:**
- isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if the field can be queried, false if not

---

#### default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to or subtracted from this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported units is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoUnit

units except

FOREVER

.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:**
- isSupported

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- unit

- the unit to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

---

#### default
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to set in the result, not null
- newValue

- the new value of the field in the result

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> plus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:**
- plus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amount

- the amount to add, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the addition cannot be made
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:**
- plus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amountToAdd

- the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
- unit

- the unit of the amount to add, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be added
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> minus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:**
- minus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amount

- the amount to subtract, not null

**Returns:**

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)

Queries this date-time using the specified query.

This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

- the type of the result

---

#### default
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)

Formats this date-time using the specified formatter.

This date-time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

The default implementation must behave as follows:

```java
return formatter.format(this);
```

**Parameters:**
- formatter

- the formatter to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the formatted date-time string, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

---

#### default
Instant
toInstant()

Converts this date-time to an

Instant

.

This returns an

Instant

representing the same point on the
time-line as this date-time. The calculation combines the

local date-time

and

offset

.

**Returns:**
- an

Instant

representing the same instant, not null

---

#### default long toEpochSecond()

Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch
of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This uses the

local date-time

and

offset

to calculate the epoch-second value,
which is the number of elapsed seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier are negative.

**Returns:**
- the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

---

#### default int compareTo​(
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> other)

Compares this date-time to another date-time, including the chronology.

The comparison is based first on the instant, then on the local date-time,
then on the zone ID, then on the chronology.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

If all the date-time objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
additional chronology stage is not required.

This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

D

extends

ChronoLocalDate

>

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

---

#### default boolean isBefore​(
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> other)

Checks if the instant of this date-time is before that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().isBefore(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-second
and nano-of-second.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this point is before the specified date-time

---

#### default boolean isAfter​(
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> other)

Checks if the instant of this date-time is after that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().isAfter(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-second
and nano-of-second.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this is after the specified date-time

---

#### default boolean isEqual​(
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> other)

Checks if the instant of this date-time is equal to that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().equals(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-second
and nano-of-second.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if the instant equals the instant of the specified date-time

---

#### boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Checks if this date-time is equal to another date-time.

The comparison is based on the offset date-time and the zone.
To compare for the same instant on the time-line, use

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

.
Only objects of type

ChronoZonedDateTime

are compared, other types return false.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if this is equal to the other date-time

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### int hashCode()

A hash code for this date-time.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a suitable hash code

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### String
toString()

Outputs this date-time as a

String

.

The output will include the full zoned date-time.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this date-time, not null

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- timeLineOrder

```java
static
Comparator
<
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?>> timeLineOrder()
```

Gets a comparator that compares

ChronoZonedDateTime

in
time-line order ignoring the chronology.

This comparator differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying instant and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the position of the date-time on the instant time-line.
The underlying comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-second and nano-of-second.

**Returns:** a comparator that compares in time-line order ignoring the chronology
**See Also:** isAfter(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

,

isBefore(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

,

isEqual(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

- from

```java
static
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

ChronoZonedDateTime

from a temporal object.

This creates a zoned date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ChronoZonedDateTime

.

The conversion extracts and combines the chronology, date, time and zone
from the temporal object. The behavior is equivalent to using

Chronology.zonedDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

with the extracted chronology.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ChronoZonedDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

ChronoZonedDateTime
**See Also:** Chronology.zonedDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

- toLocalDate

```java
default
D
toLocalDate()
```

Gets the local date part of this date-time.

This returns a local date with the same year, month and day
as this date-time.

**Returns:** the date part of this date-time, not null

- toLocalTime

```java
default
LocalTime
toLocalTime()
```

Gets the local time part of this date-time.

This returns a local time with the same hour, minute, second and
nanosecond as this date-time.

**Returns:** the time part of this date-time, not null

- toLocalDateTime

```java
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> toLocalDateTime()
```

Gets the local date-time part of this date-time.

This returns a local date with the same year, month and day
as this date-time.

**Returns:** the local date-time part of this date-time, not null

- getChronology

```java
default
Chronology
getChronology()
```

Gets the chronology of this date-time.

The

Chronology

represents the calendar system in use.
The era and other fields in

ChronoField

are defined by the chronology.

**Returns:** the chronology, not null

- getOffset

```java
ZoneOffset
getOffset()
```

Gets the zone offset, such as '+01:00'.

This is the offset of the local date-time from UTC/Greenwich.

**Returns:** the zone offset, not null

- getZone

```java
ZoneId
getZone()
```

Gets the zone ID, such as 'Europe/Paris'.

This returns the stored time-zone id used to determine the time-zone rules.

**Returns:** the zone ID, not null

- withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()
```

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
earlier of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the earlier of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Returns:** a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the earlier offset, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if no rules can be found for the zone
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if no rules are valid for this date-time

- withLaterOffsetAtOverlap

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()
```

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
later of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the later of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Returns:** a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the later offset, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if no rules can be found for the zone
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if no rules are valid for this date-time

- withZoneSameLocal

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withZoneSameLocal​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the local date-time if possible.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the local date-time.
The local date-time is only changed if it is invalid for the new zone.

To change the zone and adjust the local date-time,
use

withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null
**Returns:** a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null

- withZoneSameInstant

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withZoneSameInstant​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the instant.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the instant.
This normally results in a change to the local date-time.

This method is based on retaining the same instant, thus gaps and overlaps
in the local time-line have no effect on the result.

To change the offset while keeping the local time,
use

withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId)

.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null
**Returns:** a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

- isSupported

```java
boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if the specified field can be queried on this date-time.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported fields is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoField

fields.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the field can be queried, false if not

- isSupported

```java
default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to or subtracted from this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported units is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoUnit

units except

FOREVER

.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

- with

```java
default
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** field

- the field to set in the result, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field in the result
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
default
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> plus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the addition cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToAdd

- the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be added
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> minus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the subtraction cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> minus​(long amountToSubtract,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period subtracted.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToSubtract

- the amount of the specified unit to subtract, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period subtracted, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be subtracted
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- query

```java
default <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this date-time using the specified query.

This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

- format

```java
default
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Formats this date-time using the specified formatter.

This date-time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

The default implementation must behave as follows:

```java
return formatter.format(this);
```

**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the formatted date-time string, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

- toInstant

```java
default
Instant
toInstant()
```

Converts this date-time to an

Instant

.

This returns an

Instant

representing the same point on the
time-line as this date-time. The calculation combines the

local date-time

and

offset

.

**Returns:** an

Instant

representing the same instant, not null

- toEpochSecond

```java
default long toEpochSecond()
```

Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch
of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This uses the

local date-time

and

offset

to calculate the epoch-second value,
which is the number of elapsed seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier are negative.

**Returns:** the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

- compareTo

```java
default int compareTo​(
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> other)
```

Compares this date-time to another date-time, including the chronology.

The comparison is based first on the instant, then on the local date-time,
then on the zone ID, then on the chronology.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

If all the date-time objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
additional chronology stage is not required.

This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

D

extends

ChronoLocalDate

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

- isBefore

```java
default boolean isBefore​(
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> other)
```

Checks if the instant of this date-time is before that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().isBefore(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-second
and nano-of-second.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this point is before the specified date-time

- isAfter

```java
default boolean isAfter​(
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> other)
```

Checks if the instant of this date-time is after that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().isAfter(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-second
and nano-of-second.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is after the specified date-time

- isEqual

```java
default boolean isEqual​(
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> other)
```

Checks if the instant of this date-time is equal to that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().equals(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-second
and nano-of-second.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if the instant equals the instant of the specified date-time

- equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Checks if this date-time is equal to another date-time.

The comparison is based on the offset date-time and the zone.
To compare for the same instant on the time-line, use

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

.
Only objects of type

ChronoZonedDateTime

are compared, other types return false.

**Overrides:** equals

Method Detail

- timeLineOrder

```java
static
Comparator
<
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?>> timeLineOrder()
```

Gets a comparator that compares

ChronoZonedDateTime

in
time-line order ignoring the chronology.

This comparator differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying instant and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the position of the date-time on the instant time-line.
The underlying comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-second and nano-of-second.

**Returns:** a comparator that compares in time-line order ignoring the chronology

isEqual(java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime<?>)

- from

```java
static
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

ChronoZonedDateTime

from a temporal object.

This creates a zoned date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ChronoZonedDateTime

.

The conversion extracts and combines the chronology, date, time and zone
from the temporal object. The behavior is equivalent to using

Chronology.zonedDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

with the extracted chronology.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ChronoZonedDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

ChronoZonedDateTime
**See Also:** Chronology.zonedDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

This is the offset of the local date-time from UTC/Greenwich.

**Returns:** the zone offset, not null

- getZone

```java
ZoneId
getZone()
```

Gets the zone ID, such as 'Europe/Paris'.

This returns the stored time-zone id used to determine the time-zone rules.

**Returns:** the zone ID, not null

- withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()
```

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
earlier of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the earlier of the two selected.

If this method is called when it is not an overlap,

this

is returned.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Returns:** a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the earlier offset, not null

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()
```

Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
later of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
a zoned date-time with the later of the two selected.

ZoneId
zone)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the local date-time if possible.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the local date-time.
The local date-time is only changed if it is invalid for the new zone.

To change the zone and adjust the local date-time,
use

withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null
**Returns:** a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null

- withZoneSameInstant

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> withZoneSameInstant​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
retaining the instant.

This method changes the time-zone and retains the instant.
This normally results in a change to the local date-time.

This method is based on retaining the same instant, thus gaps and overlaps
in the local time-line have no effect on the result.

To change the offset while keeping the local time,
use

withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId)

.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null
**Returns:** a

ChronoZonedDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

- isSupported

```java
boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if the specified field can be queried on this date-time.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported fields is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoField

fields.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the field can be queried, false if not

- isSupported

```java
default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to or subtracted from this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported units is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoUnit

units except

FOREVER

.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

- with

```java
default
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** field

- the field to set in the result, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field in the result
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

D
> plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal

```java
default long toEpochSecond()
```

Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch
of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This uses the

local date-time

and

offset

to calculate the epoch-second value,
which is the number of elapsed seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier are negative.

**Returns:** the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

- compareTo

```java
default int compareTo​(
ChronoZonedDateTime
<?> other)
```

the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.
