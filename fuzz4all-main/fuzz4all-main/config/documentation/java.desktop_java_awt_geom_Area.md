# Class Area

### Class Description

```java
public class
Area

extends
Object

implements
Shape
,
Cloneable
```

An

Area

object stores and manipulates a
resolution-independent description of an enclosed area of
2-dimensional space.

Area

objects can be transformed and can perform
various Constructive Area Geometry (CAG) operations when combined
with other

Area

objects.
The CAG operations include area

addition

,

subtraction

,

intersection

, and

exclusive or

.
See the linked method documentation for examples of the various
operations.

The

Area

class implements the

Shape

interface and provides full support for all of its hit-testing
and path iteration facilities, but an

Area

is more
specific than a generalized path in a number of ways:

- Only closed paths and sub-paths are stored.

Area

objects constructed from unclosed paths
are implicitly closed during construction as if those paths
had been filled by the

Graphics2D.fill

method.

The interiors of the individual stored sub-paths are all
non-empty and non-overlapping. Paths are decomposed during
construction into separate component non-overlapping parts,
empty pieces of the path are discarded, and then these
non-empty and non-overlapping properties are maintained
through all subsequent CAG operations. Outlines of different
component sub-paths may touch each other, as long as they
do not cross so that their enclosed areas overlap.

The geometry of the path describing the outline of the

Area

resembles the path from which it was
constructed only in that it describes the same enclosed
2-dimensional area, but may use entirely different types
and ordering of the path segments to do so.

Interesting issues which are not always obvious when using
the

Area

include:

- Creating an

Area

from an unclosed (open)

Shape

results in a closed outline in the

Area

object.

Creating an

Area

from a

Shape

which encloses no area (even when "closed") produces an
empty

Area

. A common example of this issue
is that producing an

Area

from a line will
be empty since the line encloses no area. An empty

Area

will iterate no geometry in its

PathIterator

objects.

A self-intersecting

Shape

may be split into
two (or more) sub-paths each enclosing one of the
non-intersecting portions of the original path.

An

Area

may take more path segments to
describe the same geometry even when the original
outline is simple and obvious. The analysis that the

Area

class must perform on the path may
not reflect the same concepts of "simple and obvious"
as a human being perceives.

box possible for the Shape. The bounding box will not be
padded to include the control points of curves in the outline
of the Shape, but should tightly fit the actual geometry of
the outline itself. Since the returned object represents
the bounding box with integers, the bounding box can only be
as tight as the nearest integer coordinates that encompass
the geometry of the Shape.

---

#### public boolean contains​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains
the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
the rectangular area must lie within the

Shape

for the
entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the

Shape

.

The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the rectangular area are
prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the rectangular area.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Specified by:**

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the specified rectangular area;

false

otherwise or, if the

Shape

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the

Rectangle2D

Rectangle2D

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the

Rectangle2D

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified rectangular area.
The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

The Area class will attempt to return the tightest bounding
box possible for the Shape. The bounding box will not be
padded to include the control points of curves in the outline
of the Shape, but should tightly fit the actual geometry of
the outline itself. Since the returned object represents
the bounding box with integers, the bounding box can only be
as tight as the nearest integer coordinates that encompass
the geometry of the Shape.

- contains

```java
public boolean contains​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)
```

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains
the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
the rectangular area must lie within the

Shape

for the
entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the

Shape

.

The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the rectangular area are
prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the rectangular area.
The

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

.
