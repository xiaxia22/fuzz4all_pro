# Interface X509Extension

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\cert\X509Extension.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
X509Extension
```

Interface for an X.509 extension.

The extensions defined for X.509 v3

Certificates

and v2

CRLs

(Certificate Revocation
Lists) provide methods
for associating additional attributes with users or public keys,
for managing the certification hierarchy, and for managing CRL
distribution. The X.509 extensions format also allows communities
to define private extensions to carry information unique to those
communities.

Each extension in a certificate/CRL may be designated as
critical or non-critical. A certificate/CRL-using system (an application
validating a certificate/CRL) must reject the certificate/CRL if it
encounters a critical extension it does not recognize. A non-critical
extension may be ignored if it is not recognized.

The ASN.1 definition for this is:

```java
Extensions ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Extension

Extension ::= SEQUENCE {
extnId OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
critical BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
extnValue OCTET STRING
-- contains a DER encoding of a value
-- of the type registered for use with
-- the extnId object identifier value
}
```

Since not all extensions are known, the

getExtensionValue

method returns the DER-encoded OCTET STRING of the
extension value (i.e., the

extnValue

). This can then
be handled by a

Class

that understands the extension.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### boolean hasUnsupportedCriticalExtension()

Check if there is a critical extension that is not supported.

**Returns:**
- true

if a critical extension is found that is
not supported, otherwise

false

.

---

#### Set
<
String
> getCriticalExtensionOIDs()

Gets a Set of the OID strings for the extension(s) marked
CRITICAL in the certificate/CRL managed by the object
implementing this interface.

Here is sample code to get a Set of critical extensions from an
X509Certificate and print the OIDs:

```java
X509Certificate cert = null;
try (InputStream inStrm = new FileInputStream("DER-encoded-Cert")) {
CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
cert = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(inStrm);
}

Set<String> critSet = cert.getCriticalExtensionOIDs();
if (critSet != null && !critSet.isEmpty()) {
System.out.println("Set of critical extensions:");
for (String oid : critSet) {
System.out.println(oid);
}
}
```

**Returns:**
- a Set (or an empty Set if none are marked critical) of
the extension OID strings for extensions that are marked critical.
If there are no extensions present at all, then this method returns
null.

---

#### Set
<
String
> getNonCriticalExtensionOIDs()

Gets a Set of the OID strings for the extension(s) marked
NON-CRITICAL in the certificate/CRL managed by the object
implementing this interface.

Here is sample code to get a Set of non-critical extensions from an
X509CRL revoked certificate entry and print the OIDs:

```java
CertificateFactory cf = null;
X509CRL crl = null;
try (InputStream inStrm = new FileInputStream("DER-encoded-CRL")) {
cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
crl = (X509CRL)cf.generateCRL(inStrm);
}

byte[] certData = <DER-encoded certificate data>
ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(certData);
X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(bais);
X509CRLEntry badCert =
crl.getRevokedCertificate(cert.getSerialNumber());

if (badCert != null) {
Set<String> nonCritSet = badCert.getNonCriticalExtensionOIDs();
if (nonCritSet != null)
for (String oid : nonCritSet) {
System.out.println(oid);
}
}
```

**Returns:**
- a Set (or an empty Set if none are marked non-critical) of
the extension OID strings for extensions that are marked non-critical.
If there are no extensions present at all, then this method returns
null.

---

#### byte[] getExtensionValue​(
String
oid)

Gets the DER-encoded OCTET string for the extension value
(

extnValue

) identified by the passed-in

oid

String.
The

oid

string is
represented by a set of nonnegative whole numbers separated
by periods.

For example:
