# Class ModuleLayer

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\ModuleLayer.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
ModuleLayer

extends
Object
```

A layer of modules in the Java virtual machine.

A layer is created from a graph of modules in a

Configuration

and a function that maps each module to a

ClassLoader

.
Creating a layer informs the Java virtual machine about the classes that
may be loaded from the modules so that the Java virtual machine knows which
module that each class is a member of.

Creating a layer creates a

Module

object for each

ResolvedModule

in the configuration. For each resolved module that is

read

, the

Module

reads

the corresponding run-time

Module

, which may
be in the same layer or a

parent

layer.

The

defineModulesWithOneLoader

and

defineModulesWithManyLoaders

methods
provide convenient ways to create a module layer where all modules are
mapped to a single class loader or where each module is mapped to its own
class loader. The

defineModules

method is for more
advanced cases where modules are mapped to custom class loaders by means of
a function specified to the method. Each of these methods has an instance
and static variant. The instance methods create a layer with the receiver
as the parent layer. The static methods are for more advanced cases where
there can be more than one parent layer or where a

Controller

is needed to control modules in the layer

A Java virtual machine has at least one non-empty layer, the

boot

layer, that is created when the Java virtual machine is
started. The boot layer contains module

java.base

and is the only
layer in the Java virtual machine with a module named "

java.base

".
The modules in the boot layer are mapped to the bootstrap class loader and
other class loaders that are

built-in

into the Java virtual machine. The boot layer will often be
the

parent

when creating additional layers.

Each

Module

in a layer is created so that it

exports

and

opens

the packages described by its

ModuleDescriptor

. Qualified exports
(where a package is exported to a set of target modules rather than all
modules) are reified when creating the layer as follows:

- If module

X

exports a package to

Y

, and if the
runtime

Module

X

reads

Module

Y

, then
the package is exported to

Module

Y

(which may be in
the same layer as

X

or a parent layer).
- If module

X

exports a package to

Y

, and if the
runtime

Module

X

does not read

Y

then target

Y

is located as if by invoking

findModule

to find the module in the layer or its parent layers. If

Y

is found then the package is exported to the instance of

Y

that was found. If

Y

is not found then the qualified
export is ignored.

Qualified opens are handled in same way as qualified exports.

As when creating a

Configuration

,

automatic

modules receive special
treatment when creating a layer. An automatic module is created in the
Java virtual machine as a

Module

that reads every unnamed

Module

in the Java virtual machine.

Unless otherwise specified, passing a

null

argument to a method
in this class causes a

NullPointerException

to
be thrown.

Example usage:

This example creates a configuration by resolving a module named
"

myapp

" with the configuration for the boot layer as the parent. It
then creates a new layer with the modules in this configuration. All modules
are defined to the same class loader.

```java
ModuleFinder finder = ModuleFinder.of(dir1, dir2, dir3);

ModuleLayer parent = ModuleLayer.boot();

Configuration cf = parent.configuration().resolve(finder, ModuleFinder.of(), Set.of("myapp"));

ClassLoader scl = ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader();

ModuleLayer layer = parent.defineModulesWithOneLoader(cf, scl);

Class<?> c = layer.findLoader("myapp").loadClass("app.Main");
```

#### public
ModuleLayer
defineModules​(
Configuration
cf,

Function
<
String
,​
ClassLoader
> clf)

Creates a new module layer, with this layer as its parent, by defining the
modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine.
Each module is mapped, by name, to its class loader by means of the
given function. This method works exactly as specified by the static

defineModules

method when invoked with this layer as the parent. In other words, if
this layer is

thisLayer

then this method is equivalent to
invoking:

```java
ModuleLayer.defineModules(cf, List.of(thisLayer), clf).layer();
```

**Parameters:**
- cf

- The configuration for the layer
- clf

- The function to map a module name to a class loader

**Returns:**
- The newly created layer

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the given configuration has more than one parent or the parent
of the configuration is not the configuration for this layer
- LayerInstantiationException

- If the layer cannot be created for any of the reasons specified
by the static

defineModules

method

#### public static
ModuleLayer.Controller
defineModulesWithOneLoader​(
Configuration
cf,

List
<
ModuleLayer
> parentLayers,

ClassLoader
parentLoader)

Creates a new module layer by defining the modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine. This method creates one
class loader and defines all modules to that class loader.

The class loader created by this method implements

direct
delegation

when loading classes from modules. If the

loadClass

method is invoked to
load a class then it uses the package name of the class to map it to a
module. This may be a module in this layer and hence defined to the same
class loader. It may be a package in a module in a parent layer that is
exported to one or more of the modules in this layer. The class
loader delegates to the class loader of the module, throwing

ClassNotFoundException

if not found by that class loader.
When

loadClass

is invoked to load classes that do not map to a
module then it delegates to the parent class loader.

The class loader created by this method locates resources
(

getResource

,

getResources

, and other resource
methods) in all modules in the layer before searching the parent class
loader.

Attempting to create a layer with all modules defined to the same
class loader can fail for the following reasons:

- Overlapping packages

: Two or more modules in the
configuration have the same package.
- Split delegation

: The resulting class loader would
need to delegate to more than one class loader in order to load
classes in a specific package.

In addition, a layer cannot be created if the configuration contains
a module named "

java.base

", or a module contains a package named
"

java

" or a package with a name starting with "

java.

".

If there is a security manager then the class loader created by
this method will load classes and resources with privileges that are
restricted by the calling context of this method.

**Parameters:**
- cf

- The configuration for the layer
- parentLayers

- The list of parent layers in search order
- parentLoader

- The parent class loader for the class loader created by this
method; may be

null

for the bootstrap class loader

**Returns:**
- A controller that controls the newly created layer

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the parent(s) of the given configuration do not match the
configuration of the parent layers, including order
- LayerInstantiationException

- If all modules cannot be defined to the same class loader for any
of the reasons listed above
- SecurityException

- If

RuntimePermission("createClassLoader")

or

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

is denied by
the security manager

#### public static
ModuleLayer.Controller
defineModulesWithManyLoaders​(
Configuration
cf,

List
<
ModuleLayer
> parentLayers,

ClassLoader
parentLoader)

Creates a new module layer by defining the modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine. Each module is defined to
its own

ClassLoader

created by this method. The

parent

of each class loader is the given parent
class loader.

The class loaders created by this method implement

direct
delegation

when loading classes from modules. If the

loadClass

method is invoked to
load a class then it uses the package name of the class to map it to a
module. The package may be in the module defined to the class loader.
The package may be exported by another module in this layer to the
module defined to the class loader. It may be in a package exported by a
module in a parent layer. The class loader delegates to the class loader
of the module, throwing

ClassNotFoundException

if not found by
that class loader. When

loadClass

is invoked to load a class
that does not map to a module then it delegates to the parent class
loader.

The class loaders created by this method locate resources
(

getResource

,

getResources

, and other resource
methods) in the module defined to the class loader before searching
the parent class loader.

If there is a security manager then the class loaders created by
this method will load classes and resources with privileges that are
restricted by the calling context of this method.

**Parameters:**
- cf

- The configuration for the layer
- parentLayers

- The list of parent layers in search order
- parentLoader

- The parent class loader for each of the class loaders created by
this method; may be

null

for the bootstrap class loader

**Returns:**
- A controller that controls the newly created layer

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the parent(s) of the given configuration do not match the
configuration of the parent layers, including order
- LayerInstantiationException

- If the layer cannot be created because the configuration contains
a module named "

java.base

" or a module contains a package
named "

java

" or a package with a name starting with
"

java.

"
- SecurityException

- If

RuntimePermission("createClassLoader")

or

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

is denied by
the security manager

#### public static
ModuleLayer.Controller
defineModules​(
Configuration
cf,

List
<
ModuleLayer
> parentLayers,

Function
<
String
,​
ClassLoader
> clf)

Creates a new module layer by defining the modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine. The given function maps each
module in the configuration, by name, to a class loader. Creating the
layer informs the Java virtual machine about the classes that may be
loaded so that the Java virtual machine knows which module that each
class is a member of.

The class loader delegation implemented by the class loaders must
respect module readability. The class loaders should be

parallel-capable

so as to
avoid deadlocks during class loading. In addition, the entity creating
a new layer with this method should arrange that the class loaders be
ready to load from these modules before there are any attempts to load
classes or resources.

Creating a layer can fail for the following reasons:

- Two or more modules with the same package are mapped to the
same class loader.
- A module is mapped to a class loader that already has a
module of the same name defined to it.
- A module is mapped to a class loader that has already
defined types in any of the packages in the module.

In addition, a layer cannot be created if the configuration contains
a module named "

java.base

", a configuration contains a module
with a package named "

java

" or a package name starting with
"

java.

", or the function to map a module name to a class loader
returns

null

or the

platform class loader

.

If the function to map a module name to class loader throws an error
or runtime exception then it is propagated to the caller of this method.

**Parameters:**
- cf

- The configuration for the layer
- parentLayers

- The list of parent layers in search order
- clf

- The function to map a module name to a class loader

**Returns:**
- A controller that controls the newly created layer

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the parent(s) of the given configuration do not match the
configuration of the parent layers, including order
- LayerInstantiationException

- If creating the layer fails for any of the reasons listed above
- SecurityException

- If

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

is denied by
the security manager

**API Note:**
- It is implementation specific as to whether creating a layer
with this method is an atomic operation or not. Consequentially it is
possible for this method to fail with some modules, but not all, defined
to the Java virtual machine.

---

#### public
Configuration
configuration()

Returns the configuration for this layer.

**Returns:**
- The configuration for this layer

---

#### public
List
<
ModuleLayer
> parents()

Returns the list of this layer's parents unless this is the

empty layer

, which has no parents and so an
empty list is returned.

**Returns:**
- The list of this layer's parents

---

#### public
Set
<
Module
> modules()

Returns the set of the modules in this layer.

**Returns:**
- A possibly-empty unmodifiable set of the modules in this layer

---

#### public
Optional
<
Module
> findModule​(
String
name)

Returns the module with the given name in this layer, or if not in this
layer, the

parent

layers. Finding a module in
parent layers is equivalent to invoking

findModule

on each
parent, in search order, until the module is found or all parents have
been searched. In a

tree of layers

then this is equivalent to
a depth-first search.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the module to find

**Returns:**
- The module with the given name or an empty

Optional

if there isn't a module with this name in this layer or any
parent layer

---

#### public
ClassLoader
findLoader​(
String
name)

Returns the

ClassLoader

for the module with the given name. If
a module of the given name is not in this layer then the

parent

layers are searched in the manner specified by

findModule

.

If there is a security manager then its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

permission to check that the caller is allowed to get access to the
class loader.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the module to find

**Returns:**
- The ClassLoader that the module is defined to

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if a module of the given name is not
defined in this layer or any parent of this layer
- SecurityException

- if denied by the security manager

**API Note:**
- This method does not return an

Optional<ClassLoader>

because `null` must be used to represent the bootstrap class loader.

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string describing this module layer.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- A possibly empty string describing this module layer

---

#### public static
ModuleLayer
empty()

Returns the

empty

layer. There are no modules in the empty
layer. It has no parents.

**Returns:**
- The empty layer

---

#### public static
ModuleLayer
boot()

Returns the boot layer. The boot layer contains at least one module,

java.base

. Its parent is the

empty

layer.

**Returns:**
- The boot layer

**API Note:**
- This method returns

null

during startup and before
the boot layer is fully initialized.

java.lang.ModuleLayer

```java
public final class
ModuleLayer

extends

```

A layer of modules in the Java virtual machine.

A layer is created from a graph of modules in a

Configuration

and a function that maps each module to a

ClassLoader

.
Creating a layer informs the Java virtual machine about the classes that
may be loaded from the modules so that the Java virtual machine knows which
module that each class is a member of.

Creating a layer creates a

Module

object for each

ResolvedModule

in the configuration. For each resolved module that is

read

, the

Module

reads

the corresponding run-time

Module

, which may
be in the same layer or a

parent

layer.

The

defineModulesWithOneLoader

and

defineModulesWithManyLoaders

methods
provide convenient ways to create a module layer where all modules are
mapped to a single class loader or where each module is mapped to its own
class loader. The

defineModules

method is for more
advanced cases where modules are mapped to custom class loaders by means of
a function specified to the method. Each of these methods has an instance
and static variant. The instance methods create a layer with the receiver
as the parent layer. The static methods are for more advanced cases where
there can be more than one parent layer or where a

Controller

is needed to control modules in the layer

A Java virtual machine has at least one non-empty layer, the

boot

layer, that is created when the Java virtual machine is
started. The boot layer contains module

java.base

and is the only
layer in the Java virtual machine with a module named "

java.base

".
The modules in the boot layer are mapped to the bootstrap class loader and
other class loaders that are

built-in

into the Java virtual machine. The boot layer will often be
the

parent

when creating additional layers.

Each

Module

in a layer is created so that it

exports

and

opens

the packages described by its

ModuleDescriptor

. Qualified exports
(where a package is exported to a set of target modules rather than all
modules) are reified when creating the layer as follows:

- If module

X

exports a package to

Y

, and if the
runtime

Module

X

reads

Module

Y

, then
the package is exported to

Module

Y

(which may be in
the same layer as

X

or a parent layer).
- If module

X

exports a package to

Y

, and if the
runtime

Module

X

does not read

Y

then target

Y

is located as if by invoking

findModule

to find the module in the layer or its parent layers. If

Y

is found then the package is exported to the instance of

Y

that was found. If

Y

is not found then the qualified
export is ignored.

Qualified opens are handled in same way as qualified exports.

As when creating a

Configuration

,

automatic

modules receive special
treatment when creating a layer. An automatic module is created in the
Java virtual machine as a

Module

that reads every unnamed

Module

in the Java virtual machine.

Unless otherwise specified, passing a

null

argument to a method
in this class causes a

NullPointerException

to
be thrown.

Example usage:

This example creates a configuration by resolving a module named
"

myapp

" with the configuration for the boot layer as the parent. It
then creates a new layer with the modules in this configuration. All modules
are defined to the same class loader.

```java
ModuleFinder finder = ModuleFinder.of(dir1, dir2, dir3);

ModuleLayer parent = ModuleLayer.boot();

Configuration cf = parent.configuration().resolve(finder, ModuleFinder.of(), Set.of("myapp"));

ClassLoader scl = ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader();

```java
public
ModuleLayer
defineModules​(
Configuration
cf,

Function
<
String
,​
ClassLoader
> clf)
```

Creates a new module layer, with this layer as its parent, by defining the
modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine.
Each module is mapped, by name, to its class loader by means of the
given function. This method works exactly as specified by the static

defineModules

method when invoked with this layer as the parent. In other words, if
this layer is

thisLayer

then this method is equivalent to
invoking:

```java
ModuleLayer.defineModules(cf, List.of(thisLayer), clf).layer();
```

**Parameters:** cf

- The configuration for the layer
**Parameters:** clf

- The function to map a module name to a class loader
**Returns:** The newly created layer
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the given configuration has more than one parent or the parent
of the configuration is not the configuration for this layer
**Throws:** LayerInstantiationException

- If the layer cannot be created for any of the reasons specified
by the static

defineModules

method
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

is denied by

- defineModulesWithOneLoader

```java
public static
ModuleLayer.Controller
defineModulesWithOneLoader​(
Configuration
cf,

List
<
ModuleLayer
> parentLayers,

ClassLoader
parentLoader)
```

Creates a new module layer by defining the modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine. This method creates one
class loader and defines all modules to that class loader.

The class loader created by this method implements

direct
delegation

when loading classes from modules. If the

loadClass

method is invoked to
load a class then it uses the package name of the class to map it to a
module. This may be a module in this layer and hence defined to the same
class loader. It may be a package in a module in a parent layer that is
exported to one or more of the modules in this layer. The class
loader delegates to the class loader of the module, throwing

ClassNotFoundException

if not found by that class loader.
When

loadClass

is invoked to load classes that do not map to a
module then it delegates to the parent class loader.

The class loader created by this method locates resources
(

getResource

,

getResources

, and other resource
methods) in all modules in the layer before searching the parent class
loader.

Attempting to create a layer with all modules defined to the same
class loader can fail for the following reasons:

- Overlapping packages

: Two or more modules in the
configuration have the same package.
- Split delegation

: The resulting class loader would
need to delegate to more than one class loader in order to load
classes in a specific package.

In addition, a layer cannot be created if the configuration contains
a module named "

java.base

", or a module contains a package named
"

java

" or a package with a name starting with "

java.

".

If there is a security manager then the class loader created by
this method will load classes and resources with privileges that are
restricted by the calling context of this method.

**Parameters:** cf

- The configuration for the layer
**Parameters:** parentLayers

- The list of parent layers in search order
**Parameters:** parentLoader

- The parent class loader for the class loader created by this
method; may be

null

for the bootstrap class loader
**Returns:** A controller that controls the newly created layer
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the parent(s) of the given configuration do not match the
configuration of the parent layers, including order
**Throws:** LayerInstantiationException

- If all modules cannot be defined to the same class loader for any
of the reasons listed above
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If

RuntimePermission("createClassLoader")

or

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

is denied by
the security manager
**See Also:** findLoader(java.lang.String)

- defineModulesWithManyLoaders

```java
public static
ModuleLayer.Controller
defineModulesWithManyLoaders​(
Configuration
cf,

List
<
ModuleLayer
> parentLayers,

ClassLoader
parentLoader)
```

Creates a new module layer by defining the modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine. Each module is defined to
its own

ClassLoader

created by this method. The

parent

of each class loader is the given parent
class loader.

The class loaders created by this method implement

direct
delegation

when loading classes from modules. If the

loadClass

method is invoked to
load a class then it uses the package name of the class to map it to a
module. The package may be in the module defined to the class loader.
The package may be exported by another module in this layer to the
module defined to the class loader. It may be in a package exported by a
module in a parent layer. The class loader delegates to the class loader
of the module, throwing

ClassNotFoundException

if not found by
that class loader. When

loadClass

is invoked to load a class
that does not map to a module then it delegates to the parent class
loader.

The class loaders created by this method locate resources
(

getResource

,

getResources

, and other resource
methods) in the module defined to the class loader before searching
the parent class loader.

If there is a security manager then the class loaders created by
this method will load classes and resources with privileges that are
restricted by the calling context of this method.

**Parameters:** cf

- The configuration for the layer
**Parameters:** parentLayers

- The list of parent layers in search order
**Parameters:** parentLoader

- The parent class loader for each of the class loaders created by
this method; may be

null

for the bootstrap class loader
**Returns:** A controller that controls the newly created layer
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the parent(s) of the given configuration do not match the
configuration of the parent layers, including order
**Throws:** LayerInstantiationException

- If the layer cannot be created because the configuration contains
a module named "

java.base

" or a module contains a package
named "

java

" or a package with a name starting with
"

java.

"
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If

RuntimePermission("createClassLoader")

or

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

is denied by
the security manager
**See Also:** findLoader(java.lang.String)

- defineModules

```java
public static
ModuleLayer.Controller
defineModules​(
Configuration
cf,

List
<
ModuleLayer
> parentLayers,

Function
<
String
,​
ClassLoader
> clf)
```

Creates a new module layer by defining the modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine. The given function maps each
module in the configuration, by name, to a class loader. Creating the
layer informs the Java virtual machine about the classes that may be
loaded so that the Java virtual machine knows which module that each
class is a member of.

The class loader delegation implemented by the class loaders must
respect module readability. The class loaders should be

parallel-capable

so as to
avoid deadlocks during class loading. In addition, the entity creating
a new layer with this method should arrange that the class loaders be
ready to load from these modules before there are any attempts to load
classes or resources.

Creating a layer can fail for the following reasons:

- Two or more modules with the same package are mapped to the
same class loader.
- A module is mapped to a class loader that already has a
module of the same name defined to it.
- A module is mapped to a class loader that has already
defined types in any of the packages in the module.

In addition, a layer cannot be created if the configuration contains
a module named "

java.base

", a configuration contains a module
with a package named "

java

" or a package name starting with
"

java.

", or the function to map a module name to a class loader
returns

null

or the

platform class loader

.

If the function to map a module name to class loader throws an error
or runtime exception then it is propagated to the caller of this method.

**API Note:** It is implementation specific as to whether creating a layer
with this method is an atomic operation or not. Consequentially it is
possible for this method to fail with some modules, but not all, defined
to the Java virtual machine.
**Parameters:** cf

- The configuration for the layer
**Parameters:** parentLayers

- The list of parent layers in search order
**Parameters:** clf

- The function to map a module name to a class loader
**Returns:** A controller that controls the newly created layer
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the parent(s) of the given configuration do not match the
configuration of the parent layers, including order
**Throws:** LayerInstantiationException

- If creating the layer fails for any of the reasons listed above
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

is denied by
the security manager

- configuration

```java
public
Configuration
configuration()
```

Returns the configuration for this layer.

**Returns:** The configuration for this layer

- parents

```java
public
List
<
ModuleLayer
> parents()
```

Returns the list of this layer's parents unless this is the

empty layer

, which has no parents and so an
empty list is returned.

**Returns:** The list of this layer's parents

- modules

```java
public
Set
<
Module
> modules()
```

Returns the set of the modules in this layer.

**Returns:** A possibly-empty unmodifiable set of the modules in this layer

- findModule

```java
public
Optional
<
Module
> findModule​(
String
name)
```

Returns the module with the given name in this layer, or if not in this
layer, the

parent

layers. Finding a module in
parent layers is equivalent to invoking

findModule

on each
parent, in search order, until the module is found or all parents have
been searched. In a

tree of layers

then this is equivalent to
a depth-first search.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the module to find
**Returns:** The module with the given name or an empty

Optional

if there isn't a module with this name in this layer or any
parent layer

- findLoader

```java
public
ClassLoader
findLoader​(
String
name)
```

Returns the

ClassLoader

for the module with the given name. If
a module of the given name is not in this layer then the

parent

layers are searched in the manner specified by

findModule

.

If there is a security manager then its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

permission to check that the caller is allowed to get access to the
class loader.

**API Note:** This method does not return an

Optional<ClassLoader>

because `null` must be used to represent the bootstrap class loader.
**Parameters:** name

- The name of the module to find
**Returns:** The ClassLoader that the module is defined to
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a module of the given name is not
defined in this layer or any parent of this layer
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if denied by the security manager

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string describing this module layer.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** A possibly empty string describing this module layer

- empty

```java
public static
ModuleLayer
empty()
```

Returns the

empty

layer. There are no modules in the empty
layer. It has no parents.

**Returns:** The empty layer

- boot

```java
public static
ModuleLayer
boot()
```

Returns the boot layer. The boot layer contains at least one module,

java.base

. Its parent is the

empty

layer.

**API Note:** This method returns

null

during startup and before
the boot layer is fully initialized.
**Returns:** The boot layer

```

Creates a new module layer by defining the modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine. The given function maps each
module in the configuration, by name, to a class loader. Creating the
layer informs the Java virtual machine about the classes that may be
loaded so that the Java virtual machine knows which module that each
class is a member of.

The class loader delegation implemented by the class loaders must
respect module readability. The class loaders should be

parallel-capable

so as to
avoid deadlocks during class loading. In addition, the entity creating
a new layer with this method should arrange that the class loaders be
ready to load from these modules before there are any attempts to load
classes or resources.

Creating a layer can fail for the following reasons:

- Two or more modules with the same package are mapped to the
same class loader.
- A module is mapped to a class loader that already has a
module of the same name defined to it.
- A module is mapped to a class loader that has already
defined types in any of the packages in the module.

In addition, a layer cannot be created if the configuration contains
a module named "

java.base

", a configuration contains a module
with a package named "

java

" or a package name starting with
"

java.

", or the function to map a module name to a class loader
returns

null

or the

platform class loader

.

If the function to map a module name to class loader throws an error
or runtime exception then it is propagated to the caller of this method.

**API Note:** It is implementation specific as to whether creating a layer
with this method is an atomic operation or not. Consequentially it is
possible for this method to fail with some modules, but not all, defined
to the Java virtual machine.
**Parameters:** cf

- The configuration for the layer
**Parameters:** parentLayers

- The list of parent layers in search order
**Parameters:** clf

- The function to map a module name to a class loader
**Returns:** A controller that controls the newly created layer
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the parent(s) of the given configuration do not match the
configuration of the parent layers, including order
**Throws:** LayerInstantiationException

- If creating the layer fails for any of the reasons listed above
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

is denied by
the security manager

- configuration

```java
public
Configuration
configuration()
```

Returns the configuration for this layer.

**Returns:** The configuration for this layer

- parents

```java
public
List
<
ModuleLayer
> parents()
```

Returns the list of this layer's parents unless this is the

empty layer

, which has no parents and so an
empty list is returned.

**Returns:** The list of this layer's parents

- modules

```java
public
Set
<
Module
> modules()
```

Returns the set of the modules in this layer.

**Returns:** A possibly-empty unmodifiable set of the modules in this layer

- findModule

```java
public
Optional
<
Module
> findModule​(
String
name)
```

Returns the module with the given name in this layer, or if not in this
layer, the

parent

layers. Finding a module in
parent layers is equivalent to invoking

findModule

on each
parent, in search order, until the module is found or all parents have
been searched. In a

tree of layers

then this is equivalent to
a depth-first search.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the module to find
**Returns:** The module with the given name or an empty

Optional

if there isn't a module with this name in this layer or any
parent layer

- findLoader

```java
public
ClassLoader
findLoader​(
String
name)
```

Returns the

ClassLoader

for the module with the given name. If
a module of the given name is not in this layer then the

parent

layers are searched in the manner specified by

findModule

.

If there is a security manager then its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

permission to check that the caller is allowed to get access to the
class loader.

**API Note:** This method does not return an

Optional<ClassLoader>

because `null` must be used to represent the bootstrap class loader.
**Parameters:** name

- The name of the module to find
**Returns:** The ClassLoader that the module is defined to
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a module of the given name is not
defined in this layer or any parent of this layer
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if denied by the security manager

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string describing this module layer.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** A possibly empty string describing this module layer

- empty

```java
public static
ModuleLayer
empty()
```

Returns the

empty

layer. There are no modules in the empty
layer. It has no parents.

**Returns:** The empty layer

- boot

```java
public static
ModuleLayer
boot()
```

Returns the boot layer. The boot layer contains at least one module,

java.base

. Its parent is the

empty

layer.

**API Note:** This method returns

null

during startup and before
the boot layer is fully initialized.
**Returns:** The boot layer

Creates a new module layer, with this layer as its parent, by defining the
modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine.
Each module is mapped, by name, to its class loader by means of the
given function. This method works exactly as specified by the static

defineModulesWithOneLoader

```java
public static
ModuleLayer.Controller
defineModulesWithOneLoader​(
Configuration
cf,

List

parentLoader)
```

Creates a new module layer by defining the modules in the given

Configuration

to the Java virtual machine. This method creates one
class loader and defines all modules to that class loader.

The class loader created by this method implements

direct
delegation

when loading classes from modules. If the

loadClass

method is invoked to
load a class then it uses the package name of the class to map it to a
module. This may be a module in this layer and hence defined to the same
class loader. It may be a package in a module in a parent layer that is
exported to one or more of the modules in this layer. The class
loader delegates to the class loader of the module, throwing

ClassNotFoundException

if not found by that class loader.
When

loadClass

is invoked to load classes that do not map to a
module then it delegates to the parent class loader.

The class loader created by this method locates resources
(

getResource

,

getResources

, and other resource
methods) in all modules in the layer before searching the parent class
loader.

Attempting to create a layer with all modules defined to the same
class loader can fail for the following reasons:

- Overlapping packages

: Two or more modules in the
configuration have the same package.
- Split delegation

: The resulting class loader would
need to delegate to more than one class loader in order to load
classes in a specific package.

In addition, a layer cannot be created if the configuration contains
a module named "

java.base

", or a module contains a package named
"

java

" or a package with a name starting with "

java.

".

If there is a security manager then the class loader created by
this method will load classes and resources with privileges that are
restricted by the calling context of this method.

**Parameters:** cf

- The configuration for the layer
**Parameters:** parentLayers

- The list of parent layers in search order
**Parameters:** parentLoader

- The parent class loader for the class loader created by this
method; may be

null

for the bootstrap class loader
**Returns:** A controller that controls the newly created layer
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the parent(s) of the given configuration do not match the
configuration of the parent layers, including order
**Throws:** LayerInstantiationException

- If all modules cannot be defined to the same class loader for any
of the reasons listed above
**Throws:** SecurityException

> parents()

Returns the list of this layer's parents unless this is the

empty layer

, which has no parents and so an
empty list is returned.

modules

```java
public
Set
<
Module
> modules()
```

Returns the set of the modules in this layer.

**Returns:** A possibly-empty unmodifiable set of the modules in this layer

---

#### modules

public

Set

<

Module

> modules()

Returns the set of the modules in this layer.

findModule

```java
public
Optional
<
Module
> findModule​(
String
name)
```

Returns the module with the given name in this layer, or if not in this
layer, the

parent

layers. Finding a module in
parent layers is equivalent to invoking

findModule

on each
parent, in search order, until the module is found or all parents have
been searched. In a

tree of layers

then this is equivalent to
a depth-first search.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the module to find
**Returns:** The module with the given name or an empty

Optional

if there isn't a module with this name in this layer or any
parent layer

---

#### findModule

public

Optional

<

Module

> findModule​(

String

name)

Returns the module with the given name in this layer, or if not in this
layer, the

parent

layers. Finding a module in
parent layers is equivalent to invoking

findModule

on each
parent, in search order, until the module is found or all parents have
been searched. In a

tree of layers

then this is equivalent to
a depth-first search.

findLoader

```java
public
ClassLoader
findLoader​(
String
name)
```

Returns the

ClassLoader

for the module with the given name. If
a module of the given name is not in this layer then the

parent

layers are searched in the manner specified by

findModule

.

If there is a security manager then its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")

permission to check that the caller is allowed to get access to the
class loader.

**API Note:** This method does not return an

Optional<ClassLoader>

because `null` must be used to represent the bootstrap class loader.
**Parameters:** name

- The name of the module to find
**Returns:** The ClassLoader that the module is defined to
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a module of the given name is not
defined in this layer or any parent of this layer
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if denied by the security manager

toString()
```

Returns a string describing this module layer.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** A possibly empty string describing this module layer

---

#### toString

public

String

toString()

Returns a string describing this module layer.

empty

```java
public static
ModuleLayer
empty()
```

Returns the

empty

layer. There are no modules in the empty
layer. It has no parents.

**Returns:** The empty layer

---

#### empty

public static

ModuleLayer

empty()

Returns the

empty

layer. There are no modules in the empty
layer. It has no parents.

boot

```java
public static
ModuleLayer
boot()
```

Returns the boot layer. The boot layer contains at least one module,

java.base

. Its parent is the

empty

layer.

**API Note:** This method returns

null

during startup and before
the boot layer is fully initialized.
**Returns:** The boot layer

---

#### boot
