# Class Inet4Address

**Source:** `java.base\java\net\Inet4Address.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
Inet4Address

extends
InetAddress
```

This class represents an Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address.
Defined by

RFC 790: Assigned Numbers

,

RFC 1918: Address Allocation for Private Internets

,
and

RFC 2365:
Administratively Scoped IP Multicast

Textual representation of IP addresses

Textual representation of IPv4 address used as input to methods
takes one of the following forms:

- d.d.d.d
- d.d.d
- d.d
- d

When four parts are specified, each is interpreted as a byte of
data and assigned, from left to right, to the four bytes of an IPv4
address.

When a three part address is specified, the last part is
interpreted as a 16-bit quantity and placed in the right most two
bytes of the network address. This makes the three part address
format convenient for specifying Class B net- work addresses as
128.net.host.

When a two part address is supplied, the last part is
interpreted as a 24-bit quantity and placed in the right most three
bytes of the network address. This makes the two part address
format convenient for specifying Class A network addresses as
net.host.

When only one part is given, the value is stored directly in
the network address without any byte rearrangement.

For methods that return a textual representation as output
value, the first form, i.e. a dotted-quad string, is used.

The Scope of a Multicast Address

Historically the IPv4 TTL field in the IP header has doubled as a
multicast scope field: a TTL of 0 means node-local, 1 means
link-local, up through 32 means site-local, up through 64 means
region-local, up through 128 means continent-local, and up through
255 are global. However, the administrative scoping is preferred.
