# Class Instant

### Class Description

```java
public final class
Instant

extends
Object

implements
Temporal
,
TemporalAdjuster
,
Comparable
<
Instant
>,
Serializable
```

An instantaneous point on the time-line.

This class models a single instantaneous point on the time-line.
This might be used to record event time-stamps in the application.

The range of an instant requires the storage of a number larger than a

long

.
To achieve this, the class stores a

long

representing epoch-seconds and an

int

representing nanosecond-of-second, which will always be between 0 and 999,999,999.
The epoch-seconds are measured from the standard Java epoch of

1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

where instants after the epoch have positive values, and earlier instants have negative values.
For both the epoch-second and nanosecond parts, a larger value is always later on the time-line
than a smaller value.

Time-scale

The length of the solar day is the standard way that humans measure time.
This has traditionally been subdivided into 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds,
forming a 86400 second day.

Modern timekeeping is based on atomic clocks which precisely define an SI second
relative to the transitions of a Caesium atom. The length of an SI second was defined
to be very close to the 86400th fraction of a day.

Unfortunately, as the Earth rotates the length of the day varies.
In addition, over time the average length of the day is getting longer as the Earth slows.
As a result, the length of a solar day in 2012 is slightly longer than 86400 SI seconds.
The actual length of any given day and the amount by which the Earth is slowing
are not predictable and can only be determined by measurement.
The UT1 time-scale captures the accurate length of day, but is only available some
time after the day has completed.

The UTC time-scale is a standard approach to bundle up all the additional fractions
of a second from UT1 into whole seconds, known as

leap-seconds

.
A leap-second may be added or removed depending on the Earth's rotational changes.
As such, UTC permits a day to have 86399 SI seconds or 86401 SI seconds where
necessary in order to keep the day aligned with the Sun.

The modern UTC time-scale was introduced in 1972, introducing the concept of whole leap-seconds.
Between 1958 and 1972, the definition of UTC was complex, with minor sub-second leaps and
alterations to the length of the notional second. As of 2012, discussions are underway
to change the definition of UTC again, with the potential to remove leap seconds or
introduce other changes.

Given the complexity of accurate timekeeping described above, this Java API defines
its own time-scale, the

Java Time-Scale

.

The Java Time-Scale divides each calendar day into exactly 86400
subdivisions, known as seconds. These seconds may differ from the
SI second. It closely matches the de facto international civil time
scale, the definition of which changes from time to time.

The Java Time-Scale has slightly different definitions for different
segments of the time-line, each based on the consensus international
time scale that is used as the basis for civil time. Whenever the
internationally-agreed time scale is modified or replaced, a new
segment of the Java Time-Scale must be defined for it. Each segment
must meet these requirements:

- the Java Time-Scale shall closely match the underlying international
civil time scale;
- the Java Time-Scale shall exactly match the international civil
time scale at noon each day;
- the Java Time-Scale shall have a precisely-defined relationship to
the international civil time scale.

There are currently, as of 2013, two segments in the Java time-scale.

For the segment from 1972-11-03 (exact boundary discussed below) until
further notice, the consensus international time scale is UTC (with
leap seconds). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is identical to

UTC-SLS

.
This is identical to UTC on days that do not have a leap second.
On days that do have a leap second, the leap second is spread equally
over the last 1000 seconds of the day, maintaining the appearance of
exactly 86400 seconds per day.

For the segment prior to 1972-11-03, extending back arbitrarily far,
the consensus international time scale is defined to be UT1, applied
proleptically, which is equivalent to the (mean) solar time on the
prime meridian (Greenwich). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is
identical to the consensus international time scale. The exact
boundary between the two segments is the instant where UT1 = UTC
between 1972-11-03T00:00 and 1972-11-04T12:00.

Implementations of the Java time-scale using the JSR-310 API are not
required to provide any clock that is sub-second accurate, or that
progresses monotonically or smoothly. Implementations are therefore
not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to otherwise be
aware of leap seconds. JSR-310 does, however, require that
implementations must document the approach they use when defining a
clock representing the current instant.
See

Clock

for details on the available clocks.

The Java time-scale is used for all date-time classes.
This includes

Instant

,

LocalDate

,

LocalTime

,

OffsetDateTime

,

ZonedDateTime

and

Duration

.

This is a

value-based

class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
(

==

), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of

Instant

may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
The

equals

method should be used for comparisons.

---

#### public static final
Instant
MIN

The minimum supported

Instant

, '-1000000000-01-01T00:00Z'.

ZoneOffset

which affect the instant in addition to the local date-time.
The value is also chosen such that the value of the year fits in
an

int

.

---

#### public static final
Instant
MAX

The maximum supported

Instant

, '1000000000-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z'.
This could be used by an application as a "far future" instant.

This is one year later than the maximum

LocalDateTime

.
This provides sufficient values to handle the range of

ZoneOffset

which affect the instant in addition to the local date-time.
The value is also chosen such that the value of the year fits in
an

int

.

### Method Details

#### public static
Instant
now()

Obtains the current instant from the system clock.

This will query the

system UTC clock

to
obtain the current instant.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate time-source for
testing because the clock is effectively hard-coded.

**Returns:**
- the current instant using the system clock, not null

---

#### public static
Instant
now​(
Clock
clock)

Obtains the current instant from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current time.

Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

Obtains an instance of

Instant

using seconds from the
epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z and nanosecond fraction of second.

This method allows an arbitrary number of nanoseconds to be passed in.
The factory will alter the values of the second and nanosecond in order
to ensure that the stored nanosecond is in the range 0 to 999,999,999.
For example, the following will result in exactly the same instant:

```java
Instant.ofEpochSecond(3, 1);
Instant.ofEpochSecond(4, -999_999_999);
Instant.ofEpochSecond(2, 1000_000_001);
```

which this factory converts to an instance of

Instant

.

The conversion extracts the

INSTANT_SECONDS

and

NANO_OF_SECOND

#### public
Instant
truncatedTo​(
TemporalUnit
unit)

Returns a copy of this

Instant

truncated to the specified unit.

Truncating the instant returns a copy of the original with fields
smaller than the specified unit set to zero.

in

toString

.
For example, truncating with the

MINUTES

unit will
round down to the nearest minute, setting the seconds and nanoseconds to zero.

The unit must have a

duration

that divides into the length of a standard day without remainder.
This includes all supplied time units on

ChronoUnit

and

DAYS

. Other units throw an exception.

#### public <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)

Queries this instant using the specified query.

This queries this instant using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:**
- query

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- query

- the query to invoke, not null

**Returns:**
- the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

**Type Parameters:**

---

#### public
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have this instant.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the instant changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.INSTANT_SECONDS

and

ChronoField.NANO_OF_SECOND

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisInstant.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisInstant);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null

**Returns:**
- the adjusted object, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

#### public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Calculates the amount of time until another instant in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

Instant

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified instant.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two instants.
The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

Instant

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
For example, the amount in seconds between two dates can be calculated
using

startInstant.until(endInstant, SECONDS)

.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, SECONDS);
amount = SECONDS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

,

HALF_DAYS

and

DAYS

are supported. Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- until

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- endExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which is converted to an

Instant

, not null
- unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null

An instantaneous point on the time-line.

This class models a single instantaneous point on the time-line.
This might be used to record event time-stamps in the application.

The range of an instant requires the storage of a number larger than a

long

.
To achieve this, the class stores a

long

representing epoch-seconds and an

int

representing nanosecond-of-second, which will always be between 0 and 999,999,999.
The epoch-seconds are measured from the standard Java epoch of

1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

where instants after the epoch have positive values, and earlier instants have negative values.
For both the epoch-second and nanosecond parts, a larger value is always later on the time-line
than a smaller value.

Time-scale

The length of the solar day is the standard way that humans measure time.
This has traditionally been subdivided into 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds,
forming a 86400 second day.

Modern timekeeping is based on atomic clocks which precisely define an SI second
relative to the transitions of a Caesium atom. The length of an SI second was defined
to be very close to the 86400th fraction of a day.

Unfortunately, as the Earth rotates the length of the day varies.
In addition, over time the average length of the day is getting longer as the Earth slows.
As a result, the length of a solar day in 2012 is slightly longer than 86400 SI seconds.
The actual length of any given day and the amount by which the Earth is slowing
are not predictable and can only be determined by measurement.
The UT1 time-scale captures the accurate length of day, but is only available some
time after the day has completed.

The UTC time-scale is a standard approach to bundle up all the additional fractions
of a second from UT1 into whole seconds, known as

leap-seconds

.
A leap-second may be added or removed depending on the Earth's rotational changes.
As such, UTC permits a day to have 86399 SI seconds or 86401 SI seconds where
necessary in order to keep the day aligned with the Sun.

The modern UTC time-scale was introduced in 1972, introducing the concept of whole leap-seconds.
Between 1958 and 1972, the definition of UTC was complex, with minor sub-second leaps and
alterations to the length of the notional second. As of 2012, discussions are underway
to change the definition of UTC again, with the potential to remove leap seconds or
introduce other changes.

Given the complexity of accurate timekeeping described above, this Java API defines
its own time-scale, the

Java Time-Scale

.

The Java Time-Scale divides each calendar day into exactly 86400
subdivisions, known as seconds. These seconds may differ from the
SI second. It closely matches the de facto international civil time
scale, the definition of which changes from time to time.

The Java Time-Scale has slightly different definitions for different
segments of the time-line, each based on the consensus international
time scale that is used as the basis for civil time. Whenever the
internationally-agreed time scale is modified or replaced, a new
segment of the Java Time-Scale must be defined for it. Each segment
must meet these requirements:

- the Java Time-Scale shall closely match the underlying international
civil time scale;
- the Java Time-Scale shall exactly match the international civil
time scale at noon each day;
- the Java Time-Scale shall have a precisely-defined relationship to
the international civil time scale.

There are currently, as of 2013, two segments in the Java time-scale.

For the segment from 1972-11-03 (exact boundary discussed below) until
further notice, the consensus international time scale is UTC (with
leap seconds). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is identical to

UTC-SLS

.
This is identical to UTC on days that do not have a leap second.
On days that do have a leap second, the leap second is spread equally
over the last 1000 seconds of the day, maintaining the appearance of
exactly 86400 seconds per day.

For the segment prior to 1972-11-03, extending back arbitrarily far,
the consensus international time scale is defined to be UT1, applied
proleptically, which is equivalent to the (mean) solar time on the
prime meridian (Greenwich). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is
identical to the consensus international time scale. The exact
boundary between the two segments is the instant where UT1 = UTC
between 1972-11-03T00:00 and 1972-11-04T12:00.

Implementations of the Java time-scale using the JSR-310 API are not
required to provide any clock that is sub-second accurate, or that
progresses monotonically or smoothly. Implementations are therefore
not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to otherwise be
aware of leap seconds. JSR-310 does, however, require that
implementations must document the approach they use when defining a
clock representing the current instant.

not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to otherwise be

implementations must document the approach they use when defining a

#### Time-scale

The length of the solar day is the standard way that humans measure time.
This has traditionally been subdivided into 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds,
forming a 86400 second day.

Modern timekeeping is based on atomic clocks which precisely define an SI second
relative to the transitions of a Caesium atom. The length of an SI second was defined
to be very close to the 86400th fraction of a day.

Unfortunately, as the Earth rotates the length of the day varies.
In addition, over time the average length of the day is getting longer as the Earth slows.
As a result, the length of a solar day in 2012 is slightly longer than 86400 SI seconds.
The actual length of any given day and the amount by which the Earth is slowing
are not predictable and can only be determined by measurement.
The UT1 time-scale captures the accurate length of day, but is only available some
time after the day has completed.

The UTC time-scale is a standard approach to bundle up all the additional fractions
of a second from UT1 into whole seconds, known as

leap-seconds

.
A leap-second may be added or removed depending on the Earth's rotational changes.
As such, UTC permits a day to have 86399 SI seconds or 86401 SI seconds where
necessary in order to keep the day aligned with the Sun.

The modern UTC time-scale was introduced in 1972, introducing the concept of whole leap-seconds.
Between 1958 and 1972, the definition of UTC was complex, with minor sub-second leaps and
alterations to the length of the notional second. As of 2012, discussions are underway
to change the definition of UTC again, with the potential to remove leap seconds or
introduce other changes.

Given the complexity of accurate timekeeping described above, this Java API defines
its own time-scale, the

Java Time-Scale

.

The Java Time-Scale divides each calendar day into exactly 86400
subdivisions, known as seconds. These seconds may differ from the
SI second. It closely matches the de facto international civil time
scale, the definition of which changes from time to time.

The Java Time-Scale has slightly different definitions for different
segments of the time-line, each based on the consensus international
time scale that is used as the basis for civil time. Whenever the
internationally-agreed time scale is modified or replaced, a new
segment of the Java Time-Scale must be defined for it. Each segment
must meet these requirements:

- the Java Time-Scale shall closely match the underlying international
civil time scale;
- the Java Time-Scale shall exactly match the international civil
time scale at noon each day;
- the Java Time-Scale shall have a precisely-defined relationship to
the international civil time scale.

There are currently, as of 2013, two segments in the Java time-scale.

For the segment from 1972-11-03 (exact boundary discussed below) until
further notice, the consensus international time scale is UTC (with
leap seconds). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is identical to

UTC-SLS

.
This is identical to UTC on days that do not have a leap second.
On days that do have a leap second, the leap second is spread equally
over the last 1000 seconds of the day, maintaining the appearance of
exactly 86400 seconds per day.

For the segment prior to 1972-11-03, extending back arbitrarily far,
the consensus international time scale is defined to be UT1, applied
proleptically, which is equivalent to the (mean) solar time on the
prime meridian (Greenwich). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is
identical to the consensus international time scale. The exact
boundary between the two segments is the instant where UT1 = UTC
between 1972-11-03T00:00 and 1972-11-04T12:00.

Implementations of the Java time-scale using the JSR-310 API are not

over the last 1000 seconds of the day, maintaining the appearance of
exactly 86400 seconds per day.

For the segment prior to 1972-11-03, extending back arbitrarily far,
the consensus international time scale is defined to be UT1, applied
proleptically, which is equivalent to the (mean) solar time on the
prime meridian (Greenwich). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is
identical to the consensus international time scale. The exact
boundary between the two segments is the instant where UT1 = UTC
between 1972-11-03T00:00 and 1972-11-04T12:00.

Implementations of the Java time-scale using the JSR-310 API are not
required to provide any clock that is sub-second accurate, or that
progresses monotonically or smoothly. Implementations are therefore
not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to otherwise be
aware of leap seconds. JSR-310 does, however, require that
implementations must document the approach they use when defining a
clock representing the current instant.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- now

```java
public static
Instant
now()
```

Obtains the current instant from the system clock.

This will query the

system UTC clock

to
obtain the current instant.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate time-source for
testing because the clock is effectively hard-coded.

**Returns:** the current instant using the system clock, not null

- now

```java
public static
Instant
now​(
Clock
clock)
```

Obtains the current instant from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current time.

Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

**Parameters:** clock

- the clock to use, not null
**Returns:** the current instant, not null

- ofEpochSecond

```java
public static
Instant
ofEpochSecond​(long epochSecond)
```

Obtains an instance of

Instant

using seconds from the
epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

The nanosecond field is set to zero.

**Parameters:** epochSecond

- the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
**Returns:** an instant, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the instant exceeds the maximum or minimum instant

- ofEpochSecond

```java
public static
Instant
ofEpochSecond​(long epochSecond,
long nanoAdjustment)
```

Obtains an instance of

Instant

using seconds from the
epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z and nanosecond fraction of second.

This method allows an arbitrary number of nanoseconds to be passed in.
The factory will alter the values of the second and nanosecond in order
to ensure that the stored nanosecond is in the range 0 to 999,999,999.
For example, the following will result in exactly the same instant:

```java
Instant.ofEpochSecond(3, 1);
Instant.ofEpochSecond(4, -999_999_999);
Instant.ofEpochSecond(2, 1000_000_001);
```

**Parameters:** epochSecond

- the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
**Parameters:** nanoAdjustment

- the nanosecond adjustment to the number of seconds, positive or negative
**Returns:** an instant, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the instant exceeds the maximum or minimum instant
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- ofEpochMilli

```java
public static
Instant
ofEpochMilli​(long epochMilli)
```

Obtains an instance of

Instant

using milliseconds from the
epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

The seconds and nanoseconds are extracted from the specified milliseconds.

**Parameters:** epochMilli

- the number of milliseconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
**Returns:** an instant, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the instant exceeds the maximum or minimum instant

- from

```java
public static
Instant
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

Instant

from a temporal object.

This obtains an instant based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

Instant

.

The conversion extracts the

INSTANT_SECONDS

and

NANO_OF_SECOND

fields.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

Instant::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the instant, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to an

Instant

- parse

```java
public static
Instant
parse​(
CharSequence
text)
```

Obtains an instance of

Instant

from a text string such as

2007-12-03T10:15:30.00Z

.

The string must represent a valid instant in UTC and is parsed using

DateTimeFormatter.ISO_INSTANT

.

**Parameters:** text

- the text to parse, not null
**Returns:** the parsed instant, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- isSupported

```java
public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if this instant can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The supported fields are:

- NANO_OF_SECOND

MICRO_OF_SECOND

MILLI_OF_SECOND

INSTANT_SECONDS

All other

ChronoField

instances will return false.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the field is supported on this instant, false if not

- isSupported

```java
public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

If the unit is a

ChronoUnit

then the query is implemented here.
The supported units are:

- NANOS

MICROS

MILLIS

SECONDS

MINUTES

HOURS

HALF_DAYS

DAYS

All other

ChronoUnit

instances will return false.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

- range

```java
public
ValueRange
range​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
This instant is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return
appropriate range instances.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the range can be obtained is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** range

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to query the range for, not null
**Returns:** the range of valid values for the field, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the range for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported

- get

```java
public int get​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the value of the specified field from this instant as an

int

.

This queries this instant for the value of the specified field.
The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

This returns an

Instant

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.
The supported fields behave as follows:

- NANO_OF_SECOND

-
Returns an

Instant

with the specified nano-of-second.
The epoch-second will be unchanged.

milli-of-second multiplied by 1,000,000. The epoch-second will be unchanged.

INSTANT_SECONDS

-
Returns an

Instant

with the specified epoch-second.
The nano-of-second will be unchanged.

In all cases, if the new value is outside the valid range of values for the field
then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** field

- the field to set in the result, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field in the result
**Returns:** an

- if numeric overflow occurs

- truncatedTo

```java
public
Instant
truncatedTo​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns a copy of this

Instant

truncated to the specified unit.

Truncating the instant returns a copy of the original with fields
smaller than the specified unit set to zero.
The fields are calculated on the basis of using a UTC offset as seen
in

toString

.
For example, truncating with the

MINUTES

unit will
round down to the nearest minute, setting the seconds and nanoseconds to zero.

The unit must have a

duration

that divides into the length of a standard day without remainder.
This includes all supplied time units on

ChronoUnit

and

DAYS

. Other units throw an exception.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to truncate to, not null

The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling

TemporalAmount.addTo(Temporal)

. The amount implementation is free
to implement the addition in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

. Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully added.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** plus

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.INSTANT_SECONDS

and

ChronoField.NANO_OF_SECOND

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisInstant.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisInstant);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another instant in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

Instant

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified instant.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two instants.
The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

Instant

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
For example, the amount in seconds between two dates can be calculated
using

startInstant.until(endInstant, SECONDS)

.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, SECONDS);
amount = SECONDS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

,

HALF_DAYS

and

DAYS

are supported. Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** until

in interface

Temporal

OffsetDateTime

.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

formed from this instant at the
specified offset from UTC/Greenwich. An exception will be thrown if the
instant is too large to fit into an offset date-time.

This method is equivalent to

OffsetDateTime.ofInstant(this, offset)

.

**Parameters:** offset

of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

If this instant represents a point on the time-line too far in the future
or past to fit in a

long

milliseconds, then an exception is thrown.

If this instant has greater than millisecond precision, then the conversion
will drop any excess precision information as though the amount in nanoseconds
was subject to integer division by one million.

**Returns:** the number of milliseconds since the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- from

```java
public static
Instant
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

Instant

from a temporal object.

This obtains an instant based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

Instant

.

The conversion extracts the

INSTANT_SECONDS

and

NANO_OF_SECOND

fields.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

Instant::from

.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The supported fields are:

- NANO_OF_SECOND

MICRO_OF_SECOND

MILLI_OF_SECOND

INSTANT_SECONDS

All other

ChronoField

instances will return false.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

This returns an

Instant

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.
The supported fields behave as follows:

- NANO_OF_SECOND

-
Returns an

Instant

with the specified nano-of-second.
The epoch-second will be unchanged.

Instant

with the nano-of-second replaced by the specified
milli-of-second multiplied by 1,000,000. The epoch-second will be unchanged.

INSTANT_SECONDS

-
Returns an

Instant

with the specified epoch-second.
The nano-of-second will be unchanged.

In all cases, if the new value is outside the valid range of values for the field
then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** field

- the field to set in the result, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field in the result
**Returns:** an

Instant

based on

this

with the specified field set, not null

**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- truncatedTo

```java
public
Instant
truncatedTo​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns a copy of this

Instant

truncated to the specified unit.

Truncating the instant returns a copy of the original with fields
smaller than the specified unit set to zero.
The fields are calculated on the basis of using a UTC offset as seen
in

toString

.
For example, truncating with the

MINUTES

unit will
round down to the nearest minute, setting the seconds and nanoseconds to zero.

The unit must have a

duration

that divides into the length of a standard day without remainder.
This includes all supplied time units on

ChronoUnit

and

DAYS

. Other units throw an exception.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to truncate to, not null
**Returns:** an

Instant

based on this instant with the time truncated, not null

public
Instant
plus​(
TemporalAmount
amountToAdd)
```

Returns a copy of this instant with the specified amount added.

This returns an

Instant

, based on this one, with the specified amount added.
The amount is typically

Duration

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface.

The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling

TemporalAmount.addTo(Temporal)

. The amount implementation is free
to implement the addition in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

. Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully added.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToAdd

The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.INSTANT_SECONDS

and

ChronoField.NANO_OF_SECOND

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisInstant.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisInstant);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

- until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another instant in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

Instant

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified instant.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two instants.
The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

Instant

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
For example, the amount in seconds between two dates can be calculated
using

startInstant.until(endInstant, SECONDS)

.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, SECONDS);
amount = SECONDS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

,

HALF_DAYS

and

DAYS

are supported. Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** until

in interface

Temporal

OffsetDateTime

.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

formed from this instant at the
specified offset from UTC/Greenwich. An exception will be thrown if the
instant is too large to fit into an offset date-time.

This method is equivalent to

OffsetDateTime.ofInstant(this, offset)

.

**Parameters:** offset

- the offset to combine with, not null
**Returns:** the offset date-time formed from this instant and the specified offset, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported range

ZoneId
zone)
```

Combines this instant with a time-zone to create a

ZonedDateTime

.

This returns an

ZonedDateTime

formed from this instant at the
specified time-zone. An exception will be thrown if the instant is too
large to fit into a zoned date-time.

This method is equivalent to

ZonedDateTime.ofInstant(this, zone)

.

**Parameters:** zone

- the zone to combine with, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time formed from this instant and the specified zone, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

If this instant represents a point on the time-line too far in the future
or past to fit in a

long

milliseconds, then an exception is thrown.

If this instant has greater than millisecond precision, then the conversion
will drop any excess precision information as though the amount in nanoseconds
was subject to integer division by one million.

**Returns:** the number of milliseconds since the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
