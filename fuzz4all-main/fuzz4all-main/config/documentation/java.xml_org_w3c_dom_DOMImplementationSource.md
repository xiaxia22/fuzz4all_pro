# Interface DOMImplementationSource

**Source:** `java.xml\org\w3c\dom\DOMImplementationSource.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
DOMImplementationSource
```

This interface permits a DOM implementer to supply one or more
implementations, based upon requested features and versions, as specified
in

DOM
Features

. Each implemented

DOMImplementationSource

object is
listed in the binding-specific list of available sources so that its

DOMImplementation

objects are made available.

See also the

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification

.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

### Method Details

#### DOMImplementation
getDOMImplementation​(
String
features)

A method to request the first DOM implementation that supports the
specified features.

**Parameters:**
- features

- A string that specifies which features and versions
are required. This is a space separated list in which each feature
is specified by its name optionally followed by a space and a
version number. This method returns the first item of the list
returned by

getDOMImplementationList

. As an example,
the string

"XML 3.0 Traversal +Events 2.0"

will
request a DOM implementation that supports the module "XML" for its
3.0 version, a module that support of the "Traversal" module for
any version, and the module "Events" for its 2.0 version. The
module "Events" must be accessible using the method

Node.getFeature()

and

DOMImplementation.getFeature()

.

**Returns:**
- The first DOM implementation that support the desired
features, or

null

if this source has none.

---

#### DOMImplementationList
getDOMImplementationList​(
String
features)

A method to request a list of DOM implementations that support the
specified features and versions, as specified in .

**Parameters:**
- features

- A string that specifies which features and versions
are required. This is a space separated list in which each feature
is specified by its name optionally followed by a space and a
version number. This is something like: "XML 3.0 Traversal +Events
2.0"

**Returns:**
- A list of DOM implementations that support the desired
features.
