# Interface Text

**Source:** `java.xml\org\w3c\dom\Text.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Text

extends
CharacterData
```

The

Text

interface inherits from

CharacterData

and represents the textual content (termed

character data

in XML) of an

Element

or

Attr

. If there is no
markup inside an element's content, the text is contained in a single
object implementing the

Text

interface that is the only
child of the element. If there is markup, it is parsed into the
information items (elements, comments, etc.) and

Text

nodes
that form the list of children of the element.

When a document is first made available via the DOM, there is only one

Text

node for each block of text. Users may create adjacent

Text

nodes that represent the contents of a given element
without any intervening markup, but should be aware that there is no way
to represent the separations between these nodes in XML or HTML, so they
will not (in general) persist between DOM editing sessions. The

Node.normalize()

method merges any such adjacent

Text

objects into a single node for each block of text.

No lexical check is done on the content of a

Text

node
and, depending on its position in the document, some characters must be
escaped during serialization using character references; e.g. the
characters "<&" if the textual content is part of an element or of
an attribute, the character sequence "]]>" when part of an element,
the quotation mark character " or the apostrophe character ' when part of
an attribute.

### Method Details

#### Text
splitText​(int offset)
throws
DOMException

Breaks this node into two nodes at the specified

offset

,
keeping both in the tree as siblings. After being split, this node
will contain all the content up to the

offset

point. A
new node of the same type, which contains all the content at and
after the

offset

point, is returned. If the original
node had a parent node, the new node is inserted as the next sibling
of the original node. When the

offset

is equal to the
length of this node, the new node has no data.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- The 16-bit unit offset at which to split, starting from

0

.

**Returns:**
- The new node, of the same type as this node.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- INDEX_SIZE_ERR: Raised if the specified offset is negative or greater
than the number of 16-bit units in

data

.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node is readonly.

---

#### boolean isElementContentWhitespace()

Returns whether this text node contains

element content whitespace

, often abusively called "ignorable whitespace". The text node is
determined to contain whitespace in element content during the load
of the document or if validation occurs while using

Document.normalizeDocument()

.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### String
getWholeText()

Returns all text of

Text

nodes logically-adjacent text
nodes to this node, concatenated in document order.

For instance, in the example below

wholeText

on the

Text

node that contains "bar" returns "barfoo", while on
the

Text

node that contains "foo" it returns "barfoo".

```java
+-----+
| <p> |
+-----+
/\
/ \
/-----\ +-------+
| bar | | &ent; |
\-----/ +-------+
|
|
/-----\
| foo |
\-----/
```

Figure: barTextNode.wholeText value is "barfoo"

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### Text
replaceWholeText​(
String
content)
throws
DOMException

Replaces the text of the current node and all logically-adjacent text
nodes with the specified text. All logically-adjacent text nodes are
removed including the current node unless it was the recipient of the
replacement text.

This method returns the node which received the replacement text.
The returned node is:

- null

, when the replacement text is
the empty string;
- the current node, except when the current node is
read-only;
- a new

Text

node of the same type (

Text

or

CDATASection

) as the current node
inserted at the location of the replacement.

For instance, in the above example calling

replaceWholeText

on the

Text

node that
contains "bar" with "yo" in argument results in the following:

```java
+-----+
| <p> |
+-----+
|
|
/-----\
| yo |
\-----/
```

Figure: barTextNode.replaceWholeText("yo") modifies the
textual content of barTextNode with "yo"

Where the nodes to be removed are read-only descendants of an

EntityReference

, the

EntityReference

must
be removed instead of the read-only nodes. If any

EntityReference

to be removed has descendants that are
not

EntityReference

,

Text

, or

CDATASection

nodes, the

replaceWholeText

method must fail before performing any modification of the document,
raising a

DOMException

with the code

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

.

For instance, in the example below calling

replaceWholeText

on the

Text

node that
contains "bar" fails, because the

EntityReference

node
"ent" contains an

Element

node which cannot be removed.

**Parameters:**
- content

- The content of the replacing

Text

node.

**Returns:**
- The

Text

node created with the specified content.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if one of the

Text

nodes being replaced is readonly.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

The

Text

interface inherits from

CharacterData

and represents the textual content (termed

character data

in XML) of an

Element

or

Attr

. If there is no
markup inside an element's content, the text is contained in a single
object implementing the

Text

interface that is the only
child of the element. If there is markup, it is parsed into the
information items (elements, comments, etc.) and

Text

nodes
that form the list of children of the element.

When a document is first made available via the DOM, there is only one

Text

node for each block of text. Users may create adjacent

Text

nodes that represent the contents of a given element
without any intervening markup, but should be aware that there is no way
to represent the separations between these nodes in XML or HTML, so they
will not (in general) persist between DOM editing sessions. The

Node.normalize()

method merges any such adjacent

Text

objects into a single node for each block of text.

No lexical check is done on the content of a

Text

node
and, depending on its position in the document, some characters must be
escaped during serialization using character references; e.g. the
characters "<&" if the textual content is part of an element or of
an attribute, the character sequence "]]>" when part of an element,
the quotation mark character " or the apostrophe character ' when part of
an attribute.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- splitText

```java
Text
splitText​(int offset)
throws
DOMException
```

Breaks this node into two nodes at the specified

offset

,
keeping both in the tree as siblings. After being split, this node
will contain all the content up to the

offset

point. A
new node of the same type, which contains all the content at and
after the

offset

point, is returned. If the original
node had a parent node, the new node is inserted as the next sibling
of the original node. When the

offset

is equal to the
length of this node, the new node has no data.

**Parameters:** offset

- The 16-bit unit offset at which to split, starting from

0

.
**Returns:** The new node, of the same type as this node.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INDEX_SIZE_ERR: Raised if the specified offset is negative or greater
than the number of 16-bit units in

data

.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node is readonly.

- isElementContentWhitespace

```java
boolean isElementContentWhitespace()
```

Returns whether this text node contains

element content whitespace

, often abusively called "ignorable whitespace". The text node is
determined to contain whitespace in element content during the load
of the document or if validation occurs while using

Document.normalizeDocument()

.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getWholeText

```java
String
getWholeText()
```

Returns all text of

Text

nodes logically-adjacent text
nodes to this node, concatenated in document order.

For instance, in the example below

wholeText

on the

Text

node that contains "bar" returns "barfoo", while on
the

Text

node that contains "foo" it returns "barfoo".

```java
+-----+
| <p> |
+-----+
/\
/ \
/-----\ +-------+
| bar | | &ent; |
\-----/ +-------+
|
|
/-----\
| foo |
\-----/
```

Figure: barTextNode.wholeText value is "barfoo"

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- replaceWholeText

```java
Text
replaceWholeText​(
String
content)
throws
DOMException
```

Replaces the text of the current node and all logically-adjacent text
nodes with the specified text. All logically-adjacent text nodes are
removed including the current node unless it was the recipient of the
replacement text.

This method returns the node which received the replacement text.
The returned node is:

- null

, when the replacement text is
the empty string;
- the current node, except when the current node is
read-only;
- a new

Text

node of the same type (

Text

or

CDATASection

) as the current node
inserted at the location of the replacement.

For instance, in the above example calling

replaceWholeText

on the

Text

node that
contains "bar" with "yo" in argument results in the following:

```java
+-----+
| <p> |
+-----+
|
|
/-----\
| yo |
\-----/
```

Figure: barTextNode.replaceWholeText("yo") modifies the
textual content of barTextNode with "yo"

Where the nodes to be removed are read-only descendants of an

EntityReference

, the

EntityReference

must
be removed instead of the read-only nodes. If any

EntityReference

to be removed has descendants that are
not

EntityReference

,

Text

, or

CDATASection

nodes, the

replaceWholeText

method must fail before performing any modification of the document,
raising a

DOMException

with the code

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

.

For instance, in the example below calling

replaceWholeText

on the

Text

node that
contains "bar" fails, because the

EntityReference

node
"ent" contains an

Element

node which cannot be removed.

**Parameters:** content

- The content of the replacing

Text

node.
**Returns:** The

Text

node created with the specified content.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if one of the

Text

nodes being replaced is readonly.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

#### getWholeText

String

getWholeText()

Returns all text of

Text

nodes logically-adjacent text
nodes to this node, concatenated in document order.

For instance, in the example below

wholeText

on the

Text

node that contains "bar" returns "barfoo", while on
the

Text

node that contains "foo" it returns "barfoo".

```java
+-----+
| <p> |
+-----+
/\
/ \
/-----\ +-------+
| bar | | &ent; |
\-----/ +-------+
|
|
/-----\
| foo |
\-----/
```

replaceWholeText

```java
Text
replaceWholeText​(
String
content)
throws
DOMException
```

Replaces the text of the current node and all logically-adjacent text
nodes with the specified text. All logically-adjacent text nodes are
removed including the current node unless it was the recipient of the
replacement text.

This method returns the node which received the replacement text.
The returned node is:

- null

, when the replacement text is
the empty string;
- the current node, except when the current node is
read-only;
- a new

Text

node of the same type (

Text

or

CDATASection

) as the current node
inserted at the location of the replacement.

For instance, in the above example calling

replaceWholeText

on the

Text

node that
contains "bar" with "yo" in argument results in the following:

```java
+-----+
| <p> |
+-----+
|
|
/-----\
| yo |
\-----/
```

Figure: barTextNode.replaceWholeText("yo") modifies the
textual content of barTextNode with "yo"

Where the nodes to be removed are read-only descendants of an

EntityReference

, the

EntityReference

must
be removed instead of the read-only nodes. If any

EntityReference

to be removed has descendants that are
not

EntityReference

,

Text

, or

CDATASection

nodes, the

replaceWholeText

method must fail before performing any modification of the document,
raising a

DOMException

with the code

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

.

For instance, in the example below calling

replaceWholeText

on the

Text

node that
contains "bar" fails, because the

EntityReference

node
"ent" contains an

Element

node which cannot be removed.

**Parameters:** content

- The content of the replacing

Text

node.
**Returns:** The

Text

node created with the specified content.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if one of the

Text

nodes being replaced is readonly.
