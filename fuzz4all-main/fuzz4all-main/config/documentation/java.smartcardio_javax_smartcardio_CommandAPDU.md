# Class CommandAPDU

**Source:** `java.smartcardio\javax\smartcardio\CommandAPDU.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
CommandAPDU

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

A command APDU following the structure defined in ISO/IEC 7816-4.
It consists of a four byte header and a conditional body of variable length.
This class does not attempt to verify that the APDU encodes a semantically
valid command.

Note that when the expected length of the response APDU is specified
in the

constructors

,
the actual length (Ne) must be specified, not its
encoded form (Le). Similarly,

getNe()

returns the actual
value Ne. In other words, a value of 0 means "no data in the response APDU"
rather than "maximum length."

This class supports both the short and extended forms of length
encoding for Ne and Nc. However, note that not all terminals and Smart Cards
are capable of accepting APDUs that use the extended form.

For the header bytes CLA, INS, P1, and P2 the Java type

int

is used to represent the 8 bit unsigned values. In the constructors, only
the 8 lowest bits of the

int

value specified by the application
are significant. The accessor methods always return the byte as an unsigned
value between 0 and 255.

Instances of this class are immutable. Where data is passed in or out
via byte arrays, defensive cloning is performed.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable
