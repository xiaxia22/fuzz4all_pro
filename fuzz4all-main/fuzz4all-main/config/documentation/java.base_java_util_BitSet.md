# Class BitSet

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\BitSet.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
BitSet

extends
Object

implements
Cloneable
,
Serializable
```

This class implements a vector of bits that grows as needed. Each
component of the bit set has a

boolean

value. The
bits of a

BitSet

are indexed by nonnegative integers.
Individual indexed bits can be examined, set, or cleared. One

BitSet

may be used to modify the contents of another

BitSet

through logical AND, logical inclusive OR, and
logical exclusive OR operations.

By default, all bits in the set initially have the value

false

.

Every bit set has a current size, which is the number of bits
of space currently in use by the bit set. Note that the size is
related to the implementation of a bit set, so it may change with
implementation. The length of a bit set relates to logical length
of a bit set and is defined independently of implementation.

Unless otherwise noted, passing a null parameter to any of the
methods in a

BitSet

will result in a

NullPointerException

.

A

BitSet

is not safe for multithreaded use without
external synchronization.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

,

Cloneable

---

#### public int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this bit set. The hash code depends

.

The hash code is defined to be the result of the following
calculation:

```java
public int hashCode() {
long h = 1234;
long[] words = toLongArray();
for (int i = words.length; --i >= 0; )
h ^= words[i] * (i + 1);
return (int)((h >> 32) ^ h);
}
```

Note that the hash code changes if the set of bits is altered.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

- the hash code value for this bit set

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Compares this object against the specified object.
The result is

true

if and only if the argument is
not

null

and is a

Bitset

object that has
exactly the same set of bits set to

true

as this bit
set. That is, for every nonnegative

int

index

k

,

```java
((BitSet)obj).get(k) == this.get(k)
```

must be true. The current sizes of the two bit sets are not compared.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to compare with

**Returns:**
- true

if the objects are the same;

false

otherwise

**See Also:**
- size()

---

#### public
Object
clone()

Cloning this

BitSet

produces a new

BitSet

that is equal to it.
The clone of the bit set is another bit set that has exactly the
same bits set to

true

as this bit set.

**Overrides:**
- clone

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a clone of this bit set

**See Also:**
- size()

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string representation of this bit set. For every index
for which this

BitSet

contains a bit in the set
state, the decimal representation of that index is included in
the result. Such indices are listed in order from lowest to
highest, separated by ", " (a comma and a space) and
surrounded by braces, resulting in the usual mathematical
notation for a set of integers.

Example:

```java
BitSet drPepper = new BitSet();
```

Now

drPepper.toString()

returns "

{}

".

```java
drPepper.set(2);
```

Now

drPepper.toString()

returns "

{2}

".

```java
drPepper.set(4);
drPepper.set(10);
```

Now

drPepper.toString()

returns "

{2, 4, 10}

".

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this bit set

---

#### public
IntStream
stream()

Returns a stream of indices for which this

BitSet

contains a bit in the set state. The indices are returned
in order, from lowest to highest. The size of the stream
is the number of bits in the set state, equal to the value
returned by the

cardinality()

method.

The stream binds to this bit set when the terminal stream operation
commences (specifically, the spliterator for the stream is

late-binding

). If the
bit set is modified during that operation then the result is undefined.

**Returns:**
- a stream of integers representing set indices

**Since:**
- 1.8

```java
public int hashCode() {
long h = 1234;
long[] words = toLongArray();
for (int i = words.length; --i >= 0; )
h ^= words[i] * (i + 1);
return (int)((h >> 32) ^ h);
}
```

Note that the hash code changes if the set of bits is altered.

not

null

and is a

Bitset

object that has
exactly the same set of bits set to

true

as this bit
set. That is, for every nonnegative

int

index

k

,

```java
((BitSet)obj).get(k) == this.get(k)
```

must be true. The current sizes of the two bit sets are not compared.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the object to compare with
**Returns:** true

if the objects are the same;

false

otherwise
**See Also:** size()

- clone

```java
public
Object
clone()
```

Cloning this

BitSet

produces a new

BitSet

**Overrides:** clone

in class

Object
**Returns:** a clone of this bit set
**See Also:** size()

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this bit set. For every index
for which this

BitSet

contains a bit in the set
state, the decimal representation of that index is included in
the result. Such indices are listed in order from lowest to
highest, separated by ", " (a comma and a space) and
surrounded by braces, resulting in the usual mathematical
notation for a set of integers.

Example:

```java
BitSet drPepper = new BitSet();
```

Now

drPepper.toString()

returns "

{}

".

```java
drPepper.set(2);
```

Now

drPepper.toString()

returns "

{2}

".

```java
drPepper.set(4);
drPepper.set(10);
```

Now

drPepper.toString()

returns "

{2, 4, 10}

".

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of this bit set

- stream

```java
public
IntStream
stream()
```

Returns a stream of indices for which this

BitSet

contains a bit in the set state. The indices are returned
in order, from lowest to highest. The size of the stream
is the number of bits in the set state, equal to the value
returned by the

cardinality()

method.

The stream binds to this bit set when the terminal stream operation
commences (specifically, the spliterator for the stream is

late-binding

). If the
bit set is modified during that operation then the result is undefined.

**Returns:** a stream of integers representing set indices

null

and is a

Bitset

object that has
exactly the same set of bits set to

true

as this bit
set. That is, for every nonnegative

int

index

k

,

```java
((BitSet)obj).get(k) == this.get(k)
```

must be true. The current sizes of the two bit sets are not compared.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object

**Returns:** true

if the objects are the same;

false

otherwise
**See Also:** size()

**Overrides:** clone

in class

Object
**Returns:** a clone of this bit set
**See Also:** size()

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this bit set. For every index
for which this

BitSet

contains a bit in the set
state, the decimal representation of that index is included in
the result. Such indices are listed in order from lowest to
highest, separated by ", " (a comma and a space) and
surrounded by braces, resulting in the usual mathematical
notation for a set of integers.

Example:

```java
BitSet drPepper = new BitSet();
```

Now

drPepper.toString()

returns "

{}

".

```java
drPepper.set(2);
```

Now

drPepper.toString()

returns "

{2}

".

```java
drPepper.set(4);
drPepper.set(10);
```

Now

drPepper.toString()

returns "

{2, 4, 10}

".

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of this bit set

- stream

```java
public
IntStream
stream()
```

Returns a stream of indices for which this

BitSet

contains a bit in the set state. The indices are returned
in order, from lowest to highest. The size of the stream
is the number of bits in the set state, equal to the value
returned by the

cardinality()

method.

The stream binds to this bit set when the terminal stream operation
commences (specifically, the spliterator for the stream is

late-binding

). If the
bit set is modified during that operation then the result is undefined.

**Returns:** a stream of integers representing set indices
