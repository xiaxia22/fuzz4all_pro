# Class SctpMultiChannel

**Source:** `jdk.sctp\com\sun\nio\sctp\SctpMultiChannel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
SctpMultiChannel

extends
AbstractSelectableChannel
```

A selectable channel for message-oriented SCTP sockets.

An SCTP multi channel supports many associations on a single socket.
An

SctpMultiChannel

is created by invoking the

open

method of this class. A newly-created channel is open but
not yet bound. An attempt to invoke the

receive

method of an
unbound channel will cause the

NotYetBoundException

to be thrown. An attempt to invoke the

send

method of an
unbound channel will cause it to first invoke the

bind

method.
The address(es) that the channel's socket is bound to can be retrieved by
calling

getAllLocalAddresses

.

Messages may be sent and received without explicitly setting up an
association with the remote peer. The channel will implicitly setup
a new association whenever it sends or receives a message from a remote
peer if there is not already an association with that peer. Upon successful
association setup, an

association changed

notification will be put to the SCTP stack with its

event

parameter set to

COMM_UP

. This notification can be received by invoking

receive

.

Socket options are configured using the

setOption

method. An

SctpMultiChannel

supports the following options:

Socket options

Option Name

Description

SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS

Enables or disables message fragmentation

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

Enables or disables explicit message completion

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

Controls how the presentation of messages occur for the message
receiver

SCTP_INIT_MAXSTREAMS

The maximum number of streams requested by the local endpoint during
association initialization

SCTP_NODELAY

Enables or disable a Nagle-like algorithm

SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR

Requests that the local SCTP stack use the given peer address as the
association primary

SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR

Requests that the peer mark the enclosed address as the association
primary

SO_SNDBUF

The size of the socket send buffer

SO_RCVBUF

The size of the socket receive buffer

SO_LINGER

Linger on close if data is present (when configured in blocking mode
only)

Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported. The list
of options supported is obtained by invoking the

supportedOptions

method.

SCTP multi channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
They support concurrent sending and receiving, though at most one thread may be
sending and at most one thread may be receiving at any given time.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected SctpMultiChannel​(
SelectorProvider
provider)

Initializes a new instance of this class.

**Parameters:**
- provider

- The selector provider for this channel

---

### Method Details

#### public static
SctpMultiChannel
open()
throws
IOException

Opens an SCTP multi channel.

The new channel is unbound.

**Returns:**
- A new SCTP multi channel

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If the SCTP protocol is not supported
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
Set
<
Association
> associations()
throws
IOException

Returns the open associations on this channel's socket.

Only associations whose

COMM_UP

association change event has been received are included
in the returned set of associations. Associations for which a

COMM_LOST

or

SHUTDOWN

association change
event have been receive are removed from the set of associations.

The returned set of associations is a snapshot of the open
associations at the time that this method is invoked.

**Returns:**
- A

Set

containing the open associations, or an empty

Set

if there are none.

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpMultiChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local,
int backlog)
throws
IOException

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for connections.

This method is used to establish a relationship between the socket
and the local address. Once a relationship is established then
the socket remains bound until the channel is closed. This relationship
may not necesssarily be with the address

local

as it may be removed
by

unbindAddress

, but there will always be at least one local
address bound to the channel's socket once an invocation of this method
successfully completes.

Once the channel's socket has been successfully bound to a specific
address, that is not automatically assigned, more addresses
may be bound to it using

bindAddress

, or removed
using

unbindAddress

.

The backlog parameter is the maximum number of pending connections on
the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation specific. An implementation
may impose an implementation specific maximum length or may choose to ignore
the parameter. If the backlog parameter has the value

0

, or a negative
value, then an implementation specific default is used.

**Parameters:**
- local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
- backlog

- The maximum number of pending connections

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
- UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method
denies the operation
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public final
SctpMultiChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local)
throws
IOException

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for connections.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
bind(local, 0);
```

**Parameters:**
- local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
- UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method
denies the operation
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpMultiChannel
bindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException

Adds the given address to the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown.
The

bind

method takes a

SocketAddress

as its
argument which typically contains a port number as well as an address.
Addresses subquently bound using this method are simply addresses as the
SCTP port number remains the same for the lifetime of the channel.

New associations setup after this method successfully completes
will be associated with the given address. Adding addresses to existing
associations is optional functionality. If the endpoint supports
dynamic address reconfiguration then it may send the appropriate message
to the peer to change the peers address lists.

**Parameters:**
- address

- The address to add to the bound addresses for the socket

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
- AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound to the given address
- IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpMultiChannel
unbindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException

Removes the given address from the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown.

If this method is invoked on a channel that does
not have

address

as one of its bound addresses, or that has only
one local address bound to it, then this method throws

IllegalUnbindException

.

The initial address that the channel's socket is bound to using

bind

may be removed from the bound addresses for the
channel's socket.

New associations setup after this method successfully completes
will not be associated with the given address. Removing addresses from
existing associations is optional functionality. If the endpoint supports
dynamic address reconfiguration then it may send the appropriate message
to the peer to change the peers address lists.

**Parameters:**
- address

- The address to remove from the bound addresses for the socket

**Returns:**
- This channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed

address

is not bound to the channel's socket, or the
channel has only one address bound to it
- IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract <T>
MessageInfo
receive​(
ByteBuffer
buffer,
T attachment,

NotificationHandler
<T> handler)
throws
IOException

Receives a message and/or handles a notification via this channel.

If a message or notification is immediately available, or if this
channel is in blocking mode and one eventually becomes available, then
the message or notification is returned or handled, respectively. If this
channel is in non-blocking mode and a message or notification is not
immediately available then this method immediately returns

null

.

If this method receives a message it is copied into the given byte
buffer and an

MessageInfo

is returned.
The message is transferred into the given byte buffer starting at its
current position and the buffers position is incremented by the number of
bytes read. If there are fewer bytes remaining in the buffer than are
required to hold the message, or the underlying input buffer does not
contain the complete message, then an invocation of

isComplete

on the returned

MessageInfo

will return

false

, and more invocations of this
method will be necessary to completely consume the messgae. Only
one message at a time will be partially delivered in any stream. The
socket option

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

controls various aspects of what interlacing of
messages occurs.

If this method receives a notification then the appropriate method of
the given handler, if there is one, is invoked. If the handler returns

CONTINUE

then this method will try to receive another
message/notification, otherwise, if

RETURN

is returned
this method will return

null

. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the
handler it will be propagated up the stack through this method.

If a security manager has been installed then for each new association
setup this method verifies that the associations source address and port
number are permitted by the security manager's

checkAccept

method.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has
already initiated a receive operation upon this channel, then an
invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
complete. The given handler is invoked without holding any locks used
to enforce the above synchronization policy, that way handlers
will not stall other threads from receiving. A handler should not invoke
the

receive

method of this channel, if it does an

IllegalReceiveException

will be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- buffer

- The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
- attachment

- The object to attach to the receive operation; can be

null
- handler

- A handler to handle notifications from the SCTP stack, or

null

to ignore any notifications.

**Returns:**
- The

MessageInfo

,

null

if this channel is in
non-blocking mode and no messages are immediately available or
the notification handler returns

RETURN

after handling
a notification

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
- IllegalReceiveException

- If the given handler invokes the

receive

method of this
channel
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit
new associations to be accepted from the message's sender
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- The type of the attachment

---

#### public abstract int send​(
ByteBuffer
buffer,

MessageInfo
messageInfo)
throws
IOException

Sends a message via this channel.

If this channel is unbound then this method will invoke

bind(null, 0)

before sending any data.

If there is no association existing between this channel's socket
and the intended receiver, identified by the address in the given messageInfo, then one
will be automatically setup to the intended receiver. This is considered
to be Implicit Association Setup. Upon successful association setup, an

association changed

notification will be put to the SCTP stack with its

event

parameter set
to

COMM_UP

. This notification can be received by invoking

receive

.

If this channel is in blocking mode, there is sufficient room in the
underlying output buffer, then the remaining bytes in the given byte
buffer are transmitted as a single message. Sending a message
is atomic unless explicit message completion

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

socket option is enabled on this channel's socket.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode, there is sufficient room
in the underlying output buffer, and an implicit association setup is
required, then the remaining bytes in the given byte buffer are
transmitted as a single message, subject to

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

.
If for any reason the message cannot
be delivered an

association
changed

notification is put on the SCTP stack with its

event

parameter set
to

CANT_START

.

The message is transferred from the byte buffer as if by a regular

write

operation.

If a security manager has been installed then for each new association
setup this method verifies that the given remote peers address and port
number are permitted by the security manager's

checkConnect

method.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has already
initiated a send operation upon this channel, then an invocation of
this method will block until the first operation is complete.

**Parameters:**
- buffer

- The buffer containing the message to be sent
- messageInfo

- Ancillary data about the message to be sent

**Returns:**
- The number of bytes sent, which will be either the number of
bytes that were remaining in the messages buffer when this method
was invoked or, if this channel is non-blocking, may be zero if
there was insufficient room for the message in the underlying
output buffer

**Throws:**
- InvalidStreamException

- If

streamNumber

is negative, or if an association already
exists and

streamNumber

is greater than the maximum number
of outgoing streams
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit
new associations to be setup with the messages's address
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
SctpChannel
branch​(
Association
association)
throws
IOException

Branches off an association.

An application can invoke this method to branch off an association
into a separate channel. The new bound and connected

SctpChannel

will be created for the association. The branched off association will no
longer be part of this channel.

This is particularly useful when, for instance, the application
wishes to have a number of sporadic message senders/receivers remain
under the original SCTP multi channel but branch off those
associations carrying high volume data traffic into their own
separate SCTP channels.

**Parameters:**
- association

- The association to branch off

**Returns:**
- The

SctpChannel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- SctpMultiChannel

```java
protected SctpMultiChannel​(
SelectorProvider
provider)
```

Initializes a new instance of this class.

**Parameters:** provider

- The selector provider for this channel

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- open

```java
public static
SctpMultiChannel
open()
throws
IOException
```

Opens an SCTP multi channel.

The new channel is unbound.

**Returns:** A new SCTP multi channel
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the SCTP protocol is not supported
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- associations

```java
public abstract
Set
<
Association
> associations()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the open associations on this channel's socket.

Only associations whose

COMM_UP

association change event has been received are included
in the returned set of associations. Associations for which a

COMM_LOST

or

SHUTDOWN

association change
event have been receive are removed from the set of associations.

The returned set of associations is a snapshot of the open
associations at the time that this method is invoked.

**Returns:** A

Set

containing the open associations, or an empty

Set

if there are none.
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public abstract
SctpMultiChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local,
int backlog)
throws
IOException
```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for connections.

This method is used to establish a relationship between the socket
and the local address. Once a relationship is established then
the socket remains bound until the channel is closed. This relationship
may not necesssarily be with the address

local

as it may be removed
by

unbindAddress

, but there will always be at least one local
address bound to the channel's socket once an invocation of this method
successfully completes.

Once the channel's socket has been successfully bound to a specific
address, that is not automatically assigned, more addresses
may be bound to it using

bindAddress

, or removed
using

unbindAddress

.

The backlog parameter is the maximum number of pending connections on
the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation specific. An implementation
may impose an implementation specific maximum length or may choose to ignore
the parameter. If the backlog parameter has the value

0

, or a negative
value, then an implementation specific default is used.

**Parameters:** local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
**Parameters:** backlog

- The maximum number of pending connections
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method
denies the operation
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public final
SctpMultiChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local)
throws
IOException
```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for connections.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
bind(local, 0);
```

**Parameters:** local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method
denies the operation
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bindAddress

```java
public abstract
SctpMultiChannel
bindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException
```

Adds the given address to the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown.
The

bind

method takes a

SocketAddress

as its
argument which typically contains a port number as well as an address.
Addresses subquently bound using this method are simply addresses as the
SCTP port number remains the same for the lifetime of the channel.

New associations setup after this method successfully completes
will be associated with the given address. Adding addresses to existing
associations is optional functionality. If the endpoint supports
dynamic address reconfiguration then it may send the appropriate message
to the peer to change the peers address lists.

**Parameters:** address

- The address to add to the bound addresses for the socket
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound to the given address
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- unbindAddress

```java
public abstract
SctpMultiChannel
unbindAddress​(
InetAddress
address)
throws
IOException
```

Removes the given address from the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown.

If this method is invoked on a channel that does
not have

address

as one of its bound addresses, or that has only
one local address bound to it, then this method throws

IllegalUnbindException

.

The initial address that the channel's socket is bound to using

bind

may be removed from the bound addresses for the
channel's socket.

New associations setup after this method successfully completes
will not be associated with the given address. Removing addresses from
existing associations is optional functionality. If the endpoint supports
dynamic address reconfiguration then it may send the appropriate message
to the peer to change the peers address lists.

**Parameters:** address

- The address to remove from the bound addresses for the socket
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** IllegalUnbindException

-

address

is not bound to the channel's socket, or the
channel has only one address bound to it
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If address is

null

or the

wildcard

address
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- getAllLocalAddresses

```java
public abstract
Set
<
SocketAddress
> getAllLocalAddresses()
throws
IOException
```

Returns all of the socket addresses to which this channel's socket is
bound.

**Returns:** All the socket addresses that this channel's socket is
bound to, or an empty

Set

if the channel's socket is not
bound
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If the channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

```java
public abstract
Set
<
SocketAddress
> getRemoteAddresses​(
Association
association)
throws
IOException
```

Returns all of the remote addresses to which the given association on
this channel's socket is connected.

**Parameters:** association

- The association
**Returns:** All of the remote addresses for the given association, or
an empty

Set

if the association has been shutdown
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If the channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- shutdown

```java
public abstract
SctpMultiChannel
shutdown​(
Association
association)
throws
IOException
```

Shutdown an association without closing the channel.

**Parameters:** association

- The association to shutdown
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- getOption

```java
public abstract <T> T getOption​(
SctpSocketOption
<T> name,

Association
association)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the value of a socket option.

Note that some options are retrieved on the channel's socket,
therefore the

association

parameter is not applicable and will be
ignored if given. However, if the option is association specific then the
association must be given.

**Type Parameters:** T

- The type of the socket option value
**Parameters:** name

- The socket option
**Parameters:** association

- The association whose option should be retrieved, or

null

if this option should be retrieved at the channel's socket level.
**Returns:** The value of the socket option. A value of

null

may be
a valid value for some socket options.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the socket option is not supported by this channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**See Also:** SctpStandardSocketOptions

- setOption

```java
public abstract <T>
SctpMultiChannel
setOption​(
SctpSocketOption
<T> name,
T value,

Association
association)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the value of a socket option.

Note that some options are retrieved on the channel's socket,
therefore the

association

parameter is not applicable and will be
ignored if given. However, if the option is association specific then the
association must be given.

**Type Parameters:** T

- The type of the socket option value
**Parameters:** name

- The socket option
**Parameters:** association

- The association whose option should be set, or

null

if this option should be set at the channel's socket level.
**Parameters:** value

- The value of the socket option. A value of

null

may be
a valid value for some socket options.
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the socket option is not supported by this channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the value is not a valid value for this socket option
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**See Also:** SctpStandardSocketOptions

- supportedOptions

```java
public abstract
Set
<
SctpSocketOption
<?>> supportedOptions()
```

Returns a set of the socket options supported by this channel.

This method will continue to return the set of options even after the
channel has been closed.

**Returns:** A set of the socket options supported by this channel

- validOps

```java
public final int validOps()
```

Returns an operation set identifying this channel's supported operations.

SCTP multi channels support reading, and writing, so this
method returns

(

SelectionKey.OP_READ

|

SelectionKey.OP_WRITE

)

.

**Specified by:** validOps

in class

SelectableChannel
**Returns:** The valid-operation set

- receive

```java
public abstract <T>
MessageInfo
receive​(
ByteBuffer
buffer,
T attachment,

NotificationHandler
<T> handler)
throws
IOException
```

Receives a message and/or handles a notification via this channel.

If a message or notification is immediately available, or if this
channel is in blocking mode and one eventually becomes available, then
the message or notification is returned or handled, respectively. If this
channel is in non-blocking mode and a message or notification is not
immediately available then this method immediately returns

null

.

If this method receives a message it is copied into the given byte
buffer and an

MessageInfo

is returned.
The message is transferred into the given byte buffer starting at its
current position and the buffers position is incremented by the number of
bytes read. If there are fewer bytes remaining in the buffer than are
required to hold the message, or the underlying input buffer does not
contain the complete message, then an invocation of

isComplete

on the returned

MessageInfo

will return

false

, and more invocations of this
method will be necessary to completely consume the messgae. Only
one message at a time will be partially delivered in any stream. The
socket option

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

controls various aspects of what interlacing of
messages occurs.

If this method receives a notification then the appropriate method of
the given handler, if there is one, is invoked. If the handler returns

CONTINUE

then this method will try to receive another
message/notification, otherwise, if

RETURN

is returned
this method will return

null

. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the
handler it will be propagated up the stack through this method.

If a security manager has been installed then for each new association
setup this method verifies that the associations source address and port
number are permitted by the security manager's

checkAccept

method.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has
already initiated a receive operation upon this channel, then an
invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
complete. The given handler is invoked without holding any locks used
to enforce the above synchronization policy, that way handlers
will not stall other threads from receiving. A handler should not invoke
the

receive

method of this channel, if it does an

IllegalReceiveException

will be thrown.

**Type Parameters:** T

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** buffer

- The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** attachment

- The object to attach to the receive operation; can be

null
**Parameters:** handler

- A handler to handle notifications from the SCTP stack, or

null

to ignore any notifications.
**Returns:** The

MessageInfo

,

null

if this channel is in
non-blocking mode and no messages are immediately available or
the notification handler returns

RETURN

after handling
a notification
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** IllegalReceiveException

- If the given handler invokes the

receive

method of this
channel
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit
new associations to be accepted from the message's sender
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- send

```java
public abstract int send​(
ByteBuffer
buffer,

MessageInfo
messageInfo)
throws
IOException
```

Sends a message via this channel.

If this channel is unbound then this method will invoke

bind(null, 0)

before sending any data.

If there is no association existing between this channel's socket
and the intended receiver, identified by the address in the given messageInfo, then one
will be automatically setup to the intended receiver. This is considered
to be Implicit Association Setup. Upon successful association setup, an

association changed

notification will be put to the SCTP stack with its

event

parameter set
to

COMM_UP

. This notification can be received by invoking

receive

.

If this channel is in blocking mode, there is sufficient room in the
underlying output buffer, then the remaining bytes in the given byte
buffer are transmitted as a single message. Sending a message
is atomic unless explicit message completion

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

socket option is enabled on this channel's socket.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode, there is sufficient room
in the underlying output buffer, and an implicit association setup is
required, then the remaining bytes in the given byte buffer are
transmitted as a single message, subject to

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

.
If for any reason the message cannot
be delivered an

association
changed

notification is put on the SCTP stack with its

event

parameter set
to

CANT_START

.

The message is transferred from the byte buffer as if by a regular

write

operation.

If a security manager has been installed then for each new association
setup this method verifies that the given remote peers address and port
number are permitted by the security manager's

checkConnect

method.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has already
initiated a send operation upon this channel, then an invocation of
this method will block until the first operation is complete.

**Parameters:** buffer

- The buffer containing the message to be sent
**Parameters:** messageInfo

- Ancillary data about the message to be sent
**Returns:** The number of bytes sent, which will be either the number of
bytes that were remaining in the messages buffer when this method
was invoked or, if this channel is non-blocking, may be zero if
there was insufficient room for the message in the underlying
output buffer
**Throws:** InvalidStreamException

- If

streamNumber

is negative, or if an association already
exists and

streamNumber

is greater than the maximum number
of outgoing streams
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit
new associations to be setup with the messages's address
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- branch

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
branch​(
Association
association)
throws
IOException
```

Branches off an association.

An application can invoke this method to branch off an association
into a separate channel. The new bound and connected

SctpChannel

will be created for the association. The branched off association will no
longer be part of this channel.

This is particularly useful when, for instance, the application
wishes to have a number of sporadic message senders/receivers remain
under the original SCTP multi channel but branch off those
associations carrying high volume data traffic into their own
separate SCTP channels.

**Parameters:** association

- The association to branch off
**Returns:** The

SctpChannel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public abstract
SctpMultiChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local,
int backlog)
throws
IOException
```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for connections.

This method is used to establish a relationship between the socket
and the local address. Once a relationship is established then
the socket remains bound until the channel is closed. This relationship
may not necesssarily be with the address

local

as it may be removed
by

unbindAddress

, but there will always be at least one local
address bound to the channel's socket once an invocation of this method
successfully completes.

Once the channel's socket has been successfully bound to a specific
address, that is not automatically assigned, more addresses
may be bound to it using

bindAddress

, or removed
using

unbindAddress

.

The backlog parameter is the maximum number of pending connections on
the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation specific. An implementation
may impose an implementation specific maximum length or may choose to ignore
the parameter. If the backlog parameter has the value

0

, or a negative
value, then an implementation specific default is used.

**Parameters:** local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address
**Parameters:** backlog

- The maximum number of pending connections
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If this channel is already bound
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported

**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public final
SctpMultiChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local)
throws

```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for connections.

This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
bind(local, 0);
```

**Parameters:** local

- The local address to bind the socket, or

null

to
bind the socket to an automatically assigned socket address

```

Adds the given address to the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

address.
The channel must be first bound using

bind

before
invoking this method, otherwise

NotYetBoundException

is thrown.
The

bind

method takes a

SocketAddress

as its
argument which typically contains a port number as well as an address.
Addresses subquently bound using this method are simply addresses as the
SCTP port number remains the same for the lifetime of the channel.

New associations setup after this method successfully completes
will be associated with the given address. Adding addresses to existing
associations is optional functionality. If the endpoint supports
dynamic address reconfiguration then it may send the appropriate message
to the peer to change the peers address lists.

**Parameters:** address

- The address to add to the bound addresses for the socket
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

```

Removes the given address from the bound addresses for the channel's
socket.

The given address must not be the

wildcard

If this method is invoked on a channel that does
not have

address

as one of its bound addresses, or that has only
one local address bound to it, then this method throws

IllegalUnbindException

.

The initial address that the channel's socket is bound to using

bind

may be removed from the bound addresses for the
channel's socket.

New associations setup after this method successfully completes
will not be associated with the given address. Removing addresses from
existing associations is optional functionality. If the endpoint supports

SCTP multi channels support reading, and writing, so this
method returns

(

SelectionKey.OP_READ

|

SelectionKey.OP_WRITE

)

.

**Specified by:** validOps

in class

SelectableChannel
**Returns:** The valid-operation set

- receive

```java
public abstract <T>
MessageInfo
receive​(
ByteBuffer
buffer,
T attachment,

NotificationHandler
<T> handler)
throws
IOException
```

Receives a message and/or handles a notification via this channel.

If a message or notification is immediately available, or if this
channel is in blocking mode and one eventually becomes available, then
the message or notification is returned or handled, respectively. If this
channel is in non-blocking mode and a message or notification is not
immediately available then this method immediately returns

null

.

If this method receives a message it is copied into the given byte
buffer and an

MessageInfo

is returned.
The message is transferred into the given byte buffer starting at its
current position and the buffers position is incremented by the number of
bytes read. If there are fewer bytes remaining in the buffer than are
required to hold the message, or the underlying input buffer does not
contain the complete message, then an invocation of

isComplete

on the returned

MessageInfo

will return

false

, and more invocations of this
method will be necessary to completely consume the messgae. Only
one message at a time will be partially delivered in any stream. The
socket option

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

controls various aspects of what interlacing of
messages occurs.

If this method receives a notification then the appropriate method of
the given handler, if there is one, is invoked. If the handler returns

CONTINUE

then this method will try to receive another
message/notification, otherwise, if

RETURN

is returned
this method will return

null

. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the
handler it will be propagated up the stack through this method.

If a security manager has been installed then for each new association
setup this method verifies that the associations source address and port
number are permitted by the security manager's

checkAccept

method.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has
already initiated a receive operation upon this channel, then an
invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
complete. The given handler is invoked without holding any locks used
to enforce the above synchronization policy, that way handlers
will not stall other threads from receiving. A handler should not invoke
the

receive

method of this channel, if it does an

IllegalReceiveException

will be thrown.

**Type Parameters:** T

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** buffer

- The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** attachment

- The object to attach to the receive operation; can be

null
**Parameters:** handler

- A handler to handle notifications from the SCTP stack, or

null

to ignore any notifications.
**Returns:** The

MessageInfo

,

null

if this channel is in
non-blocking mode and no messages are immediately available or
the notification handler returns

RETURN

after handling
a notification
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** NotYetBoundException

- If this channel is not yet bound
**Throws:** IllegalReceiveException

- If the given handler invokes the

receive

method of this
channel
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit
new associations to be accepted from the message's sender
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- send

```java
public abstract int send​(
ByteBuffer
buffer,

MessageInfo
messageInfo)
throws
IOException
```

Sends a message via this channel.

If this channel is unbound then this method will invoke

bind(null, 0)

before sending any data.

If there is no association existing between this channel's socket
and the intended receiver, identified by the address in the given messageInfo, then one
will be automatically setup to the intended receiver. This is considered
to be Implicit Association Setup. Upon successful association setup, an

association changed

notification will be put to the SCTP stack with its

event

parameter set
to

COMM_UP

. This notification can be received by invoking

receive

.

If this channel is in blocking mode, there is sufficient room in the
underlying output buffer, then the remaining bytes in the given byte
buffer are transmitted as a single message. Sending a message
is atomic unless explicit message completion

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

socket option is enabled on this channel's socket.

If this channel is in non-blocking mode, there is sufficient room
in the underlying output buffer, and an implicit association setup is
required, then the remaining bytes in the given byte buffer are
transmitted as a single message, subject to

SCTP_EXPLICIT_COMPLETE

.
If for any reason the message cannot
be delivered an

association
changed

notification is put on the SCTP stack with its

event

parameter set
to

CANT_START

.

The message is transferred from the byte buffer as if by a regular

write

operation.

If a security manager has been installed then for each new association
setup this method verifies that the given remote peers address and port
number are permitted by the security manager's

checkConnect

method.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has already
initiated a send operation upon this channel, then an invocation of
this method will block until the first operation is complete.

**Parameters:** buffer

- The buffer containing the message to be sent
**Parameters:** messageInfo

- Ancillary data about the message to be sent
**Returns:** The number of bytes sent, which will be either the number of
bytes that were remaining in the messages buffer when this method
was invoked or, if this channel is non-blocking, may be zero if
there was insufficient room for the message in the underlying
output buffer
**Throws:** InvalidStreamException

- If

streamNumber

is negative, or if an association already
exists and

streamNumber

is greater than the maximum number
of outgoing streams
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit
new associations to be setup with the messages's address
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- branch

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
branch​(
Association
association)
throws
IOException
```

Branches off an association.

An application can invoke this method to branch off an association
into a separate channel. The new bound and connected

SctpChannel

will be created for the association. The branched off association will no
longer be part of this channel.

This is particularly useful when, for instance, the application
wishes to have a number of sporadic message senders/receivers remain
under the original SCTP multi channel but branch off those
associations carrying high volume data traffic into their own
separate SCTP channels.

**Parameters:** association

- The association to branch off
**Returns:** The

SctpChannel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

```

Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket
to listen for connections.

This method is used to establish a relationship between the socket

```

Receives a message and/or handles a notification via this channel.

If a message or notification is immediately available, or if this
channel is in blocking mode and one eventually becomes available, then
the message or notification is returned or handled, respectively. If this
channel is in non-blocking mode and a message or notification is not
immediately available then this method immediately returns

null

.

If this method receives a message it is copied into the given byte
buffer and an

MessageInfo

is returned.
The message is transferred into the given byte buffer starting at its
current position and the buffers position is incremented by the number of
bytes read. If there are fewer bytes remaining in the buffer than are
required to hold the message, or the underlying input buffer does not
contain the complete message, then an invocation of

isComplete

on the returned

MessageInfo

will return

false

, and more invocations of this
method will be necessary to completely consume the messgae. Only
one message at a time will be partially delivered in any stream. The
socket option

SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE

controls various aspects of what interlacing of
messages occurs.

If this method receives a notification then the appropriate method of
the given handler, if there is one, is invoked. If the handler returns

CONTINUE

then this method will try to receive another
message/notification, otherwise, if

RETURN

is returned
this method will return

null

. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the
handler it will be propagated up the stack through this method.

If a security manager has been installed then for each new association
setup this method verifies that the associations source address and port
number are permitted by the security manager's

checkAccept

method.

This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has
already initiated a receive operation upon this channel, then an
invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
complete. The given handler is invoked without holding any locks used
to enforce the above synchronization policy, that way handlers
will not stall other threads from receiving. A handler should not invoke
the

receive

method of this channel, if it does an

IllegalReceiveException

will be thrown.

**Type Parameters:** T

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** buffer

- The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** attachment

- The object to attach to the receive operation; can be

branch

```java
public abstract
SctpChannel
branch​(
Association
association)
throws
IOException
```

Branches off an association.

An application can invoke this method to branch off an association
into a separate channel. The new bound and connected

SctpChannel

will be created for the association. The branched off association will no
longer be part of this channel.

This is particularly useful when, for instance, the application
wishes to have a number of sporadic message senders/receivers remain
under the original SCTP multi channel but branch off those
associations carrying high volume data traffic into their own
separate SCTP channels.

**Parameters:** association

- The association to branch off
**Returns:** The

SctpChannel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
