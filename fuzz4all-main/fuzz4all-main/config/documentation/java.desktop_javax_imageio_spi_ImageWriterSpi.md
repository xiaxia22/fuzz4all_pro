# Class ImageWriterSpi

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\imageio\spi\ImageWriterSpi.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
ImageWriterSpi

extends
ImageReaderWriterSpi
```

The service provider interface (SPI) for

ImageWriter

s.
For more information on service provider classes, see the class comment
for the

IIORegistry

class.

Each

ImageWriterSpi

provides several types of information
about the

ImageWriter

class with which it is associated.

The name of the vendor who defined the SPI class and a
brief description of the class are available via the

getVendorName

,

getDescription

,
and

getVersion

methods.
These methods may be internationalized to provide locale-specific
output. These methods are intended mainly to provide short,
human-writable information that might be used to organize a pop-up
menu or other list.

Lists of format names, file suffixes, and MIME types associated
with the service may be obtained by means of the

getFormatNames

,

getFileSuffixes

, and

getMIMEType

methods. These methods may be used to
identify candidate

ImageWriter

s for writing a
particular file or stream based on manual format selection, file
naming, or MIME associations.

A more reliable way to determine which

ImageWriter

s
are likely to be able to parse a particular data stream is provided
by the

canEncodeImage

method. This methods allows the
service provider to inspect the actual image contents.

Finally, an instance of the

ImageWriter

class
associated with this service provider may be obtained by calling
the

createWriterInstance

method. Any heavyweight
initialization, such as the loading of native libraries or creation
of large tables, should be deferred at least until the first
invocation of this method.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** RegisterableService

### Method Details

#### public boolean isFormatLossless()

Returns

true

if the format that this writer
outputs preserves pixel data bit-accurately. The default
implementation returns

true

.

**Returns:**
- true

if the format preserves full pixel
accuracy.

---

#### public
Class
<?>[] getOutputTypes()

Returns an array of

Class

objects indicating what
types of objects may be used as arguments to the writer's

setOutput

method.

For most writers, which only output to an

ImageOutputStream

, a single-element array
containing

ImageOutputStream.class

should be
returned.

**Returns:**
- a non-

null

array of

Class

objects of length at least 1.

---

#### public abstract boolean canEncodeImage​(
ImageTypeSpecifier
type)

Returns

true

if the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider is able to
encode an image with the given layout. The layout
(

i.e.

, the image's

SampleModel

and

ColorModel

) is described by an

ImageTypeSpecifier

object.

A return value of

true

is not an absolute
guarantee of successful encoding; the encoding process may still
produce errors due to factors such as I/O errors, inconsistent
or malformed data structures, etc. The intent is that a
reasonable inspection of the basic structure of the image be
performed in order to determine if it is within the scope of
the encoding format. For example, a service provider for a
format that can only encode greyscale would return

false

if handed an RGB

BufferedImage

.
Similarly, a service provider for a format that can encode
8-bit RGB imagery might refuse to encode an image with an
associated alpha channel.

Different

ImageWriter

s, and thus service
providers, may choose to be more or less strict. For example,
they might accept an image with premultiplied alpha even though
it will have to be divided out of each pixel, at some loss of
precision, in order to be stored.

**Parameters:**
- type

- an

ImageTypeSpecifier

specifying the
layout of the image to be written.

**Returns:**
- true

if this writer is likely to be able
to encode images with the given layout.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

type

is

null

.

---

#### public boolean canEncodeImage​(
RenderedImage
im)

Returns

true

if the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider is able to
encode the given

RenderedImage

instance. Note
that this includes instances of

java.awt.image.BufferedImage

.

See the discussion for

canEncodeImage(ImageTypeSpecifier)

for information
on the semantics of this method.

**Parameters:**
- im

- an instance of

RenderedImage

to be encoded.

**Returns:**
- true

if this writer is likely to be able
to encode this image.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

im

is

null

.

---

#### public
ImageWriter
createWriterInstance()
throws
IOException

Returns an instance of the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state as if
its

reset

method had been called.

The default implementation simply returns

createWriterInstance(null)

.

**Returns:**
- an

ImageWriter

instance.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an error occurs during loading,
or initialization of the writer class, or during instantiation
or initialization of the writer object.

---

#### public abstract
ImageWriter
createWriterInstance​(
Object
extension)
throws
IOException

Returns an instance of the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state
as if its

reset

method had been called.

An

Object

may be supplied to the plug-in at
construction time. The nature of the object is entirely
plug-in specific.

Typically, a plug-in will implement this method using code
such as

return new MyImageWriter(this)

.

**Parameters:**
- extension

- a plug-in specific extension object, which may
be

null

.

**Returns:**
- an

ImageWriter

instance.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if the attempt to instantiate
the writer fails.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the

ImageWriter

's constructor throws an

IllegalArgumentException

to indicate that the
extension object is unsuitable.

---

#### public boolean isOwnWriter​(
ImageWriter
writer)

Returns

true

if the

ImageWriter

object
passed in is an instance of the

ImageWriter

associated with this service provider.

**Parameters:**
- writer

- an

ImageWriter

instance.

**Returns:**
- true

if

writer

is recognized

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

writer

is

null

.

---

#### public
String
[] getImageReaderSpiNames()

Returns an array of

String

s containing all the
fully qualified names of all the

ImageReaderSpi

classes that can understand the internal metadata
representation used by the

ImageWriter

associated
with this service provider, or

null

if there are
no such

ImageReaders

specified. If a
non-

null

value is returned, it must have non-zero
length.

The first item in the array must be the name of the service
provider for the "preferred" reader, as it will be used to
instantiate the

ImageReader

returned by

ImageIO.getImageReader(ImageWriter)

.

This mechanism may be used to obtain

ImageReaders

that will generated non-pixel
meta-data (see

IIOExtraDataInfo

) in a structure
understood by an

ImageWriter

. By reading the
image and obtaining this data from one of the

ImageReaders

obtained with this method and passing
it on to the

ImageWriter

, a client program can
read an image, modify it in some way, and write it back out
preserving all meta-data, without having to understand anything
about the internal structure of the meta-data, or even about
the image format.

**Returns:**
- an array of

String

s of length at least 1
containing names of

ImageReaderSpi

s, or

null

.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- isFormatLossless

```java
public boolean isFormatLossless()
```

Returns

true

if the format that this writer
outputs preserves pixel data bit-accurately. The default
implementation returns

true

.

**Returns:** true

if the format preserves full pixel
accuracy.

- getOutputTypes

```java
public
Class
<?>[] getOutputTypes()
```

Returns an array of

Class

objects indicating what
types of objects may be used as arguments to the writer's

setOutput

method.

For most writers, which only output to an

ImageOutputStream

, a single-element array
containing

ImageOutputStream.class

should be
returned.

**Returns:** a non-

null

array of

Class

objects of length at least 1.

- canEncodeImage

```java
public abstract boolean canEncodeImage​(
ImageTypeSpecifier
type)
```

Returns

true

if the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider is able to
encode an image with the given layout. The layout
(

i.e.

, the image's

SampleModel

and

ColorModel

) is described by an

ImageTypeSpecifier

object.

A return value of

true

is not an absolute
guarantee of successful encoding; the encoding process may still
produce errors due to factors such as I/O errors, inconsistent
or malformed data structures, etc. The intent is that a
reasonable inspection of the basic structure of the image be
performed in order to determine if it is within the scope of
the encoding format. For example, a service provider for a
format that can only encode greyscale would return

false

if handed an RGB

BufferedImage

.
Similarly, a service provider for a format that can encode
8-bit RGB imagery might refuse to encode an image with an
associated alpha channel.

Different

ImageWriter

s, and thus service
providers, may choose to be more or less strict. For example,
they might accept an image with premultiplied alpha even though
it will have to be divided out of each pixel, at some loss of
precision, in order to be stored.

**Parameters:** type

- an

ImageTypeSpecifier

specifying the
layout of the image to be written.
**Returns:** true

if this writer is likely to be able
to encode images with the given layout.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

type

is

null

.

- canEncodeImage

```java
public boolean canEncodeImage​(
RenderedImage
im)
```

Returns

true

if the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider is able to
encode the given

RenderedImage

instance. Note
that this includes instances of

java.awt.image.BufferedImage

.

See the discussion for

canEncodeImage(ImageTypeSpecifier)

for information
on the semantics of this method.

**Parameters:** im

- an instance of

RenderedImage

to be encoded.
**Returns:** true

if this writer is likely to be able
to encode this image.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

im

is

null

.

- createWriterInstance

```java
public
ImageWriter
createWriterInstance()
throws
IOException
```

Returns an instance of the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state as if
its

reset

method had been called.

The default implementation simply returns

createWriterInstance(null)

.

**Returns:** an

ImageWriter

instance.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during loading,
or initialization of the writer class, or during instantiation
or initialization of the writer object.

- createWriterInstance

```java
public abstract
ImageWriter
createWriterInstance​(
Object
extension)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an instance of the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state
as if its

reset

method had been called.

An

Object

may be supplied to the plug-in at
construction time. The nature of the object is entirely
plug-in specific.

Typically, a plug-in will implement this method using code
such as

return new MyImageWriter(this)

.

**Parameters:** extension

- a plug-in specific extension object, which may
be

null

.
**Returns:** an

ImageWriter

instance.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the attempt to instantiate
the writer fails.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

ImageWriter

's constructor throws an

IllegalArgumentException

to indicate that the
extension object is unsuitable.

- isOwnWriter

```java
public boolean isOwnWriter​(
ImageWriter
writer)
```

Returns

true

if the

ImageWriter

object
passed in is an instance of the

ImageWriter

associated with this service provider.

**Parameters:** writer

- an

ImageWriter

instance.
**Returns:** true

if

writer

is recognized
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

writer

is

null

.

- getImageReaderSpiNames

```java
public
String
[] getImageReaderSpiNames()
```

Returns an array of

String

s containing all the
fully qualified names of all the

ImageReaderSpi

classes that can understand the internal metadata
representation used by the

ImageWriter

associated
with this service provider, or

null

if there are
no such

ImageReaders

specified. If a
non-

null

value is returned, it must have non-zero
length.

The first item in the array must be the name of the service
provider for the "preferred" reader, as it will be used to
instantiate the

ImageReader

returned by

ImageIO.getImageReader(ImageWriter)

.

This mechanism may be used to obtain

ImageReaders

that will generated non-pixel
meta-data (see

IIOExtraDataInfo

) in a structure
understood by an

ImageWriter

. By reading the
image and obtaining this data from one of the

ImageReaders

obtained with this method and passing
it on to the

ImageWriter

, a client program can
read an image, modify it in some way, and write it back out
preserving all meta-data, without having to understand anything
about the internal structure of the meta-data, or even about
the image format.

**Returns:** an array of

String

s of length at least 1
containing names of

ImageReaderSpi

s, or

null

.

,

ImageReaderSpi.getImageWriterSpiNames()

SampleModel

and

ColorModel

) is described by an

ImageTypeSpecifier

object.

A return value of

true

is not an absolute
guarantee of successful encoding; the encoding process may still
produce errors due to factors such as I/O errors, inconsistent
or malformed data structures, etc. The intent is that a
reasonable inspection of the basic structure of the image be
performed in order to determine if it is within the scope of
the encoding format. For example, a service provider for a
format that can only encode greyscale would return

false

if handed an RGB

BufferedImage

.
Similarly, a service provider for a format that can encode
8-bit RGB imagery might refuse to encode an image with an
associated alpha channel.

Different

ImageWriter

s, and thus service
providers, may choose to be more or less strict. For example,
they might accept an image with premultiplied alpha even though
it will have to be divided out of each pixel, at some loss of
precision, in order to be stored.

**Parameters:** type

- an

ImageTypeSpecifier

specifying the
layout of the image to be written.
**Returns:** true

if this writer is likely to be able
to encode images with the given layout.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

type

is

null

.

- canEncodeImage

```java
public boolean canEncodeImage​(
RenderedImage
im)
```

Returns

true

if the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider is able to
encode the given

RenderedImage

instance. Note
that this includes instances of

java.awt.image.BufferedImage

.

See the discussion for

canEncodeImage(ImageTypeSpecifier)

for information
on the semantics of this method.

**Parameters:** im

- an instance of

RenderedImage

to be encoded.
**Returns:** true

if this writer is likely to be able
to encode this image.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

im

is

null

.

- createWriterInstance

```java
public
ImageWriter
createWriterInstance()
throws
IOException
```

Returns an instance of the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state as if
its

reset

method had been called.

The default implementation simply returns

createWriterInstance(null)

.

**Returns:** an

ImageWriter

instance.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during loading,
or initialization of the writer class, or during instantiation
or initialization of the writer object.

- createWriterInstance

```java
public abstract
ImageWriter
createWriterInstance​(
Object
extension)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an instance of the

ImageWriter

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state
as if its

reset

method had been called.

An

Object

may be supplied to the plug-in at
construction time. The nature of the object is entirely
plug-in specific.

Typically, a plug-in will implement this method using code
such as

return new MyImageWriter(this)

.

**Parameters:** extension

- a plug-in specific extension object, which may
be

null

.
**Returns:** an

ImageWriter

instance.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the attempt to instantiate
the writer fails.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

ImageWriter

's constructor throws an

IllegalArgumentException

to indicate that the
extension object is unsuitable.

- isOwnWriter

```java
public boolean isOwnWriter​(
ImageWriter
writer)
```

Returns

true

if the

ImageWriter

object
passed in is an instance of the

ImageWriter

associated with this service provider.

**Parameters:** writer

- an

ImageWriter

instance.
**Returns:** true

if

writer

is recognized
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

writer

is

null

.

- getImageReaderSpiNames

```java
public
String
[] getImageReaderSpiNames()
```

Returns an array of

String

s containing all the
fully qualified names of all the

ImageReaderSpi

classes that can understand the internal metadata
representation used by the

ImageWriter

associated
with this service provider, or

null

if there are
no such

ImageReaders

specified. If a
non-

null

value is returned, it must have non-zero
length.

The first item in the array must be the name of the service
provider for the "preferred" reader, as it will be used to
instantiate the

ImageReader

returned by

ImageIO.getImageReader(ImageWriter)

.

This mechanism may be used to obtain

ImageReaders

that will generated non-pixel
meta-data (see

IIOExtraDataInfo

) in a structure
understood by an

ImageWriter

. By reading the
image and obtaining this data from one of the

ImageReaders

obtained with this method and passing
it on to the

ImageWriter

, a client program can
read an image, modify it in some way, and write it back out
preserving all meta-data, without having to understand anything
about the internal structure of the meta-data, or even about
the image format.

**Returns:** an array of

String

s of length at least 1
containing names of

ImageReaderSpi

s, or

null

.

Class

objects indicating what
types of objects may be used as arguments to the writer's

setOutput

method.

For most writers, which only output to an

ImageOutputStream

, a single-element array
containing

ImageOutputStream.class

should be
returned.

**Returns:** a non-

null

array of

Class

objects of length at least 1.
