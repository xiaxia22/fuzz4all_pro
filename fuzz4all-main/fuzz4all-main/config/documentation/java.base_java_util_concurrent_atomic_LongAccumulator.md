# Class LongAccumulator

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\concurrent\atomic\LongAccumulator.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
LongAccumulator

extends
Number

implements
Serializable
```

One or more variables that together maintain a running

long

value updated using a supplied function. When updates (method

accumulate(long)

) are contended across threads, the set of variables
may grow dynamically to reduce contention. Method

get()

(or, equivalently,

longValue()

) returns the current value
across the variables maintaining updates.

This class is usually preferable to

AtomicLong

when
multiple threads update a common value that is used for purposes such
as collecting statistics, not for fine-grained synchronization
control. Under low update contention, the two classes have similar
characteristics. But under high contention, expected throughput of
this class is significantly higher, at the expense of higher space
consumption.

The order of accumulation within or across threads is not
guaranteed and cannot be depended upon, so this class is only
applicable to functions for which the order of accumulation does
not matter. The supplied accumulator function should be
side-effect-free, since it may be re-applied when attempted updates
fail due to contention among threads. For predictable results, the
accumulator function should be associative and commutative. The
function is applied with an existing value (or identity) as one
argument, and a given update as the other argument. For example,
to maintain a running maximum value, you could supply

Long::max

along with

Long.MIN_VALUE

as the identity.

Class

LongAdder

provides analogs of the functionality of
this class for the common special case of maintaining counts and
sums. The call

new LongAdder()

is equivalent to

new
LongAccumulator((x, y) -> x + y, 0L)

.

This class extends

Number

, but does

not

define
methods such as

equals

,

hashCode

and

compareTo

because instances are expected to be mutated, and so are
not useful as collection keys.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public LongAccumulator​(
LongBinaryOperator
accumulatorFunction,
long identity)

Creates a new instance using the given accumulator function
and identity element.

**Parameters:**
- accumulatorFunction

- a side-effect-free function of two arguments
- identity

- identity (initial value) for the accumulator function

---

### Method Details

#### public void accumulate​(long x)

Updates with the given value.

**Parameters:**
- x

- the value

---

#### public long get()

Returns the current value. The returned value is

NOT

an atomic snapshot; invocation in the absence of concurrent
updates returns an accurate result, but concurrent updates that
occur while the value is being calculated might not be
incorporated.

**Returns:**
- the current value

---

#### public void reset()

Resets variables maintaining updates to the identity value.
This method may be a useful alternative to creating a new
updater, but is only effective if there are no concurrent
updates. Because this method is intrinsically racy, it should
only be used when it is known that no threads are concurrently
updating.

---

#### public long getThenReset()

Equivalent in effect to

get()

followed by

reset()

. This method may apply for example during quiescent
points between multithreaded computations. If there are
updates concurrent with this method, the returned value is

not

guaranteed to be the final value occurring before
the reset.

**Returns:**
- the value before reset

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns the String representation of the current value.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- the String representation of the current value

---

#### public long longValue()

Equivalent to

get()

.

**Specified by:**
- longValue

in class

Number

**Returns:**
- the current value

---

#### public int intValue()

Returns the

current value

as an

int

after a narrowing primitive conversion.

**Specified by:**
- intValue

in class

Number

**Returns:**
- the numeric value represented by this object after conversion
to type

int

.

---

#### public float floatValue()

Returns the

current value

as a

float

after a widening primitive conversion.

**Specified by:**
- floatValue

in class

Number

**Returns:**
- the numeric value represented by this object after conversion
to type

float

.

---

#### public double doubleValue()

Returns the

current value

as a

double

after a widening primitive conversion.

**Specified by:**
- doubleValue

in class

Number

**Returns:**
- the numeric value represented by this object after conversion
to type

double

.
