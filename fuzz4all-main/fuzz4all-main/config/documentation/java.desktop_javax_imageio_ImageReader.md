# Class ImageReader

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\imageio\ImageReader.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
ImageReader

extends
Object
```

An abstract superclass for parsing and decoding of images. This
class must be subclassed by classes that read in images in the
context of the Java Image I/O framework.

ImageReader

objects are normally instantiated by
the service provider interface (SPI) class for the specific format.
Service provider classes (e.g., instances of

ImageReaderSpi

) are registered with the

IIORegistry

, which uses them for format recognition
and presentation of available format readers and writers.

When an input source is set (using the

setInput

method), it may be marked as "seek forward only". This setting
means that images contained within the input source will only be
read in order, possibly allowing the reader to avoid caching
portions of the input containing data associated with images that
have been read previously.

**See Also:** ImageWriter

,

IIORegistry

,

### Constructor Details

#### protected ImageReader​(
ImageReaderSpi
originatingProvider)

Constructs an

ImageReader

and sets its

originatingProvider

field to the supplied value.

Subclasses that make use of extensions should provide a
constructor with signature

(ImageReaderSpi,Object)

in order to retrieve the extension object. If
the extension object is unsuitable, an

IllegalArgumentException

should be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- originatingProvider

- the

ImageReaderSpi

that is
invoking this constructor, or

null

.

---

### Method Details

#### public
String
getFormatName()
throws
IOException

Returns a

String

identifying the format of the
input source.

The default implementation returns

originatingProvider.getFormatNames()[0]

.
Implementations that may not have an originating service
provider, or which desire a different naming policy should
override this method.

**Returns:**
- the format name, as a

String

.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an error occurs reading the
information from the input source.

---

#### public
ImageReaderSpi
getOriginatingProvider()

Returns the

ImageReaderSpi

that was passed in on
the constructor. Note that this value may be

null

.

**Returns:**
- an

ImageReaderSpi

, or

null

.

**See Also:**
- ImageReaderSpi

---

#### public void setInput​(
Object
input,
boolean seekForwardOnly,
boolean ignoreMetadata)

Sets the input source to use to the given

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

.
The input source must be set before any of the query or read
methods are used. If

input

is

null

,
any currently set input source will be removed. In any case,
the value of

minIndex

will be initialized to 0.

The

seekForwardOnly

parameter controls whether
the value returned by

getMinIndex

will be
increased as each image (or thumbnail, or image metadata) is
read. If

seekForwardOnly

is true, then a call to

read(index)

will throw an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

if

index < this.minIndex

;
otherwise, the value of

minIndex

will be set to

index

. If

seekForwardOnly

is

false

, the value of

minIndex

will remain 0 regardless of any read
operations.

The

ignoreMetadata

parameter, if set to

true

, allows the reader to disregard any metadata
encountered during the read. Subsequent calls to the

getStreamMetadata

and

getImageMetadata

methods may return

null

, and an

IIOImage

returned from

readAll

may return

null

from their

getMetadata

method. Setting this parameter may
allow the reader to work more efficiently. The reader may
choose to disregard this setting and return metadata normally.

Subclasses should take care to remove any cached
information based on the previous stream, such as header
information or partially decoded image data.

Use of a general

Object

other than an

ImageInputStream

is intended for readers that
interact directly with a capture device or imaging protocol.
The set of legal classes is advertised by the reader's service
provider's

getInputTypes

method; most readers
will return a single-element array containing only

ImageInputStream.class

to indicate that they
accept only an

ImageInputStream

.

The default implementation checks the

input

argument against the list returned by

originatingProvider.getInputTypes()

and fails
if the argument is not an instance of one of the classes
in the list. If the originating provider is set to

null

, the input is accepted only if it is an

ImageInputStream

.

**Parameters:**
- input

- the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

to use for future decoding.
- seekForwardOnly

- if

true

, images and metadata
may only be read in ascending order from this input source.
- ignoreMetadata

- if

true

, metadata
may be ignored during reads.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

input

is
not an instance of one of the classes returned by the
originating service provider's

getInputTypes

method, or is not an

ImageInputStream

.

**See Also:**
- ImageInputStream

,

getInput()

,

ImageReaderSpi.getInputTypes()

#### public void setInput​(
Object
input,
boolean seekForwardOnly)

Sets the input source to use to the given

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

.
The input source must be set before any of the query or read
methods are used. If

input

is

null

,
any currently set input source will be removed. In any case,
the value of

minIndex

will be initialized to 0.

The

seekForwardOnly

parameter controls whether
the value returned by

getMinIndex

will be
increased as each image (or thumbnail, or image metadata) is
read. If

seekForwardOnly

is true, then a call to

read(index)

will throw an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

if

index < this.minIndex

;
otherwise, the value of

minIndex

will be set to

index

. If

seekForwardOnly

is

false

, the value of

minIndex

will remain 0 regardless of any read
operations.

This method is equivalent to

setInput(input, seekForwardOnly, false)

.

**Parameters:**
- input

- the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

to use for future decoding.
- seekForwardOnly

- if

true

, images and metadata
may only be read in ascending order from this input source.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

input

is
not an instance of one of the classes returned by the
originating service provider's

getInputTypes

method, or is not an

ImageInputStream

.

**See Also:**
- getInput()

---

#### public void setInput​(
Object
input)

Sets the input source to use to the given

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

.
The input source must be set before any of the query or read
methods are used. If

input

is

null

,
any currently set input source will be removed. In any case,
the value of

minIndex

will be initialized to 0.

This method is equivalent to

setInput(input, false, false)

.

**Parameters:**
- input

- the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

to use for future decoding.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

input

is
not an instance of one of the classes returned by the
originating service provider's

getInputTypes

method, or is not an

ImageInputStream

.

**See Also:**
- getInput()

---

#### public
Object
getInput()

Returns the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

previously set as the input source. If the
input source has not been set,

null

is returned.

**Returns:**
- the

Object

that will be used for future
decoding, or

null

.

**See Also:**
- ImageInputStream

,

setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

---

#### public boolean isSeekForwardOnly()

Returns

true

if the current input source has been
marked as seek forward only by passing

true

as the

seekForwardOnly

argument to the

setInput

method.

**Returns:**
- true

if the input source is seek forward
only.

**See Also:**
- setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

---

#### public boolean isIgnoringMetadata()

Returns

true

if the current input source has been
marked as allowing metadata to be ignored by passing

true

as the

ignoreMetadata

argument
to the

setInput

method.

**Returns:**
- true

if the metadata may be ignored.

**See Also:**
- setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

---

#### public int getMinIndex()

Returns the lowest valid index for reading an image, thumbnail,
or image metadata. If

seekForwardOnly()

is

false

, this value will typically remain 0,
indicating that random access is possible. Otherwise, it will
contain the value of the most recently accessed index, and
increase in a monotonic fashion.

**Returns:**
- the minimum legal index for reading.

---

#### public
Locale
[] getAvailableLocales()

Returns an array of

Locale

s that may be used to
localize warning listeners and compression settings. A return
value of

null

indicates that localization is not
supported.

The default implementation returns a clone of the

availableLocales

instance variable if it is
non-

null

, or else returns

null

.

**Returns:**
- an array of

Locale

s that may be used as
arguments to

setLocale

, or

null

.

---

#### public void setLocale​(
Locale
locale)

Sets the current

Locale

of this

ImageReader

to the given value. A value of

null

removes any previous setting, and indicates
that the reader should localize as it sees fit.

**Parameters:**
- locale

- the desired

Locale

, or

null

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

locale

is
non-

null

but is not one of the values returned by

getAvailableLocales

.

**See Also:**
- getLocale()

---

#### public
Locale
getLocale()

Returns the currently set

Locale

, or

null

if none has been set.

**Returns:**
- the current

Locale

, or

null

.

**See Also:**
- setLocale(java.util.Locale)

---

#### public abstract int getNumImages​(boolean allowSearch)
throws
IOException

Returns the number of images, not including thumbnails, available
from the current input source.

Note that some image formats (such as animated GIF) do not
specify how many images are present in the stream. Thus
determining the number of images will require the entire stream
to be scanned and may require memory for buffering. If images
are to be processed in order, it may be more efficient to
simply call

read

with increasing indices until an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

is thrown to indicate
that no more images are available. The

allowSearch

parameter may be set to

false

to indicate that an exhaustive search is not
desired; the return value will be

-1

to indicate
that a search is necessary. If the input has been specified
with

seekForwardOnly

set to

true

,
this method throws an

IllegalStateException

if

allowSearch

is set to

true

.

**Parameters:**
- allowSearch

- if

true

, the true number of
images will be returned even if a search is required. If

false

, the reader may return

-1

without performing the search.

**Returns:**
- the number of images, as an

int

, or

-1

if

allowSearch

is

false

and a search would be required.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set,
or if the input has been specified with

seekForwardOnly

set to

true

.
- IOException

- if an error occurs reading the
information from the input source.

**See Also:**
- setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

---

#### public abstract int getWidth​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns the width in pixels of the given image within the input
source.

If the image can be rendered to a user-specified size, then
this method returns the default width.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.

**Returns:**
- the width of the image, as an

int

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs reading the width
information from the input source.

---

#### public abstract int getHeight​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns the height in pixels of the given image within the
input source.

If the image can be rendered to a user-specified size, then
this method returns the default height.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.

**Returns:**
- the height of the image, as an

int

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs reading the height
information from the input source.

---

#### public boolean isRandomAccessEasy​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns

true

if the storage format of the given
image places no inherent impediment on random access to pixels.
For most compressed formats, such as JPEG, this method should
return

false

, as a large section of the image in
addition to the region of interest may need to be decoded.

This is merely a hint for programs that wish to be
efficient; all readers must be able to read arbitrary regions
as specified in an

ImageReadParam

.

Note that formats that return

false

from
this method may nonetheless allow tiling (

e.g.

Restart
Markers in JPEG), and random access will likely be reasonably
efficient on tiles. See

isImageTiled

.

A reader for which all images are guaranteed to support
easy random access, or are guaranteed not to support easy
random access, may return

true

or

false

respectively without accessing any image
data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an exception
even if no input source has been set or the image index is out
of bounds.

The default implementation returns

false

.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.

**Returns:**
- true

if reading a region of interest of
the given image is likely to be efficient.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public float getAspectRatio​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns the aspect ratio of the given image (that is, its width
divided by its height) as a

float

. For images
that are inherently resizable, this method provides a way to
determine the appropriate width given a desired height, or vice
versa. For non-resizable images, the true width and height
are used.

The default implementation simply returns

(float)getWidth(imageIndex)/getHeight(imageIndex)

.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.

**Returns:**
- a

float

indicating the aspect ratio of the
given image.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public
ImageTypeSpecifier
getRawImageType​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns an

ImageTypeSpecifier

indicating the

SampleModel

and

ColorModel

which most
closely represents the "raw" internal format of the image. If
there is no close match then a type which preserves the most
information from the image should be returned. The returned value
should also be included in the list of values returned by

getImageTypes

.

The default implementation simply returns the first entry
from the list provided by

getImageType

.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.

**Returns:**
- an

ImageTypeSpecifier

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs reading the format
information from the input source.

---

#### public abstract
Iterator
<
ImageTypeSpecifier
> getImageTypes​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns an

Iterator

containing possible image
types to which the given image may be decoded, in the form of

ImageTypeSpecifiers

s. At least one legal image
type will be returned.

The first element of the iterator should be the most
"natural" type for decoding the image with as little loss as
possible. For example, for a JPEG image the first entry should
be an RGB image, even though the image data is stored
internally in a YCbCr color space.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be

retrieved

.

**Returns:**
- an

Iterator

containing at least one

ImageTypeSpecifier

representing suggested image
types for decoding the current given image.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs reading the format
information from the input source.

**See Also:**
- ImageReadParam.setDestination(BufferedImage)

,

IIOParam.setDestinationType(ImageTypeSpecifier)

---

#### public
ImageReadParam
getDefaultReadParam()

Returns a default

ImageReadParam

object
appropriate for this format. All subclasses should define a
set of default values for all parameters and return them with
this call. This method may be called before the input source
is set.

The default implementation constructs and returns a new

ImageReadParam

object that does not allow source
scaling (

i.e.

, it returns

new ImageReadParam()

.

**Returns:**
- an

ImageReadParam

object which may be used
to control the decoding process using a set of default settings.

---

#### public abstract
IIOMetadata
getStreamMetadata()
throws
IOException

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object representing the
metadata associated with the input source as a whole (i.e., not
associated with any particular image), or

null

if
the reader does not support reading metadata, is set to ignore
metadata, or if no metadata is available.

**Returns:**
- an

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public
IIOMetadata
getStreamMetadata​(
String
formatName,

Set
<
String
> nodeNames)
throws
IOException

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object representing the
metadata associated with the input source as a whole (i.e.,
not associated with any particular image). If no such data
exists,

null

is returned.

The resulting metadata object is only responsible for
returning documents in the format named by

formatName

. Within any documents that are
returned, only nodes whose names are members of

nodeNames

are required to be returned. In this
way, the amount of metadata processing done by the reader may
be kept to a minimum, based on what information is actually
needed.

If

formatName

is not the name of a supported
metadata format,

null

is returned.

In all cases, it is legal to return a more capable metadata
object than strictly necessary. The format name and node names
are merely hints that may be used to reduce the reader's
workload.

The default implementation simply returns the result of
calling

getStreamMetadata()

, after checking that
the format name is supported. If it is not,

null

is returned.

**Parameters:**
- formatName

- a metadata format name that may be used to retrieve
a document from the returned

IIOMetadata

object.
- nodeNames

- a

Set

containing the names of
nodes that may be contained in a retrieved document.

**Returns:**
- an

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

formatName

is

null

.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

nodeNames

is

null

.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

- the index of the image whose metadata is to
be retrieved.

**Returns:**
- an

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

getImageMetadata​(int imageIndex,

String
formatName,

Set
<
String
> nodeNames)
throws
IOException

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object representing the
metadata associated with the given image, or

null

if the reader does not support reading metadata or none
is available.

The resulting metadata object is only responsible for
returning documents in the format named by

formatName

. Within any documents that are
returned, only nodes whose names are members of

nodeNames

are required to be returned. In this
way, the amount of metadata processing done by the reader may
be kept to a minimum, based on what information is actually
needed.

If

formatName

is not the name of a supported
metadata format,

null

may be returned.

In all cases, it is legal to return a more capable metadata
object than strictly necessary. The format name and node names
are merely hints that may be used to reduce the reader's
workload.

The default implementation simply returns the result of
calling

getImageMetadata(imageIndex)

- an

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.

#### public
BufferedImage
read​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Reads the image indexed by

imageIndex

and returns
it as a complete

BufferedImage

, using a default

ImageReadParam

. This is a convenience method
that calls

read(imageIndex, null)

.

The image returned will be formatted according to the first

ImageTypeSpecifier

returned from

getImageTypes

.

Any registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects
will be notified by calling their

imageStarted

method, followed by calls to their

imageProgress

method as the read progresses. Finally their

imageComplete

method will be called.

IIOReadUpdateListener

objects may be updated at
other times during the read as pixels are decoded. Finally,

IIOReadWarningListener

objects will receive
notification of any non-fatal warnings that occur during
decoding.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.

**Returns:**
- the desired portion of the image as a

BufferedImage

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.

#### public abstract
BufferedImage
read​(int imageIndex,

ImageReadParam
param)
throws
IOException

Reads the image indexed by

imageIndex

and returns
it as a complete

BufferedImage

, using a supplied

ImageReadParam

.

The actual

BufferedImage

returned will be
chosen using the algorithm defined by the

getDestination

method.

Any registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects
will be notified by calling their

imageStarted

method, followed by calls to their

imageProgress

method as the read progresses. Finally their

imageComplete

method will be called.

IIOReadUpdateListener

objects may be updated at
other times during the read as pixels are decoded. Finally,

IIOReadWarningListener

objects will receive
notification of any non-fatal warnings that occur during
decoding.

The set of source bands to be read and destination bands to
be written is determined by calling

getSourceBands

and

getDestinationBands

on the supplied

ImageReadParam

. If the lengths of the arrays
returned by these methods differ, the set of source bands
contains an index larger that the largest available source
index, or the set of destination bands contains an index larger
than the largest legal destination index, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

If the supplied

ImageReadParam

contains
optional setting values not supported by this reader (

e.g.

source render size or any format-specific settings), they will
be ignored.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
- param

- an

ImageReadParam

used to control
the reading process, or

null

.

**Returns:**

IIOImage
readAll​(int imageIndex,

ImageReadParam
param)
throws
IOException

Reads the image indexed by

imageIndex

and returns
an

IIOImage

containing the image, thumbnails, and
associated image metadata, using a supplied

ImageReadParam

.

The actual

BufferedImage

referenced by the
returned

IIOImage

will be chosen using the
algorithm defined by the

getDestination

method.

Any registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects
will be notified by calling their

imageStarted

method, followed by calls to their

imageProgress

method as the read progresses. Finally their

imageComplete

method will be called.

IIOReadUpdateListener

objects may be updated at
other times during the read as pixels are decoded. Finally,

IIOReadWarningListener

objects will receive
notification of any non-fatal warnings that occur during
decoding.

The set of source bands to be read and destination bands to
be written is determined by calling

getSourceBands

and

getDestinationBands

on the supplied

ImageReadParam

. If the lengths of the arrays
returned by these methods differ, the set of source bands
contains an index larger that the largest available source
index, or the set of destination bands contains an index larger
than the largest legal destination index, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

Thumbnails will be returned in their entirety regardless of
the region settings.

If the supplied

ImageReadParam

contains
optional setting values not supported by this reader (

e.g.

source render size or any format-specific settings), those
values will be ignored.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
- param

- an

ImageReadParam

used to control
the reading process, or

null

.

**Returns:**
- an

IIOImage

containing the desired portion
of the image, a set of thumbnails, and associated image
metadata.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the set of source and
destination bands specified by

param.getSourceBands

and

param.getDestinationBands

differ in length or
include indices that are out of bounds.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting image
would have a width or height less than 1.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

#### public
Iterator
<
IIOImage
> readAll​(
Iterator
<? extends
ImageReadParam
> params)
throws
IOException

Returns an

Iterator

containing all the images,
thumbnails, and metadata, starting at the index given by

getMinIndex

, from the input source in the form of

IIOImage

objects. An

Iterator

containing

ImageReadParam

objects is supplied; one
element is consumed for each image read from the input source
until no more images are available. If the read param

Iterator

runs out of elements, but there are still
more images available from the input source, default read
params are used for the remaining images.

If

params

is

null

, a default read
param will be used for all images.

The actual

BufferedImage

referenced by the
returned

IIOImage

will be chosen using the
algorithm defined by the

getDestination

method.

Any registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects
will be notified by calling their

sequenceStarted

method once. Then, for each image decoded, there will be a
call to

imageStarted

, followed by calls to

imageProgress

as the read progresses, and finally
to

imageComplete

. The

sequenceComplete

method will be called after the
last image has been decoded.

IIOReadUpdateListener

objects may be updated at
other times during the read as pixels are decoded. Finally,

IIOReadWarningListener

objects will receive
notification of any non-fatal warnings that occur during
decoding.

The set of source bands to be read and destination bands to
be written is determined by calling

getSourceBands

and

getDestinationBands

on the supplied

ImageReadParam

. If the lengths of the arrays
returned by these methods differ, the set of source bands
contains an index larger that the largest available source
index, or the set of destination bands contains an index larger
than the largest legal destination index, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

Thumbnails will be returned in their entirety regardless of the
region settings.

If any of the supplied

ImageReadParam

s contain
optional setting values not supported by this reader (

e.g.

source render size or any format-specific settings), they will
be ignored.

**Parameters:**
- params

- an

Iterator

containing

ImageReadParam

objects.

**Returns:**
- an

Iterator

representing the
contents of the input source as

IIOImage

s.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if any
non-

null

element of

params

is not an

ImageReadParam

.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the set of source and
destination bands specified by

param.getSourceBands

and

param.getDestinationBands

differ in length or
include indices that are out of bounds.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if a resulting image would
have a width or height less than 1.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

#### public boolean canReadRaster()

Returns

true

if this plug-in supports reading
just a

Raster

of pixel data.
If this method returns

false

, calls to

readRaster

or

readTileRaster

will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

The default implementation returns

false

.

**Returns:**
- true

if this plug-in supports reading raw

Raster

s.

**See Also:**
- readRaster(int, javax.imageio.ImageReadParam)

,

readTileRaster(int, int, int)

---

#### public
Raster
readRaster​(int imageIndex,

ImageReadParam
param)
throws
IOException

Returns a new

Raster

object containing the raw pixel data
from the image stream, without any color conversion applied. The
application must determine how to interpret the pixel data by other
means. Any destination or image-type parameters in the supplied

ImageReadParam

object are ignored, but all other
parameters are used exactly as in the

read

method, except that any destination offset is used as a logical rather
than a physical offset. The size of the returned

Raster

will always be that of the source region clipped to the actual image.
Logical offsets in the stream itself are ignored.

This method allows formats that normally apply a color
conversion, such as JPEG, and formats that do not normally have an
associated colorspace, such as remote sensing or medical imaging data,
to provide access to raw pixel data.

Any registered

readUpdateListener

s are ignored, as
there is no

BufferedImage

, but all other listeners are
called exactly as they are for the

read

method.

If

canReadRaster()

returns

false

, this method throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

If the supplied

ImageReadParam

contains
optional setting values not supported by this reader (

e.g.

source render size or any format-specific settings), they will
be ignored.

The default implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be read.
- param

- an

ImageReadParam

used to control
the reading process, or

null

.

**Returns:**
- the desired portion of the image as a

Raster

.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if this plug-in does not
support reading raw

Raster

s.
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

#### public boolean isImageTiled​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns

true

if the image is organized into

tiles

, that is, equal-sized non-overlapping rectangles.

A reader plug-in may choose whether or not to expose tiling
that is present in the image as it is stored. It may even
choose to advertise tiling when none is explicitly present. In
general, tiling should only be advertised if there is some
advantage (in speed or space) to accessing individual tiles.
Regardless of whether the reader advertises tiling, it must be
capable of reading an arbitrary rectangular region specified in
an

ImageReadParam

.

A reader for which all images are guaranteed to be tiled,
or are guaranteed not to be tiled, may return

true

or

false

respectively without accessing any image
data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an exception
even if no input source has been set or the image index is out
of bounds.

The default implementation just returns

false

.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.

**Returns:**
- true

if the image is tiled.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public int getTileWidth​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns the width of a tile in the given image.

The default implementation simply returns

getWidth(imageIndex)

, which is correct for
non-tiled images. Readers that support tiling should override
this method.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.

**Returns:**
- the width of a tile.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public int getTileHeight​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns the height of a tile in the given image.

The default implementation simply returns

getHeight(imageIndex)

, which is correct for
non-tiled images. Readers that support tiling should override
this method.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.

**Returns:**
- the height of a tile.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public int getTileGridXOffset​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns the X coordinate of the upper-left corner of tile (0,
0) in the given image.

A reader for which the tile grid X offset always has the
same value (usually 0), may return the value without accessing
any image data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an
exception even if no input source has been set or the image
index is out of bounds.

The default implementation simply returns 0, which is
correct for non-tiled images and tiled images in most formats.
Readers that support tiling with non-(0, 0) offsets should
override this method.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.

**Returns:**
- the X offset of the tile grid.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public int getTileGridYOffset​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner of tile (0,
0) in the given image.

A reader for which the tile grid Y offset always has the
same value (usually 0), may return the value without accessing
any image data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an
exception even if no input source has been set or the image
index is out of bounds.

The default implementation simply returns 0, which is
correct for non-tiled images and tiled images in most formats.
Readers that support tiling with non-(0, 0) offsets should
override this method.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.

**Returns:**
- the Y offset of the tile grid.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public
BufferedImage
readTile​(int imageIndex,
int tileX,
int tileY)
throws
IOException

Reads the tile indicated by the

tileX

and

tileY

arguments, returning it as a

BufferedImage

. If the arguments are out of range,
an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown. If the
image is not tiled, the values 0, 0 will return the entire
image; any other values will cause an

IllegalArgumentException

to be thrown.

This method is merely a convenience equivalent to calling

read(int, ImageReadParam)

with a read param
specifying a source region having offsets of

tileX*getTileWidth(imageIndex)

,

tileY*getTileHeight(imageIndex)

and width and
height of

getTileWidth(imageIndex)

,

getTileHeight(imageIndex)

; and subsampling
factors of 1 and offsets of 0. To subsample a tile, call

read

with a read param specifying this region
and different subsampling parameters.

The default implementation returns the entire image if

tileX

and

tileY

are 0, or throws
an

IllegalArgumentException

otherwise.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
- tileX

- the column index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.
- tileY

- the row index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.

**Returns:**
- the tile as a

BufferedImage

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the tile indices are
out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public
Raster
readTileRaster​(int imageIndex,
int tileX,
int tileY)
throws
IOException

Returns a new

Raster

object containing the raw
pixel data from the tile, without any color conversion applied.
The application must determine how to interpret the pixel data by other
means.

If

canReadRaster()

returns

false

, this method throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

The default implementation checks if reading

Raster

s is supported, and if so calls

readRaster(imageIndex, null)

if

tileX

and

tileY

are 0, or throws an

IllegalArgumentException

otherwise.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
- tileX

- the column index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.
- tileY

- the row index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.

**Returns:**
- the tile as a

Raster

.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if this plug-in does not
support reading raw

Raster

s.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the tile indices are
out of bounds.
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

#### public
RenderedImage
readAsRenderedImage​(int imageIndex,

ImageReadParam
param)
throws
IOException

Returns a

RenderedImage

object that contains the
contents of the image indexed by

imageIndex

. By
default, the returned image is simply the

BufferedImage

returned by

read(imageIndex, param)

.

The semantics of this method may differ from those of the
other

read

methods in several ways. First, any
destination image and/or image type set in the

ImageReadParam

may be ignored. Second, the usual
listener calls are not guaranteed to be made, or to be
meaningful if they are. This is because the returned image may
not be fully populated with pixel data at the time it is
returned, or indeed at any time.

If the supplied

ImageReadParam

contains
optional setting values not supported by this reader (

e.g.

source render size or any format-specific settings), they will
be ignored.

The default implementation just calls

read(imageIndex, param)

.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
- param

- an

ImageReadParam

used to control
the reading process, or

null

.

**Returns:**
- a

RenderedImage

object providing a view of
the image.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the set of source and
destination bands specified by

param.getSourceBands

and

param.getDestinationBands

differ in length or
include indices that are out of bounds.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting image
would have a width or height less than 1.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public boolean readerSupportsThumbnails()

Returns

true

if the image format understood by
this reader supports thumbnail preview images associated with
it. The default implementation returns

false

.

If this method returns

false

,

hasThumbnails

and

getNumThumbnails

will return

false

and

0

,
respectively, and

readThumbnail

will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

, regardless of their
arguments.

A reader that does not support thumbnails need not
implement any of the thumbnail-related methods.

**Returns:**
- true

if thumbnails are supported.

---

#### public boolean hasThumbnails​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns

true

if the given image has thumbnail
preview images associated with it. If the format does not
support thumbnails (

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

),

false

will be
returned regardless of whether an input source has been set or
whether

imageIndex

is in bounds.

The default implementation returns

true

if

getNumThumbnails

returns a value greater than 0.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image being queried.

**Returns:**
- true

if the given image has thumbnails.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but the input source has not been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public int getNumThumbnails​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns the number of thumbnail preview images associated with
the given image. If the format does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

),

0

will be returned regardless
of whether an input source has been set or whether

imageIndex

is in bounds.

The default implementation returns 0 without checking its
argument.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image being queried.

**Returns:**
- the number of thumbnails associated with the given
image.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but the input source has not been set.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
- IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

---

#### public int getThumbnailWidth​(int imageIndex,
int thumbnailIndex)
throws
IOException

Returns the width of the thumbnail preview image indexed by

thumbnailIndex

, associated with the image indexed
by

ImageIndex

.

If the reader does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

), an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

The default implementation simply returns

readThumbnail(imageindex, thumbnailIndex).getWidth()

.
Subclasses should therefore
override this method if possible in order to avoid forcing the
thumbnail to be read.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
- thumbnailIndex

- the index of the thumbnail to be retrieved.

**Returns:**

thumbnailIndex

, associated with the image indexed
by

ImageIndex

.

If the reader does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

), an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

The default implementation simply returns

readThumbnail(imageindex, thumbnailIndex).getHeight()

.
Subclasses should therefore override
this method if possible in order to avoid
forcing the thumbnail to be read.

**Parameters:**
- imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
- thumbnailIndex

- the index of the thumbnail to be retrieved.

**Returns:**
- the height of the desired thumbnail as an

throws
IOException

Returns the thumbnail preview image indexed by

thumbnailIndex

, associated with the image indexed
by

ImageIndex

as a

BufferedImage

.

Any registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects
will be notified by calling their

thumbnailStarted

,

thumbnailProgress

,
and

thumbnailComplete

methods.

If the reader does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

), an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown regardless of whether an input source has been
set or whether the indices are in bounds.

The default implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

---

#### public void abort()

Requests that any current read operation be aborted. The
contents of the image following the abort will be undefined.

Readers should call

clearAbortRequest

at the
beginning of each read operation, and poll the value of

abortRequested

regularly during the read.

---

#### protected boolean abortRequested()

Returns

true

if a request to abort the current
read operation has been made since the reader was instantiated or

clearAbortRequest

was called.

**Returns:**
- true

if the current read operation should
be aborted.

**See Also:**
- abort()

,

clearAbortRequest()

---

#### protected void clearAbortRequest()

Clears any previous abort request. After this method has been
called,

abortRequested

will return

false

.

**See Also:**
- abort()

,

abortRequested()

---

#### public void addIIOReadWarningListener​(
IIOReadWarningListener
listener)

Adds an

IIOReadWarningListener

to the list of
registered warning listeners. If

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken. Messages sent to the given listener will be
localized, if possible, to match the current

Locale

. If no

Locale

has been set,
warning messages may be localized as the reader sees fit.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- an

IIOReadWarningListener

to be registered.

**See Also:**
- removeIIOReadWarningListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadWarningListener)

---

#### public void removeIIOReadWarningListener​(
IIOReadWarningListener
listener)

Removes an

IIOReadWarningListener

from the list of
registered error listeners. If the listener was not previously
registered, or if

listener

is

null

,
no exception will be thrown and no action will be taken.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- an IIOReadWarningListener to be unregistered.

**See Also:**
- addIIOReadWarningListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadWarningListener)

---

#### public void removeAllIIOReadWarningListeners()

Removes all currently registered

IIOReadWarningListener

objects.

The default implementation sets the

warningListeners

and

warningLocales

instance variables to

null

.

---

#### public void addIIOReadProgressListener​(
IIOReadProgressListener
listener)

Adds an

IIOReadProgressListener

to the list of
registered progress listeners. If

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- an IIOReadProgressListener to be registered.

**See Also:**
- removeIIOReadProgressListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadProgressListener)

---

#### public void removeIIOReadProgressListener​(
IIOReadProgressListener
listener)

Removes an

IIOReadProgressListener

from the list
of registered progress listeners. If the listener was not
previously registered, or if

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- an IIOReadProgressListener to be unregistered.

**See Also:**
- addIIOReadProgressListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadProgressListener)

---

#### public void removeAllIIOReadProgressListeners()

Removes all currently registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects.

The default implementation sets the

progressListeners

instance variable to

null

.

---

#### public void addIIOReadUpdateListener​(
IIOReadUpdateListener
listener)

Adds an

IIOReadUpdateListener

to the list of
registered update listeners. If

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken. The listener will receive notification of pixel
updates as images and thumbnails are decoded, including the
starts and ends of progressive passes.

If no update listeners are present, the reader may choose
to perform fewer updates to the pixels of the destination
images and/or thumbnails, which may result in more efficient
decoding.

For example, in progressive JPEG decoding each pass
contains updates to a set of coefficients, which would have to
be transformed into pixel values and converted to an RGB color
space for each pass if listeners are present. If no listeners
are present, the coefficients may simply be accumulated and the
final results transformed and color converted one time only.

The final results of decoding will be the same whether or
not intermediate updates are performed. Thus if only the final
image is desired it may be preferable not to register any

IIOReadUpdateListener

s. In general, progressive
updating is most effective when fetching images over a network
connection that is very slow compared to local CPU processing;
over a fast connection, progressive updates may actually slow
down the presentation of the image.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- an IIOReadUpdateListener to be registered.

**See Also:**
- removeIIOReadUpdateListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadUpdateListener)

---

#### public void removeIIOReadUpdateListener​(
IIOReadUpdateListener
listener)

Removes an

IIOReadUpdateListener

registered update listeners. If the listener was not
previously registered, or if

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- an IIOReadUpdateListener to be unregistered.

**See Also:**
- addIIOReadUpdateListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadUpdateListener)

---

#### public void removeAllIIOReadUpdateListeners()

is undefined.

It is important for applications to call this method when they
know they will no longer be using this

ImageReader

.
Otherwise, the reader may continue to hold on to resources
indefinitely.

The default implementation of this method in the superclass does
nothing. Subclass implementations should ensure that all resources,
especially native resources, are released.

---

#### protected static
Rectangle
getSourceRegion​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int srcWidth,
int srcHeight)

A utility method that may be used by readers to compute the
region of the source image that should be read, taking into
account any source region and subsampling offset settings in
the supplied

ImageReadParam

. The actual
subsampling factors, destination size, and destination offset
are

not

taken into consideration, thus further
clipping must take place. The

computeRegions

method performs all necessary clipping.

**Parameters:**
- param

- the

ImageReadParam

being used, or

null

.
- srcWidth

- the width of the source image.
- srcHeight

- the height of the source image.

**Returns:**
- the source region as a

Rectangle

.

---

#### protected static void computeRegions​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int srcWidth,
int srcHeight,

BufferedImage
image,

Rectangle
srcRegion,

Rectangle
destRegion)

Computes the source region of interest and the destination
region of interest, taking the width and height of the source
image, an optional destination image, and an optional

ImageReadParam

into account. The source region
begins with the entire source image. Then that is clipped to
the source region specified in the

ImageReadParam

,
if one is specified.

If either of the destination offsets are negative, the
source region is clipped so that its top left will coincide
with the top left of the destination image, taking subsampling
into account. Then the result is clipped to the destination
image on the right and bottom, if one is specified, taking
subsampling and destination offsets into account.

Similarly, the destination region begins with the source
image, is translated to the destination offset given in the

ImageReadParam

if there is one, and finally is
clipped to the destination image, if there is one.

If either the source or destination regions end up having a
width or height of 0, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

The

getSourceRegion>

method may be used if only source clipping is desired.

**Parameters:**
- param

- an

ImageReadParam

, or

null

.
- srcWidth

- the width of the source image.
- srcHeight

- the height of the source image.
- image

- a

BufferedImage

that will be the
destination image, or

null

.
- srcRegion

- a

Rectangle

that will be filled with
the source region of interest.
- destRegion

- a

Rectangle

that will be filled with
the destination region of interest.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

srcRegion

is

null

.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

dstRegion

is

null

.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting source or
destination region is empty.

---

#### protected static void checkReadParamBandSettings​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int numSrcBands,
int numDstBands)

A utility method that may be used by readers to test the
validity of the source and destination band settings of an

ImageReadParam

. This method may be called as soon
as the reader knows both the number of bands of the source
image as it exists in the input stream, and the number of bands
of the destination image that being written.

The method retrieves the source and destination band
setting arrays from param using the

getSourceBands

and

getDestinationBands

methods (or considers them
to be

null

if

param

is

null

). If the source band setting array is

null

, it is considered to be equal to the array

{ 0, 1, ..., numSrcBands - 1 }

, and similarly for
the destination band setting array.

The method then tests that both arrays are equal in length,
and that neither array contains a value larger than the largest
available band index.

Any failure results in an

IllegalArgumentException

being thrown; success
results in the method returning silently.

**Parameters:**
- param

- the

ImageReadParam

being used to read
the image.
- numSrcBands

- the number of bands of the image as it exists
int the input source.
- numDstBands

- the number of bands in the destination image
being written.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

param

contains an invalid specification of a source and/or
destination band subset.

---

#### protected static
BufferedImage
getDestination​(
ImageReadParam
param,

Iterator
<
ImageTypeSpecifier
> imageTypes,
int width,
int height)
throws
IIOException

Returns the

BufferedImage

to which decoded pixel
data should be written. The image is determined by inspecting
the supplied

ImageReadParam

if it is
non-

null

; if its

getDestination

method returns a non-

null

value, that image is
simply returned. Otherwise,

param.getDestinationType

method is called to
determine if a particular image type has been specified. If
so, the returned

ImageTypeSpecifier

is used after
checking that it is equal to one of those included in

imageTypes

.

If

param

is

null

or the above
steps have not yielded an image or an

ImageTypeSpecifier

, the first value obtained from
the

imageTypes

parameter is used. Typically, the
caller will set

imageTypes

to the value of

getImageTypes(imageIndex)

.

Next, the dimensions of the image are determined by a call
to

computeRegions

. The actual width and height of
the image being decoded are passed in as the

width

and

height

parameters.

**Parameters:**
- param

- an

ImageReadParam

to be used to get
the destination image or image type, or

null

.
- imageTypes

- an

Iterator

of

ImageTypeSpecifier

s indicating the legal image
types, with the default first.
- width

- the true width of the image or tile being decoded.
- height

- the true width of the image or tile being decoded.

**Returns:**
- the

BufferedImage

to which decoded pixel
data should be written.

**Throws:**
- IIOException

- if the

ImageTypeSpecifier

specified by

param

does not match any of the legal
ones from

imageTypes

.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

imageTypes

is

null

or empty, or if an object not of type

ImageTypeSpecifier

is retrieved from it.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting image would
have a width or height less than 1.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the product of

width

and

height

is greater than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

### Additional Sections

#### Class ImageReader

java.lang.Object

- javax.imageio.ImageReader

javax.imageio.ImageReader

```java
public abstract class
ImageReader

extends
Object
```

An abstract superclass for parsing and decoding of images. This
class must be subclassed by classes that read in images in the
context of the Java Image I/O framework.

ImageReader

objects are normally instantiated by
the service provider interface (SPI) class for the specific format.
Service provider classes (e.g., instances of

ImageReaderSpi

) are registered with the

IIORegistry

, which uses them for format recognition
and presentation of available format readers and writers.

When an input source is set (using the

setInput

method), it may be marked as "seek forward only". This setting
means that images contained within the input source will only be
read in order, possibly allowing the reader to avoid caching
portions of the input containing data associated with images that
have been read previously.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- ImageReader

```java
protected ImageReader​(
ImageReaderSpi
originatingProvider)
```

Constructs an

ImageReader

and sets its

originatingProvider

field to the supplied value.

Subclasses that make use of extensions should provide a
constructor with signature

(ImageReaderSpi,Object)

in order to retrieve the extension object. If
the extension object is unsuitable, an

IllegalArgumentException

should be thrown.

**Parameters:** originatingProvider

- the

ImageReaderSpi

that is
invoking this constructor, or

null

.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getFormatName

```java
public
String
getFormatName()
throws
IOException
```

Returns a

String

identifying the format of the
input source.

The default implementation returns

originatingProvider.getFormatNames()[0]

.
Implementations that may not have an originating service
provider, or which desire a different naming policy should
override this method.

**Returns:** the format name, as a

String

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the
information from the input source.

- getOriginatingProvider

```java
public
ImageReaderSpi
getOriginatingProvider()
```

Returns the

ImageReaderSpi

that was passed in on
the constructor. Note that this value may be

null

.

**Returns:** an

ImageReaderSpi

, or

null

.
**See Also:** ImageReaderSpi

- setInput

```java
public void setInput​(
Object
input,
boolean seekForwardOnly,
boolean ignoreMetadata)
```

Sets the input source to use to the given

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

.
The input source must be set before any of the query or read
methods are used. If

input

is

null

,
any currently set input source will be removed. In any case,
the value of

minIndex

will be initialized to 0.

The

seekForwardOnly

parameter controls whether
the value returned by

getMinIndex

will be
increased as each image (or thumbnail, or image metadata) is
read. If

seekForwardOnly

is true, then a call to

read(index)

will throw an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

if

index < this.minIndex

;
otherwise, the value of

minIndex

will be set to

index

. If

seekForwardOnly

is

false

, the value of

minIndex

will remain 0 regardless of any read
operations.

The

ignoreMetadata

parameter, if set to

true

, allows the reader to disregard any metadata
encountered during the read. Subsequent calls to the

getStreamMetadata

and

getImageMetadata

methods may return

null

, and an

IIOImage

returned from

readAll

may return

null

from their

getMetadata

method. Setting this parameter may
allow the reader to work more efficiently. The reader may
choose to disregard this setting and return metadata normally.

Subclasses should take care to remove any cached
information based on the previous stream, such as header
information or partially decoded image data.

Use of a general

Object

other than an

ImageInputStream

is intended for readers that
interact directly with a capture device or imaging protocol.
The set of legal classes is advertised by the reader's service
provider's

getInputTypes

method; most readers
will return a single-element array containing only

ImageInputStream.class

to indicate that they
accept only an

ImageInputStream

.

The default implementation checks the

input

argument against the list returned by

originatingProvider.getInputTypes()

and fails
if the argument is not an instance of one of the classes
in the list. If the originating provider is set to

null

, the input is accepted only if it is an

ImageInputStream

.

**Parameters:** input

- the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

to use for future decoding.
**Parameters:** seekForwardOnly

- if

true

, images and metadata
may only be read in ascending order from this input source.
**Parameters:** ignoreMetadata

- if

true

, metadata
may be ignored during reads.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

input

is
not an instance of one of the classes returned by the
originating service provider's

getInputTypes

method, or is not an

ImageInputStream

.
**See Also:** ImageInputStream

,

getInput()

,

ImageReaderSpi.getInputTypes()

- setInput

```java
public void setInput​(
Object
input,
boolean seekForwardOnly)
```

Sets the input source to use to the given

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

.
The input source must be set before any of the query or read
methods are used. If

input

is

null

,
any currently set input source will be removed. In any case,
the value of

minIndex

will be initialized to 0.

The

seekForwardOnly

parameter controls whether
the value returned by

getMinIndex

will be
increased as each image (or thumbnail, or image metadata) is
read. If

seekForwardOnly

is true, then a call to

read(index)

will throw an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

if

index < this.minIndex

;
otherwise, the value of

minIndex

will be set to

index

. If

seekForwardOnly

is

false

, the value of

minIndex

will remain 0 regardless of any read
operations.

This method is equivalent to

setInput(input, seekForwardOnly, false)

.

**Parameters:** input

- the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

to use for future decoding.
**Parameters:** seekForwardOnly

- if

true

, images and metadata
may only be read in ascending order from this input source.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

input

is
not an instance of one of the classes returned by the
originating service provider's

getInputTypes

method, or is not an

ImageInputStream

.
**See Also:** getInput()

- setInput

```java
public void setInput​(
Object
input)
```

Sets the input source to use to the given

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

.
The input source must be set before any of the query or read
methods are used. If

input

is

null

,
any currently set input source will be removed. In any case,
the value of

minIndex

will be initialized to 0.

This method is equivalent to

setInput(input, false, false)

.

**Parameters:** input

- the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

to use for future decoding.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

input

is
not an instance of one of the classes returned by the
originating service provider's

getInputTypes

method, or is not an

ImageInputStream

.
**See Also:** getInput()

- getInput

```java
public
Object
getInput()
```

Returns the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

previously set as the input source. If the
input source has not been set,

null

is returned.

**Returns:** the

Object

that will be used for future
decoding, or

null

.
**See Also:** ImageInputStream

,

setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

- isSeekForwardOnly

```java
public boolean isSeekForwardOnly()
```

Returns

true

if the current input source has been
marked as seek forward only by passing

true

as the

seekForwardOnly

argument to the

setInput

method.

**Returns:** true

if the input source is seek forward
only.
**See Also:** setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

- isIgnoringMetadata

```java
public boolean isIgnoringMetadata()
```

Returns

true

if the current input source has been
marked as allowing metadata to be ignored by passing

true

as the

ignoreMetadata

argument
to the

setInput

method.

**Returns:** true

if the metadata may be ignored.
**See Also:** setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

- getMinIndex

```java
public int getMinIndex()
```

Returns the lowest valid index for reading an image, thumbnail,
or image metadata. If

seekForwardOnly()

is

false

, this value will typically remain 0,
indicating that random access is possible. Otherwise, it will
contain the value of the most recently accessed index, and
increase in a monotonic fashion.

**Returns:** the minimum legal index for reading.

- getAvailableLocales

```java
public
Locale
[] getAvailableLocales()
```

Returns an array of

Locale

s that may be used to
localize warning listeners and compression settings. A return
value of

null

indicates that localization is not
supported.

The default implementation returns a clone of the

availableLocales

instance variable if it is
non-

null

, or else returns

null

.

**Returns:** an array of

Locale

s that may be used as
arguments to

setLocale

, or

null

.

- setLocale

```java
public void setLocale​(
Locale
locale)
```

Sets the current

Locale

of this

ImageReader

to the given value. A value of

null

removes any previous setting, and indicates
that the reader should localize as it sees fit.

**Parameters:** locale

- the desired

Locale

, or

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

locale

is
non-

null

but is not one of the values returned by

getAvailableLocales

.
**See Also:** getLocale()

- getLocale

```java
public
Locale
getLocale()
```

Returns the currently set

Locale

, or

null

if none has been set.

**Returns:** the current

Locale

, or

null

.
**See Also:** setLocale(java.util.Locale)

- getNumImages

```java
public abstract int getNumImages​(boolean allowSearch)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the number of images, not including thumbnails, available
from the current input source.

Note that some image formats (such as animated GIF) do not
specify how many images are present in the stream. Thus
determining the number of images will require the entire stream
to be scanned and may require memory for buffering. If images
are to be processed in order, it may be more efficient to
simply call

read

with increasing indices until an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

is thrown to indicate
that no more images are available. The

allowSearch

parameter may be set to

false

to indicate that an exhaustive search is not
desired; the return value will be

-1

to indicate
that a search is necessary. If the input has been specified
with

seekForwardOnly

set to

true

,
this method throws an

IllegalStateException

if

allowSearch

is set to

true

.

**Parameters:** allowSearch

- if

true

, the true number of
images will be returned even if a search is required. If

false

, the reader may return

-1

without performing the search.
**Returns:** the number of images, as an

int

, or

-1

if

allowSearch

is

false

and a search would be required.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set,
or if the input has been specified with

seekForwardOnly

set to

true

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the
information from the input source.
**See Also:** setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

- getWidth

```java
public abstract int getWidth​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the width in pixels of the given image within the input
source.

If the image can be rendered to a user-specified size, then
this method returns the default width.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the width of the image, as an

int

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the width
information from the input source.

- getHeight

```java
public abstract int getHeight​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the height in pixels of the given image within the
input source.

If the image can be rendered to a user-specified size, then
this method returns the default height.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the height of the image, as an

int

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the height
information from the input source.

- isRandomAccessEasy

```java
public boolean isRandomAccessEasy​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns

true

if the storage format of the given
image places no inherent impediment on random access to pixels.
For most compressed formats, such as JPEG, this method should
return

false

, as a large section of the image in
addition to the region of interest may need to be decoded.

This is merely a hint for programs that wish to be
efficient; all readers must be able to read arbitrary regions
as specified in an

ImageReadParam

.

Note that formats that return

false

from
this method may nonetheless allow tiling (

e.g.

Restart
Markers in JPEG), and random access will likely be reasonably
efficient on tiles. See

isImageTiled

.

A reader for which all images are guaranteed to support
easy random access, or are guaranteed not to support easy
random access, may return

true

or

false

respectively without accessing any image
data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an exception
even if no input source has been set or the image index is out
of bounds.

The default implementation returns

false

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** true

if reading a region of interest of
the given image is likely to be efficient.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getAspectRatio

```java
public float getAspectRatio​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the aspect ratio of the given image (that is, its width
divided by its height) as a

float

. For images
that are inherently resizable, this method provides a way to
determine the appropriate width given a desired height, or vice
versa. For non-resizable images, the true width and height
are used.

The default implementation simply returns

(float)getWidth(imageIndex)/getHeight(imageIndex)

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** a

float

indicating the aspect ratio of the
given image.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getRawImageType

```java
public
ImageTypeSpecifier
getRawImageType​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

ImageTypeSpecifier

indicating the

SampleModel

and

ColorModel

which most
closely represents the "raw" internal format of the image. If
there is no close match then a type which preserves the most
information from the image should be returned. The returned value
should also be included in the list of values returned by

getImageTypes

.

The default implementation simply returns the first entry
from the list provided by

getImageType

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** an

ImageTypeSpecifier

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the format
information from the input source.

- getImageTypes

```java
public abstract
Iterator
<
ImageTypeSpecifier
> getImageTypes​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

Iterator

containing possible image
types to which the given image may be decoded, in the form of

ImageTypeSpecifiers

s. At least one legal image
type will be returned.

The first element of the iterator should be the most
"natural" type for decoding the image with as little loss as
possible. For example, for a JPEG image the first entry should
be an RGB image, even though the image data is stored
internally in a YCbCr color space.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be

retrieved

.
**Returns:** an

Iterator

containing at least one

ImageTypeSpecifier

representing suggested image
types for decoding the current given image.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the format
information from the input source.
**See Also:** ImageReadParam.setDestination(BufferedImage)

,

IIOParam.setDestinationType(ImageTypeSpecifier)

- getDefaultReadParam

```java
public
ImageReadParam
getDefaultReadParam()
```

Returns a default

ImageReadParam

object
appropriate for this format. All subclasses should define a
set of default values for all parameters and return them with
this call. This method may be called before the input source
is set.

The default implementation constructs and returns a new

ImageReadParam

object that does not allow source
scaling (

i.e.

, it returns

new ImageReadParam()

.

**Returns:** an

ImageReadParam

object which may be used
to control the decoding process using a set of default settings.

- getStreamMetadata

```java
public abstract
IIOMetadata
getStreamMetadata()
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object representing the
metadata associated with the input source as a whole (i.e., not
associated with any particular image), or

null

if
the reader does not support reading metadata, is set to ignore
metadata, or if no metadata is available.

**Returns:** an

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getStreamMetadata

```java
public
IIOMetadata
getStreamMetadata​(
String
formatName,

Set
<
String
> nodeNames)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object representing the
metadata associated with the input source as a whole (i.e.,
not associated with any particular image). If no such data
exists,

null

is returned.

The resulting metadata object is only responsible for
returning documents in the format named by

formatName

. Within any documents that are
returned, only nodes whose names are members of

nodeNames

are required to be returned. In this
way, the amount of metadata processing done by the reader may
be kept to a minimum, based on what information is actually
needed.

If

formatName

is not the name of a supported
metadata format,

null

is returned.

In all cases, it is legal to return a more capable metadata
object than strictly necessary. The format name and node names
are merely hints that may be used to reduce the reader's
workload.

The default implementation simply returns the result of
calling

getStreamMetadata()

, after checking that
the format name is supported. If it is not,

null

is returned.

**Parameters:** formatName

- a metadata format name that may be used to retrieve
a document from the returned

IIOMetadata

object.
**Parameters:** nodeNames

- a

Set

containing the names of
nodes that may be contained in a retrieved document.
**Returns:** an

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

formatName

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

nodeNames

is

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getImageMetadata

```java
public abstract
IIOMetadata
getImageMetadata​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object containing metadata
associated with the given image, or

null

if the
reader does not support reading metadata, is set to ignore
metadata, or if no metadata is available.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image whose metadata is to
be retrieved.
**Returns:** an

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getImageMetadata

```java
public
IIOMetadata
getImageMetadata​(int imageIndex,

String
formatName,

Set
<
String
> nodeNames)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object representing the
metadata associated with the given image, or

null

if the reader does not support reading metadata or none
is available.

The resulting metadata object is only responsible for
returning documents in the format named by

formatName

. Within any documents that are
returned, only nodes whose names are members of

nodeNames

are required to be returned. In this
way, the amount of metadata processing done by the reader may
be kept to a minimum, based on what information is actually
needed.

If

formatName

is not the name of a supported
metadata format,

null

may be returned.

In all cases, it is legal to return a more capable metadata
object than strictly necessary. The format name and node names
are merely hints that may be used to reduce the reader's
workload.

The default implementation simply returns the result of
calling

getImageMetadata(imageIndex)

, after
checking that the format name is supported. If it is not,

null

is returned.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image whose metadata is to
be retrieved.
**Parameters:** formatName

- a metadata format name that may be used to retrieve
a document from the returned

IIOMetadata

> params)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

Iterator

containing all the images,
thumbnails, and metadata, starting at the index given by

getMinIndex

, from the input source in the form of

IIOImage

objects. An

Iterator

containing

ImageReadParam

objects is supplied; one
element is consumed for each image read from the input source
until no more images are available. If the read param

Iterator

runs out of elements, but there are still
more images available from the input source, default read
params are used for the remaining images.

If

params

is

null

, a default read
param will be used for all images.

The actual

BufferedImage

referenced by the
returned

IIOImage

will be chosen using the
algorithm defined by the

getDestination

method.

Any registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects
will be notified by calling their

sequenceStarted

method once. Then, for each image decoded, there will be a
call to

imageStarted

, followed by calls to

imageProgress

as the read progresses, and finally
to

imageComplete

. The

sequenceComplete

method will be called after the
last image has been decoded.

IIOImage

- canReadRaster

```java
public boolean canReadRaster()
```

Returns

true

if this plug-in supports reading
just a

Raster

of pixel data.
If this method returns

false

, calls to

readRaster

or

readTileRaster

will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

The default implementation returns

false

.

**Returns:** true

if this plug-in supports reading raw

Raster

s.
**See Also:** readRaster(int, javax.imageio.ImageReadParam)

,

readTileRaster(int, int, int)

- readRaster

```java
public
Raster
readRaster​(int imageIndex,

ImageReadParam
param)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a new

Raster

object containing the raw pixel data
from the image stream, without any color conversion applied. The
application must determine how to interpret the pixel data by other
means. Any destination or image-type parameters in the supplied

ImageReadParam

object are ignored, but all other
parameters are used exactly as in the

read

method, except that any destination offset is used as a logical rather
than a physical offset. The size of the returned

Raster

will always be that of the source region clipped to the actual image.
Logical offsets in the stream itself are ignored.

This method allows formats that normally apply a color
conversion, such as JPEG, and formats that do not normally have an
associated colorspace, such as remote sensing or medical imaging data,
to provide access to raw pixel data.

Any registered

readUpdateListener

s are ignored, as
there is no

BufferedImage

, but all other listeners are
called exactly as they are for the

read

method.

If

canReadRaster()

returns

false

, this method throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

If the supplied

ImageReadParam

contains
optional setting values not supported by this reader (

e.g.

source render size or any format-specific settings), they will
be ignored.

The default implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be read.
**Parameters:** param

- an

ImageReadParam

used to control
the reading process, or

null

.
**Returns:** the desired portion of the image as a

Raster

.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this plug-in does not
support reading raw

Raster

s.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.
**See Also:** canReadRaster()

,

read(int)

,

Raster

- isImageTiled

```java
public boolean isImageTiled​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns

true

if the image is organized into

tiles

, that is, equal-sized non-overlapping rectangles.

A reader plug-in may choose whether or not to expose tiling
that is present in the image as it is stored. It may even
choose to advertise tiling when none is explicitly present. In
general, tiling should only be advertised if there is some
advantage (in speed or space) to accessing individual tiles.
Regardless of whether the reader advertises tiling, it must be
capable of reading an arbitrary rectangular region specified in
an

ImageReadParam

.

A reader for which all images are guaranteed to be tiled,
or are guaranteed not to be tiled, may return

true

or

false

respectively without accessing any image
data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an exception
even if no input source has been set or the image index is out
of bounds.

The default implementation just returns

false

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** true

if the image is tiled.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getTileWidth

```java
public int getTileWidth​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the width of a tile in the given image.

The default implementation simply returns

getWidth(imageIndex)

, which is correct for
non-tiled images. Readers that support tiling should override
this method.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the width of a tile.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getTileHeight

```java
public int getTileHeight​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the height of a tile in the given image.

The default implementation simply returns

getHeight(imageIndex)

, which is correct for
non-tiled images. Readers that support tiling should override
this method.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the height of a tile.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getTileGridXOffset

```java
public int getTileGridXOffset​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the X coordinate of the upper-left corner of tile (0,
0) in the given image.

A reader for which the tile grid X offset always has the
same value (usually 0), may return the value without accessing
any image data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an
exception even if no input source has been set or the image
index is out of bounds.

The default implementation simply returns 0, which is
correct for non-tiled images and tiled images in most formats.
Readers that support tiling with non-(0, 0) offsets should
override this method.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the X offset of the tile grid.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getTileGridYOffset

```java
public int getTileGridYOffset​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner of tile (0,
0) in the given image.

A reader for which the tile grid Y offset always has the
same value (usually 0), may return the value without accessing
any image data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an
exception even if no input source has been set or the image
index is out of bounds.

The default implementation simply returns 0, which is
correct for non-tiled images and tiled images in most formats.
Readers that support tiling with non-(0, 0) offsets should
override this method.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the Y offset of the tile grid.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- readTile

```java
public
BufferedImage
readTile​(int imageIndex,
int tileX,
int tileY)
throws
IOException
```

Reads the tile indicated by the

tileX

and

tileY

arguments, returning it as a

BufferedImage

. If the arguments are out of range,
an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown. If the
image is not tiled, the values 0, 0 will return the entire
image; any other values will cause an

IllegalArgumentException

to be thrown.

This method is merely a convenience equivalent to calling

read(int, ImageReadParam)

with a read param
specifying a source region having offsets of

tileX*getTileWidth(imageIndex)

,

tileY*getTileHeight(imageIndex)

and width and
height of

getTileWidth(imageIndex)

,

getTileHeight(imageIndex)

; and subsampling
factors of 1 and offsets of 0. To subsample a tile, call

read

with a read param specifying this region
and different subsampling parameters.

The default implementation returns the entire image if

tileX

and

tileY

are 0, or throws
an

IllegalArgumentException

otherwise.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** tileX

- the column index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** tileY

- the row index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.
**Returns:** the tile as a

BufferedImage

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the tile indices are
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- readTileRaster

```java
public
Raster
readTileRaster​(int imageIndex,
int tileX,
int tileY)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a new

Raster

object containing the raw
pixel data from the tile, without any color conversion applied.
The application must determine how to interpret the pixel data by other
means.

If

canReadRaster()

returns

false

, this method throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

The default implementation checks if reading

Raster

s is supported, and if so calls

readRaster(imageIndex, null)

if

tileX

and

tileY

are 0, or throws an

IllegalArgumentException

otherwise.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** tileX

- the column index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** tileY

- the row index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.
**Returns:** the tile as a

Raster

.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this plug-in does not
support reading raw

Raster

s.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the tile indices are
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- readAsRenderedImage

```java
public
RenderedImage
readAsRenderedImage​(int imageIndex,

ImageReadParam
param)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a

RenderedImage

object that contains the
contents of the image indexed by

imageIndex

. By
default, the returned image is simply the

BufferedImage

returned by

read(imageIndex, param)

.

The semantics of this method may differ from those of the
other

read

methods in several ways. First, any
destination image and/or image type set in the

ImageReadParam

may be ignored. Second, the usual
listener calls are not guaranteed to be made, or to be
meaningful if they are. This is because the returned image may
not be fully populated with pixel data at the time it is
returned, or indeed at any time.

If the supplied

ImageReadParam

contains
optional setting values not supported by this reader (

e.g.

source render size or any format-specific settings), they will
be ignored.

The default implementation just calls

read(imageIndex, param)

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** param

- an

ImageReadParam

used to control
the reading process, or

null

.
**Returns:** a

RenderedImage

object providing a view of
the image.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the set of source and
destination bands specified by

param.getSourceBands

and

param.getDestinationBands

differ in length or
include indices that are out of bounds.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting image
would have a width or height less than 1.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- readerSupportsThumbnails

```java
public boolean readerSupportsThumbnails()
```

Returns

true

if the image format understood by
this reader supports thumbnail preview images associated with
it. The default implementation returns

false

.

If this method returns

false

,

hasThumbnails

and

getNumThumbnails

will return

false

and

0

,
respectively, and

readThumbnail

will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

, regardless of their
arguments.

A reader that does not support thumbnails need not
implement any of the thumbnail-related methods.

**Returns:** true

if thumbnails are supported.

- hasThumbnails

```java
public boolean hasThumbnails​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns

true

if the given image has thumbnail
preview images associated with it. If the format does not
support thumbnails (

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

),

false

will be
returned regardless of whether an input source has been set or
whether

imageIndex

is in bounds.

The default implementation returns

true

if

getNumThumbnails

returns a value greater than 0.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image being queried.
**Returns:** true

if the given image has thumbnails.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getNumThumbnails

```java
public int getNumThumbnails​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the number of thumbnail preview images associated with
the given image. If the format does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

),

0

will be returned regardless
of whether an input source has been set or whether

imageIndex

is in bounds.

The default implementation returns 0 without checking its
argument.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image being queried.
**Returns:** the number of thumbnails associated with the given
image.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getThumbnailWidth

```java
public int getThumbnailWidth​(int imageIndex,
int thumbnailIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the width of the thumbnail preview image indexed by

thumbnailIndex

, associated with the image indexed
by

ImageIndex

.

If the reader does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

), an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

The default implementation simply returns

readThumbnail(imageindex, thumbnailIndex).getWidth()

.
Subclasses should therefore
override this method if possible in order to avoid forcing the
thumbnail to be read.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** thumbnailIndex

- the index of the thumbnail to be retrieved.

```java
public int getThumbnailHeight​(int imageIndex,
int thumbnailIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the height of the thumbnail preview image indexed by

thumbnailIndex

, associated with the image indexed
by

ImageIndex

.

If the reader does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

), an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

The default implementation simply returns

readThumbnail(imageindex, thumbnailIndex).getHeight()

.
Subclasses should therefore override
this method if possible in order to avoid
forcing the thumbnail to be read.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** thumbnailIndex

- the index of the thumbnail to be retrieved.
**Returns:** the height of the desired thumbnail as an

int

.

BufferedImage
readThumbnail​(int imageIndex,
int thumbnailIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the thumbnail preview image indexed by

thumbnailIndex

, associated with the image indexed
by

ImageIndex

as a

BufferedImage

.

Any registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects
will be notified by calling their

thumbnailStarted

,

thumbnailProgress

,
and

thumbnailComplete

methods.

If the reader does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

), an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown regardless of whether an input source has been
set or whether the indices are in bounds.

The default implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

- if either of the supplied
indices are out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- abort

```java
public void abort()
```

Requests that any current read operation be aborted. The
contents of the image following the abort will be undefined.

Readers should call

clearAbortRequest

at the
beginning of each read operation, and poll the value of

abortRequested

regularly during the read.

- abortRequested

```java
protected boolean abortRequested()
```

Returns

true

if a request to abort the current
read operation has been made since the reader was instantiated or

clearAbortRequest

was called.

**Returns:** true

if the current read operation should
be aborted.
**See Also:** abort()

,

clearAbortRequest()

The default implementation sets the

warningListeners

and

warningLocales

instance variables to

null

.

- addIIOReadProgressListener

```java
public void addIIOReadProgressListener​(
IIOReadProgressListener
listener)
```

Adds an

IIOReadProgressListener

to the list of
registered progress listeners. If

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken.

**Parameters:** listener

- an IIOReadProgressListener to be registered.
**See Also:** removeIIOReadProgressListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadProgressListener)

- removeIIOReadProgressListener

```java
public void removeIIOReadProgressListener​(
IIOReadProgressListener
listener)
```

Removes an

IIOReadProgressListener

from the list
of registered progress listeners. If the listener was not
previously registered, or if

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken.

**Parameters:** listener

- an IIOReadProgressListener to be unregistered.
**See Also:** addIIOReadProgressListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadProgressListener)

- removeAllIIOReadProgressListeners

```java
public void removeAllIIOReadProgressListeners()
```

Removes all currently registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects.

The default implementation sets the

progressListeners

instance variable to

null

.

- addIIOReadUpdateListener

```java
public void addIIOReadUpdateListener​(
IIOReadUpdateListener
listener)
```

Adds an

IIOReadUpdateListener

to the list of
registered update listeners. If

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken. The listener will receive notification of pixel
updates as images and thumbnails are decoded, including the
starts and ends of progressive passes.

If no update listeners are present, the reader may choose
to perform fewer updates to the pixels of the destination
images and/or thumbnails, which may result in more efficient
decoding.

For example, in progressive JPEG decoding each pass
contains updates to a set of coefficients, which would have to
be transformed into pixel values and converted to an RGB color
space for each pass if listeners are present. If no listeners
are present, the coefficients may simply be accumulated and the
final results transformed and color converted one time only.

The final results of decoding will be the same whether or
not intermediate updates are performed. Thus if only the final
image is desired it may be preferable not to register any

IIOReadUpdateListener

s. In general, progressive
updating is most effective when fetching images over a network
connection that is very slow compared to local CPU processing;
over a fast connection, progressive updates may actually slow
down the presentation of the image.

**Parameters:** listener

- an IIOReadUpdateListener to be registered.
**See Also:** removeIIOReadUpdateListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadUpdateListener)

- removeIIOReadUpdateListener

```java
public void removeIIOReadUpdateListener​(

know they will no longer be using this

ImageReader

.
Otherwise, the reader may continue to hold on to resources
indefinitely.

The default implementation of this method in the superclass does
nothing. Subclass implementations should ensure that all resources,
especially native resources, are released.

- getSourceRegion

```java
protected static
Rectangle
getSourceRegion​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int srcWidth,
int srcHeight)
```

A utility method that may be used by readers to compute the
region of the source image that should be read, taking into
account any source region and subsampling offset settings in
the supplied

ImageReadParam

. The actual
subsampling factors, destination size, and destination offset
are

not

taken into consideration, thus further
clipping must take place. The

computeRegions

method performs all necessary clipping.

**Parameters:** param

- the

ImageReadParam

being used, or

null

.
**Parameters:** srcWidth

- the width of the source image.
**Parameters:** srcHeight

- the height of the source image.
**Returns:** the source region as a

Rectangle

.

- computeRegions

```java
protected static void computeRegions​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int srcWidth,
int srcHeight,

BufferedImage
image,

Rectangle
srcRegion,

Rectangle
destRegion)
```

Computes the source region of interest and the destination
region of interest, taking the width and height of the source
image, an optional destination image, and an optional

ImageReadParam

into account. The source region
begins with the entire source image. Then that is clipped to
the source region specified in the

ImageReadParam

,
if one is specified.

If either of the destination offsets are negative, the
source region is clipped so that its top left will coincide
with the top left of the destination image, taking subsampling
into account. Then the result is clipped to the destination
image on the right and bottom, if one is specified, taking
subsampling and destination offsets into account.

Similarly, the destination region begins with the source
image, is translated to the destination offset given in the

ImageReadParam

if there is one, and finally is
clipped to the destination image, if there is one.

If either the source or destination regions end up having a
width or height of 0, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

The

getSourceRegion>

method may be used if only source clipping is desired.

**Parameters:** param

- an

ImageReadParam

, or

null

.
**Parameters:** srcWidth

- the width of the source image.
**Parameters:** srcHeight

- the height of the source image.
**Parameters:** image

- a

BufferedImage

that will be the
destination image, or

null

.
**Parameters:** srcRegion

- a

Rectangle

that will be filled with
the source region of interest.
**Parameters:** destRegion

- a

Rectangle

that will be filled with
the destination region of interest.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

srcRegion

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

dstRegion

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting source or
destination region is empty.

- checkReadParamBandSettings

```java
protected static void checkReadParamBandSettings​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int numSrcBands,
int numDstBands)
```

A utility method that may be used by readers to test the
validity of the source and destination band settings of an

ImageReadParam

. This method may be called as soon
as the reader knows both the number of bands of the source
image as it exists in the input stream, and the number of bands
of the destination image that being written.

The method retrieves the source and destination band
setting arrays from param using the

getSourceBands

and

getDestinationBands

methods (or considers them
to be

null

if

param

is

null

). If the source band setting array is

null

, it is considered to be equal to the array

{ 0, 1, ..., numSrcBands - 1 }

, and similarly for
the destination band setting array.

The method then tests that both arrays are equal in length,
and that neither array contains a value larger than the largest
available band index.

Any failure results in an

IllegalArgumentException

being thrown; success
results in the method returning silently.

**Parameters:** param

- the

ImageReadParam

being used to read
the image.
**Parameters:** numSrcBands

- the number of bands of the image as it exists
int the input source.
**Parameters:** numDstBands

- the number of bands in the destination image
being written.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

param

contains an invalid specification of a source and/or
destination band subset.

- getDestination

```java
protected static
BufferedImage
getDestination​(
ImageReadParam
param,

Iterator
<
ImageTypeSpecifier
> imageTypes,
int width,
int height)
throws
IIOException
```

Returns the

BufferedImage

to which decoded pixel
data should be written. The image is determined by inspecting
the supplied

ImageReadParam

if it is
non-

null

; if its

getDestination

method returns a non-

null

value, that image is
simply returned. Otherwise,

param.getDestinationType

method is called to
determine if a particular image type has been specified. If
so, the returned

ImageTypeSpecifier

is used after
checking that it is equal to one of those included in

imageTypes

.

If

param

is

null

or the above
steps have not yielded an image or an

ImageTypeSpecifier

, the first value obtained from
the

imageTypes

parameter is used. Typically, the
caller will set

imageTypes

to the value of

getImageTypes(imageIndex)

.

Next, the dimensions of the image are determined by a call
to

computeRegions

. The actual width and height of
the image being decoded are passed in as the

width

and

height

parameters.

**Parameters:** param

- an

ImageReadParam

to be used to get
the destination image or image type, or

null

.
**Parameters:** imageTypes

- an

Iterator

of

ImageTypeSpecifier

s indicating the legal image
types, with the default first.
**Parameters:** width

- the true width of the image or tile being decoded.
**Parameters:** height

- the true width of the image or tile being decoded.
**Returns:** the

BufferedImage

to which decoded pixel
data should be written.
**Throws:** IIOException

- if the

ImageTypeSpecifier

specified by

param

does not match any of the legal
ones from

imageTypes

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

imageTypes

is

null

or empty, or if an object not of type

ImageTypeSpecifier

is retrieved from it.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting image would
have a width or height less than 1.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the product of

width

and

height

is greater than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

Method Detail

- getFormatName

```java
public
String
getFormatName()
throws
IOException
```

Returns a

String

identifying the format of the
input source.

The default implementation returns

originatingProvider.getFormatNames()[0]

.
Implementations that may not have an originating service
provider, or which desire a different naming policy should
override this method.

**Returns:** the format name, as a

String

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the
information from the input source.

- getOriginatingProvider

```java
public
ImageReaderSpi
getOriginatingProvider()
```

Returns the

ImageReaderSpi

that was passed in on
the constructor. Note that this value may be

null

.

**Returns:** an

ImageReaderSpi

, or

null

.
**See Also:** ImageReaderSpi

- setInput

```java
public void setInput​(
Object
input,
boolean seekForwardOnly,
boolean ignoreMetadata)
```

Sets the input source to use to the given

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

.
The input source must be set before any of the query or read
methods are used. If

input

is

null

,
any currently set input source will be removed. In any case,
the value of

minIndex

will be initialized to 0.

The

seekForwardOnly

parameter controls whether
the value returned by

getMinIndex

will be
increased as each image (or thumbnail, or image metadata) is
read. If

seekForwardOnly

is true, then a call to

read(index)

will throw an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

if

index < this.minIndex

;
otherwise, the value of

minIndex

will be set to

index

. If

seekForwardOnly

is

false

, the value of

minIndex

will remain 0 regardless of any read
operations.

The

ignoreMetadata

parameter, if set to

true

, allows the reader to disregard any metadata
encountered during the read. Subsequent calls to the

getStreamMetadata

and

getImageMetadata

methods may return

null

, and an

IIOImage

returned from

readAll

may return

null

from their

getMetadata

method. Setting this parameter may
allow the reader to work more efficiently. The reader may
choose to disregard this setting and return metadata normally.

Subclasses should take care to remove any cached
information based on the previous stream, such as header
information or partially decoded image data.

Use of a general

Object

other than an

ImageInputStream

is intended for readers that
interact directly with a capture device or imaging protocol.
The set of legal classes is advertised by the reader's service
provider's

getInputTypes

method; most readers
will return a single-element array containing only

ImageInputStream.class

to indicate that they
accept only an

ImageInputStream

.

The default implementation checks the

input

argument against the list returned by

originatingProvider.getInputTypes()

and fails
if the argument is not an instance of one of the classes
in the list. If the originating provider is set to

null

, the input is accepted only if it is an

ImageInputStream

.

**Parameters:** input

- the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

to use for future decoding.
**Parameters:** seekForwardOnly

- if

true

, images and metadata
may only be read in ascending order from this input source.
**Parameters:** ignoreMetadata

- if

true

, metadata
may be ignored during reads.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

input

is
not an instance of one of the classes returned by the
originating service provider's

getInputTypes

method, or is not an

ImageInputStream

.
**See Also:** ImageInputStream

,

getInput()

,

ImageReaderSpi.getInputTypes()

- setInput

```java
public void setInput​(
Object
input,
boolean seekForwardOnly)
```

Sets the input source to use to the given

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

.
The input source must be set before any of the query or read
methods are used. If

input

is

null

,
any currently set input source will be removed. In any case,
the value of

minIndex

will be initialized to 0.

The

seekForwardOnly

parameter controls whether
the value returned by

getMinIndex

will be
increased as each image (or thumbnail, or image metadata) is
read. If

seekForwardOnly

is true, then a call to

read(index)

will throw an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

if

index < this.minIndex

;
otherwise, the value of

minIndex

will be set to

index

. If

seekForwardOnly

is

false

, the value of

minIndex

will remain 0 regardless of any read
operations.

This method is equivalent to

setInput(input, seekForwardOnly, false)

.

**Parameters:** input

- the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

to use for future decoding.
**Parameters:** seekForwardOnly

- if

true

, images and metadata
may only be read in ascending order from this input source.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

input

is
not an instance of one of the classes returned by the
originating service provider's

getInputTypes

method, or is not an

ImageInputStream

.
**See Also:** getInput()

- setInput

```java
public void setInput​(
Object
input)
```

Sets the input source to use to the given

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

.
The input source must be set before any of the query or read
methods are used. If

input

is

null

,
any currently set input source will be removed. In any case,
the value of

minIndex

will be initialized to 0.

This method is equivalent to

setInput(input, false, false)

.

**Parameters:** input

- the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

to use for future decoding.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

input

is
not an instance of one of the classes returned by the
originating service provider's

getInputTypes

method, or is not an

ImageInputStream

.
**See Also:** getInput()

- getInput

```java
public
Object
getInput()
```

Returns the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

previously set as the input source. If the
input source has not been set,

null

is returned.

**Returns:** the

Object

that will be used for future
decoding, or

null

.
**See Also:** ImageInputStream

,

setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

- isSeekForwardOnly

```java
public boolean isSeekForwardOnly()
```

Returns

true

if the current input source has been
marked as seek forward only by passing

true

as the

seekForwardOnly

argument to the

setInput

method.

**Returns:** true

if the input source is seek forward
only.
**See Also:** setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

- isIgnoringMetadata

```java
public boolean isIgnoringMetadata()
```

Returns

true

if the current input source has been
marked as allowing metadata to be ignored by passing

true

as the

ignoreMetadata

argument
to the

setInput

method.

**Returns:** true

if the metadata may be ignored.
**See Also:** setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

- getMinIndex

```java
public int getMinIndex()
```

Returns the lowest valid index for reading an image, thumbnail,
or image metadata. If

seekForwardOnly()

is

false

, this value will typically remain 0,
indicating that random access is possible. Otherwise, it will
contain the value of the most recently accessed index, and
increase in a monotonic fashion.

**Returns:** the minimum legal index for reading.

- getAvailableLocales

```java
public
Locale
[] getAvailableLocales()
```

Returns an array of

Locale

s that may be used to
localize warning listeners and compression settings. A return
value of

null

indicates that localization is not
supported.

The default implementation returns a clone of the

availableLocales

instance variable if it is
non-

null

, or else returns

null

.

**Returns:** an array of

Locale

s that may be used as
arguments to

setLocale

, or

null

.

- setLocale

```java
public void setLocale​(
Locale
locale)
```

Sets the current

Locale

of this

ImageReader

to the given value. A value of

null

removes any previous setting, and indicates
that the reader should localize as it sees fit.

**Parameters:** locale

- the desired

Locale

, or

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

locale

is
non-

null

but is not one of the values returned by

getAvailableLocales

.
**See Also:** getLocale()

- getLocale

```java
public
Locale
getLocale()
```

Returns the currently set

Locale

, or

null

if none has been set.

**Returns:** the current

Locale

, or

null

.
**See Also:** setLocale(java.util.Locale)

- getNumImages

```java
public abstract int getNumImages​(boolean allowSearch)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the number of images, not including thumbnails, available
from the current input source.

Note that some image formats (such as animated GIF) do not
specify how many images are present in the stream. Thus
determining the number of images will require the entire stream
to be scanned and may require memory for buffering. If images
are to be processed in order, it may be more efficient to
simply call

read

with increasing indices until an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

is thrown to indicate
that no more images are available. The

allowSearch

parameter may be set to

false

to indicate that an exhaustive search is not
desired; the return value will be

-1

to indicate
that a search is necessary. If the input has been specified
with

seekForwardOnly

set to

true

,
this method throws an

IllegalStateException

if

allowSearch

is set to

true

.

**Parameters:** allowSearch

- if

true

, the true number of
images will be returned even if a search is required. If

false

, the reader may return

-1

without performing the search.
**Returns:** the number of images, as an

int

, or

-1

if

allowSearch

is

false

and a search would be required.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set,
or if the input has been specified with

seekForwardOnly

set to

true

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the
information from the input source.
**See Also:** setInput(java.lang.Object, boolean, boolean)

- getWidth

```java
public abstract int getWidth​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the width in pixels of the given image within the input
source.

If the image can be rendered to a user-specified size, then
this method returns the default width.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the width of the image, as an

int

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the width
information from the input source.

- getHeight

```java
public abstract int getHeight​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the height in pixels of the given image within the
input source.

If the image can be rendered to a user-specified size, then
this method returns the default height.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the height of the image, as an

int

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the height
information from the input source.

- isRandomAccessEasy

```java
public boolean isRandomAccessEasy​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns

true

if the storage format of the given
image places no inherent impediment on random access to pixels.
For most compressed formats, such as JPEG, this method should
return

false

, as a large section of the image in
addition to the region of interest may need to be decoded.

This is merely a hint for programs that wish to be
efficient; all readers must be able to read arbitrary regions
as specified in an

ImageReadParam

.

Note that formats that return

false

from
this method may nonetheless allow tiling (

e.g.

Restart
Markers in JPEG), and random access will likely be reasonably
efficient on tiles. See

isImageTiled

.

A reader for which all images are guaranteed to support
easy random access, or are guaranteed not to support easy
random access, may return

true

or

false

respectively without accessing any image
data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an exception
even if no input source has been set or the image index is out
of bounds.

The default implementation returns

false

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** true

if reading a region of interest of
the given image is likely to be efficient.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getAspectRatio

```java
public float getAspectRatio​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the aspect ratio of the given image (that is, its width
divided by its height) as a

float

. For images
that are inherently resizable, this method provides a way to
determine the appropriate width given a desired height, or vice
versa. For non-resizable images, the true width and height
are used.

The default implementation simply returns

(float)getWidth(imageIndex)/getHeight(imageIndex)

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** a

float

indicating the aspect ratio of the
given image.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getRawImageType

```java
public
ImageTypeSpecifier
getRawImageType​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

ImageTypeSpecifier

indicating the

SampleModel

and

ColorModel

which most
closely represents the "raw" internal format of the image. If
there is no close match then a type which preserves the most
information from the image should be returned. The returned value
should also be included in the list of values returned by

getImageTypes

.

The default implementation simply returns the first entry
from the list provided by

getImageType

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** an

ImageTypeSpecifier

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the format
information from the input source.

- getImageTypes

```java
public abstract
Iterator
<
ImageTypeSpecifier
> getImageTypes​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

Iterator

containing possible image
types to which the given image may be decoded, in the form of

ImageTypeSpecifiers

s. At least one legal image
type will be returned.

The first element of the iterator should be the most
"natural" type for decoding the image with as little loss as
possible. For example, for a JPEG image the first entry should
be an RGB image, even though the image data is stored
internally in a YCbCr color space.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be

retrieved

.
**Returns:** an

Iterator

containing at least one

ImageTypeSpecifier

representing suggested image
types for decoding the current given image.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs reading the format
information from the input source.
**See Also:** ImageReadParam.setDestination(BufferedImage)

,

IIOParam.setDestinationType(ImageTypeSpecifier)

- getDefaultReadParam

```java
public
ImageReadParam
getDefaultReadParam()
```

Returns a default

ImageReadParam

object
appropriate for this format. All subclasses should define a
set of default values for all parameters and return them with
this call. This method may be called before the input source
is set.

The default implementation constructs and returns a new

ImageReadParam

object that does not allow source
scaling (

i.e.

, it returns

new ImageReadParam()

.

**Returns:** an

ImageReadParam

object which may be used
to control the decoding process using a set of default settings.

- getStreamMetadata

```java
public abstract
IIOMetadata
getStreamMetadata()
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object representing the
metadata associated with the input source as a whole (i.e., not
associated with any particular image), or

null

if
the reader does not support reading metadata, is set to ignore
metadata, or if no metadata is available.

**Returns:** an

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getStreamMetadata

```java
public
IIOMetadata
getStreamMetadata​(
String
formatName,

Set
<
String
> nodeNames)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object representing the
metadata associated with the input source as a whole (i.e.,
not associated with any particular image). If no such data
exists,

null

is returned.

The resulting metadata object is only responsible for
returning documents in the format named by

formatName

. Within any documents that are
returned, only nodes whose names are members of

nodeNames

are required to be returned. In this
way, the amount of metadata processing done by the reader may
be kept to a minimum, based on what information is actually
needed.

If

formatName

is not the name of a supported
metadata format,

null

is returned.

In all cases, it is legal to return a more capable metadata
object than strictly necessary. The format name and node names
are merely hints that may be used to reduce the reader's
workload.

The default implementation simply returns the result of
calling

getStreamMetadata()

, after checking that
the format name is supported. If it is not,

null

is returned.

**Parameters:** formatName

- a metadata format name that may be used to retrieve
a document from the returned

IIOMetadata

object.
**Parameters:** nodeNames

- a

Set

containing the names of
nodes that may be contained in a retrieved document.
**Returns:** an

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

formatName

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

nodeNames

is

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getImageMetadata

```java
public abstract
IIOMetadata
getImageMetadata​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object containing metadata
associated with the given image, or

null

if the
reader does not support reading metadata, is set to ignore
metadata, or if no metadata is available.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image whose metadata is to
be retrieved.
**Returns:** an

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getImageMetadata

```java
public
IIOMetadata
getImageMetadata​(int imageIndex,

String
formatName,

Set
<
String
> nodeNames)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object representing the
metadata associated with the given image, or

null

if the reader does not support reading metadata or none
is available.

The resulting metadata object is only responsible for
returning documents in the format named by

formatName

. Within any documents that are
returned, only nodes whose names are members of

nodeNames

are required to be returned. In this
way, the amount of metadata processing done by the reader may
be kept to a minimum, based on what information is actually
needed.

If

formatName

is not the name of a supported
metadata format,

null

may be returned.

In all cases, it is legal to return a more capable metadata
object than strictly necessary. The format name and node names
are merely hints that may be used to reduce the reader's
workload.

The default implementation simply returns the result of
calling

getImageMetadata(imageIndex)

, after
checking that the format name is supported. If it is not,

null

is returned.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image whose metadata is to
be retrieved.

IIOMetadata

object, or

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

formatName

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

nodeNames

is

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- read

```java
public
BufferedImage
read​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

imageIndex

and returns
an

IIOImage

containing the image, thumbnails, and
associated image metadata, using a supplied

ImageReadParam

.

The actual

BufferedImage

referenced by the
returned

IIOImage

will be chosen using the
algorithm defined by the

getDestination

method.

Any registered

method will be called.

IIOReadUpdateListener

objects may be updated at
other times during the read as pixels are decoded. Finally,

IIOReadWarningListener

objects will receive
notification of any non-fatal warnings that occur during
decoding.

The set of source bands to be read and destination bands to
be written is determined by calling

getSourceBands

containing

ImageReadParam

objects is supplied; one
element is consumed for each image read from the input source
until no more images are available. If the read param

Iterator

runs out of elements, but there are still
more images available from the input source, default read
params are used for the remaining images.

If

params

is

null

, a default read
param will be used for all images.

The actual

BufferedImage

referenced by the
returned

IIOImage

will be chosen using the
algorithm defined by the

getDestination

method.

Any registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects
will be notified by calling their

sequenceStarted

method once. Then, for each image decoded, there will be a
call to

imageStarted

, followed by calls to

imageProgress

as the read progresses, and finally
to

imageComplete

. The

sequenceComplete

method will be called after the
last image has been decoded.

IIOReadUpdateListener

objects may be updated at
other times during the read as pixels are decoded. Finally,

IIOReadWarningListener

objects will receive
notification of any non-fatal warnings that occur during
decoding.

The set of source bands to be read and destination bands to
be written is determined by calling

getSourceBands

and

getDestinationBands

on the supplied

ImageReadParam

. If the lengths of the arrays
returned by these methods differ, the set of source bands
contains an index larger that the largest available source
index, or the set of destination bands contains an index larger
than the largest legal destination index, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

Thumbnails will be returned in their entirety regardless of the
region settings.

If any of the supplied

ImageReadParam

s contain
optional setting values not supported by this reader (

e.g.

source render size or any format-specific settings), they will
be ignored.

**Parameters:** params

- an

Iterator

containing

ImageReadParam

objects.
**Returns:** an

Iterator

representing the
contents of the input source as

IIOImage

s.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if any
non-

null

element of

params

is not an

ImageReadParam

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the set of source and
destination bands specified by

param.getSourceBands

and

param.getDestinationBands

differ in length or
include indices that are out of bounds.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if a resulting image would
have a width or height less than 1.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.
**See Also:** ImageReadParam

,

IIOImage

- canReadRaster

```java
public boolean canReadRaster()
```

Returns

true

if this plug-in supports reading
just a

Raster

of pixel data.
If this method returns

false

, calls to

readRaster

or

readTileRaster

will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

The default implementation returns

false

.

**Returns:** true

if this plug-in supports reading raw

Raster

s.
**See Also:** readRaster(int, javax.imageio.ImageReadParam)

,

readTileRaster(int, int, int)

- readRaster

```java
public
Raster
readRaster​(int imageIndex,

ImageReadParam
param)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a new

Raster

object containing the raw pixel data
from the image stream, without any color conversion applied. The
application must determine how to interpret the pixel data by other
means. Any destination or image-type parameters in the supplied

ImageReadParam

object are ignored, but all other
parameters are used exactly as in the

read

method, except that any destination offset is used as a logical rather
than a physical offset. The size of the returned

Raster

will always be that of the source region clipped to the actual image.
Logical offsets in the stream itself are ignored.

This method allows formats that normally apply a color
conversion, such as JPEG, and formats that do not normally have an
associated colorspace, such as remote sensing or medical imaging data,
to provide access to raw pixel data.

Any registered

readUpdateListener

s are ignored, as
there is no

BufferedImage

, but all other listeners are
called exactly as they are for the

read

method.

If

canReadRaster()

returns

false

, this method throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

If the supplied

ImageReadParam

contains
optional setting values not supported by this reader (

e.g.

source render size or any format-specific settings), they will
be ignored.

The default implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be read.
**Parameters:** param

- an

ImageReadParam

used to control
the reading process, or

null

.
**Returns:** the desired portion of the image as a

Raster

.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this plug-in does not
support reading raw

Raster

s.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.
**See Also:** canReadRaster()

,

read(int)

,

Raster

- isImageTiled

```java
public boolean isImageTiled​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns

true

if the image is organized into

tiles

, that is, equal-sized non-overlapping rectangles.

A reader plug-in may choose whether or not to expose tiling
that is present in the image as it is stored. It may even
choose to advertise tiling when none is explicitly present. In
general, tiling should only be advertised if there is some
advantage (in speed or space) to accessing individual tiles.
Regardless of whether the reader advertises tiling, it must be
capable of reading an arbitrary rectangular region specified in
an

ImageReadParam

.

A reader for which all images are guaranteed to be tiled,
or are guaranteed not to be tiled, may return

true

or

false

respectively without accessing any image
data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an exception
even if no input source has been set or the image index is out
of bounds.

The default implementation just returns

false

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** true

if the image is tiled.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getTileWidth

```java
public int getTileWidth​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the width of a tile in the given image.

The default implementation simply returns

getWidth(imageIndex)

, which is correct for
non-tiled images. Readers that support tiling should override
this method.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the width of a tile.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getTileHeight

```java
public int getTileHeight​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the height of a tile in the given image.

The default implementation simply returns

getHeight(imageIndex)

, which is correct for
non-tiled images. Readers that support tiling should override
this method.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the height of a tile.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getTileGridXOffset

```java
public int getTileGridXOffset​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the X coordinate of the upper-left corner of tile (0,
0) in the given image.

A reader for which the tile grid X offset always has the
same value (usually 0), may return the value without accessing
any image data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an
exception even if no input source has been set or the image
index is out of bounds.

The default implementation simply returns 0, which is
correct for non-tiled images and tiled images in most formats.
Readers that support tiling with non-(0, 0) offsets should
override this method.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the X offset of the tile grid.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getTileGridYOffset

```java
public int getTileGridYOffset​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner of tile (0,
0) in the given image.

A reader for which the tile grid Y offset always has the
same value (usually 0), may return the value without accessing
any image data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an
exception even if no input source has been set or the image
index is out of bounds.

The default implementation simply returns 0, which is
correct for non-tiled images and tiled images in most formats.
Readers that support tiling with non-(0, 0) offsets should
override this method.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be queried.
**Returns:** the Y offset of the tile grid.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an input source is required
to determine the return value, but none has been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an image must be
accessed to determine the return value, but the supplied index
is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- readTile

```java
public
BufferedImage
readTile​(int imageIndex,
int tileX,
int tileY)
throws
IOException
```

Reads the tile indicated by the

tileX

and

tileY

arguments, returning it as a

BufferedImage

. If the arguments are out of range,
an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown. If the
image is not tiled, the values 0, 0 will return the entire
image; any other values will cause an

IllegalArgumentException

to be thrown.

This method is merely a convenience equivalent to calling

read(int, ImageReadParam)

with a read param
specifying a source region having offsets of

tileX*getTileWidth(imageIndex)

,

tileY*getTileHeight(imageIndex)

and width and
height of

getTileWidth(imageIndex)

,

getTileHeight(imageIndex)

; and subsampling
factors of 1 and offsets of 0. To subsample a tile, call

read

with a read param specifying this region
and different subsampling parameters.

The default implementation returns the entire image if

tileX

and

tileY

are 0, or throws
an

IllegalArgumentException

otherwise.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** tileX

- the column index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** tileY

- the row index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.
**Returns:** the tile as a

BufferedImage

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the tile indices are
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- readTileRaster

```java
public
Raster
readTileRaster​(int imageIndex,
int tileX,
int tileY)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a new

Raster

object containing the raw
pixel data from the tile, without any color conversion applied.
The application must determine how to interpret the pixel data by other
means.

If

canReadRaster()

returns

false

, this method throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

The default implementation checks if reading

Raster

s is supported, and if so calls

readRaster(imageIndex, null)

if

tileX

and

tileY

are 0, or throws an

IllegalArgumentException

otherwise.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** tileX

- the column index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** tileY

- the row index (starting with 0) of the tile
to be retrieved.
**Returns:** the tile as a

Raster

.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this plug-in does not
support reading raw

Raster

s.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the tile indices are
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- readAsRenderedImage

```java
public
RenderedImage
readAsRenderedImage​(int imageIndex,

ImageReadParam
param)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a

RenderedImage

object that contains the
contents of the image indexed by

imageIndex

. By
default, the returned image is simply the

BufferedImage

returned by

read(imageIndex, param)

.

The semantics of this method may differ from those of the
other

read

methods in several ways. First, any
destination image and/or image type set in the

ImageReadParam

may be ignored. Second, the usual
listener calls are not guaranteed to be made, or to be
meaningful if they are. This is because the returned image may
not be fully populated with pixel data at the time it is
returned, or indeed at any time.

If the supplied

ImageReadParam

contains
optional setting values not supported by this reader (

e.g.

source render size or any format-specific settings), they will
be ignored.

The default implementation just calls

read(imageIndex, param)

.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** param

- an

ImageReadParam

used to control
the reading process, or

null

.
**Returns:** a

RenderedImage

object providing a view of
the image.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the input source has not been
set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the supplied index is
out of bounds.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the set of source and
destination bands specified by

param.getSourceBands

and

param.getDestinationBands

differ in length or
include indices that are out of bounds.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting image
would have a width or height less than 1.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- readerSupportsThumbnails

```java
public boolean readerSupportsThumbnails()
```

Returns

true

if the image format understood by
this reader supports thumbnail preview images associated with
it. The default implementation returns

false

.

If this method returns

false

,

hasThumbnails

and

getNumThumbnails

will return

false

and

0

,
respectively, and

readThumbnail

will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

, regardless of their
arguments.

A reader that does not support thumbnails need not
implement any of the thumbnail-related methods.

**Returns:** true

if thumbnails are supported.

- hasThumbnails

```java
public boolean hasThumbnails​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns

true

if the given image has thumbnail
preview images associated with it. If the format does not
support thumbnails (

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

),

false

will be
returned regardless of whether an input source has been set or
whether

imageIndex

is in bounds.

The default implementation returns

true

if

getNumThumbnails

returns a value greater than 0.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image being queried.
**Returns:** true

if the given image has thumbnails.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getNumThumbnails

```java
public int getNumThumbnails​(int imageIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the number of thumbnail preview images associated with
the given image. If the format does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

),

0

will be returned regardless
of whether an input source has been set or whether

imageIndex

is in bounds.

The default implementation returns 0 without checking its
argument.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image being queried.
**Returns:** the number of thumbnails associated with the given
image.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but the input source has not been set.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the reader supports
thumbnails but

imageIndex

is out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- getThumbnailWidth

```java
public int getThumbnailWidth​(int imageIndex,
int thumbnailIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the width of the thumbnail preview image indexed by

thumbnailIndex

, associated with the image indexed
by

ImageIndex

.

If the reader does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

), an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

The default implementation simply returns

readThumbnail(imageindex, thumbnailIndex).getWidth()

.
Subclasses should therefore
override this method if possible in order to avoid forcing the
thumbnail to be read.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** thumbnailIndex

- the index of the thumbnail to be retrieved.
**Returns:** the width of the desired thumbnail as an

int

.

```java
public int getThumbnailHeight​(int imageIndex,
int thumbnailIndex)
throws
IOException
```

Returns the height of the thumbnail preview image indexed by

thumbnailIndex

, associated with the image indexed
by

ImageIndex

.

If the reader does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

), an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

The default implementation simply returns

readThumbnail(imageindex, thumbnailIndex).getHeight()

.
Subclasses should therefore override
this method if possible in order to avoid
forcing the thumbnail to be read.

**Parameters:** imageIndex

- the index of the image to be retrieved.
**Parameters:** thumbnailIndex

- the index of the thumbnail to be retrieved.
**Returns:** the height of the desired thumbnail as an

int

BufferedImage
readThumbnail​(int imageIndex,
int thumbnailIndex)
throws
IOException
```

thumbnailIndex

, associated with the image indexed
by

ImageIndex

as a

BufferedImage

.

Any registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects
will be notified by calling their

thumbnailStarted

,

thumbnailProgress

,
and

thumbnailComplete

methods.

If the reader does not support thumbnails,
(

readerSupportsThumbnails

returns

false

), an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown regardless of whether an input source has been
set or whether the indices are in bounds.

- if either of the supplied
indices are out of bounds.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during reading.

- abort

```java
public void abort()
```

Requests that any current read operation be aborted. The
contents of the image following the abort will be undefined.

Readers should call

clearAbortRequest

at the
beginning of each read operation, and poll the value of

abortRequested

regularly during the read.

- abortRequested

```java
protected boolean abortRequested()
```

Returns

true

if a request to abort the current
read operation has been made since the reader was instantiated or

clearAbortRequest

was called.

**Returns:** true

if the current read operation should
be aborted.
**See Also:** abort()

,

clearAbortRequest()

- clearAbortRequest

```java
protected void clearAbortRequest()
```

called,

abortRequested

will return

false

.

**See Also:** abort()

,

abortRequested()

- addIIOReadWarningListener

```java
public void addIIOReadWarningListener​(
IIOReadWarningListener
listener)
```

Adds an

IIOReadWarningListener

to the list of
registered warning listeners. If

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken. Messages sent to the given listener will be
localized, if possible, to match the current

Locale

. If no

Locale

has been set,
warning messages may be localized as the reader sees fit.

**Parameters:** listener

- an

IIOReadWarningListener

to be registered.
**See Also:** removeIIOReadWarningListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadWarningListener)

- removeIIOReadWarningListener

```java
public void removeIIOReadWarningListener​(
IIOReadWarningListener
listener)
```

Removes an

IIOReadWarningListener

from the list of
registered error listeners. If the listener was not previously
registered, or if

listener

is

null

,
no exception will be thrown and no action will be taken.

**Parameters:** listener

- an IIOReadWarningListener to be unregistered.
**See Also:** addIIOReadWarningListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadWarningListener)

- removeAllIIOReadWarningListeners

```java
public void removeAllIIOReadWarningListeners()
```

Removes all currently registered

IIOReadWarningListener

objects.

The default implementation sets the

warningListeners

and

warningLocales

instance variables to

null

.

- addIIOReadProgressListener

```java
public void addIIOReadProgressListener​(
IIOReadProgressListener
listener)
```

Adds an

IIOReadProgressListener

to the list of
registered progress listeners. If

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken.

**Parameters:** listener

- an IIOReadProgressListener to be registered.
**See Also:** removeIIOReadProgressListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadProgressListener)

- removeIIOReadProgressListener

```java
public void removeIIOReadProgressListener​(
IIOReadProgressListener
listener)
```

Removes an

IIOReadProgressListener

from the list
of registered progress listeners. If the listener was not
previously registered, or if

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken.

**Parameters:** listener

- an IIOReadProgressListener to be unregistered.
**See Also:** addIIOReadProgressListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadProgressListener)

- removeAllIIOReadProgressListeners

```java
public void removeAllIIOReadProgressListeners()
```

Removes all currently registered

IIOReadProgressListener

objects.

The default implementation sets the

progressListeners

instance variable to

null

.

- addIIOReadUpdateListener

```java
public void addIIOReadUpdateListener​(
IIOReadUpdateListener
listener)
```

Adds an

IIOReadUpdateListener

to the list of
registered update listeners. If

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken. The listener will receive notification of pixel
updates as images and thumbnails are decoded, including the
starts and ends of progressive passes.

If no update listeners are present, the reader may choose
to perform fewer updates to the pixels of the destination
images and/or thumbnails, which may result in more efficient
decoding.

For example, in progressive JPEG decoding each pass
contains updates to a set of coefficients, which would have to
be transformed into pixel values and converted to an RGB color
space for each pass if listeners are present. If no listeners
are present, the coefficients may simply be accumulated and the
final results transformed and color converted one time only.

The final results of decoding will be the same whether or
not intermediate updates are performed. Thus if only the final
image is desired it may be preferable not to register any

IIOReadUpdateListener

s. In general, progressive
updating is most effective when fetching images over a network
connection that is very slow compared to local CPU processing;
over a fast connection, progressive updates may actually slow
down the presentation of the image.

**Parameters:** listener

- an IIOReadUpdateListener to be registered.
**See Also:** removeIIOReadUpdateListener(javax.imageio.event.IIOReadUpdateListener)

- removeIIOReadUpdateListener

```java
public void removeIIOReadUpdateListener​(
IIOReadUpdateListener
listener)
```

previously registered, or if

listener

is

null

- removeAllIIOReadUpdateListeners

```java
public void removeAllIIOReadUpdateListeners()
```

- getSourceRegion

```java
protected static
Rectangle
getSourceRegion​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int srcWidth,
int srcHeight)
```

A utility method that may be used by readers to compute the
region of the source image that should be read, taking into
account any source region and subsampling offset settings in
the supplied

ImageReadParam

. The actual
subsampling factors, destination size, and destination offset
are

not

taken into consideration, thus further
clipping must take place. The

computeRegions

method performs all necessary clipping.

**Parameters:** param

- the

ImageReadParam

being used, or

null

.
**Parameters:** srcWidth

- the width of the source image.
**Parameters:** srcHeight

- the height of the source image.
**Returns:** the source region as a

Rectangle

.

- computeRegions

```java
protected static void computeRegions​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int srcWidth,
int srcHeight,

BufferedImage
image,

Rectangle
srcRegion,

Rectangle
destRegion)
```

Computes the source region of interest and the destination
region of interest, taking the width and height of the source
image, an optional destination image, and an optional

ImageReadParam

into account. The source region
begins with the entire source image. Then that is clipped to
the source region specified in the

ImageReadParam

,
if one is specified.

If either of the destination offsets are negative, the
source region is clipped so that its top left will coincide
with the top left of the destination image, taking subsampling
into account. Then the result is clipped to the destination
image on the right and bottom, if one is specified, taking
subsampling and destination offsets into account.

Similarly, the destination region begins with the source
image, is translated to the destination offset given in the

ImageReadParam

if there is one, and finally is
clipped to the destination image, if there is one.

If either the source or destination regions end up having a
width or height of 0, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

The

getSourceRegion>

method may be used if only source clipping is desired.

**Parameters:** param

- an

ImageReadParam

, or

null

.
**Parameters:** srcWidth

- the width of the source image.
**Parameters:** srcHeight

- the height of the source image.
**Parameters:** image

- a

BufferedImage

that will be the
destination image, or

null

.
**Parameters:** srcRegion

- a

Rectangle

that will be filled with
the source region of interest.
**Parameters:** destRegion

- a

Rectangle

that will be filled with
the destination region of interest.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

srcRegion

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

dstRegion

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting source or
destination region is empty.

- checkReadParamBandSettings

```java
protected static void checkReadParamBandSettings​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int numSrcBands,
int numDstBands)
```

A utility method that may be used by readers to test the
validity of the source and destination band settings of an

ImageReadParam

. This method may be called as soon
as the reader knows both the number of bands of the source
image as it exists in the input stream, and the number of bands
of the destination image that being written.

The method retrieves the source and destination band
setting arrays from param using the

getSourceBands

and

getDestinationBands

methods (or considers them
to be

null

if

param

is

null

). If the source band setting array is

null

, it is considered to be equal to the array

{ 0, 1, ..., numSrcBands - 1 }

, and similarly for
the destination band setting array.

The method then tests that both arrays are equal in length,
and that neither array contains a value larger than the largest
available band index.

Any failure results in an

IllegalArgumentException

being thrown; success
results in the method returning silently.

**Parameters:** param

- the

ImageReadParam

being used to read
the image.
**Parameters:** numSrcBands

- the number of bands of the image as it exists
int the input source.
**Parameters:** numDstBands

- the number of bands in the destination image
being written.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

param

contains an invalid specification of a source and/or
destination band subset.

- getDestination

```java
protected static
BufferedImage
getDestination​(
ImageReadParam
param,

Iterator
<
ImageTypeSpecifier
> imageTypes,
int width,
int height)
throws
IIOException
```

Returns the

BufferedImage

to which decoded pixel
data should be written. The image is determined by inspecting
the supplied

ImageReadParam

if it is
non-

null

; if its

getDestination

method returns a non-

null

value, that image is
simply returned. Otherwise,

param.getDestinationType

method is called to
determine if a particular image type has been specified. If
so, the returned

ImageTypeSpecifier

is used after
checking that it is equal to one of those included in

imageTypes

.

If

param

is

null

or the above
steps have not yielded an image or an

ImageTypeSpecifier

, the first value obtained from
the

imageTypes

parameter is used. Typically, the
caller will set

imageTypes

to the value of

getImageTypes(imageIndex)

.

Next, the dimensions of the image are determined by a call
to

computeRegions

. The actual width and height of
the image being decoded are passed in as the

width

and

height

parameters.

**Parameters:** param

- an

ImageReadParam

to be used to get
the destination image or image type, or

null

.
**Parameters:** imageTypes

- an

Iterator

of

ImageTypeSpecifier

s indicating the legal image
types, with the default first.
**Parameters:** width

- the true width of the image or tile being decoded.
**Parameters:** height

- the true width of the image or tile being decoded.
**Returns:** the

BufferedImage

to which decoded pixel
data should be written.
**Throws:** IIOException

- if the

ImageTypeSpecifier

specified by

param

does not match any of the legal
ones from

imageTypes

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

imageTypes

is

null

or empty, or if an object not of type

ImageTypeSpecifier

is retrieved from it.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting image would
have a width or height less than 1.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the product of

width

and

height

is greater than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

setInput

```java
public void setInput​(
Object
input,
boolean seekForwardOnly,
boolean ignoreMetadata)
```

Sets the input source to use to the given

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

.
The input source must be set before any of the query or read
methods are used. If

input

is

null

,
any currently set input source will be removed. In any case,
the value of

minIndex

will be initialized to 0.

The

seekForwardOnly

parameter controls whether
the value returned by

getMinIndex

will be
increased as each image (or thumbnail, or image metadata) is
read. If

seekForwardOnly

is true, then a call to

read(index)

will throw an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

if

index < this.minIndex

;
otherwise, the value of

minIndex

will be set to

index

. If

seekForwardOnly

is

false

, the value of

minIndex

will remain 0 regardless of any read
operations.

The

ignoreMetadata

parameter, if set to

true

, allows the reader to disregard any metadata
encountered during the read. Subsequent calls to the

getStreamMetadata

and

getImageMetadata

methods may return

null

, and an

IIOImage

returned from

readAll

may return

null

from their

getMetadata

method. Setting this parameter may
allow the reader to work more efficiently. The reader may
choose to disregard this setting and return metadata normally.

Subclasses should take care to remove any cached
information based on the previous stream, such as header
information or partially decoded image data.

Use of a general

Object

other than an

ImageInputStream

is intended for readers that
interact directly with a capture device or imaging protocol.
The set of legal classes is advertised by the reader's service
provider's

getInputTypes

method; most readers
will return a single-element array containing only

ImageInputStream.class

to indicate that they
accept only an

ImageInputStream

.

The default implementation checks the

input

argument against the list returned by

originatingProvider.getInputTypes()

and fails
if the argument is not an instance of one of the classes
in the list. If the originating provider is set to

null

, the input is accepted only if it is an

ImageInputStream

.

**Parameters:** input

- the

ImageInputStream

or other

Object

to use for future decoding.
**Parameters:** seekForwardOnly

- if

true

, images and metadata
may only be read in ascending order from this input source.
**Parameters:** ignoreMetadata

- if

true

, metadata
may be ignored during reads.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

Set

throws

IOException

Returns an

IIOMetadata

object representing the
metadata associated with the given image, or

null

if the reader does not support reading metadata or none
is available.

The resulting metadata object is only responsible for
returning documents in the format named by

formatName

. Within any documents that are
returned, only nodes whose names are members of

nodeNames

are required to be returned. In this
way, the amount of metadata processing done by the reader may
be kept to a minimum, based on what information is actually
needed.

If

formatName

is not the name of a supported
metadata format,

null

may be returned.

In all cases, it is legal to return a more capable metadata
object than strictly necessary. The format name and node names
are merely hints that may be used to reduce the reader's
workload.

The default implementation simply returns the result of
calling

getImageMetadata(imageIndex)

, after
checking that the format name is supported. If it is not,

null

is returned.

param)
throws

```

Returns a new

Raster

object containing the raw pixel data
from the image stream, without any color conversion applied. The
application must determine how to interpret the pixel data by other
means. Any destination or image-type parameters in the supplied

ImageReadParam

object are ignored, but all other
parameters are used exactly as in the

read

method, except that any destination offset is used as a logical rather
than a physical offset. The size of the returned

Raster

will always be that of the source region clipped to the actual image.
Logical offsets in the stream itself are ignored.

This method allows formats that normally apply a color
conversion, such as JPEG, and formats that do not normally have an
associated colorspace, such as remote sensing or medical imaging data,
to provide access to raw pixel data.

Any registered

readUpdateListener

s are ignored, as
there is no

, but all other listeners are
called exactly as they are for the

read

method.

If

addIIOReadUpdateListener

```java

IIOReadUpdateListener
listener)
```

Adds an

IIOReadUpdateListener

to the list of
registered update listeners. If

listener

is

null

, no exception will be thrown and no action
will be taken. The listener will receive notification of pixel
updates as images and thumbnails are decoded, including the
starts and ends of progressive passes.

If no update listeners are present, the reader may choose
to perform fewer updates to the pixels of the destination
images and/or thumbnails, which may result in more efficient
decoding.

For example, in progressive JPEG decoding each pass
contains updates to a set of coefficients, which would have to
be transformed into pixel values and converted to an RGB color
space for each pass if listeners are present. If no listeners
are present, the coefficients may simply be accumulated and the
final results transformed and color converted one time only.

The final results of decoding will be the same whether or
not intermediate updates are performed. Thus if only the final
image is desired it may be preferable not to register any

IIOReadUpdateListener

s. In general, progressive
updating is most effective when fetching images over a network
connection that is very slow compared to local CPU processing;
over a fast connection, progressive updates may actually slow
down the presentation of the image.

- an IIOReadUpdateListener to be registered.

```

A utility method that may be used by readers to compute the
region of the source image that should be read, taking into
account any source region and subsampling offset settings in
the supplied

ImageReadParam

. The actual
subsampling factors, destination size, and destination offset
are

not

taken into consideration, thus further
clipping must take place. The

computeRegions

method performs all necessary clipping.

**Parameters:** param

- the

ImageReadParam

being used, or

null

.
**Parameters:** srcWidth

- the width of the source image.
**Parameters:** srcHeight

- the height of the source image.

computeRegions

```java
protected static void computeRegions​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int srcWidth,
int srcHeight,

BufferedImage
image,

Rectangle
srcRegion,

Rectangle
destRegion)
```

Computes the source region of interest and the destination
region of interest, taking the width and height of the source
image, an optional destination image, and an optional

ImageReadParam

into account. The source region
begins with the entire source image. Then that is clipped to
the source region specified in the

ImageReadParam

,
if one is specified.

If either of the destination offsets are negative, the
source region is clipped so that its top left will coincide
with the top left of the destination image, taking subsampling
into account. Then the result is clipped to the destination
image on the right and bottom, if one is specified, taking
subsampling and destination offsets into account.

Similarly, the destination region begins with the source
image, is translated to the destination offset given in the

ImageReadParam

if there is one, and finally is
clipped to the destination image, if there is one.

If either the source or destination regions end up having a
width or height of 0, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

The

getSourceRegion>

method may be used if only source clipping is desired.

**Parameters:** param

- an

ImageReadParam

, or

null

.
**Parameters:** srcWidth

- the width of the source image.
**Parameters:** srcHeight

- the height of the source image.
**Parameters:** image

- a

BufferedImage

that will be the
destination image, or

null

.
**Parameters:** srcRegion

- a

Rectangle

that will be filled with
the source region of interest.
**Parameters:** destRegion

- a

Rectangle

that will be filled with
the destination region of interest.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

srcRegion

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

dstRegion

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the resulting source or
destination region is empty.

checkReadParamBandSettings

```java
protected static void checkReadParamBandSettings​(
ImageReadParam
param,
int numSrcBands,
int numDstBands)
```

A utility method that may be used by readers to test the
validity of the source and destination band settings of an

ImageReadParam

. This method may be called as soon
as the reader knows both the number of bands of the source
image as it exists in the input stream, and the number of bands
of the destination image that being written.

The method retrieves the source and destination band
setting arrays from param using the

getSourceBands

and

getDestinationBands

methods (or considers them
to be

null

if

param

is

null

). If the source band setting array is

null

, it is considered to be equal to the array

{ 0, 1, ..., numSrcBands - 1 }

, and similarly for
the destination band setting array.

The method then tests that both arrays are equal in length,
and that neither array contains a value larger than the largest
available band index.

Any failure results in an

IllegalArgumentException

being thrown; success
results in the method returning silently.

**Parameters:** param

- the

ImageReadParam

being used to read
the image.
**Parameters:** numSrcBands

- the number of bands of the image as it exists
int the input source.
**Parameters:** numDstBands

- the number of bands in the destination image
being written.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

param

contains an invalid specification of a source and/or
destination band subset.

Next, the dimensions of the image are determined by a call
to

computeRegions

. The actual width and height of
the image being decoded are passed in as the

width

and

height

parameters.

**Parameters:** param

- an

ImageReadParam
