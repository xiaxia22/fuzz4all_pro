public interface
FlightRecorderMXBean

extends
PlatformManagedObject
```

Management interface for controlling Flight Recorder.

The object name for identifying the MXBean in the platform MBean
server is:

Flight Recorder can be configured in the following ways:

- Recording options

Specify how long a recording should last, and where and when data
should be dumped.
- Settings

Specify which events should be enabled and what kind information each
event should capture.
- Configurations

Predefined sets of settings, typically derived from a settings file,
that specify the configuration of multiple events simultaneously.

See the package

jdk.jfr

documentation for descriptions of the settings
syntax and the

ConfigurationInfo

class documentation for configuration information.

---

#### void setRecordingSettings​(long recordingId,

Map
<
String
,​
String
> settings)
throws
IllegalArgumentException

Sets and replaces all previous settings for the specified recording.

A setting consists of a name/value pair, where

name

specifies the
event and setting to configure, and the

value

specifies what to set
it to.

The name can be formed in the following ways:

<event-name> + "#" + <setting-name>

or

<event-id> + "#" + <setting-name>

For example, to set the sample interval of the CPU Load event to once every
second, use the name

"jdk.CPULoad#period"

and the value

"1 s"

. If multiple events use the same name, for example if an event
class is loaded in multiple class loaders, and differentiation is needed
between them, then the name is

"56#period"

. The ID for an event is
obtained by invoking

EventType.getId()

method and is valid
for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instance that the event is registered in.

A list of available event names is retrieved by invoking

FlightRecorder.getEventTypes()

and

EventType.getName()

. A list of available settings for an
event type is obtained by invoking

EventType.getSettingDescriptors()

and

ValueDescriptor.getName()

.

**Parameters:**
- recordingId

- ID of the recording
- settings

- name value map of the settings to set, not

null

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if no recording with the specified ID exists
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the
caller does not have

ManagementPermission("control")

- Recording.getId()

---

#### void setRecordingOptions​(long recordingId,

Map
<
String
,​
String
> options)
throws
IllegalArgumentException

Configures the recording options (for example, destination file and time span
to keep data).

See

FlightRecorderMXBean

for a description of the options and values
that can be used. Setting a value to

null

restores the value to the
default value.

**Parameters:**
- recordingId

- the ID of the recording to set options for
- options

- name/value map of the settings to set, not

null

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if no recording with the specified ID exists
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists, and the
caller does not have

ManagementPermission("control")

or an
option contains a file that the caller does not have permission to
operate on.

- setRecordingSettings

```java
void setRecordingSettings​(long recordingId,

Map
<
String
,​
String
> settings)
throws
IllegalArgumentException
```

Sets and replaces all previous settings for the specified recording.

A setting consists of a name/value pair, where

name

specifies the
event and setting to configure, and the

value

specifies what to set
it to.

The name can be formed in the following ways:

<event-name> + "#" + <setting-name>

or

<event-id> + "#" + <setting-name>

For example, to set the sample interval of the CPU Load event to once every
second, use the name

"jdk.CPULoad#period"

and the value

"1 s"

. If multiple events use the same name, for example if an event
class is loaded in multiple class loaders, and differentiation is needed
between them, then the name is

"56#period"

. The ID for an event is
obtained by invoking

EventType.getId()

method and is valid
for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instance that the event is registered in.

A list of available event names is retrieved by invoking

FlightRecorder.getEventTypes()

and

EventType.getName()

. A list of available settings for an
event type is obtained by invoking

EventType.getSettingDescriptors()

and

ValueDescriptor.getName()

.

<event-id> + "#" + <setting-name>

For example, to set the sample interval of the CPU Load event to once every
second, use the name

"jdk.CPULoad#period"

and the value

"1 s"

. If multiple events use the same name, for example if an event
class is loaded in multiple class loaders, and differentiation is needed
between them, then the name is

"56#period"

. The ID for an event is
obtained by invoking

EventType.getId()

method and is valid
for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instance that the event is registered in.

A list of available event names is retrieved by invoking
