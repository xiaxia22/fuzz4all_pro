# Class MutableCallSite

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\invoke\MutableCallSite.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
MutableCallSite

extends
CallSite
```

A

MutableCallSite

is a

CallSite

whose target variable
behaves like an ordinary field.
An

invokedynamic

instruction linked to a

MutableCallSite

delegates
all calls to the site's current target.
The

dynamic invoker

of a mutable call site
also delegates each call to the site's current target.

Here is an example of a mutable call site which introduces a
state variable into a method handle chain.

JavaDocExamplesTest.testMutableCallSite

```java
MutableCallSite name = new MutableCallSite(MethodType.methodType(String.class));
MethodHandle MH_name = name.dynamicInvoker();
MethodType MT_str1 = MethodType.methodType(String.class);
MethodHandle MH_upcase = MethodHandles.lookup()
.findVirtual(String.class, "toUpperCase", MT_str1);
MethodHandle worker1 = MethodHandles.filterReturnValue(MH_name, MH_upcase);
name.setTarget(MethodHandles.constant(String.class, "Rocky"));
assertEquals("ROCKY", (String) worker1.invokeExact());
name.setTarget(MethodHandles.constant(String.class, "Fred"));
assertEquals("FRED", (String) worker1.invokeExact());
// (mutation can be continued indefinitely)
```

The same call site may be used in several places at once.

```java
MethodType MT_str2 = MethodType.methodType(String.class, String.class);
MethodHandle MH_cat = lookup().findVirtual(String.class,
"concat", methodType(String.class, String.class));
MethodHandle MH_dear = MethodHandles.insertArguments(MH_cat, 1, ", dear?");
MethodHandle worker2 = MethodHandles.filterReturnValue(MH_name, MH_dear);
assertEquals("Fred, dear?", (String) worker2.invokeExact());
name.setTarget(MethodHandles.constant(String.class, "Wilma"));
assertEquals("WILMA", (String) worker1.invokeExact());
assertEquals("Wilma, dear?", (String) worker2.invokeExact());
```

Non-synchronization of target values:

A write to a mutable call site's target does not force other threads
to become aware of the updated value. Threads which do not perform
suitable synchronization actions relative to the updated call site
may cache the old target value and delay their use of the new target
value indefinitely.
(This is a normal consequence of the Java Memory Model as applied
to object fields.)

The

syncAll

operation provides a way to force threads
to accept a new target value, even if there is no other synchronization.

For target values which will be frequently updated, consider using
a

volatile call site

instead.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public MutableCallSite​(
MethodType
type)

Creates a blank call site object with the given method type.
The initial target is set to a method handle of the given type
which will throw an

IllegalStateException

if called.

The type of the call site is permanently set to the given type.

Before this

CallSite

object is returned from a bootstrap method,
or invoked in some other manner,
it is usually provided with a more useful target method,
via a call to

setTarget

.

**Parameters:**
- type

- the method type that this call site will have

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the proposed type is null

---

#### public MutableCallSite​(
MethodHandle
target)

Creates a call site object with an initial target method handle.
The type of the call site is permanently set to the initial target's type.

**Parameters:**
- target

- the method handle that will be the initial target of the call site

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the proposed target is null

---

### Method Details

#### public final
MethodHandle
getTarget()

Returns the target method of the call site, which behaves
like a normal field of the

MutableCallSite

.

The interactions of

getTarget

with memory are the same
as of a read from an ordinary variable, such as an array element or a
non-volatile, non-final field.

In particular, the current thread may choose to reuse the result
of a previous read of the target from memory, and may fail to see
a recent update to the target by another thread.

**Specified by:**
- getTarget

in class

CallSite

**Returns:**
- the linkage state of this call site, a method handle which can change over time

**See Also:**
- setTarget(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle)

---

#### public void setTarget​(
MethodHandle
newTarget)

Updates the target method of this call site, as a normal variable.
The type of the new target must agree with the type of the old target.

The interactions with memory are the same
as of a write to an ordinary variable, such as an array element or a
non-volatile, non-final field.

In particular, unrelated threads may fail to see the updated target
until they perform a read from memory.
Stronger guarantees can be created by putting appropriate operations
into the bootstrap method and/or the target methods used
at any given call site.

**Specified by:**
- setTarget

in class

CallSite

**Parameters:**
- newTarget

- the new target

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the proposed new target is null
- WrongMethodTypeException

- if the proposed new target
has a method type that differs from the previous target

**See Also:**
- getTarget()

---

#### public static void syncAll​(
MutableCallSite
[] sites)

Performs a synchronization operation on each call site in the given array,
forcing all other threads to throw away any cached values previously
loaded from the target of any of the call sites.

This operation does not reverse any calls that have already started
on an old target value.
(Java supports

forward time travel

only.)

The overall effect is to force all future readers of each call site's target
to accept the most recently stored value.
("Most recently" is reckoned relative to the

syncAll

itself.)
Conversely, the

syncAll

call may block until all readers have
(somehow) decached all previous versions of each call site's target.

To avoid race conditions, calls to

setTarget

and

syncAll

should generally be performed under some sort of mutual exclusion.
Note that reader threads may observe an updated target as early
as the

setTarget

call that install the value
(and before the

syncAll

that confirms the value).
On the other hand, reader threads may observe previous versions of
the target until the

syncAll

call returns
(and after the

setTarget

that attempts to convey the updated version).

This operation is likely to be expensive and should be used sparingly.
If possible, it should be buffered for batch processing on sets of call sites.

If

sites

contains a null element,
a

NullPointerException

will be raised.
In this case, some non-null elements in the array may be
processed before the method returns abnormally.
Which elements these are (if any) is implementation-dependent.

Java Memory Model details

In terms of the Java Memory Model, this operation performs a synchronization
action which is comparable in effect to the writing of a volatile variable
by the current thread, and an eventual volatile read by every other thread
that may access one of the affected call sites.

The following effects are apparent, for each individual call site

S

:

- A new volatile variable

V

is created, and written by the current thread.
As defined by the JMM, this write is a global synchronization event.

As is normal with thread-local ordering of write events,
every action already performed by the current thread is
taken to happen before the volatile write to

V

.
(In some implementations, this means that the current thread
performs a global release operation.)

Specifically, the write to the current target of

S

is
taken to happen before the volatile write to

V

.

The volatile write to

V

is placed
(in an implementation specific manner)
in the global synchronization order.

Consider an arbitrary thread

T

(other than the current thread).
If

T

executes a synchronization action

A

after the volatile write to

V

(in the global synchronization order),
it is therefore required to see either the current target
of

S

, or a later write to that target,
if it executes a read on the target of

S

.
(This constraint is called "synchronization-order consistency".)

The JMM specifically allows optimizing compilers to elide
reads or writes of variables that are known to be useless.
Such elided reads and writes have no effect on the happens-before
relation. Regardless of this fact, the volatile

V

will not be elided, even though its written value is
indeterminate and its read value is not used.

Because of the last point, the implementation behaves as if a
volatile read of

V

were performed by

T

immediately after its action

A

. In the local ordering
of actions in

T

, this read happens before any future
read of the target of

S

. It is as if the
implementation arbitrarily picked a read of

S

's target
by

T

, and forced a read of

V

to precede it,
thereby ensuring communication of the new target value.

As long as the constraints of the Java Memory Model are obeyed,
implementations may delay the completion of a

syncAll

operation while other threads (

T

above) continue to
use previous values of

S

's target.
However, implementations are (as always) encouraged to avoid
livelock, and to eventually require all threads to take account
of the updated target.

Discussion:

For performance reasons,

syncAll

is not a virtual method
on a single call site, but rather applies to a set of call sites.
Some implementations may incur a large fixed overhead cost
for processing one or more synchronization operations,
but a small incremental cost for each additional call site.
In any case, this operation is likely to be costly, since
other threads may have to be somehow interrupted
in order to make them notice the updated target value.
However, it may be observed that a single call to synchronize
several sites has the same formal effect as many calls,
each on just one of the sites.

Implementation Note:

Simple implementations of

MutableCallSite

may use
a volatile variable for the target of a mutable call site.
In such an implementation, the

syncAll

method can be a no-op,
and yet it will conform to the JMM behavior documented above.

**Parameters:**
- sites

- an array of call sites to be synchronized

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the

sites

array reference is null
or the array contains a null

Consider an arbitrary thread

T

(other than the current thread).
If

T

executes a synchronization action

A

after the volatile write to

V

(in the global synchronization order),
it is therefore required to see either the current target
of

S

, or a later write to that target,
if it executes a read on the target of

S

.
(This constraint is called "synchronization-order consistency".)

The JMM specifically allows optimizing compilers to elide
reads or writes of variables that are known to be useless.
Such elided reads and writes have no effect on the happens-before
relation. Regardless of this fact, the volatile

V

will not be elided, even though its written value is
indeterminate and its read value is not used.

Because of the last point, the implementation behaves as if a
volatile read of

V

were performed by

T

immediately after its action

A

. In the local ordering
of actions in

T

, this read happens before any future
read of the target of

S

. It is as if the
implementation arbitrarily picked a read of

S

's target
by

T

, and forced a read of

V

to precede it,
thereby ensuring communication of the new target value.

As long as the constraints of the Java Memory Model are obeyed,
implementations may delay the completion of a

syncAll

operation while other threads (

T

above) continue to
use previous values of

S

's target.
However, implementations are (as always) encouraged to avoid
livelock, and to eventually require all threads to take account
of the updated target.

Discussion:

For performance reasons,

syncAll

is not a virtual method
on a single call site, but rather applies to a set of call sites.
Some implementations may incur a large fixed overhead cost
for processing one or more synchronization operations,
but a small incremental cost for each additional call site.
In any case, this operation is likely to be costly, since
other threads may have to be somehow interrupted
in order to make them notice the updated target value.
However, it may be observed that a single call to synchronize
several sites has the same formal effect as many calls,
each on just one of the sites.

Implementation Note:

Simple implementations of

MutableCallSite

may use
a volatile variable for the target of a mutable call site.
In such an implementation, the

syncAll

method can be a no-op,
and yet it will conform to the JMM behavior documented above.

Method Detail

- getTarget

```java
public final
MethodHandle
getTarget()
```

Returns the target method of the call site, which behaves
like a normal field of the

MutableCallSite

.

The interactions of

getTarget

with memory are the same
as of a read from an ordinary variable, such as an array element or a
non-volatile, non-final field.

In particular, the current thread may choose to reuse the result
of a previous read of the target from memory, and may fail to see
a recent update to the target by another thread.

**Specified by:** getTarget

in class

CallSite
**Returns:** the linkage state of this call site, a method handle which can change over time
**See Also:** setTarget(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle)

- setTarget

```java
public void setTarget​(
MethodHandle
newTarget)
```

Updates the target method of this call site, as a normal variable.
The type of the new target must agree with the type of the old target.

The interactions with memory are the same
as of a write to an ordinary variable, such as an array element or a
non-volatile, non-final field.

In particular, unrelated threads may fail to see the updated target
until they perform a read from memory.
Stronger guarantees can be created by putting appropriate operations
into the bootstrap method and/or the target methods used
at any given call site.

**Specified by:** setTarget

in class

CallSite
**Parameters:** newTarget

- the new target
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the proposed new target is null
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the proposed new target
has a method type that differs from the previous target
**See Also:** getTarget()

- syncAll

```java
public static void syncAll​(
MutableCallSite
[] sites)
```

Performs a synchronization operation on each call site in the given array,
forcing all other threads to throw away any cached values previously
loaded from the target of any of the call sites.

This operation does not reverse any calls that have already started
on an old target value.
(Java supports

forward time travel

only.)

The overall effect is to force all future readers of each call site's target
to accept the most recently stored value.
("Most recently" is reckoned relative to the

syncAll

itself.)
Conversely, the

syncAll

call may block until all readers have
(somehow) decached all previous versions of each call site's target.

To avoid race conditions, calls to

setTarget

and

syncAll

should generally be performed under some sort of mutual exclusion.
Note that reader threads may observe an updated target as early
as the

setTarget

call that install the value
(and before the

syncAll

that confirms the value).
On the other hand, reader threads may observe previous versions of
the target until the

syncAll

call returns
(and after the

setTarget

that attempts to convey the updated version).

This operation is likely to be expensive and should be used sparingly.
If possible, it should be buffered for batch processing on sets of call sites.

If

sites

contains a null element,
a

NullPointerException

will be raised.
In this case, some non-null elements in the array may be
processed before the method returns abnormally.
Which elements these are (if any) is implementation-dependent.

Java Memory Model details

In terms of the Java Memory Model, this operation performs a synchronization
action which is comparable in effect to the writing of a volatile variable
by the current thread, and an eventual volatile read by every other thread
that may access one of the affected call sites.

The following effects are apparent, for each individual call site

S

:

- A new volatile variable

V

is created, and written by the current thread.
As defined by the JMM, this write is a global synchronization event.

As is normal with thread-local ordering of write events,
every action already performed by the current thread is
taken to happen before the volatile write to

V

.
(In some implementations, this means that the current thread
performs a global release operation.)

Specifically, the write to the current target of

S

is
taken to happen before the volatile write to

V

.

The volatile write to

V

is placed
(in an implementation specific manner)
in the global synchronization order.

Consider an arbitrary thread

T

(other than the current thread).
If

T

executes a synchronization action

A

after the volatile write to

V

(in the global synchronization order),
it is therefore required to see either the current target
of

S

, or a later write to that target,
if it executes a read on the target of

a volatile variable for the target of a mutable call site.
In such an implementation, the

syncAll

method can be a no-op,
and yet it will conform to the JMM behavior documented above.

The overall effect is to force all future readers of each call site's target
to accept the most recently stored value.
("Most recently" is reckoned relative to the

syncAll

itself.)
Conversely, the

syncAll

call may block until all readers have
(somehow) decached all previous versions of each call site's target.

To avoid race conditions, calls to

setTarget

and

syncAll

should generally be performed under some sort of mutual exclusion.
Note that reader threads may observe an updated target as early
as the

setTarget

call that install the value
(and before the

syncAll

that confirms the value).
On the other hand, reader threads may observe previous versions of
the target until the

syncAll

call returns
(and after the

setTarget

that attempts to convey the updated version).

This operation is likely to be expensive and should be used sparingly.
If possible, it should be buffered for batch processing on sets of call sites.

If

sites

contains a null element,
a

NullPointerException

will be raised.
In this case, some non-null elements in the array may be
processed before the method returns abnormally.
Which elements these are (if any) is implementation-dependent.

Java Memory Model details

In terms of the Java Memory Model, this operation performs a synchronization
action which is comparable in effect to the writing of a volatile variable
by the current thread, and an eventual volatile read by every other thread
that may access one of the affected call sites.

The following effects are apparent, for each individual call site

S

:

- A new volatile variable

V

is created, and written by the current thread.
As defined by the JMM, this write is a global synchronization event.

As is normal with thread-local ordering of write events,
every action already performed by the current thread is
taken to happen before the volatile write to

V

.
(In some implementations, this means that the current thread
performs a global release operation.)

Specifically, the write to the current target of

S

is
taken to happen before the volatile write to

V

.

The volatile write to

V

is placed
(in an implementation specific manner)
in the global synchronization order.

Consider an arbitrary thread

T

(other than the current thread).
If

T

executes a synchronization action

A

after the volatile write to

V

(in the global synchronization order),
it is therefore required to see either the current target
of

S

, or a later write to that target,
if it executes a read on the target of

S

.
(This constraint is called "synchronization-order consistency".)

The JMM specifically allows optimizing compilers to elide
reads or writes of variables that are known to be useless.
Such elided reads and writes have no effect on the happens-before
relation. Regardless of this fact, the volatile

V

will not be elided, even though its written value is
indeterminate and its read value is not used.

Because of the last point, the implementation behaves as if a
volatile read of

V

were performed by

T

immediately after its action

A

. In the local ordering
of actions in

T

, this read happens before any future
read of the target of

S

. It is as if the
implementation arbitrarily picked a read of

S

's target
by

T

, and forced a read of

V

to precede it,
thereby ensuring communication of the new target value.

As long as the constraints of the Java Memory Model are obeyed,
implementations may delay the completion of a

syncAll

operation while other threads (

T

above) continue to
use previous values of

S

's target.
However, implementations are (as always) encouraged to avoid
livelock, and to eventually require all threads to take account
of the updated target.

Discussion:

For performance reasons,

syncAll

is not a virtual method
on a single call site, but rather applies to a set of call sites.
Some implementations may incur a large fixed overhead cost
for processing one or more synchronization operations,
but a small incremental cost for each additional call site.
In any case, this operation is likely to be costly, since
other threads may have to be somehow interrupted
in order to make them notice the updated target value.
However, it may be observed that a single call to synchronize
several sites has the same formal effect as many calls,
each on just one of the sites.

Implementation Note:

Simple implementations of

MutableCallSite

may use
a volatile variable for the target of a mutable call site.
