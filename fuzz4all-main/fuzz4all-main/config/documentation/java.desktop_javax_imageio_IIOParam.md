# Class IIOParam

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\imageio\IIOParam.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
IIOParam

extends
Object
```

A superclass of all classes describing how streams should be
decoded or encoded. This class contains all the variables and
methods that are shared by

ImageReadParam

and

ImageWriteParam

.

This class provides mechanisms to specify a source region and a
destination region. When reading, the source is the stream and
the in-memory image is the destination. When writing, these are
reversed. In the case of writing, destination regions may be used
only with a writer that supports pixel replacement.

Decimation subsampling may be specified for both readers
and writers, using a movable subsampling grid.

Subsets of the source and destination bands may be selected.

**Direct Known Subclasses:** ImageReadParam

,

ImageWriteParam

---

### Field Details

#### protected
Rectangle
sourceRegion

The source region, on

null

if none is set.

---

#### protected int sourceXSubsampling

The decimation subsampling to be applied in the horizontal
direction. By default, the value is

1

.
The value must not be negative or 0.

---

#### protected int sourceYSubsampling

The decimation subsampling to be applied in the vertical
direction. By default, the value is

1

.
The value must not be negative or 0.

---

#### protected int subsamplingXOffset

A horizontal offset to be applied to the subsampling grid before
subsampling. The first pixel to be used will be offset this
amount from the origin of the region, or of the image if no
region is specified.

---

#### protected int subsamplingYOffset

A vertical offset to be applied to the subsampling grid before
subsampling. The first pixel to be used will be offset this
amount from the origin of the region, or of the image if no
region is specified.

---

#### protected int[] sourceBands

An array of

int

s indicating which source bands
will be used, or

null

. If

null

, the
set of source bands to be used is as described in the comment
for the

setSourceBands

method. No value should
be allowed to be negative.

---

#### protected
ImageTypeSpecifier
destinationType

An

ImageTypeSpecifier

destination image when reading, or to set the output color type
when writing. If non has been set the value will be

null

. By default, the value is

null

.

---

#### protected
Point
destinationOffset

The offset in the destination where the upper-left decoded
pixel should be placed. By default, the value is (0, 0).

---

#### protected
IIOParamController
defaultController

The default

IIOParamController

that will be
used to provide settings for this

IIOParam

object when the

activateController

method
is called. This default should be set by subclasses
that choose to provide their own default controller,
usually a GUI, for setting parameters.

### Constructor Details

#### protected IIOParam()

Protected constructor may be called only by subclasses.

---

### Method Details

#### public void setSourceRegion​(
Rectangle
sourceRegion)

Sets the source region of interest. The region of interest is
described as a rectangle, with the upper-left corner of the
source image as pixel (0, 0) and increasing values down and to
the right. The actual number of pixels used will depend on
the subsampling factors set by

setSourceSubsampling

.
If subsampling has been set such that this number is zero,
an

IllegalStateException

will be thrown.

The source region of interest specified by this method will
be clipped as needed to fit within the source bounds, as well
as the destination offsets, width, and height at the time of
actual I/O.

A value of

null

for

sourceRegion

will remove any region specification, causing the entire image
to be used.

**Parameters:**
- sourceRegion

- a

Rectangle

specifying the
source region of interest, or

null

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

sourceRegion

is non-

null

and either

sourceRegion.x

or

sourceRegion.y

is
negative.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

sourceRegion

is non-

null

and either

sourceRegion.width

or

sourceRegion.height

is negative or 0.
- IllegalStateException

- if subsampling is such that
this region will have a subsampled width or height of zero.

- getSourceRegion()

,

setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

setDestinationOffset(java.awt.Point)

,

getDestinationOffset()

---

#### public
Rectangle
getSourceRegion()

Returns the source region to be used. The returned value is
that set by the most recent call to

setSourceRegion

, and will be

null

if
there is no region set.

**Returns:**
- the source region of interest as a

Rectangle

, or

null

.

**See Also:**
- setSourceRegion(java.awt.Rectangle)

---

#### public void setSourceSubsampling​(int sourceXSubsampling,
int sourceYSubsampling,
int subsamplingXOffset,
int subsamplingYOffset)

Specifies a decimation subsampling to apply on I/O. The

sourceXSubsampling

and

sourceYSubsampling

parameters specify the
subsampling period (

i.e.

, the number of rows and columns
to advance after every source pixel). Specifically, a period of
1 will use every row or column; a period of 2 will use every
other row or column. The

subsamplingXOffset

and

subsamplingYOffset

parameters specify an offset
from the region (or image) origin for the first subsampled pixel.
Adjusting the origin of the subsample grid is useful for avoiding
seams when subsampling a very large source image into destination
regions that will be assembled into a complete subsampled image.
Most users will want to simply leave these parameters at 0.

The number of pixels and scanlines to be used are calculated
as follows.

The number of subsampled pixels in a scanline is given by

truncate[(width - subsamplingXOffset + sourceXSubsampling - 1)
/ sourceXSubsampling]

.

If the region is such that this width is zero, an

IllegalStateException

is thrown.

The number of scanlines to be used can be computed similarly.

The ability to set the subsampling grid to start somewhere
other than the source region origin is useful if the
region is being used to create subsampled tiles of a large image,
where the tile width and height are not multiples of the
subsampling periods. If the subsampling grid does not remain
consistent from tile to tile, there will be artifacts at the tile
boundaries. By adjusting the subsampling grid offset for each
tile to compensate, these artifacts can be avoided. The tradeoff
is that in order to avoid these artifacts, the tiles are not all
the same size. The grid offset to use in this case is given by:

grid offset = [period - (region offset modulo period)] modulo period)

If either

sourceXSubsampling

or

sourceYSubsampling

is 0 or negative, an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

If either

subsamplingXOffset

or

subsamplingYOffset

is negative or greater than or
equal to the corresponding period, an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

There is no

unsetSourceSubsampling

method;
simply call

setSourceSubsampling(1, 1, 0, 0)

to
restore default values.

**Parameters:**
- sourceXSubsampling

- the number of columns to advance
between pixels.
- sourceYSubsampling

- the number of rows to advance between
pixels.
- subsamplingXOffset

- the horizontal offset of the first subsample
within the region, or within the image if no region is set.
- subsamplingYOffset

- the horizontal offset of the first subsample
within the region, or within the image if no region is set.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if either period is
negative or 0, or if either grid offset is negative or greater than
the corresponding period.
- IllegalStateException

- if the source region is such that
the subsampled output would contain no pixels.

---

#### public int getSourceXSubsampling()

Returns the number of source columns to advance for each pixel.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 1
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:**
- the source subsampling X period.

**See Also:**
- setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSourceYSubsampling()

---

#### public int getSourceYSubsampling()

Returns the number of rows to advance for each pixel.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 1
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:**
- the source subsampling Y period.

**See Also:**
- setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSourceXSubsampling()

---

#### public int getSubsamplingXOffset()

Returns the horizontal offset of the subsampling grid.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 0
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:**
- the source subsampling grid X offset.

**See Also:**
- setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSubsamplingYOffset()

---

#### public int getSubsamplingYOffset()

Returns the vertical offset of the subsampling grid.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 0
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:**
- the source subsampling grid Y offset.

**See Also:**
- setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSubsamplingXOffset()

---

#### public void setSourceBands​(int[] sourceBands)

Sets the indices of the source bands to be used. Duplicate
indices are not allowed.

A

null

value indicates that all source bands
will be used.

At the time of reading, an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown by the
reader or writer if a value larger than the largest available
source band index has been specified or if the number of source
bands and destination bands to be used differ. The

ImageReader.checkReadParamBandSettings

method may
be used to automate this test.

Semantically, a copy is made of the array; changes to the
array contents subsequent to this call have no effect on
this

IIOParam

.

**Parameters:**
- sourceBands

- an array of integer band indices to be
used.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

sourceBands

contains a negative or duplicate value.

**See Also:**
- getSourceBands()

,

ImageReadParam.setDestinationBands(int[])

,

ImageReader.checkReadParamBandSettings(javax.imageio.ImageReadParam, int, int)

---

#### public int[] getSourceBands()

Returns the set of source bands to be used. The returned
value is that set by the most recent call to

setSourceBands

, or

null

if there have
been no calls to

setSourceBands

.

Semantically, the array returned is a copy; changes to
array contents subsequent to this call have no effect on this

IIOParam

.

**Returns:**
- the set of source bands to be used, or

null

.

**See Also:**
- setSourceBands(int[])

---

#### public void setDestinationType​(
ImageTypeSpecifier
destinationType)

Sets the desired image type for the destination image, using an

ImageTypeSpecifier

.

When reading, if the layout of the destination has been set
using this method, each call to an

ImageReader

read

method will return a new

BufferedImage

using the format specified by the
supplied type specifier. As a side effect, any destination

BufferedImage

set by

ImageReadParam.setDestination(BufferedImage)

will
no longer be set as the destination. In other words, this
method may be thought of as calling

setDestination((BufferedImage)null)

.

When writing, the destination type maybe used to determine
the color type of the image. The

SampleModel

information will be ignored, and may be

null

. For
example, a 4-banded image could represent either CMYK or RGBA
data. If a destination type is set, its

ColorModel

will override any

ColorModel

on the image itself. This is crucial
when

setSourceBands

is used since the image's

ColorModel

will refer to the entire image rather
than to the subset of bands being written.

**Parameters:**
- destinationType

- the

ImageTypeSpecifier

to
be used to determine the destination layout and color type.

**See Also:**
- getDestinationType()

---

#### public
ImageTypeSpecifier
getDestinationType()

Returns the type of image to be returned by the read, if one
was set by a call to

setDestination(ImageTypeSpecifier)

, as an

ImageTypeSpecifier

. If none was set,

null

is returned.

**Returns:**
- an

ImageTypeSpecifier

describing the
destination type, or

null

.

**See Also:**
- setDestinationType(javax.imageio.ImageTypeSpecifier)

---

#### public void setDestinationOffset​(
Point
destinationOffset)

Specifies the offset in the destination image at which future
decoded pixels are to be placed, when reading, or where a
region will be written, when writing.

When reading, the region to be written within the
destination

BufferedImage

will start at this
offset and have a width and height determined by the source
region of interest, the subsampling parameters, and the
destination bounds.

Normal writes are not affected by this method, only writes
performed using

ImageWriter.replacePixels

. For
such writes, the offset specified is within the output stream
image whose pixels are being modified.

There is no

unsetDestinationOffset

method;
simply call

setDestinationOffset(new Point(0, 0))

to
restore default values.

**Parameters:**
- destinationOffset

- the offset in the destination, as a

Point

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

destinationOffset

is

null

.

**See Also:**
- getDestinationOffset()

,

ImageWriter.replacePixels(java.awt.image.RenderedImage, javax.imageio.ImageWriteParam)

---

#### public
Point
getDestinationOffset()

Returns the offset in the destination image at which pixels are
to be placed.

If

setDestinationOffsets

has not been called,
a

Point

with zero X and Y values is returned
(which is the correct value).

**Returns:**
- the destination offset as a

Point

.

**See Also:**
- setDestinationOffset(java.awt.Point)

---

#### public void setController​(
IIOParamController
controller)

Sets the

IIOParamController

to be used
to provide settings for this

IIOParam

object when the

activateController

method
is called, overriding any default controller. If the
argument is

null

, no controller will be
used, including any default. To restore the default, use

setController(getDefaultController())

.

**Parameters:**
- controller

- An appropriate

IIOParamController

, or

null

.

**See Also:**
- IIOParamController

,

getController()

,

getDefaultController()

,

hasController()

,

activateController()

---

#### public
IIOParamController
getController()

Returns whatever

IIOParamController

is currently
installed. This could be the default if there is one,

null

, or the argument of the most recent call
to

setController

.

**Returns:**
- the currently installed

IIOParamController

, or

null

.

**See Also:**
- IIOParamController

,

setController(javax.imageio.IIOParamController)

,

getDefaultController()

,

hasController()

,

activateController()

---

#### public
IIOParamController
getDefaultController()

Returns the default

IIOParamController

, if there
is one, regardless of the currently installed controller. If
there is no default controller, returns

null

.

**Returns:**
- the default

IIOParamController

, or

null

.

**See Also:**
- IIOParamController

,

setController(IIOParamController)

,

getController()

,

hasController()

,

activateController()

---

#### public boolean hasController()

Returns

true

if there is a controller installed
for this

IIOParam

object. This will return

true

if

getController

would not
return

null

.

**Returns:**
- true

if a controller is installed.

**See Also:**
- IIOParamController

,

setController(IIOParamController)

,

getController()

,

getDefaultController()

,

activateController()

---

#### public boolean activateController()

Activates the installed

IIOParamController

for
this

IIOParam

object and returns the resulting
value. When this method returns

true

, all values
for this

IIOParam

object will be ready for the
next read or write operation. If

false

is
returned, no settings in this object will have been disturbed
(

i.e.

, the user canceled the operation).

Ordinarily, the controller will be a GUI providing a user
interface for a subclass of

IIOParam

for a
particular plug-in. Controllers need not be GUIs, however.

**Returns:**
- true

if the controller completed normally.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if there is no controller
currently installed.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- setSourceRegion

```java
public void setSourceRegion​(
Rectangle
sourceRegion)
```

Sets the source region of interest. The region of interest is
described as a rectangle, with the upper-left corner of the
source image as pixel (0, 0) and increasing values down and to
the right. The actual number of pixels used will depend on
the subsampling factors set by

setSourceSubsampling

.
If subsampling has been set such that this number is zero,
an

IllegalStateException

will be thrown.

The source region of interest specified by this method will
be clipped as needed to fit within the source bounds, as well
as the destination offsets, width, and height at the time of
actual I/O.

A value of

null

for

sourceRegion

will remove any region specification, causing the entire image
to be used.

**Parameters:** sourceRegion

- a

Rectangle

specifying the
source region of interest, or

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

sourceRegion

is non-

null

and either

sourceRegion.x

or

sourceRegion.y

is
negative.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

sourceRegion

is non-

null

and either

sourceRegion.width

or

sourceRegion.height

is negative or 0.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if subsampling is such that
this region will have a subsampled width or height of zero.
**See Also:** getSourceRegion()

,

setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

setDestinationOffset(java.awt.Point)

,

getDestinationOffset()

- getSourceRegion

```java
public
Rectangle
getSourceRegion()
```

Returns the source region to be used. The returned value is
that set by the most recent call to

setSourceRegion

, and will be

null

if
there is no region set.

**Returns:** the source region of interest as a

Rectangle

, or

null

.
**See Also:** setSourceRegion(java.awt.Rectangle)

- setSourceSubsampling

```java
public void setSourceSubsampling​(int sourceXSubsampling,
int sourceYSubsampling,
int subsamplingXOffset,
int subsamplingYOffset)
```

Specifies a decimation subsampling to apply on I/O. The

sourceXSubsampling

and

sourceYSubsampling

parameters specify the
subsampling period (

i.e.

, the number of rows and columns
to advance after every source pixel). Specifically, a period of
1 will use every row or column; a period of 2 will use every
other row or column. The

subsamplingXOffset

and

subsamplingYOffset

parameters specify an offset
from the region (or image) origin for the first subsampled pixel.
Adjusting the origin of the subsample grid is useful for avoiding
seams when subsampling a very large source image into destination
regions that will be assembled into a complete subsampled image.
Most users will want to simply leave these parameters at 0.

The number of pixels and scanlines to be used are calculated
as follows.

The number of subsampled pixels in a scanline is given by

truncate[(width - subsamplingXOffset + sourceXSubsampling - 1)
/ sourceXSubsampling]

.

If the region is such that this width is zero, an

IllegalStateException

is thrown.

The number of scanlines to be used can be computed similarly.

The ability to set the subsampling grid to start somewhere
other than the source region origin is useful if the
region is being used to create subsampled tiles of a large image,
where the tile width and height are not multiples of the
subsampling periods. If the subsampling grid does not remain
consistent from tile to tile, there will be artifacts at the tile
boundaries. By adjusting the subsampling grid offset for each
tile to compensate, these artifacts can be avoided. The tradeoff
is that in order to avoid these artifacts, the tiles are not all
the same size. The grid offset to use in this case is given by:

grid offset = [period - (region offset modulo period)] modulo period)

If either

sourceXSubsampling

or

sourceYSubsampling

is 0 or negative, an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

If either

subsamplingXOffset

or

subsamplingYOffset

is negative or greater than or
equal to the corresponding period, an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

There is no

unsetSourceSubsampling

method;
simply call

setSourceSubsampling(1, 1, 0, 0)

to
restore default values.

**Parameters:** sourceXSubsampling

- the number of columns to advance
between pixels.
**Parameters:** sourceYSubsampling

- the number of rows to advance between
pixels.
**Parameters:** subsamplingXOffset

- the horizontal offset of the first subsample
within the region, or within the image if no region is set.
**Parameters:** subsamplingYOffset

- the horizontal offset of the first subsample
within the region, or within the image if no region is set.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if either period is
negative or 0, or if either grid offset is negative or greater than
the corresponding period.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the source region is such that
the subsampled output would contain no pixels.

- getSourceXSubsampling

```java
public int getSourceXSubsampling()
```

Returns the number of source columns to advance for each pixel.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 1
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:** the source subsampling X period.
**See Also:** setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSourceYSubsampling()

- getSourceYSubsampling

```java
public int getSourceYSubsampling()
```

Returns the number of rows to advance for each pixel.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 1
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:** the source subsampling Y period.
**See Also:** setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSourceXSubsampling()

- getSubsamplingXOffset

```java
public int getSubsamplingXOffset()
```

Returns the horizontal offset of the subsampling grid.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 0
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:** the source subsampling grid X offset.
**See Also:** setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSubsamplingYOffset()

- getSubsamplingYOffset

```java
public int getSubsamplingYOffset()
```

Returns the vertical offset of the subsampling grid.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 0
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:** the source subsampling grid Y offset.
**See Also:** setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSubsamplingXOffset()

- setSourceBands

```java
public void setSourceBands​(int[] sourceBands)
```

Sets the indices of the source bands to be used. Duplicate
indices are not allowed.

A

null

value indicates that all source bands
will be used.

At the time of reading, an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown by the
reader or writer if a value larger than the largest available
source band index has been specified or if the number of source
bands and destination bands to be used differ. The

ImageReader.checkReadParamBandSettings

method may
be used to automate this test.

Semantically, a copy is made of the array; changes to the
array contents subsequent to this call have no effect on
this

IIOParam

.

**Parameters:** sourceBands

- an array of integer band indices to be
used.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

sourceBands

contains a negative or duplicate value.
**See Also:** getSourceBands()

,

ImageReadParam.setDestinationBands(int[])

,

ImageReader.checkReadParamBandSettings(javax.imageio.ImageReadParam, int, int)

- getSourceBands

```java
public int[] getSourceBands()
```

Returns the set of source bands to be used. The returned
value is that set by the most recent call to

setSourceBands

, or

null

if there have
been no calls to

setSourceBands

.

Semantically, the array returned is a copy; changes to
array contents subsequent to this call have no effect on this

IIOParam

.

**Returns:** the set of source bands to be used, or

null

.
**See Also:** setSourceBands(int[])

- setDestinationType

```java
public void setDestinationType​(
ImageTypeSpecifier
destinationType)
```

Sets the desired image type for the destination image, using an

ImageTypeSpecifier

.

When reading, if the layout of the destination has been set
using this method, each call to an

ImageReader

read

method will return a new

BufferedImage

using the format specified by the
supplied type specifier. As a side effect, any destination

BufferedImage

set by

ImageReadParam.setDestination(BufferedImage)

will
no longer be set as the destination. In other words, this
method may be thought of as calling

setDestination((BufferedImage)null)

.

When writing, the destination type maybe used to determine
the color type of the image. The

SampleModel

information will be ignored, and may be

null

. For
example, a 4-banded image could represent either CMYK or RGBA
data. If a destination type is set, its

ColorModel

will override any

ColorModel

on the image itself. This is crucial
when

setSourceBands

is used since the image's

ColorModel

will refer to the entire image rather
than to the subset of bands being written.

**Parameters:** destinationType

- the

ImageTypeSpecifier

to
be used to determine the destination layout and color type.
**See Also:** getDestinationType()

- getDestinationType

```java
public
ImageTypeSpecifier
getDestinationType()
```

Returns the type of image to be returned by the read, if one
was set by a call to

setDestination(ImageTypeSpecifier)

, as an

ImageTypeSpecifier

. If none was set,

null

is returned.

**Returns:** an

ImageTypeSpecifier

describing the
destination type, or

null

.
**See Also:** setDestinationType(javax.imageio.ImageTypeSpecifier)

- setDestinationOffset

```java
public void setDestinationOffset​(
Point
destinationOffset)
```

Specifies the offset in the destination image at which future
decoded pixels are to be placed, when reading, or where a
region will be written, when writing.

When reading, the region to be written within the
destination

BufferedImage

will start at this
offset and have a width and height determined by the source
region of interest, the subsampling parameters, and the
destination bounds.

Normal writes are not affected by this method, only writes
performed using

ImageWriter.replacePixels

. For
such writes, the offset specified is within the output stream
image whose pixels are being modified.

There is no

unsetDestinationOffset

method;
simply call

setDestinationOffset(new Point(0, 0))

to
restore default values.

**Parameters:** destinationOffset

- the offset in the destination, as a

Point

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

destinationOffset

is

null

.
**See Also:** getDestinationOffset()

,

ImageWriter.replacePixels(java.awt.image.RenderedImage, javax.imageio.ImageWriteParam)

- getDestinationOffset

```java
public
Point
getDestinationOffset()
```

Returns the offset in the destination image at which pixels are
to be placed.

If

setDestinationOffsets

has not been called,
a

Point

with zero X and Y values is returned
(which is the correct value).

**Returns:** the destination offset as a

Point

.
**See Also:** setDestinationOffset(java.awt.Point)

- setController

```java
public void setController​(
IIOParamController
controller)
```

Sets the

IIOParamController

to be used
to provide settings for this

IIOParam

object when the

activateController

method
is called, overriding any default controller. If the
argument is

null

, no controller will be
used, including any default. To restore the default, use

setController(getDefaultController())

.

**Parameters:** controller

- An appropriate

IIOParamController

, or

null

.

IIOParamController

is currently
installed. This could be the default if there is one,

null

, or the argument of the most recent call
to

setController

.

**Returns:** the currently installed

IIOParamController

, or

null

.
**See Also:** IIOParamController

,

setController(javax.imageio.IIOParamController)

,

is one, regardless of the currently installed controller. If
there is no default controller, returns

null

.

,

setController(IIOParamController)

,

getController()

,

hasController()

,

activateController()

- hasController

```java
public boolean hasController()
```

Returns

true

if there is a controller installed
for this

IIOParam

object. This will return

true

if

getController

would not
return

null

.

**Returns:** true

if a controller is installed.
**See Also:** IIOParamController

,

setController(IIOParamController)

,

getController()

,

getDefaultController()

,

activateController()

- activateController

```java
public boolean activateController()
```

Activates the installed

IIOParamController

for
this

IIOParam

object and returns the resulting
value. When this method returns

true

, all values
for this

IIOParam

object will be ready for the
next read or write operation. If

false

is
returned, no settings in this object will have been disturbed
(

i.e.

, the user canceled the operation).

Ordinarily, the controller will be a GUI providing a user
interface for a subclass of

IIOParam

for a
particular plug-in. Controllers need not be GUIs, however.

**Returns:** true

if the controller completed normally.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if there is no controller
currently installed.

Returns the source region to be used. The returned value is
that set by the most recent call to

setSourceRegion

, and will be

null

if
there is no region set.

**Returns:** the source region of interest as a

Rectangle

, or

null

.

- setSourceSubsampling

```java
public void setSourceSubsampling​(int sourceXSubsampling,
int sourceYSubsampling,
int subsamplingXOffset,
int subsamplingYOffset)
```

Specifies a decimation subsampling to apply on I/O. The

sourceXSubsampling

and

sourceYSubsampling

parameters specify the
subsampling period (

i.e.

, the number of rows and columns
to advance after every source pixel). Specifically, a period of
1 will use every row or column; a period of 2 will use every
other row or column. The

subsamplingXOffset

and

subsamplingYOffset

parameters specify an offset
from the region (or image) origin for the first subsampled pixel.
Adjusting the origin of the subsample grid is useful for avoiding
seams when subsampling a very large source image into destination
regions that will be assembled into a complete subsampled image.
Most users will want to simply leave these parameters at 0.

The number of pixels and scanlines to be used are calculated
as follows.

The number of subsampled pixels in a scanline is given by

truncate[(width - subsamplingXOffset + sourceXSubsampling - 1)
/ sourceXSubsampling]

.

If the region is such that this width is zero, an

IllegalStateException

is thrown.

The number of scanlines to be used can be computed similarly.

The ability to set the subsampling grid to start somewhere
other than the source region origin is useful if the
region is being used to create subsampled tiles of a large image,
where the tile width and height are not multiples of the
subsampling periods. If the subsampling grid does not remain
consistent from tile to tile, there will be artifacts at the tile
boundaries. By adjusting the subsampling grid offset for each
tile to compensate, these artifacts can be avoided. The tradeoff
is that in order to avoid these artifacts, the tiles are not all
the same size. The grid offset to use in this case is given by:

grid offset = [period - (region offset modulo period)] modulo period)

If either

sourceXSubsampling

or

sourceYSubsampling

is 0 or negative, an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

If either

subsamplingXOffset

or

subsamplingYOffset

is negative or greater than or
equal to the corresponding period, an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

There is no

unsetSourceSubsampling

method;
simply call

setSourceSubsampling(1, 1, 0, 0)

to
restore default values.

**Parameters:** sourceXSubsampling

- the number of columns to advance
between pixels.
**Parameters:** sourceYSubsampling

- the number of rows to advance between
pixels.
**Parameters:** subsamplingXOffset

- the horizontal offset of the first subsample
within the region, or within the image if no region is set.
**Parameters:** subsamplingYOffset

- the horizontal offset of the first subsample
within the region, or within the image if no region is set.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if either period is
negative or 0, or if either grid offset is negative or greater than
the corresponding period.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the source region is such that
the subsampled output would contain no pixels.

- getSourceXSubsampling

```java
public int getSourceXSubsampling()
```

Returns the number of source columns to advance for each pixel.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 1
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:** the source subsampling X period.
**See Also:** setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSourceYSubsampling()

- getSourceYSubsampling

```java
public int getSourceYSubsampling()
```

Returns the number of rows to advance for each pixel.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 1
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:** the source subsampling Y period.
**See Also:** setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSourceXSubsampling()

- getSubsamplingXOffset

```java
public int getSubsamplingXOffset()
```

Returns the horizontal offset of the subsampling grid.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 0
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:** the source subsampling grid X offset.
**See Also:** setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSubsamplingYOffset()

- getSubsamplingYOffset

```java
public int getSubsamplingYOffset()
```

Returns the vertical offset of the subsampling grid.

If

setSourceSubsampling

has not been called, 0
is returned (which is the correct value).

**Returns:** the source subsampling grid Y offset.
**See Also:** setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)

,

getSubsamplingXOffset()

- setSourceBands

```java
public void setSourceBands​(int[] sourceBands)
```

Sets the indices of the source bands to be used. Duplicate
indices are not allowed.

A

null

value indicates that all source bands
will be used.

At the time of reading, an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown by the
reader or writer if a value larger than the largest available
source band index has been specified or if the number of source
bands and destination bands to be used differ. The

ImageReader.checkReadParamBandSettings

method may
be used to automate this test.

Semantically, a copy is made of the array; changes to the
array contents subsequent to this call have no effect on
this

IIOParam

.

**Parameters:** sourceBands

- an array of integer band indices to be
used.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

sourceBands

contains a negative or duplicate value.
**See Also:** getSourceBands()

,

ImageReadParam.setDestinationBands(int[])

,

ImageReader.checkReadParamBandSettings(javax.imageio.ImageReadParam, int, int)

- getSourceBands

```java
public int[] getSourceBands()
```

Returns the set of source bands to be used. The returned
value is that set by the most recent call to

setSourceBands

, or

null

if there have
been no calls to

setSourceBands

.

Semantically, the array returned is a copy; changes to
array contents subsequent to this call have no effect on this

IIOParam

.

**Returns:** the set of source bands to be used, or

null

.
**See Also:** setSourceBands(int[])

- setDestinationType

```java
public void setDestinationType​(
ImageTypeSpecifier
destinationType)
```

Sets the desired image type for the destination image, using an

ImageTypeSpecifier

.

When reading, if the layout of the destination has been set
using this method, each call to an

ImageReader

read

method will return a new

BufferedImage

using the format specified by the
supplied type specifier. As a side effect, any destination

BufferedImage

set by

ImageReadParam.setDestination(BufferedImage)

will
no longer be set as the destination. In other words, this
method may be thought of as calling

setDestination((BufferedImage)null)

.

When writing, the destination type maybe used to determine
the color type of the image. The

SampleModel

information will be ignored, and may be

null

. For
example, a 4-banded image could represent either CMYK or RGBA
data. If a destination type is set, its

ColorModel

will override any

ColorModel

on the image itself. This is crucial
when

setSourceBands

is used since the image's

ColorModel

will refer to the entire image rather
than to the subset of bands being written.

**Parameters:** destinationType

- the

ImageTypeSpecifier

to
be used to determine the destination layout and color type.
**See Also:** getDestinationType()

- getDestinationType

```java
public
ImageTypeSpecifier
getDestinationType()
```

Returns the type of image to be returned by the read, if one
was set by a call to

setDestination(ImageTypeSpecifier)

, as an

ImageTypeSpecifier

. If none was set,

null

is returned.

**Returns:** an

ImageTypeSpecifier

describing the
destination type, or

null

.
**See Also:** setDestinationType(javax.imageio.ImageTypeSpecifier)

- setDestinationOffset

```java
public void setDestinationOffset​(
Point
destinationOffset)
```

Specifies the offset in the destination image at which future
decoded pixels are to be placed, when reading, or where a
region will be written, when writing.

When reading, the region to be written within the
destination

BufferedImage

will start at this
offset and have a width and height determined by the source
region of interest, the subsampling parameters, and the
destination bounds.

Normal writes are not affected by this method, only writes
performed using

ImageWriter.replacePixels

. For
such writes, the offset specified is within the output stream
image whose pixels are being modified.

There is no

unsetDestinationOffset

method;
simply call

setDestinationOffset(new Point(0, 0))

to
restore default values.

**Parameters:** destinationOffset

- the offset in the destination, as a

Point

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

destinationOffset

is

null

.
**See Also:** getDestinationOffset()

,

ImageWriter.replacePixels(java.awt.image.RenderedImage, javax.imageio.ImageWriteParam)

- getDestinationOffset

```java
public
Point
getDestinationOffset()
```

Returns the offset in the destination image at which pixels are
to be placed.

If

setDestinationOffsets

has not been called,
a

Point

with zero X and Y values is returned
(which is the correct value).

**Returns:** the destination offset as a

Point

.
**See Also:** setDestinationOffset(java.awt.Point)

- setController

```java
public void setController​(
IIOParamController
controller)
```

Sets the

IIOParamController

to be used
to provide settings for this

IIOParam

object when the

activateController

method
is called, overriding any default controller. If the
argument is

null

, no controller will be
used, including any default. To restore the default, use

setController(getDefaultController())

.

**Parameters:** controller

- An appropriate

IIOParamController

, or

null

.

,

getController()

,

getDefaultController()

,

hasController()

,

activateController()

- getController

```java
public
IIOParamController
getController()
```

Returns whatever

IIOParamController

is currently
installed. This could be the default if there is one,

null

, or the argument of the most recent call
to

setController

.

**Returns:** the currently installed

IIOParamController

, or

null

.
**See Also:** IIOParamController

,

setController(javax.imageio.IIOParamController)

,

getDefaultController()

,

hasController()

,

activateController()

- getDefaultController

getDefaultController()
```

Returns the default

IIOParamController

, if there
is one, regardless of the currently installed controller. If
there is no default controller, returns

null

.

IIOParamController

, or

null

.

,

setController(IIOParamController)

,

getController()

,

hasController()

,

activateController()

- hasController

```java
public boolean hasController()
```

Returns

true

if there is a controller installed
for this

IIOParam

object. This will return

true

if

getController

would not
return

null

.

**Returns:** true

if a controller is installed.
**See Also:** IIOParamController

,

setController(IIOParamController)

,

getController()

,

getDefaultController()

,

activateController()

- activateController

```java
public boolean activateController()
```

Activates the installed

IIOParamController

for
this

IIOParam

object and returns the resulting
value. When this method returns

true

, all values
for this

IIOParam

object will be ready for the
next read or write operation. If

false

is
returned, no settings in this object will have been disturbed
(

i.e.

, the user canceled the operation).

Ordinarily, the controller will be a GUI providing a user
interface for a subclass of

IIOParam

for a
particular plug-in. Controllers need not be GUIs, however.

**Returns:** true

if the controller completed normally.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if there is no controller
currently installed.

#### Method Detail

setSourceRegion

```java
public void setSourceRegion​(
Rectangle
sourceRegion)
```

Sets the source region of interest. The region of interest is
described as a rectangle, with the upper-left corner of the
source image as pixel (0, 0) and increasing values down and to
the right. The actual number of pixels used will depend on
the subsampling factors set by

setSourceSubsampling

.
If subsampling has been set such that this number is zero,
an

IllegalStateException

will be thrown.

The source region of interest specified by this method will
be clipped as needed to fit within the source bounds, as well
as the destination offsets, width, and height at the time of
actual I/O.

A value of

null

for

sourceRegion

will remove any region specification, causing the entire image
to be used.

**Parameters:** sourceRegion

- a

Rectangle

specifying the
source region of interest, or

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

sourceRegion

is non-

null

and either

sourceRegion.x

or

sourceRegion.y

is
negative.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

sourceRegion

is non-

null

and either

sourceRegion.width

or

sourceRegion.height

is negative or 0.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if subsampling is such that
this region will have a subsampled width or height of zero.

setDestinationType

```java
public void setDestinationType​(
ImageTypeSpecifier
destinationType)
```

Sets the desired image type for the destination image, using an

ImageTypeSpecifier

.

When reading, if the layout of the destination has been set
using this method, each call to an

ImageReader

read

method will return a new

BufferedImage

using the format specified by the
supplied type specifier. As a side effect, any destination

BufferedImage

set by

ImageReadParam.setDestination(BufferedImage)

will
no longer be set as the destination. In other words, this
method may be thought of as calling

setDestination((BufferedImage)null)

.

When writing, the destination type maybe used to determine
the color type of the image. The

SampleModel

information will be ignored, and may be

null

. For
example, a 4-banded image could represent either CMYK or RGBA
data. If a destination type is set, its

ColorModel

will override any

ColorModel

on the image itself. This is crucial
when

setSourceBands

is used since the image's

ColorModel

will refer to the entire image rather
than to the subset of bands being written.

**Parameters:** destinationType

- the

ImageTypeSpecifier

to
be used to determine the destination layout and color type.

setDestinationOffset

```java
public void setDestinationOffset​(
Point
destinationOffset)
```

Specifies the offset in the destination image at which future
decoded pixels are to be placed, when reading, or where a
region will be written, when writing.

When reading, the region to be written within the
destination

BufferedImage

will start at this
offset and have a width and height determined by the source
region of interest, the subsampling parameters, and the
destination bounds.

Normal writes are not affected by this method, only writes
performed using

ImageWriter.replacePixels

. For
such writes, the offset specified is within the output stream
image whose pixels are being modified.

There is no

unsetDestinationOffset

method;
simply call

setDestinationOffset(new Point(0, 0))

to
restore default values.

**Parameters:** destinationOffset

- the offset in the destination, as a

Point

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if
