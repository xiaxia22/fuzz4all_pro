# Class AsynchronousSocketChannel

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\channels\AsynchronousSocketChannel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
AsynchronousSocketChannel

extends
Object

implements
AsynchronousByteChannel
,
NetworkChannel
```

An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.

Asynchronous socket channels are created in one of two ways. A newly-created

AsynchronousSocketChannel

is created by invoking one of the

open

methods defined by this class. A newly-created channel is open but
not yet connected. A connected

AsynchronousSocketChannel

is created
when a connection is made to the socket of an

AsynchronousServerSocketChannel

.
It is not possible to create an asynchronous socket channel for an arbitrary,
pre-existing

socket

.

A newly-created channel is connected by invoking its

connect

method; once connected, a channel remains connected until it is closed. Whether
or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by invoking its

getRemoteAddress

method. An attempt to invoke an I/O
operation upon an unconnected channel will cause a

NotYetConnectedException

to be thrown.

Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one read operation
and one write operation can be outstanding at any time.
If a thread initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
completed then a

ReadPendingException

will be thrown. Similarly, an
attempt to initiate a write operation before a previous write has completed
will throw a

WritePendingException

.

Socket options are configured using the

setOption

method. Asynchronous socket channels support the following options:

Socket options

Option Name

Description

SO_SNDBUF

The size of the socket send buffer

SO_RCVBUF

The size of the socket receive buffer

SO_KEEPALIVE

Keep connection alive

SO_REUSEADDR

Re-use address

TCP_NODELAY

Disable the Nagle algorithm

Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.

Timeouts

The

read

and

write

methods defined by this class allow a timeout to be specified when initiating
a read or write operation. If the timeout elapses before an operation completes
then the operation completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. A timeout may leave the channel, or the
underlying connection, in an inconsistent state. Where the implementation
cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read from the channel then it puts
the channel into an implementation specific

error state

. A subsequent
attempt to initiate a

read

operation causes an unspecified runtime
exception to be thrown. Similarly if a

write

operation times out and
the implementation cannot guarantee bytes have not been written to the
channel then further attempts to

write

to the channel cause an
unspecified runtime exception to be thrown. When a timeout elapses then the
state of the

ByteBuffer

, or the sequence of buffers, for the I/O
operation is not defined. Buffers should be discarded or at least care must
be taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while the channel remains
open. All methods that accept timeout parameters treat values less than or
equal to zero to mean that the I/O operation does not timeout.

AsynchronousSocketChannel
shutdownInput()
throws
IOException

Shutdown the connection for reading without closing the channel.

Once shutdown for reading then further reads on the channel will
return

-1

, the end-of-stream indication. If the input side of the
connection is already shutdown then invoking this method has no effect.
The effect on an outstanding read operation is system dependent and
therefore not specified. The effect, if any, when there is data in the
socket receive buffer that has not been read, or data arrives subsequently,
is also system dependent.

- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
AsynchronousSocketChannel
shutdownOutput()
throws
IOException

Shutdown the connection for writing without closing the channel.

Once shutdown for writing then further attempts to write to the
channel will throw

ClosedChannelException

. If the output side of
the connection is already shutdown then invoking this method has no
effect. The effect on an outstanding write operation is system dependent
and therefore not specified.

**Returns:**
- The channel

**Throws:**
- NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

#### public abstract <A> void connect​(
SocketAddress
remote,
A attachment,

CompletionHandler
<
Void
,​? super A> handler)

Connects this channel.

This method initiates an operation to connect this channel. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when
the connection is successfully established or connection cannot be
established. If the connection cannot be established then the channel is
closed.

This method performs exactly the same security checks as the

Socket

class. That is, if a security manager has been
installed then this method verifies that its

checkConnect

method permits
connecting to the address and port number of the given remote endpoint.

**Parameters:**
- remote

- The remote address to which this channel is to be connected
- attachment

- The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be

null
- handler

- The handler for consuming the result

**Throws:**
- UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
- UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
- AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
- ConnectionPendingException

- If a connection operation is already in progress on this channel
- ShutdownChannelGroupException

- If the channel group has terminated
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote endpoint

- getRemoteAddress()

**Type Parameters:**
- A

- The type of the attachment

---

#### public abstract
Future
<
Void
> connect​(
SocketAddress
remote)

Connects this channel.

This method initiates an operation to connect this channel. This
method behaves in exactly the same manner as the

connect(SocketAddress, Object, CompletionHandler)

method except that
instead of specifying a completion handler, this method returns a

Future

representing the pending result. The

Future

's

get

method returns

null

on successful completion.

**Parameters:**
- remote

- The remote address to which this channel is to be connected

**Returns:**
- A

Future

object representing the pending result

**Throws:**
- UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
- UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
- AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
- ConnectionPendingException

- If a connection operation is already in progress on this channel

#### public abstract <A> void read​(
ByteBuffer
dst,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit,
A attachment,

CompletionHandler
<
Integer
,​? super A> handler)

Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a
sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the read
operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
handler is the number of bytes read or

-1

if no bytes could be
read because the channel has reached end-of-stream.

If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
completes then the operation completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. Where a timeout occurs, and the
implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read, or will not
be read from the channel into the given buffer, then further attempts to
read from the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
thrown.

Otherwise this method works in the same manner as the

AsynchronousByteChannel.read(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)

method.

**Parameters:**
- dst

- The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
- timeout

- The maximum time for the I/O operation to complete
- unit

- The time unit of the

timeout

argument
- attachment

- The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be

null
- handler

- The handler for consuming the result

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the buffer is read-only
- ReadPendingException

- If a read operation is already in progress on this channel
- NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
- ShutdownChannelGroupException

- If the channel group has terminated

#### public abstract <A> void read​(
ByteBuffer
[] dsts,
int offset,
int length,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit,
A attachment,

CompletionHandler
<
Long
,​? super A> handler)

Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into a subsequence of the
given buffers. This operation, sometimes called a

scattering read

,
is often useful when implementing network protocols that group data into
segments consisting of one or more fixed-length headers followed by a
variable-length body. The

handler

parameter is a completion
handler that is invoked when the read operation completes (or fails). The
result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes read or

-1

if no bytes could be read because the channel has reached
end-of-stream.

This method initiates a read of up to

r

bytes from this channel,
where

r

is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified
subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,

```java
dsts[offset].remaining()
+ dsts[offset+1].remaining()
+ ... + dsts[offset+length-1].remaining()
```

at the moment that the read is attempted.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

n

is read, where

0

<

n

<=

r

.
Up to the first

dsts[offset].remaining()

bytes of this sequence
are transferred into buffer

dsts[offset]

, up to the next

dsts[offset+1].remaining()

bytes are transferred into buffer

dsts[offset+1]

, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence
is transferred into the given buffers. As many bytes as possible are
transferred into each buffer, hence the final position of each updated
buffer, except the last updated buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to
that buffer's limit. The underlying operating system may impose a limit
on the number of buffers that may be used in an I/O operation. Where the
number of buffers (with bytes remaining), exceeds this limit, then the
I/O operation is performed with the maximum number of buffers allowed by
the operating system.

If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
completes then it completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. Where a timeout occurs, and the
implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read, or will not
be read from the channel into the given buffers, then further attempts to
read from the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
thrown.

**Parameters:**
- dsts

- The buffers into which bytes are to be transferred
- offset

- The offset within the buffer array of the first buffer into which
bytes are to be transferred; must be non-negative and no larger than

dsts.length
- length

- The maximum number of buffers to be accessed; must be non-negative
and no larger than

dsts.length - offset
- timeout

- The maximum time for the I/O operation to complete
- unit

- The time unit of the

timeout

argument
- attachment

- The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be

null
- handler

- The handler for consuming the result

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If the pre-conditions for the

offset

and

length

parameter aren't met
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the buffer is read-only
- ReadPendingException

- If a read operation is already in progress on this channel
- NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
- ShutdownChannelGroupException

- If the channel group has terminated

**Type Parameters:**
- A

- The type of the attachment

#### public abstract <A> void write​(
ByteBuffer
src,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit,
A attachment,

CompletionHandler
<
Integer
,​? super A> handler)

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a
sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the write
operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
handler is the number of bytes written.

If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
completes then it completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. Where a timeout occurs, and the
implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written, or will
not be written to the channel from the given buffer, then further attempts
to write to the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
thrown.

Otherwise this method works in the same manner as the

AsynchronousByteChannel.write(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)

method.

**Parameters:**
- src

- The buffer from which bytes are to be retrieved
- timeout

- The maximum time for the I/O operation to complete

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from a subsequence of the given
buffers. This operation, sometimes called a

gathering write

, is
often useful when implementing network protocols that group data into
segments consisting of one or more fixed-length headers followed by a
variable-length body. The

The result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes written.

This method initiates a write of up to

is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified
subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,

```java
srcs[offset].remaining()
+ srcs[offset+1].remaining()
+ ... + srcs[offset+length-1].remaining()
```

at the moment that the write is attempted.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

n

is written, where

0

<

n

<=

r

.
Up to the first

srcs[offset].remaining()

bytes of this sequence
are written from buffer

srcs[offset]

, up to the next

srcs[offset+1].remaining()

bytes are written from buffer

srcs[offset+1]

, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence is
written. As many bytes as possible are written from each buffer, hence
the final position of each updated buffer, except the last updated
buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit. The underlying
operating system may impose a limit on the number of buffers that may be
used in an I/O operation. Where the number of buffers (with bytes
remaining), exceeds this limit, then the I/O operation is performed with
the maximum number of buffers allowed by the operating system.

```java
public abstract class
AsynchronousSocketChannel

extends

implements
AsynchronousByteChannel

NetworkChannel
```

An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.

Asynchronous socket channels are created in one of two ways. A newly-created

AsynchronousSocketChannel

is created by invoking one of the

open

methods defined by this class. A newly-created channel is open but
not yet connected. A connected

AsynchronousSocketChannel

is created
when a connection is made to the socket of an

AsynchronousServerSocketChannel

.
It is not possible to create an asynchronous socket channel for an arbitrary,
pre-existing

socket

.

A newly-created channel is connected by invoking its

connect

method; once connected, a channel remains connected until it is closed. Whether
or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by invoking its

getRemoteAddress

method. An attempt to invoke an I/O
operation upon an unconnected channel will cause a

NotYetConnectedException

to be thrown.

Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one read operation
and one write operation can be outstanding at any time.
If a thread initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
completed then a

ReadPendingException

will be thrown. Similarly, an
attempt to initiate a write operation before a previous write has completed
will throw a

WritePendingException

.

Socket options are configured using the

setOption

method. Asynchronous socket channels support the following options:

Socket options

Option Name

Description

SO_SNDBUF

The size of the socket send buffer

SO_RCVBUF

The size of the socket receive buffer

SO_KEEPALIVE

Keep connection alive

SO_REUSEADDR

Re-use address

TCP_NODELAY

Disable the Nagle algorithm

Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.

Timeouts

The

read

and

write

methods defined by this class allow a timeout to be specified when initiating
a read or write operation. If the timeout elapses before an operation completes
then the operation completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. A timeout may leave the channel, or the
underlying connection, in an inconsistent state. Where the implementation
cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read from the channel then it puts
the channel into an implementation specific

error state

. A subsequent
attempt to initiate a

read

operation causes an unspecified runtime
exception to be thrown. Similarly if a

write

operation times out and
the implementation cannot guarantee bytes have not been written to the
channel then further attempts to

write

to the channel cause an
unspecified runtime exception to be thrown. When a timeout elapses then the
state of the

ByteBuffer

, or the sequence of buffers, for the I/O
operation is not defined. Buffers should be discarded or at least care must
be taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while the channel remains
open. All methods that accept timeout parameters treat values less than or
equal to zero to mean that the I/O operation does not timeout.

public abstract class

AsynchronousSocketChannel

NetworkChannel

An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.

Asynchronous socket channels are created in one of two ways. A newly-created

AsynchronousSocketChannel

is created by invoking one of the

open

methods defined by this class. A newly-created channel is open but
not yet connected. A connected

AsynchronousSocketChannel

is created
when a connection is made to the socket of an

or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by invoking its

method. An attempt to invoke an I/O
operation upon an unconnected channel will cause a

NotYetConnectedException

to be thrown.

Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one read operation
and one write operation can be outstanding at any time.
If a thread initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
completed then a

ReadPendingException

will be thrown. Similarly, an
attempt to initiate a write operation before a previous write has completed
will throw a

WritePendingException

.

Socket options are configured using the

Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.

Timeouts

The

read

and

write

methods defined by this class allow a timeout to be specified when initiating
a read or write operation. If the timeout elapses before an operation completes
then the operation completes with the exception

channel then further attempts to

write

to the channel cause an
unspecified runtime exception to be thrown. When a timeout elapses then the
state of the

ByteBuffer

, or the sequence of buffers, for the I/O
operation is not defined. Buffers should be discarded or at least care must
be taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while the channel remains
open. All methods that accept timeout parameters treat values less than or
equal to zero to mean that the I/O operation does not timeout.

Asynchronous socket channels are created in one of two ways. A newly-created

AsynchronousSocketChannel

is created by invoking one of the

open

methods defined by this class. A newly-created channel is open but
not yet connected. A connected

AsynchronousSocketChannel

is created
when a connection is made to the socket of an

AsynchronousServerSocketChannel

.
It is not possible to create an asynchronous socket channel for an arbitrary,
pre-existing

socket

.

A newly-created channel is connected by invoking its

connect

method; once connected, a channel remains connected until it is closed. Whether
or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by invoking its

getRemoteAddress

method. An attempt to invoke an I/O
operation upon an unconnected channel will cause a

NotYetConnectedException

to be thrown.

Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one read operation
and one write operation can be outstanding at any time.
If a thread initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
completed then a

ReadPendingException

will be thrown. Similarly, an
attempt to initiate a write operation before a previous write has completed
will throw a

WritePendingException

.

Socket options are configured using the

setOption

method. Asynchronous socket channels support the following options:

Socket options

Option Name

Description

SO_SNDBUF

The size of the socket send buffer

SO_RCVBUF

The size of the socket receive buffer

SO_KEEPALIVE

Keep connection alive

SO_REUSEADDR

Re-use address

TCP_NODELAY

Disable the Nagle algorithm

Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.

Timeouts

The

read

and

write

methods defined by this class allow a timeout to be specified when initiating
a read or write operation. If the timeout elapses before an operation completes
then the operation completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. A timeout may leave the channel, or the
underlying connection, in an inconsistent state. Where the implementation
cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read from the channel then it puts
the channel into an implementation specific

error state

. A subsequent
attempt to initiate a

read

operation causes an unspecified runtime
exception to be thrown. Similarly if a

write

operation times out and
the implementation cannot guarantee bytes have not been written to the
channel then further attempts to

write

to the channel cause an
unspecified runtime exception to be thrown. When a timeout elapses then the
state of the

ByteBuffer

, or the sequence of buffers, for the I/O
operation is not defined. Buffers should be discarded or at least care must
be taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while the channel remains

**Returns:** The provider that created this channel

- open

```java
public static
AsynchronousSocketChannel
open​(
AsynchronousChannelGroup
group)
throws
IOException
```

Opens an asynchronous socket channel.

The new channel is created by invoking the

openAsynchronousSocketChannel

method on the

AsynchronousChannelProvider

that created the group. If the group parameter
is

null

then the resulting channel is created by the system-wide
default provider, and bound to the

default group

.

**Parameters:** group

- The group to which the newly constructed channel should be bound,
or

null

for the default group
**Returns:** A new asynchronous socket channel
**Throws:** ShutdownChannelGroupException

- If the channel group is shutdown
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- open

```java
public static
AsynchronousSocketChannel
open()
throws
IOException
```

Opens an asynchronous socket channel.

This method returns an asynchronous socket channel that is bound to
the

default group

.This method is equivalent to evaluating the
expression:

```java
open((AsynchronousChannelGroup)null);
```

**Returns:** A new asynchronous socket channel
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- bind

```java
public abstract
AsynchronousSocketChannel
bind​(
SocketAddress
local)
throws

```

Description copied from interface:

NetworkChannel

Binds the channel's socket to a local address.

This method is used to establish an association between the socket and
a local address. Once an association is established then the socket remains
bound until the channel is closed. If the

local

parameter has the
value

null

then the socket will be bound to an address that is
assigned automatically.

**Specified by:** bind

in interface

NetworkChannel
**Parameters:** local

- The address to bind the socket, or

null

to bind the socket
to an automatically assigned socket address
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a connection operation is already in progress on this channel
**Throws:** AlreadyBoundException

- If the socket is already bound
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given address is not supported
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If the channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and its

checkListen

method denies
the operation
**See Also:** NetworkChannel.getLocalAddress()

- setOption

```java
public abstract <T>
AsynchronousSocketChannel
setOption​(
SocketOption
<T> name,
T value)
throws
IOException
```

Description copied from interface:

NetworkChannel

Sets the value of a socket option.

**Specified by:** setOption

in interface

NetworkChannel
**Type Parameters:** T

- The type of the socket option value
**Parameters:** name

- The socket option
**Parameters:** value

- The value of the socket option. A value of

null

may be
a valid value for some socket options.
**Returns:** This channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the value is not a valid value for this socket option
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**See Also:** StandardSocketOptions

- shutdownInput

```java
public abstract
AsynchronousSocketChannel
shutdownInput()
throws
IOException
```

Shutdown the connection for reading without closing the channel.

Once shutdown for reading then further reads on the channel will
return

-1

, the end-of-stream indication. If the input side of the
connection is already shutdown then invoking this method has no effect.
The effect on an outstanding read operation is system dependent and
therefore not specified. The effect, if any, when there is data in the
socket receive buffer that has not been read, or data arrives subsequently,
is also system dependent.

**Returns:** The channel
**Throws:** NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- shutdownOutput

```java
public abstract
AsynchronousSocketChannel
shutdownOutput()
throws
IOException
```

Shutdown the connection for writing without closing the channel.

Once shutdown for writing then further attempts to write to the
channel will throw

ClosedChannelException

. If the output side of
the connection is already shutdown then invoking this method has no
effect. The effect on an outstanding write operation is system dependent
and therefore not specified.

**Returns:** The channel
**Throws:** NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- getRemoteAddress

```java
public abstract
SocketAddress
getRemoteAddress()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the remote address to which this channel's socket is connected.

Where the channel is bound and connected to an Internet Protocol
socket address then the return value from this method is of type

InetSocketAddress

.

**Returns:** The remote address;

null

if the channel's socket is not
connected
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If the channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- connect

```java
public abstract <A> void connect​(
SocketAddress
remote,
A attachment,

CompletionHandler
<
Void
,​? super A> handler)
```

Connects this channel.

This method initiates an operation to connect this channel. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when
the connection is successfully established or connection cannot be
established. If the connection cannot be established then the channel is
closed.

This method performs exactly the same security checks as the

Socket

class. That is, if a security manager has been
installed then this method verifies that its

checkConnect

method permits
connecting to the address and port number of the given remote endpoint.

**Type Parameters:** A

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** remote

- The remote address to which this channel is to be connected
**Parameters:** attachment

- The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be

null
**Parameters:** handler

- The handler for consuming the result
**Throws:** UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
**Throws:** AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a connection operation is already in progress on this channel
**Throws:** ShutdownChannelGroupException

- If the channel group has terminated
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote endpoint
**See Also:** getRemoteAddress()

- connect

```java
public abstract
Future
<
Void
> connect​(
SocketAddress
remote)
```

Connects this channel.

This method initiates an operation to connect this channel. This
method behaves in exactly the same manner as the

connect(SocketAddress, Object, CompletionHandler)

method except that
instead of specifying a completion handler, this method returns a

Future

representing the pending result. The

Future

's

get

method returns

null

on successful completion.

**Parameters:** remote

- The remote address to which this channel is to be connected
**Returns:** A

Future

object representing the pending result
**Throws:** UnresolvedAddressException

- If the given remote address is not fully resolved
**Throws:** UnsupportedAddressTypeException

- If the type of the given remote address is not supported
**Throws:** AlreadyConnectedException

- If this channel is already connected
**Throws:** ConnectionPendingException

- If a connection operation is already in progress on this channel
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed
and it does not permit access to the given remote endpoint

- read

```java
public abstract <A> void read​(
ByteBuffer
dst,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit,
A attachment,

CompletionHandler
<
Integer
,​? super A> handler)
```

Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a
sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the read
operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
handler is the number of bytes read or

-1

if no bytes could be
read because the channel has reached end-of-stream.

If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
completes then the operation completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. Where a timeout occurs, and the
implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read, or will not
be read from the channel into the given buffer, then further attempts to
read from the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
thrown.

Otherwise this method works in the same manner as the

AsynchronousByteChannel.read(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)

method.

**Type Parameters:** A

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** dst

- The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** timeout

- The maximum time for the I/O operation to complete
**Parameters:** unit

- The time unit of the

timeout

argument
**Parameters:** attachment

- The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be

null
**Parameters:** handler

- The handler for consuming the result
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the buffer is read-only
**Throws:** ReadPendingException

- If a read operation is already in progress on this channel
**Throws:** NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
**Throws:** ShutdownChannelGroupException

- If the channel group has terminated

- read

```java
public final <A> void read​(

The read operation may read up to

r

bytes from the channel,
where

r

is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,

dst.remaining()

at the time that the read is attempted. Where

r

is 0, the read operation completes immediately with a result of

0

without initiating an I/O operation.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

n

is read, where

0

<

n

<=

r

.
This byte sequence will be transferred into the buffer so that the first
byte in the sequence is at index

p

and the last byte is at index

p

+

n

-

1

,
where

p

is the buffer's position at the moment the read is
performed. Upon completion the buffer's position will be equal to

p

+

n

; its limit will not have changed.

Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads so care
should be taken to not access the buffer until the operation has
completed.

This method may be invoked at any time. Some channel types may not
allow more than one read to be outstanding at any given time. If a thread
initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
completed then a

ReadPendingException

will be thrown.

Description copied from interface:

AsynchronousByteChannel

Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a
sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer. The method
behaves in exactly the same manner as the

read(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)

method except that instead
of specifying a completion handler, this method returns a

Future

representing the pending result. The

Future

's

get

method returns the number of bytes read or

-1

if no bytes
could be read because the channel has reached end-of-stream.

**Specified by:** read

in interface

AsynchronousByteChannel
**Parameters:** dst

- The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
**Returns:** A Future representing the result of the operation
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the buffer is read-only
**Throws:** ReadPendingException

- If the channel does not allow more than one read to be outstanding
and a previous read has not completed
**Throws:** NotYetConnectedException

int length,
long timeout,

TimeUnit

A attachment,

CompletionHandler

Long
,​? super A> handler)
```

Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into a subsequence of the
given buffers. This operation, sometimes called a

scattering read

,
is often useful when implementing network protocols that group data into
segments consisting of one or more fixed-length headers followed by a
variable-length body. The

handler

parameter is a completion
handler that is invoked when the read operation completes (or fails). The
result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes read or

-1

if no bytes could be read because the channel has reached
end-of-stream.

This method initiates a read of up to

r

bytes from this channel,
where

r

is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified
subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,

```java
dsts[offset].remaining()
+ dsts[offset+1].remaining()
+ ... + dsts[offset+length-1].remaining()
```

at the moment that the read is attempted.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

n

is read, where

0

<

n

<=

r

.
Up to the first

dsts[offset].remaining()

bytes of this sequence
are transferred into buffer

dsts[offset]

, up to the next

dsts[offset+1].remaining()

bytes are transferred into buffer

dsts[offset+1]

, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence
is transferred into the given buffers. As many bytes as possible are
transferred into each buffer, hence the final position of each updated
buffer, except the last updated buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to
that buffer's limit. The underlying operating system may impose a limit
on the number of buffers that may be used in an I/O operation. Where the
number of buffers (with bytes remaining), exceeds this limit, then the
I/O operation is performed with the maximum number of buffers allowed by
the operating system.

If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
completes then it completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. Where a timeout occurs, and the
implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read, or will not
be read from the channel into the given buffers, then further attempts to
read from the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
thrown.

**Type Parameters:** A

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** dsts

- The buffers into which bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** offset

- The offset within the buffer array of the first buffer into which
bytes are to be transferred; must be non-negative and no larger than

dsts.length
**Parameters:** length

- The maximum number of buffers to be accessed; must be non-negative
and no larger than

dsts.length - offset
**Parameters:** timeout

- The maximum time for the I/O operation to complete
**Parameters:** unit

- The time unit of the

timeout

argument
**Parameters:** attachment

- The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be

**Parameters:** handler

- The handler for consuming the result
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If the pre-conditions for the

offset

and

length

parameter aren't met
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the buffer is read-only
**Throws:** ReadPendingException

- If a read operation is already in progress on this channel
**Throws:** NotYetConnectedException

```java
public abstract <A> void write​(
ByteBuffer
src,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit,
A attachment,

CompletionHandler
<
Integer
,​? super A> handler)
```

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a
sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the write
operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
handler is the number of bytes written.

If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
completes then it completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. Where a timeout occurs, and the
implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written, or will
not be written to the channel from the given buffer, then further attempts
to write to the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
thrown.

Otherwise this method works in the same manner as the

AsynchronousByteChannel.write(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)

method.

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a
sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the write
operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
handler is the number of bytes written.

The write operation may write up to

r

bytes to the channel,
where

r

is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,

src.remaining()

at the time that the write is attempted. Where

r

is 0, the write operation completes immediately with a result of

0

without initiating an I/O operation.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

n

is written, where

0

<

n

<=

.
This byte sequence will be transferred from the buffer starting at index

, where

p

is the buffer's position at the moment the

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from a subsequence of the given

at the moment that the write is attempted.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

This method initiates an operation to connect this channel. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when
the connection is successfully established or connection cannot be
established. If the connection cannot be established then the channel is
closed.

This method performs exactly the same security checks as the

Socket

class. That is, if a security manager has been
installed then this method verifies that its

checkConnect

method permits
connecting to the address and port number of the given remote endpoint.

handler that is invoked when the read operation completes (or fails). The
result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes read or

-1

if no bytes could be read because the channel has reached
end-of-stream.

This method initiates a read of up to

r

bytes from this channel,
where

r

is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified
subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,

```java
dsts[offset].remaining()
+ dsts[offset+1].remaining()
+ ... + dsts[offset+length-1].remaining()
```

at the moment that the read is attempted.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

n

is read, where

0

<

n

<=

r

.
Up to the first

dsts[offset].remaining()

bytes of this sequence
are transferred into buffer

dsts[offset]

, up to the next

dsts[offset+1].remaining()

bytes are transferred into buffer

dsts[offset+1]

, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence
is transferred into the given buffers. As many bytes as possible are
transferred into each buffer, hence the final position of each updated
buffer, except the last updated buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to
that buffer's limit. The underlying operating system may impose a limit
on the number of buffers that may be used in an I/O operation. Where the
number of buffers (with bytes remaining), exceeds this limit, then the
I/O operation is performed with the maximum number of buffers allowed by
the operating system.

If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
completes then it completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. Where a timeout occurs, and the
implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read, or will not
be read from the channel into the given buffers, then further attempts to
read from the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
thrown.

**Type Parameters:** A

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** dsts

- The buffers into which bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** offset

- The offset within the buffer array of the first buffer into which
bytes are to be transferred; must be non-negative and no larger than

```

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a
sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the write
operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
handler is the number of bytes written.

If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
completes then it completes with the exception

. Where a timeout occurs, and the
implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written, or will
not be written to the channel from the given buffer, then further attempts
to write to the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
thrown.

Description copied from interface:

AsynchronousByteChannel

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a
sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the write
operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
handler is the number of bytes written.

The write operation may write up to

r

bytes to the channel,
where

r

is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,

src.remaining()

at the time that the write is attempted. Where

r

is 0, the write operation completes immediately with a result of

0

without initiating an I/O operation.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

n

is written, where

0

<

n

<=

r

.
This byte sequence will be transferred from the buffer starting at index

p

, where

p

is the buffer's position at the moment the
write is performed; the index of the last byte written will be

p

+

n

-

1

.
Upon completion the buffer's position will be equal to

p

+

n

; its limit will not have changed.

Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads so care
should be taken to not access the buffer until the operation has
completed.

This method may be invoked at any time. Some channel types may not
allow more than one write to be outstanding at any given time. If a thread
initiates a write operation before a previous write operation has
completed then a

WritePendingException

will be thrown.

**Specified by:** write

**Type Parameters:** A

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** src

- The buffer from which bytes are to be retrieved
**Parameters:** attachment

- The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be

**Parameters:** handler

- The completion handler object
**Throws:** WritePendingException

- If the channel does not allow more than one write to be outstanding

AsynchronousByteChannel

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a
sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The method
behaves in exactly the same manner as the

```

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from a subsequence of the given
buffers. This operation, sometimes called a

gathering write

, is
often useful when implementing network protocols that group data into
segments consisting of one or more fixed-length headers followed by a
variable-length body. The

handler

parameter is a completion
handler that is invoked when the write operation completes (or fails).
The result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes written.

This method initiates a write of up to

r

bytes to this channel,
where

r

is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified
subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,

```java
srcs[offset].remaining()
+ srcs[offset+1].remaining()
+ ... + srcs[offset+length-1].remaining()
```

at the moment that the write is attempted.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

n

is written, where

0

<

n

<=

r

.
Up to the first

srcs[offset].remaining()

bytes of this sequence
are written from buffer

srcs[offset]

, up to the next

srcs[offset+1].remaining()

bytes are written from buffer

srcs[offset+1]

, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence is
written. As many bytes as possible are written from each buffer, hence
the final position of each updated buffer, except the last updated
buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit. The underlying
operating system may impose a limit on the number of buffers that may be
used in an I/O operation. Where the number of buffers (with bytes
remaining), exceeds this limit, then the I/O operation is performed with
the maximum number of buffers allowed by the operating system.

If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
completes then it completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. Where a timeout occurs, and the
implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written, or will
not be written to the channel from the given buffers, then further attempts
to write to the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
thrown.

**Type Parameters:** A

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** srcs

- The buffers from which bytes are to be retrieved
**Parameters:** offset

- The offset within the buffer array of the first buffer from which
bytes are to be retrieved; must be non-negative and no larger

AsynchronousByteChannel

Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a
sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer. The

handler

parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the read
operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
handler is the number of bytes read or

-1

if no bytes could be
read because the channel has reached end-of-stream.

The read operation may read up to

r

bytes from the channel,
where

r

is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,

dst.remaining()

at the time that the read is attempted. Where

r

is 0, the read operation completes immediately with a result of

0

without initiating an I/O operation.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

n

is read, where

0

<

n

<=

r

.
This byte sequence will be transferred into the buffer so that the first
byte in the sequence is at index

p

and the last byte is at index

p

+

n

-

1

,
where

p

is the buffer's position at the moment the read is
performed. Upon completion the buffer's position will be equal to

p

+

n

; its limit will not have changed.

Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads so care
should be taken to not access the buffer until the operation has
completed.

This method may be invoked at any time. Some channel types may not
allow more than one read to be outstanding at any given time. If a thread
initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
completed then a

ReadPendingException

will be thrown.

that buffer's limit. The underlying operating system may impose a limit
on the number of buffers that may be used in an I/O operation. Where the
number of buffers (with bytes remaining), exceeds this limit, then the
I/O operation is performed with the maximum number of buffers allowed by
the operating system.

n

is written, where

0

<

n

<=

r

.
This byte sequence will be transferred from the buffer starting at index

p

, where

p

is the buffer's position at the moment the
write is performed; the index of the last byte written will be

p

+

n

-

1

.
Upon completion the buffer's position will be equal to

p

n

; its limit will not have changed.

Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads so care
should be taken to not access the buffer until the operation has
completed.

This method may be invoked at any time. Some channel types may not
allow more than one write to be outstanding at any given time. If a thread
initiates a write operation before a previous write operation has
completed then a

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.

This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a
sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The method
behaves in exactly the same manner as the

write(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)

method except that instead
of specifying a completion handler, this method returns a

```

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from a subsequence of the given
buffers. This operation, sometimes called a

gathering write

, is
often useful when implementing network protocols that group data into
segments consisting of one or more fixed-length headers followed by a
variable-length body. The

handler

parameter is a completion
handler that is invoked when the write operation completes (or fails).
The result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes written.

This method initiates a write of up to

r

bytes to this channel,
where

r

is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified
subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,

```java
srcs[offset].remaining()
+ srcs[offset+1].remaining()
+ ... + srcs[offset+length-1].remaining()
```

at the moment that the write is attempted.

Suppose that a byte sequence of length

n

is written, where

0

<

n

<=

r

.
Up to the first

srcs[offset].remaining()

bytes of this sequence
are written from buffer

srcs[offset]

, up to the next

srcs[offset+1].remaining()

bytes are written from buffer

srcs[offset+1]

, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence is
written. As many bytes as possible are written from each buffer, hence
the final position of each updated buffer, except the last updated
buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit. The underlying
operating system may impose a limit on the number of buffers that may be
used in an I/O operation. Where the number of buffers (with bytes
remaining), exceeds this limit, then the I/O operation is performed with
the maximum number of buffers allowed by the operating system.

If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
completes then it completes with the exception

InterruptedByTimeoutException

. Where a timeout occurs, and the
implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written, or will
not be written to the channel from the given buffers, then further attempts
to write to the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
thrown.

**Type Parameters:** A

- The type of the attachment
**Parameters:** srcs

- The buffers from which bytes are to be retrieved
**Parameters:** offset

- The offset within the buffer array of the first buffer from which
bytes are to be retrieved; must be non-negative and no larger
than

srcs.length
**Parameters:** length

- The maximum number of buffers to be accessed; must be non-negative
and no larger than

srcs.length - offset
**Parameters:** timeout

- The maximum time for the I/O operation to complete
**Parameters:** unit

- The time unit of the

timeout

argument
**Parameters:** attachment

- The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be

null
**Parameters:** handler

- The handler for consuming the result
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If the pre-conditions for the

offset

and

length

parameter aren't met
**Throws:** WritePendingException

- If a write operation is already in progress on this channel
**Throws:** NotYetConnectedException

- If this channel is not yet connected
**Throws:** ShutdownChannelGroupException

- If the channel group has terminated
