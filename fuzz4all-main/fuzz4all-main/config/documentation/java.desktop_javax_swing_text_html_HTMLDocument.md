# Class HTMLDocument

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\text\html\HTMLDocument.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
HTMLDocument

extends
DefaultStyledDocument
```

A document that models HTML. The purpose of this model is to
support both browsing and editing. As a result, the structure
described by an HTML document is not exactly replicated by default.
The element structure that is modeled by default, is built by the
class

HTMLDocument.HTMLReader

, which implements the

HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback

protocol that the parser
expects. To change the structure one can subclass

HTMLReader

, and reimplement the method

getReader(int)

to return the new reader implementation. The
documentation for

HTMLReader

should be consulted for
the details of the default structure created. The intent is that
the document be non-lossy (although reproducing the HTML format may
result in a different format).

The document models only HTML, and makes no attempt to store
view attributes in it. The elements are identified by the

StyleContext.NameAttribute

attribute, which should
always have a value of type

HTML.Tag

that identifies
the kind of element. Some of the elements (such as comments) are
synthesized. The

HTMLFactory

uses this attribute to
determine what kind of view to build.

This document supports incremental loading. The

TokenThreshold

property controls how much of the parse
is buffered before trying to update the element structure of the
document. This property is set by the

EditorKit

so
that subclasses can disable it.

The

Base

property determines the URL against which
relative URLs are resolved. By default, this will be the

Document.StreamDescriptionProperty

if the value of the
property is a URL. If a <BASE> tag is encountered, the base
will become the URL specified by that tag. Because the base URL is
a property, it can of course be set directly.

The default content storage mechanism for this document is a gap
buffer (

GapContent

). Alternatives can be supplied by
using the constructor that takes a

Content

implementation.

Modifying HTMLDocument

In addition to the methods provided by Document and
StyledDocument for mutating an HTMLDocument, HTMLDocument provides
a number of convenience methods. The following methods can be used
to insert HTML content into an existing document.

- setInnerHTML(Element, String)
- setOuterHTML(Element, String)
- insertBeforeStart(Element, String)
- insertAfterStart(Element, String)
- insertBeforeEnd(Element, String)
- insertAfterEnd(Element, String)

The following examples illustrate using these methods. Each
example assumes the HTML document is initialized in the following
way:

```java
JEditorPane p = new JEditorPane();
p.setContentType("text/html");
p.setText("..."); // Document text is provided below.
HTMLDocument d = (HTMLDocument) p.getDocument();
```

With the following HTML content:

```java
<html>
<head>
<title>An example HTMLDocument</title>
<style type="text/css">
div { background-color: silver; }
ul { color: blue; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="BOX">
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

All the methods for modifying an HTML document require an

Element

. Elements can be obtained from an HTML document by using
the method

getElement(Element e, Object attribute, Object
value)

. It returns the first descendant element that contains the
specified attribute with the given value, in depth-first order.
For example,

d.getElement(d.getDefaultRootElement(),
StyleConstants.NameAttribute, HTML.Tag.P)

returns the first
paragraph element.

A convenient shortcut for locating elements is the method

getElement(String)

; returns an element whose

ID

attribute matches the specified value. For example,

d.getElement("BOX")

returns the

DIV

element.

The

getIterator(HTML.Tag t)

method can also be used for
finding all occurrences of the specified HTML tag in the
document.

Inserting elements

Elements can be inserted before or after the existing children
of any non-leaf element by using the methods

insertAfterStart

and

insertBeforeEnd

.
For example, if

e

is the

DIV

element,

d.insertAfterStart(e, "<ul><li>List
Item</li></ul>")

inserts the list before the first
paragraph, and

d.insertBeforeEnd(e, "<ul><li>List
Item</li></ul>")

inserts the list after the last
paragraph. The

DIV

block becomes the parent of the
newly inserted elements.

Sibling elements can be inserted before or after any element by
using the methods

insertBeforeStart

and

insertAfterEnd

. For example, if

e

is the

DIV

element,

d.insertBeforeStart(e,
"<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>")

inserts the list
before the

DIV

element, and

d.insertAfterEnd(e,
"<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>")

inserts the list
after the

DIV

element. The newly inserted elements
become siblings of the

DIV

element.

Replacing elements

Elements and all their descendants can be replaced by using the
methods

setInnerHTML

and

setOuterHTML

.
For example, if

e

is the

DIV

element,

d.setInnerHTML(e, "<ul><li>List
Item</li></ul>")

replaces all children paragraphs with
the list, and

d.setOuterHTML(e, "<ul><li>List
Item</li></ul>")

replaces the

DIV

element
itself. In latter case the parent of the list is the

BODY

element.

### Method Details

#### public
HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback
getReader​(int pos)

Fetches the reader for the parser to use when loading the document
with HTML. This is implemented to return an instance of

HTMLDocument.HTMLReader

.
Subclasses can reimplement this
method to change how the document gets structured if desired.
(For example, to handle custom tags, or structurally represent character
style elements.)

**Parameters:**
- pos

- the starting position

**Returns:**
- the reader used by the parser to load the document

---

#### public
HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback
getReader​(int pos,
int popDepth,
int pushDepth,

HTML.Tag
insertTag)

Returns the reader for the parser to use to load the document
with HTML. This is implemented to return an instance of

HTMLDocument.HTMLReader

.
Subclasses can reimplement this
method to change how the document gets structured if desired.
(For example, to handle custom tags, or structurally represent character
style elements.)

This is a convenience method for

getReader(int, int, int, HTML.Tag, TRUE)

.

**Parameters:**
- pos

- the starting position
- popDepth

- the number of

ElementSpec.EndTagTypes

to generate before inserting
- pushDepth

- the number of

ElementSpec.StartTagTypes

with a direction of

ElementSpec.JoinNextDirection

that should be generated before inserting,
but after the end tags have been generated
- insertTag

- the first tag to start inserting into document

**Returns:**
- the reader used by the parser to load the document

---

#### public
URL
getBase()

Returns the location to resolve relative URLs against. By
default this will be the document's URL if the document
was loaded from a URL. If a base tag is found and
can be parsed, it will be used as the base location.

**Returns:**
- the base location

---

#### public void setBase​(
URL
u)

Sets the location to resolve relative URLs against. By
default this will be the document's URL if the document
was loaded from a URL. If a base tag is found and
can be parsed, it will be used as the base location.

This also sets the base of the

StyleSheet

to be

u

as well as the base of the document.

**Parameters:**
- u

- the desired base URL

---

#### protected void insert​(int offset,

DefaultStyledDocument.ElementSpec
[] data)
throws
BadLocationException

Inserts new elements in bulk. This is how elements get created
in the document. The parsing determines what structure is needed
and creates the specification as a set of tokens that describe the
edit while leaving the document free of a write-lock. This method
can then be called in bursts by the reader to acquire a write-lock
for a shorter duration (i.e. while the document is actually being
altered).

**Overrides:**
- insert

in class

DefaultStyledDocument

**Parameters:**
- offset

- the starting offset
- data

- the element data

**Throws:**
- BadLocationException

- if the given position does not
represent a valid location in the associated document.

---

#### protected void insertUpdate​(
AbstractDocument.DefaultDocumentEvent
chng,

AttributeSet
attr)

Updates document structure as a result of text insertion. This
will happen within a write lock. This implementation simply
parses the inserted content for line breaks and builds up a set
of instructions for the element buffer.

**Overrides:**
- insertUpdate

in class

DefaultStyledDocument

**Parameters:**
- chng

- a description of the document change
- attr

- the attributes

---

#### protected void create​(
DefaultStyledDocument.ElementSpec
[] data)

Replaces the contents of the document with the given
element specifications. This is called before insert if
the loading is done in bursts. This is the only method called
if loading the document entirely in one burst.

**Overrides:**
- create

in class

DefaultStyledDocument

**Parameters:**
- data

- the new contents of the document

---

#### public void setParagraphAttributes​(int offset,
int length,

AttributeSet
s,
boolean replace)

Sets attributes for a paragraph.

This method is thread safe, although most Swing methods
are not. Please see

Concurrency
in Swing

for more information.

**Specified by:**
- setParagraphAttributes

in interface

StyledDocument

**Overrides:**
- setParagraphAttributes

in class

DefaultStyledDocument

**Parameters:**
- offset

- the offset into the paragraph (must be at least 0)
- length

- the number of characters affected (must be at least 0)
- s

- the attributes
- replace

- whether to replace existing attributes, or merge them

---

#### public
StyleSheet
getStyleSheet()

Fetches the

StyleSheet

with the document-specific display
rules (CSS) that were specified in the HTML document itself.

**Returns:**
- the

StyleSheet

---

#### public
HTMLDocument.Iterator
getIterator​(
HTML.Tag
t)

Fetches an iterator for the specified HTML tag.
This can be used for things like iterating over the
set of anchors contained, or iterating over the input
elements.

**Parameters:**
- t

- the requested

HTML.Tag

**Returns:**
- the

Iterator

for the given HTML tag

**See Also:**
- HTML.Tag

---

#### protected
Element
createLeafElement​(
Element
parent,

AttributeSet
a,
int p0,
int p1)

Creates a document leaf element that directly represents
text (doesn't have any children). This is implemented
to return an element of type

HTMLDocument.RunElement

.

**Overrides:**
- createLeafElement

in class

AbstractDocument

**Parameters:**
- parent

- the parent element
- a

- the attributes for the element
- p0

- the beginning of the range (must be at least 0)
- p1

- the end of the range (must be at least p0)

**Returns:**
- the new element

---

#### protected
Element
createBranchElement​(
Element
parent,

AttributeSet
a)

Creates a document branch element, that can contain other elements.
This is implemented to return an element of type

HTMLDocument.BlockElement

.

**Overrides:**
- createBranchElement

in class

AbstractDocument

**Parameters:**
- parent

- the parent element
- a

- the attributes

**Returns:**
- the element

---

#### protected
AbstractDocument.AbstractElement
createDefaultRoot()

---

#### public void setTokenThreshold​(int n)

Sets the number of tokens to buffer before trying to update
the documents element structure.

**Parameters:**
- n

- the number of tokens to buffer

---

#### public int getTokenThreshold()

Gets the number of tokens to buffer before trying to update
the documents element structure. The default value is

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

**Returns:**
- the number of tokens to buffer

---

#### public void setPreservesUnknownTags​(boolean preservesTags)

Determines how unknown tags are handled by the parser.
If set to true, unknown
tags are put in the model, otherwise they are dropped.

**Parameters:**
- preservesTags

- true if unknown tags should be
saved in the model, otherwise tags are dropped

**See Also:**
- HTML.Tag

---

#### public boolean getPreservesUnknownTags()

Returns the behavior the parser observes when encountering
unknown tags.

**Returns:**
- true if unknown tags are to be preserved when parsing

**See Also:**
- HTML.Tag

---

#### public void processHTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent​(
HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent
e)

Processes

HyperlinkEvents

that
are generated by documents in an HTML frame.
The

HyperlinkEvent

type, as the parameter suggests,
is

HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent

.
In addition to the typical information contained in a

HyperlinkEvent

,
this event contains the element that corresponds to the frame in
which the click happened (the source element) and the
target name. The target name has 4 possible values:

- _self

_parent

_top

a named frame

If target is _self, the action is to change the value of the

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute and fires a

ChangedUpdate

event.

If the target is _parent, then it deletes the parent element,
which is a <FRAMESET> element, and inserts a new <FRAME>
element, and sets its

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute
to have a value equal to the destination URL and fire a

RemovedUpdate

and

InsertUpdate

.

If the target is _top, this method does nothing. In the implementation
of the view for a frame, namely the

FrameView

,
the processing of _top is handled. Given that _top implies
replacing the entire document, it made sense to handle this outside
of the document that it will replace.

If the target is a named frame, then the element hierarchy is searched
for an element with a name equal to the target, its

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute is updated and a

ChangedUpdate

event is fired.

**Parameters:**
- e

- the event

---

#### public void setParser​(
HTMLEditorKit.Parser
parser)

Sets the parser that is used by the methods that insert html
into the existing document, such as

setInnerHTML

,
and

setOuterHTML

.

HTMLEditorKit.createDefaultDocument

will set the parser
for you. If you create an

HTMLDocument

by hand,
be sure and set the parser accordingly.

**Parameters:**
- parser

- the parser to be used for text insertion

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public
HTMLEditorKit.Parser
getParser()

Returns the parser that is used when inserting HTML into the existing
document.

**Returns:**
- the parser used for text insertion

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public void setInnerHTML​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException

Replaces the children of the given element with the contents
specified as an HTML string.

This will be seen as at least two events, n inserts followed by
a remove.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

setInnerHTML(elem, "<ul><li>")

results in the following structure (new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

\

<ul>

\

<li>
```

Parameter

elem

must not be a leaf element,
otherwise an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.
If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter
is

null

, no changes are made to the document.

For this to work correctly, the document must have an

HTMLEditorKit.Parser

set. This will be the case
if the document was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the

createDefaultDocument

method.

**Parameters:**
- elem

- the branch element whose children will be replaced
- htmlText

- the string to be parsed and assigned to

elem

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

elem

is a leaf
- IllegalStateException

- if an

HTMLEditorKit.Parser

has not been defined
- BadLocationException

- if replacement is impossible because of
a structural issue
- IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public void setOuterHTML​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException

Replaces the given element in the parent with the contents
specified as an HTML string.

This will be seen as at least two events, n inserts followed by
a remove.

When replacing a leaf this will attempt to make sure there is
a newline present if one is needed. This may result in an additional
element being inserted. Consider, if you were to replace a character
element that contained a newline with <img> this would create
two elements, one for the image, and one for the newline.

If you try to replace the element at length you will most
likely end up with two elements, eg

setOuterHTML(getCharacterElement (getLength()),
"blah")

will result in two leaf elements at the end, one
representing 'blah', and the other representing the end
element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

setOuterHTML(elem, "<ul><li>")

results in the following structure (new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<ul>

\

<li>
```

If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter is

null

, no changes are made to the
document.

For this to work correctly, the document must have an
HTMLEditorKit.Parser set. This will be the case if the document
was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the

createDefaultDocument

method.

**Parameters:**
- elem

- the element to replace
- htmlText

- the string to be parsed and inserted in place of

elem

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if an HTMLEditorKit.Parser has not
been set
- BadLocationException

- if replacement is impossible because of
a structural issue
- IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public void insertAfterStart​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException

Inserts the HTML specified as a string at the start
of the element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

insertAfterStart(elem,
"<ul><li>")

results in the following structure
(new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ | \

<ul>
<p> <p>
/

<li>
```

Unlike the

insertBeforeStart

method, new
elements become

children

of the specified element,
not siblings.

Parameter

elem

must not be a leaf element,
otherwise an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.
If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter
is

null

, no changes are made to the document.

- htmlText

- the string to be parsed and assigned to

elem

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

elem

is a leaf
- IllegalStateException

- if an HTMLEditorKit.Parser has not
been set on the document
- BadLocationException

- if insertion is impossible because of
a structural issue

---

#### public void insertBeforeEnd​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException

Inserts the HTML specified as a string at the end of
the element.

If

elem

's children are leaves, and the
character at a

elem.getEndOffset() - 1

is a newline,
this will insert before the newline so that there isn't text after
the newline.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

insertBeforeEnd(elem, "<ul><li>")

results in the following structure (new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ | \
<p> <p>
<ul>

\

<li>
```

Unlike the

insertAfterEnd

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

,

Document

,

StyledDocument

```java
public class
HTMLDocument

extends
DefaultStyledDocument
```

A document that models HTML. The purpose of this model is to
support both browsing and editing. As a result, the structure
described by an HTML document is not exactly replicated by default.
The element structure that is modeled by default, is built by the
class

HTMLDocument.HTMLReader

, which implements the

HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback

protocol that the parser
expects. To change the structure one can subclass

HTMLReader

, and reimplement the method

getReader(int)

to return the new reader implementation. The
documentation for

HTMLReader

should be consulted for
the details of the default structure created. The intent is that
the document be non-lossy (although reproducing the HTML format may
result in a different format).

The document models only HTML, and makes no attempt to store
view attributes in it. The elements are identified by the

StyleContext.NameAttribute

attribute, which should
always have a value of type

HTML.Tag

that identifies
the kind of element. Some of the elements (such as comments) are
synthesized. The

HTMLFactory

uses this attribute to
determine what kind of view to build.

This document supports incremental loading. The

TokenThreshold

property controls how much of the parse
is buffered before trying to update the element structure of the
document. This property is set by the

EditorKit

so
that subclasses can disable it.

The

Base

property determines the URL against which
relative URLs are resolved. By default, this will be the

Document.StreamDescriptionProperty

if the value of the
property is a URL. If a <BASE> tag is encountered, the base
will become the URL specified by that tag. Because the base URL is
a property, it can of course be set directly.

The default content storage mechanism for this document is a gap
buffer (

GapContent

). Alternatives can be supplied by
using the constructor that takes a

Content

implementation.

Modifying HTMLDocument

In addition to the methods provided by Document and
StyledDocument for mutating an HTMLDocument, HTMLDocument provides
a number of convenience methods. The following methods can be used
to insert HTML content into an existing document.

- setInnerHTML(Element, String)
- setOuterHTML(Element, String)
- insertBeforeStart(Element, String)
- insertAfterStart(Element, String)
- insertBeforeEnd(Element, String)
- insertAfterEnd(Element, String)

The following examples illustrate using these methods. Each
example assumes the HTML document is initialized in the following
way:

```java
JEditorPane p = new JEditorPane();
p.setContentType("text/html");
p.setText("..."); // Document text is provided below.
HTMLDocument d = (HTMLDocument) p.getDocument();
```

With the following HTML content:

```java
<html>
<head>
<title>An example HTMLDocument</title>
<style type="text/css">
div { background-color: silver; }
ul { color: blue; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="BOX">
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

All the methods for modifying an HTML document require an

Element

. Elements can be obtained from an HTML document by using
the method

getElement(Element e, Object attribute, Object
value)

. It returns the first descendant element that contains the
specified attribute with the given value, in depth-first order.
For example,

d.getElement(d.getDefaultRootElement(),
StyleConstants.NameAttribute, HTML.Tag.P)

returns the first
paragraph element.

A convenient shortcut for locating elements is the method

getElement(String)

; returns an element whose

ID

attribute matches the specified value. For example,

d.getElement("BOX")

returns the

DIV

element.

The

getIterator(HTML.Tag t)

method can also be used for
finding all occurrences of the specified HTML tag in the
document.

Inserting elements

Elements can be inserted before or after the existing children
of any non-leaf element by using the methods

insertAfterStart

and

insertBeforeEnd

.
For example, if

e

is the

DIV

element,

d.insertAfterStart(e, "<ul><li>List
Item</li></ul>")

inserts the list before the first
paragraph, and

d.insertBeforeEnd(e, "<ul><li>List
Item</li></ul>")

inserts the list after the last
paragraph. The

DIV

block becomes the parent of the
newly inserted elements.

Sibling elements can be inserted before or after any element by
using the methods

insertBeforeStart

and

insertAfterEnd

. For example, if

e

is the

DIV

element,

d.insertBeforeStart(e,
"<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>")

inserts the list
before the

DIV

element, and

d.insertAfterEnd(e,
"<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>")

inserts the list
after the

DIV

element. The newly inserted elements
become siblings of the

DIV

element.

Replacing elements

Elements and all their descendants can be replaced by using the
methods

setInnerHTML

and

setOuterHTML

.
For example, if

e

is the

DIV

element,

d.setInnerHTML(e, "<ul><li>List
Item</li></ul>")

replaces all children paragraphs with
the list, and

d.setOuterHTML(e, "<ul><li>List
Item</li></ul>")

replaces the

DIV

element
itself. In latter case the parent of the list is the

BODY

element.

. This is a convenience
method for the constructor

HTMLDocument(Content, StyleSheet)

.

- HTMLDocument

```java
public HTMLDocument​(
StyleSheet
styles)
```

Constructs an HTML document with the default content
storage implementation and the specified style/attribute
storage mechanism. This is a convenience method for the
constructor

HTMLDocument(Content, StyleSheet)

.

**Parameters:** styles

- the styles

- HTMLDocument

```java
public HTMLDocument​(
AbstractDocument.Content
c,

StyleSheet
styles)
```

Constructs an HTML document with the given content
storage implementation and the given style/attribute
storage mechanism.

**Parameters:** c

- the container for the content
**Parameters:** styles

- the styles

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getReader

```java
public
HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback
getReader​(int pos)
```

Fetches the reader for the parser to use when loading the document
with HTML. This is implemented to return an instance of

HTMLDocument.HTMLReader

.
Subclasses can reimplement this
method to change how the document gets structured if desired.
(For example, to handle custom tags, or structurally represent character
style elements.)

**Parameters:** pos

- the starting position
**Returns:** the reader used by the parser to load the document

- getReader

```java
public
HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback
getReader​(int pos,
int popDepth,
int pushDepth,

HTML.Tag
insertTag)
```

Returns the reader for the parser to use to load the document
with HTML. This is implemented to return an instance of

HTMLDocument.HTMLReader

.
Subclasses can reimplement this
method to change how the document gets structured if desired.
(For example, to handle custom tags, or structurally represent character
style elements.)

This is a convenience method for

getReader(int, int, int, HTML.Tag, TRUE)

.

**Parameters:** pos

- the starting position
**Parameters:** popDepth

- the number of

ElementSpec.EndTagTypes

to generate before inserting
**Parameters:** pushDepth

- the number of

ElementSpec.StartTagTypes

with a direction of

ElementSpec.JoinNextDirection

that should be generated before inserting,
but after the end tags have been generated
**Parameters:** insertTag

- the first tag to start inserting into document
**Returns:** the reader used by the parser to load the document

- getBase

```java
public
URL
getBase()
```

Returns the location to resolve relative URLs against. By
default this will be the document's URL if the document
was loaded from a URL. If a base tag is found and
can be parsed, it will be used as the base location.

**Returns:** the base location

- setBase

```java
public void setBase​(
URL
u)
```

Sets the location to resolve relative URLs against. By
default this will be the document's URL if the document
was loaded from a URL. If a base tag is found and
can be parsed, it will be used as the base location.

This also sets the base of the

StyleSheet

to be

u

as well as the base of the document.

**Parameters:** u

- the desired base URL

- insert

```java
protected void insert​(int offset,

DefaultStyledDocument.ElementSpec
[] data)
throws
BadLocationException
```

Inserts new elements in bulk. This is how elements get created
in the document. The parsing determines what structure is needed
and creates the specification as a set of tokens that describe the
edit while leaving the document free of a write-lock. This method
can then be called in bursts by the reader to acquire a write-lock
for a shorter duration (i.e. while the document is actually being
altered).

**Overrides:** insert

in class

DefaultStyledDocument
**Parameters:** offset

- the starting offset
**Parameters:** data

- the element data
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- if the given position does not
represent a valid location in the associated document.

- insertUpdate

```java
protected void insertUpdate​(
AbstractDocument.DefaultDocumentEvent
chng,

AttributeSet
attr)
```

Updates document structure as a result of text insertion. This
will happen within a write lock. This implementation simply
parses the inserted content for line breaks and builds up a set
of instructions for the element buffer.

**Overrides:** insertUpdate

in class

DefaultStyledDocument
**Parameters:** chng

- a description of the document change
**Parameters:** attr

- the attributes

- create

```java
protected void create​(
DefaultStyledDocument.ElementSpec
[] data)
```

Replaces the contents of the document with the given
element specifications. This is called before insert if
the loading is done in bursts. This is the only method called
if loading the document entirely in one burst.

**Overrides:** create

in class

DefaultStyledDocument
**Parameters:** data

- the new contents of the document

- setParagraphAttributes

```java
public void setParagraphAttributes​(int offset,
int length,

AttributeSet
s,
boolean replace)
```

Sets attributes for a paragraph.

This method is thread safe, although most Swing methods
are not. Please see

Concurrency
in Swing

for more information.

**Specified by:** setParagraphAttributes

in interface

StyledDocument
**Overrides:** setParagraphAttributes

in class

DefaultStyledDocument
**Parameters:** offset

- the offset into the paragraph (must be at least 0)
**Parameters:** length

- the number of characters affected (must be at least 0)
**Parameters:** s

- the attributes
**Parameters:** replace

- whether to replace existing attributes, or merge them

- getStyleSheet

```java
public
StyleSheet
getStyleSheet()
```

Fetches the

StyleSheet

with the document-specific display
rules (CSS) that were specified in the HTML document itself.

**Returns:** the

StyleSheet

- getIterator

```java
public
HTMLDocument.Iterator
getIterator​(
HTML.Tag
t)
```

Fetches an iterator for the specified HTML tag.
This can be used for things like iterating over the
set of anchors contained, or iterating over the input
elements.

**Parameters:** t

- the requested

HTML.Tag
**Returns:** the

Iterator

for the given HTML tag
**See Also:** HTML.Tag

- createLeafElement

```java
protected
Element
createLeafElement​(
Element
parent,

AttributeSet
a,
int p0,
int p1)
```

Creates a document leaf element that directly represents
text (doesn't have any children). This is implemented
to return an element of type

HTMLDocument.RunElement

.

**Overrides:** createLeafElement

in class

AbstractDocument
**Parameters:** parent

- the parent element
**Parameters:** a

- the attributes for the element
**Parameters:** p0

- the beginning of the range (must be at least 0)
**Parameters:** p1

- the end of the range (must be at least p0)
**Returns:** the new element

- createBranchElement

```java
protected
Element
createBranchElement​(
Element
parent,

AttributeSet
a)
```

Creates a document branch element, that can contain other elements.
This is implemented to return an element of type

HTMLDocument.BlockElement

.

**Overrides:** createBranchElement

in class

AbstractDocument
**Parameters:** parent

- the parent element
**Parameters:** a

- the attributes
**Returns:** the element

- createDefaultRoot

```java
protected
AbstractDocument.AbstractElement
createDefaultRoot()
```

Creates the root element to be used to represent the
default document structure.

**Overrides:** createDefaultRoot

in class

DefaultStyledDocument
**Returns:** the element base

- setTokenThreshold

```java
public void setTokenThreshold​(int n)
```

Sets the number of tokens to buffer before trying to update
the documents element structure.

**Parameters:** n

- the number of tokens to buffer

- getTokenThreshold

```java
public int getTokenThreshold()
```

Gets the number of tokens to buffer before trying to update
the documents element structure. The default value is

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

**Returns:** the number of tokens to buffer

- setPreservesUnknownTags

```java
public void setPreservesUnknownTags​(boolean preservesTags)
```

Determines how unknown tags are handled by the parser.
If set to true, unknown
tags are put in the model, otherwise they are dropped.

**Parameters:** preservesTags

- true if unknown tags should be
saved in the model, otherwise tags are dropped
**See Also:** HTML.Tag

- getPreservesUnknownTags

```java
public boolean getPreservesUnknownTags()
```

Returns the behavior the parser observes when encountering
unknown tags.

**Returns:** true if unknown tags are to be preserved when parsing
**See Also:** HTML.Tag

- processHTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent

```java
public void processHTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent​(
HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent
e)
```

Processes

HyperlinkEvents

that
are generated by documents in an HTML frame.
The

HyperlinkEvent

type, as the parameter suggests,
is

HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent

.
In addition to the typical information contained in a

HyperlinkEvent

,
this event contains the element that corresponds to the frame in
which the click happened (the source element) and the
target name. The target name has 4 possible values:

- _self

_parent

_top

a named frame

If target is _self, the action is to change the value of the

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute and fires a

ChangedUpdate

event.

If the target is _parent, then it deletes the parent element,
which is a <FRAMESET> element, and inserts a new <FRAME>
element, and sets its

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute
to have a value equal to the destination URL and fire a

RemovedUpdate

and

InsertUpdate

.

If the target is _top, this method does nothing. In the implementation
of the view for a frame, namely the

FrameView

,
the processing of _top is handled. Given that _top implies
replacing the entire document, it made sense to handle this outside
of the document that it will replace.

If the target is a named frame, then the element hierarchy is searched
for an element with a name equal to the target, its

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute is updated and a

ChangedUpdate

event is fired.

**Parameters:** e

- the event

- setParser

```java
public void setParser​(
HTMLEditorKit.Parser
parser)
```

Sets the parser that is used by the methods that insert html
into the existing document, such as

setInnerHTML

,
and

setOuterHTML

.

HTMLEditorKit.createDefaultDocument

will set the parser
for you. If you create an

HTMLDocument

by hand,
be sure and set the parser accordingly.

**Parameters:** parser

- the parser to be used for text insertion
**Since:** 1.3

- getParser

```java
public
HTMLEditorKit.Parser
getParser()
```

Returns the parser that is used when inserting HTML into the existing
document.

**Returns:** the parser used for text insertion
**Since:** 1.3

- setInnerHTML

```java
public void setInnerHTML​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException
```

Replaces the children of the given element with the contents
specified as an HTML string.

This will be seen as at least two events, n inserts followed by
a remove.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

setInnerHTML(elem, "<ul><li>")

results in the following structure (new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

\

<ul>

\

<li>
```

Parameter

elem

must not be a leaf element,
otherwise an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.
If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter
is

null

, no changes are made to the document.

For this to work correctly, the document must have an

HTMLEditorKit.Parser

set. This will be the case
if the document was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the

createDefaultDocument

method.

**Parameters:** elem

- the branch element whose children will be replaced
**Parameters:** htmlText

- the string to be parsed and assigned to

elem
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

elem

is a leaf
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an

HTMLEditorKit.Parser

has not been defined
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- if replacement is impossible because of
a structural issue
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs
**Since:** 1.3

- setOuterHTML

```java
public void setOuterHTML​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException
```

Replaces the given element in the parent with the contents
specified as an HTML string.

This will be seen as at least two events, n inserts followed by
a remove.

When replacing a leaf this will attempt to make sure there is
a newline present if one is needed. This may result in an additional
element being inserted. Consider, if you were to replace a character
element that contained a newline with <img> this would create
two elements, one for the image, and one for the newline.

If you try to replace the element at length you will most
likely end up with two elements, eg

setOuterHTML(getCharacterElement (getLength()),
"blah")

will result in two leaf elements at the end, one
representing 'blah', and the other representing the end
element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

setOuterHTML(elem, "<ul><li>")

results in the following structure (new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<ul>

\

<li>
```

If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter is

null

, no changes are made to the
document.

For this to work correctly, the document must have an
HTMLEditorKit.Parser set. This will be the case if the document
was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the

createDefaultDocument

method.

**Parameters:** elem

- the element to replace
**Parameters:** htmlText

- the string to be parsed and inserted in place of

- insertAfterStart

```java
public void insertAfterStart​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException
```

Inserts the HTML specified as a string at the start
of the element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

insertAfterStart(elem,
"<ul><li>")

results in the following structure
(new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ | \

<ul>
<p> <p>
/

<li>
```

Unlike the

insertBeforeStart

method, new
elements become

children

of the specified element,
not siblings.

Parameter

elem

must not be a leaf element,
otherwise an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.
If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter
is

null

, no changes are made to the document.

For this to work correctly, the document must have an

HTMLEditorKit.Parser

set. This will be the case
if the document was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the

createDefaultDocument

method.

**Parameters:** elem

- the branch element to be the root for the new text
**Parameters:** htmlText

- the string to be parsed and assigned to

elem
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

elem

is a leaf
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an HTMLEditorKit.Parser has not
been set on the document

,

IOException
```

Inserts the HTML specified as a string at the end of
the element.

If

elem

's children are leaves, and the
character at a

elem.getEndOffset() - 1

is a newline,
this will insert before the newline so that there isn't text after
the newline.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

insertBeforeEnd(elem, "<ul><li>")

results in the following structure (new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ | \
<p> <p>

```

Inserts the HTML specified as a string before the start of
the given element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

insertBeforeStart(elem,

results in the following structure
(new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
/ \

<ul>

<div>

/ / \

<li>
<p> <p>
```

Unlike the

Method Detail

- getReader

```java
public
HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback
getReader​(int pos)
```

Fetches the reader for the parser to use when loading the document
with HTML. This is implemented to return an instance of

HTMLDocument.HTMLReader

.
Subclasses can reimplement this
method to change how the document gets structured if desired.
(For example, to handle custom tags, or structurally represent character
style elements.)

**Parameters:** pos

- the starting position
**Returns:** the reader used by the parser to load the document

- getReader

```java
public
HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback
getReader​(int pos,
int popDepth,
int pushDepth,

HTML.Tag
insertTag)
```

Returns the reader for the parser to use to load the document
with HTML. This is implemented to return an instance of

HTMLDocument.HTMLReader

.
Subclasses can reimplement this
method to change how the document gets structured if desired.
(For example, to handle custom tags, or structurally represent character
style elements.)

This is a convenience method for

getReader(int, int, int, HTML.Tag, TRUE)

.

**Parameters:** pos

- the starting position
**Parameters:** popDepth

- the number of

ElementSpec.EndTagTypes

to generate before inserting
**Parameters:** pushDepth

- the number of

ElementSpec.StartTagTypes

with a direction of

ElementSpec.JoinNextDirection

that should be generated before inserting,
but after the end tags have been generated
**Parameters:** insertTag

- the first tag to start inserting into document
**Returns:** the reader used by the parser to load the document

- getBase

```java
public
URL
getBase()
```

Returns the location to resolve relative URLs against. By
default this will be the document's URL if the document
was loaded from a URL. If a base tag is found and
can be parsed, it will be used as the base location.

**Returns:** the base location

- setBase

```java
public void setBase​(
URL
u)
```

Sets the location to resolve relative URLs against. By
default this will be the document's URL if the document
was loaded from a URL. If a base tag is found and
can be parsed, it will be used as the base location.

This also sets the base of the

StyleSheet

to be

u

as well as the base of the document.

**Parameters:** u

- the desired base URL

- insert

```java
protected void insert​(int offset,

DefaultStyledDocument.ElementSpec
[] data)
throws
BadLocationException
```

Inserts new elements in bulk. This is how elements get created
in the document. The parsing determines what structure is needed
and creates the specification as a set of tokens that describe the
edit while leaving the document free of a write-lock. This method
can then be called in bursts by the reader to acquire a write-lock
for a shorter duration (i.e. while the document is actually being
altered).

**Overrides:** insert

in class

DefaultStyledDocument
**Parameters:** offset

- the starting offset
**Parameters:** data

- the element data
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- if the given position does not
represent a valid location in the associated document.

- insertUpdate

```java
protected void insertUpdate​(
AbstractDocument.DefaultDocumentEvent
chng,

AttributeSet
attr)
```

Updates document structure as a result of text insertion. This
will happen within a write lock. This implementation simply
parses the inserted content for line breaks and builds up a set
of instructions for the element buffer.

**Overrides:** insertUpdate

in class

DefaultStyledDocument
**Parameters:** chng

- a description of the document change
**Parameters:** attr

- the attributes

- create

```java
protected void create​(
DefaultStyledDocument.ElementSpec
[] data)
```

Replaces the contents of the document with the given
element specifications. This is called before insert if
the loading is done in bursts. This is the only method called
if loading the document entirely in one burst.

**Overrides:** create

in class

DefaultStyledDocument
**Parameters:** data

- the new contents of the document

- setParagraphAttributes

```java
public void setParagraphAttributes​(int offset,
int length,

AttributeSet
s,
boolean replace)
```

Sets attributes for a paragraph.

This method is thread safe, although most Swing methods
are not. Please see

Concurrency
in Swing

for more information.

**Specified by:** setParagraphAttributes

in interface

StyledDocument
**Overrides:** setParagraphAttributes

in class

DefaultStyledDocument
**Parameters:** offset

- the offset into the paragraph (must be at least 0)
**Parameters:** length

- the number of characters affected (must be at least 0)
**Parameters:** s

- the attributes
**Parameters:** replace

- whether to replace existing attributes, or merge them

- getStyleSheet

```java
public
StyleSheet
getStyleSheet()
```

Fetches the

StyleSheet

with the document-specific display
rules (CSS) that were specified in the HTML document itself.

**Returns:** the

StyleSheet

- getIterator

```java
public
HTMLDocument.Iterator
getIterator​(
HTML.Tag
t)
```

set of anchors contained, or iterating over the input
elements.

**Parameters:** t

- the requested

HTML.Tag
**Returns:** the

Iterator

for the given HTML tag
**See Also:** HTML.Tag

- createLeafElement

```java
protected
Element
createLeafElement​(
Element
parent,

AttributeSet
a,
int p0,
int p1)
```

Creates a document leaf element that directly represents
text (doesn't have any children). This is implemented
to return an element of type

HTMLDocument.RunElement

.

**Overrides:** createLeafElement

in class

AbstractDocument
**Parameters:** parent

- the parent element
**Parameters:** a

- the attributes for the element
**Parameters:** p0

- the beginning of the range (must be at least 0)
**Parameters:** p1

**Returns:** the new element

- createBranchElement

```java
protected
Element
createBranchElement​(
Element
parent,

in class

DefaultStyledDocument
**Returns:** the element base

- setTokenThreshold

```java
public void setTokenThreshold​(int n)
```

the documents element structure.

**Parameters:** n

- the number of tokens to buffer

- getTokenThreshold

```java
public int getTokenThreshold()
```

Gets the number of tokens to buffer before trying to update
the documents element structure. The default value is

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

**Returns:** the number of tokens to buffer

- setPreservesUnknownTags

```java
public void setPreservesUnknownTags​(boolean preservesTags)
```

Determines how unknown tags are handled by the parser.
If set to true, unknown
tags are put in the model, otherwise they are dropped.

**Parameters:** preservesTags

- true if unknown tags should be
saved in the model, otherwise tags are dropped
**See Also:** HTML.Tag

- getPreservesUnknownTags

```java
public boolean getPreservesUnknownTags()
```

Returns the behavior the parser observes when encountering
unknown tags.

**Returns:** true if unknown tags are to be preserved when parsing
**See Also:** HTML.Tag

- processHTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent

```java
public void processHTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent​(
HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent
e)
```

Processes

HyperlinkEvents

that
are generated by documents in an HTML frame.
The

HyperlinkEvent

type, as the parameter suggests,
is

HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent

.
In addition to the typical information contained in a

HyperlinkEvent

,
this event contains the element that corresponds to the frame in
which the click happened (the source element) and the
target name. The target name has 4 possible values:

- _self

_parent

_top

a named frame

If target is _self, the action is to change the value of the

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute and fires a

ChangedUpdate

event.

If the target is _parent, then it deletes the parent element,
which is a <FRAMESET> element, and inserts a new <FRAME>
element, and sets its

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute
to have a value equal to the destination URL and fire a

RemovedUpdate

and

InsertUpdate

.

If the target is _top, this method does nothing. In the implementation
of the view for a frame, namely the

FrameView

,
the processing of _top is handled. Given that _top implies
replacing the entire document, it made sense to handle this outside
of the document that it will replace.

If the target is a named frame, then the element hierarchy is searched
for an element with a name equal to the target, its

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute is updated and a

ChangedUpdate

event is fired.

**Parameters:** e

- the event

- setParser

```java
public void setParser​(
HTMLEditorKit.Parser
parser)
```

Sets the parser that is used by the methods that insert html
into the existing document, such as

setInnerHTML

,
and

setOuterHTML

.

HTMLEditorKit.createDefaultDocument

will set the parser
for you. If you create an

HTMLDocument

by hand,
be sure and set the parser accordingly.

**Parameters:** parser

- the parser to be used for text insertion
**Since:** 1.3

- getParser

```java
public
HTMLEditorKit.Parser
getParser()
```

Returns the parser that is used when inserting HTML into the existing
document.

**Returns:** the parser used for text insertion
**Since:** 1.3

- setInnerHTML

```java
public void setInnerHTML​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException
```

Replaces the children of the given element with the contents
specified as an HTML string.

This will be seen as at least two events, n inserts followed by
a remove.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

setInnerHTML(elem, "<ul><li>")

results in the following structure (new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

\

<ul>

\

<li>
```

Parameter

elem

must not be a leaf element,
otherwise an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.
If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter
is

null

, no changes are made to the document.

For this to work correctly, the document must have an

HTMLEditorKit.Parser

set. This will be the case
if the document was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the

createDefaultDocument

method.

**Parameters:** elem

- the branch element whose children will be replaced
**Parameters:** htmlText

- the string to be parsed and assigned to

elem
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

elem

is a leaf
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an

HTMLEditorKit.Parser

has not been defined
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- if replacement is impossible because of
a structural issue
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs
**Since:** 1.3

- setOuterHTML

```java
public void setOuterHTML​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException
```

Replaces the given element in the parent with the contents
specified as an HTML string.

This will be seen as at least two events, n inserts followed by
a remove.

When replacing a leaf this will attempt to make sure there is
a newline present if one is needed. This may result in an additional
element being inserted. Consider, if you were to replace a character
element that contained a newline with <img> this would create
two elements, one for the image, and one for the newline.

If you try to replace the element at length you will most
likely end up with two elements, eg

setOuterHTML(getCharacterElement (getLength()),
"blah")

will result in two leaf elements at the end, one
representing 'blah', and the other representing the end
element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

setOuterHTML(elem, "<ul><li>")

results in the following structure (new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<ul>

\

<li>
```

If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter is

null

, no changes are made to the
document.

For this to work correctly, the document must have an
HTMLEditorKit.Parser set. This will be the case if the document
was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the

createDefaultDocument

method.

**Parameters:** elem

- the element to replace
**Parameters:** htmlText

- the string to be parsed and inserted in place of

elem
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an HTMLEditorKit.Parser has not
been set
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- if replacement is impossible because of
a structural issue
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs
**Since:** 1.3

- insertAfterStart

```java
public void insertAfterStart​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException
```

Inserts the HTML specified as a string at the start
of the element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

insertAfterStart(elem,
"<ul><li>")

results in the following structure
(new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ | \

<ul>
<p> <p>
/

<li>
```

Unlike the

insertBeforeStart

method, new
elements become

children

of the specified element,
not siblings.

Parameter

elem

must not be a leaf element,
otherwise an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.
If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter
is

null

, no changes are made to the document.

For this to work correctly, the document must have an

HTMLEditorKit.Parser

set. This will be the case
if the document was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the

createDefaultDocument

method.

**Parameters:** elem

- the branch element to be the root for the new text
**Parameters:** htmlText

- the string to be parsed and assigned to

elem
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

elem

is a leaf
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an HTMLEditorKit.Parser has not
been set on the document
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- if insertion is impossible because of
a structural issue
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs
**Since:** 1.3

- insertBeforeEnd

```java
public void insertBeforeEnd​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException
```

Inserts the HTML specified as a string at the end of
the element.

If

elem

's children are leaves, and the
character at a

elem.getEndOffset() - 1

is a newline,
this will insert before the newline so that there isn't text after
the newline.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

insertBeforeEnd(elem, "<ul><li>")

results in the following structure (new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ | \
<p> <p>
<ul>

\

<li>
```

Unlike the

insertAfterEnd

method, new elements
become

children

of the specified element, not
siblings.

Parameter

elem

must not be a leaf element,
otherwise an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.
If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter
is

null

, no changes are made to the document.

For this to work correctly, the document must have an

HTMLEditorKit.Parser

**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

elem

is a leaf
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an HTMLEditorKit.Parser has not
been set on the document

- insertBeforeStart

```java
public void insertBeforeStart​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException
```

Inserts the HTML specified as a string before the start of
the given element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

insertBeforeStart(elem,
"<ul><li>")

results in the following structure
(new elements are

in blue

).

```java
<body>
/ \

<ul>

<div>

/ / \

<li>
<p> <p>
```

Unlike the

insertAfterStart

method, new
elements become

siblings

of the specified element, not
children.

If either

elem

or

htmlText

parameter is

null

, no changes are made to the
document.

For this to work correctly, the document must have an

HTMLEditorKit.Parser

set. This will be the case
if the document was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the

createDefaultDocument

method.

**Parameters:** elem

- the element the content is inserted before
**Parameters:** htmlText

- the string to be parsed and inserted before

elem
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if an HTMLEditorKit.Parser has not
been set on the document
**Throws:** BadLocationException

- if insertion is impossible because of
a structural issue
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs
**Since:** 1.3

- insertAfterEnd

```java
public void insertAfterEnd​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException
```

Inserts the HTML specified as a string after the end of the
given element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
```

Invoking

insertAfterEnd(elem, "<ul><li>")

results in the following structure (new elements are

processHTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent

```java
public void processHTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent​(
HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent
e)
```

Processes

HyperlinkEvents

that
are generated by documents in an HTML frame.
The

HyperlinkEvent

type, as the parameter suggests,
is

HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent

.
In addition to the typical information contained in a

HyperlinkEvent

,
this event contains the element that corresponds to the frame in
which the click happened (the source element) and the
target name. The target name has 4 possible values:

- _self

_parent

_top

a named frame

If target is _self, the action is to change the value of the

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute and fires a

ChangedUpdate

event.

If the target is _parent, then it deletes the parent element,
which is a <FRAMESET> element, and inserts a new <FRAME>
element, and sets its

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute
to have a value equal to the destination URL and fire a

RemovedUpdate

and

InsertUpdate

.

If the target is _top, this method does nothing. In the implementation
of the view for a frame, namely the

FrameView

,
the processing of _top is handled. Given that _top implies
replacing the entire document, it made sense to handle this outside
of the document that it will replace.

If the target is a named frame, then the element hierarchy is searched
for an element with a name equal to the target, its

HTML.Attribute.SRC

attribute is updated and a

ChangedUpdate

event is fired.

**Parameters:** e

- the event

setOuterHTML

```java
public void setOuterHTML​(
Element
elem,

String
htmlText)
throws
BadLocationException
,

IOException
```

Replaces the given element in the parent with the contents
specified as an HTML string.

This will be seen as at least two events, n inserts followed by
a remove.

When replacing a leaf this will attempt to make sure there is
a newline present if one is needed. This may result in an additional
element being inserted. Consider, if you were to replace a character
element that contained a newline with <img> this would create
two elements, one for the image, and one for the newline.

If you try to replace the element at length you will most
likely end up with two elements, eg

setOuterHTML(getCharacterElement (getLength()),
"blah")

will result in two leaf elements at the end, one
representing 'blah', and the other representing the end
element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

#### setOuterHTML

public void setOuterHTML​(

Element

elem,

String

htmlText)
throws

BadLocationException

,

IOException

Replaces the given element in the parent with the contents
specified as an HTML string.

This will be seen as at least two events, n inserts followed by
a remove.

When replacing a leaf this will attempt to make sure there is
a newline present if one is needed. This may result in an additional
element being inserted. Consider, if you were to replace a character
element that contained a newline with <img> this would create
two elements, one for the image, and one for the newline.

If you try to replace the element at length you will most
likely end up with two elements, eg

setOuterHTML(getCharacterElement (getLength()),
"blah")

will result in two leaf elements at the end, one
representing 'blah', and the other representing the end
element.

Consider the following structure (the

elem

parameter is

in bold

).

```java
<body>
|

<div>

/ \
<p> <p>
