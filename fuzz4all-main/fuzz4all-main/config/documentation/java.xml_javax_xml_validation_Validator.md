# Class Validator

**Source:** `java.xml\javax\xml\validation\Validator.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Validator

extends
Object
```

A processor that checks an XML document against

Schema

.

A validator object is not thread-safe and not reentrant.
In other words, it is the application's responsibility to make
sure that one

Validator

object is not used from
more than one thread at any given time, and while the

validate

method is invoked, applications may not recursively call
the

validate

method.

**Since:** 1.5

---

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected Validator()

Constructor for derived classes.

The constructor does nothing.

Derived classes must create

Validator

objects that have

null

ErrorHandler

and

null

LSResourceResolver

.

---

### Method Details

#### public abstract void reset()

Reset this

Validator

to its original configuration.

Validator

is reset to the same state as when it was created with

Schema.newValidator()

.

reset()

is designed to allow the reuse of existing

Validator

s
thus saving resources associated with the creation of new

Validator

s.

The reset

Validator

is not guaranteed to have
the same

LSResourceResolver

or

ErrorHandler

Object

s, e.g.

Object.equals(Object obj)

.
It is guaranteed to have a functionally equal

LSResourceResolver

and

ErrorHandler

.

#### public void validate​(
Source
source)
throws
SAXException
,

IOException

Validates the specified input.

This is just a convenience method for

validate(Source source, Result result)

with

result

of

null

.

**Parameters:**
- source

- XML to be validated. Must be an XML document or
XML element and must not be null. For backwards compatibility,
the results of attempting to validate anything other than
a document or element are implementation-dependent.
Implementations must either recognize and process the input
or throw an IllegalArgumentException.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the

Source

is an XML artifact that the implementation cannot
validate (for example, a processing instruction).
- SAXException

- If the

ErrorHandler

throws a

SAXException

or
if a fatal error is found and the

ErrorHandler

returns
normally.
- IOException

- If the validator is processing a

SAXSource

and the
underlying

XMLReader

throws an

IOException

.
- NullPointerException

- If

source

is

null

.

**See Also:**
- validate(Source source, Result result)

---

#### public abstract void validate​(
Source
source,

Result
result)
throws
SAXException
,

IOException

Validates the specified input and send the augmented validation
result to the specified output.

This method places the following restrictions on the types of
the

Source

/

Result

accepted.

To validate one

Source

into another kind of

Result

, use the identity transformer (see

TransformerFactory.newTransformer()

).

Errors found during the validation is sent to the specified

ErrorHandler

.

If a document is valid, or if a document contains some errors
but none of them were fatal and the

ErrorHandler

didn't
throw any exception, then the method returns normally.

**Parameters:**
- source

- XML to be validated. Must be an XML document or
XML element and must not be null. For backwards compatibility,
the results of attempting to validate anything other than
a document or element are implementation-dependent.
Implementations must either recognize and process the input
or throw an IllegalArgumentException.
- result

- The

Result

object that receives (possibly augmented)
XML. This parameter can be null if the caller is not interested
in it.

Note that when a

DOMResult

is used,
a validator might just pass the same DOM node from

DOMSource

to

DOMResult

(in which case

source.getNode()==result.getNode()

),
it might copy the entire DOM tree, or it might alter the
node given by the source.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the

Result

type doesn't match the

Source

type of if the

Source

is an XML artifact that the implementation cannot
validate (for example, a processing instruction).
- SAXException

- If the

ErrorHandler

throws a

SAXException

or
if a fatal error is found and the

ErrorHandler

returns
normally.
- IOException

- If the validator is processing a

SAXSource

and the
underlying

XMLReader

throws an

IOException

.
- NullPointerException

- If the

source

parameter is

null

.

**See Also:**
- validate(Source source)

---

#### public abstract void setErrorHandler​(
ErrorHandler
errorHandler)

Sets the

ErrorHandler

to receive errors encountered
during the

validate

method invocation.

Error handler can be used to customize the error handling process
during a validation. When an

ErrorHandler

is set,
errors found during the validation will be first sent
to the

ErrorHandler

.

The error handler can abort further validation immediately
by throwing

SAXException

from the handler. Or for example
it can print an error to the screen and try to continue the
validation by returning normally from the

ErrorHandler

If any

Throwable

is thrown from an

ErrorHandler

,
the caller of the

validate

method will be thrown
the same

Throwable

object.

Validator

is not allowed to
throw

SAXException

without first reporting it to

ErrorHandler

.

When the

ErrorHandler

is null, the implementation will
behave as if the following

ErrorHandler

is set:

```java
class DraconianErrorHandler implements
ErrorHandler
{
public void fatalError(
SAXParseException
e ) throws
SAXException
{
throw e;
}
public void error(
SAXParseException
e ) throws
SAXException
{
throw e;
}
public void warning(
SAXParseException
e ) throws
SAXException
{
// noop
}
}
```

When a new

Validator

object is created, initially
this field is set to null.

**Parameters:**
- errorHandler

- A new error handler to be set. This parameter can be null.

---

#### public abstract
ErrorHandler
getErrorHandler()

Gets the current

ErrorHandler

set to this

Validator

.

**Returns:**
- This method returns the object that was last set through
the

setErrorHandler(ErrorHandler)

method, or null
if that method has never been called since this

Validator

has created.

**See Also:**
- setErrorHandler(ErrorHandler)

---

#### public abstract void setResourceResolver​(
LSResourceResolver
resourceResolver)

Sets the

LSResourceResolver

to customize
resource resolution while in a validation episode.

Validator

uses a

LSResourceResolver

when it needs to locate external resources while a validation,
although exactly what constitutes "locating external resources" is
up to each schema language.

When the

LSResourceResolver

is null, the implementation will
behave as if the following

LSResourceResolver

is set:

```java
class DumbLSResourceResolver implements
LSResourceResolver
{
public
LSInput
resolveResource(
String publicId, String systemId, String baseURI) {

return null; // always return null
}
}
```

If a

LSResourceResolver

throws a

RuntimeException

(or instances of its derived classes),
then the

Validator

will abort the parsing and
the caller of the

validate

method will receive
the same

RuntimeException

.

When a new

Validator

object is created, initially
this field is set to null.

**Parameters:**
- resourceResolver

- A new resource resolver to be set. This parameter can be null.

---

#### public abstract
LSResourceResolver
getResourceResolver()

Gets the current

LSResourceResolver

set to this

Validator

.

**Returns:**
- This method returns the object that was last set through
the

setResourceResolver(LSResourceResolver)

method, or null
if that method has never been called since this

Validator

has created.

**See Also:**
- setErrorHandler(ErrorHandler)

---

#### public boolean getFeature​(
String
name)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException

Look up the value of a feature flag.

The feature name is any fully-qualified URI. It is
possible for a

Validator

to recognize a feature name but
temporarily be unable to return its value.
Some feature values may be available only in specific
contexts, such as before, during, or after a validation.

Implementors are free (and encouraged) to invent their own features,
using names built on their own URIs.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The feature name, which is a non-null fully-qualified URI.

**Returns:**
- The current value of the feature (true or false).

**Throws:**
- SAXNotRecognizedException

- If the feature
value can't be assigned or retrieved.
- SAXNotSupportedException

- When the

Validator

recognizes the feature name but
cannot determine its value at this time.
- NullPointerException

- When the name parameter is null.

**See Also:**
- setFeature(String, boolean)

---

#### public void setFeature​(
String
name,
boolean value)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException

Set the value of a feature flag.

Feature can be used to control the way a

Validator

parses schemas, although

Validator

s are not required
to recognize any specific feature names.

The feature name is any fully-qualified URI. It is
possible for a

Validator

to expose a feature value but
to be unable to change the current value.
Some feature values may be immutable or mutable only
in specific contexts, such as before, during, or after
a validation.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The feature name, which is a non-null fully-qualified URI.
- value

- The requested value of the feature (true or false).

**Throws:**
- SAXNotRecognizedException

- If the feature
value can't be assigned or retrieved.
- SAXNotSupportedException

- When the

Validator

recognizes the feature name but
cannot set the requested value.
- NullPointerException

- When the name parameter is null.

**See Also:**
- getFeature(String)

---

#### public void setProperty​(
String
name,

Object
object)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException

Set the value of a property.

The property name is any fully-qualified URI. It is
possible for a

Validator

to recognize a property name but
to be unable to change the current value.
Some property values may be immutable or mutable only
in specific contexts, such as before, during, or after
a validation.

All implementations that implement JAXP 1.5 or newer are required to
support the

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD

and

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA

properties.

- Access to external DTDs in source or Schema file is restricted to
the protocols specified by the

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD

property. If access is denied during validation due to the restriction
of this property,

SAXException

will be thrown by the

validate(Source)

method.

Access to external reference set by the schemaLocation attribute is
restricted to the protocols specified by the

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA

property.
If access is denied during validation due to the restriction of this property,

SAXException

will be thrown by the

validate(Source)

method.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The property name, which is a non-null fully-qualified URI.
- object

- The requested value for the property.

**Throws:**
- SAXNotRecognizedException

- If the property
value can't be assigned or retrieved.
- SAXNotSupportedException

- When the

Validator

recognizes the property name but
cannot set the requested value.
- NullPointerException

- When the name parameter is null.

---

#### public
Object
getProperty​(
String
name)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException

Look up the value of a property.

The property name is any fully-qualified URI. It is
possible for a

Validator

to recognize a property name but
temporarily be unable to return its value.
Some property values may be available only in specific
contexts, such as before, during, or after a validation.

Validator

s are not required to recognize any specific
property names.

Implementors are free (and encouraged) to invent their own properties,
using names built on their own URIs.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The property name, which is a non-null fully-qualified URI.

**Returns:**
- The current value of the property.

**Throws:**
- SAXNotRecognizedException

- If the property
value can't be assigned or retrieved.
- SAXNotSupportedException

- When the
XMLReader recognizes the property name but
cannot determine its value at this time.
- NullPointerException

- When the name parameter is null.

```java
public void setProperty​(
String
name,

Object
object)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Set the value of a property.

The property name is any fully-qualified URI. It is
possible for a

Validator

to recognize a property name but
to be unable to change the current value.
Some property values may be immutable or mutable only
in specific contexts, such as before, during, or after
a validation.

All implementations that implement JAXP 1.5 or newer are required to
support the

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD

and

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA

properties.

- Access to external DTDs in source or Schema file is restricted to
the protocols specified by the

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD

property. If access is denied during validation due to the restriction
of this property,

SAXException

will be thrown by the

validate(Source)

method.

Access to external reference set by the schemaLocation attribute is
restricted to the protocols specified by the

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA

property.
If access is denied during validation due to the restriction of this property,

SAXException

will be thrown by the

validate(Source)

method.

**Parameters:** name

- The property name, which is a non-null fully-qualified URI.
**Parameters:** object

- The requested value for the property.
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- If the property
value can't be assigned or retrieved.
**Throws:** SAXNotSupportedException

- When the

Validator

recognizes the property name but
cannot set the requested value.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- When the name parameter is null.

- getProperty

```java
public
Object
getProperty​(
String
name)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Look up the value of a property.

The property name is any fully-qualified URI. It is
possible for a

Validator

to recognize a property name but
temporarily be unable to return its value.
Some property values may be available only in specific
contexts, such as before, during, or after a validation.

Validator

s are not required to recognize any specific
property names.

Implementors are free (and encouraged) to invent their own properties,
using names built on their own URIs.

**Parameters:** name

- The property name, which is a non-null fully-qualified URI.
**Returns:** The current value of the property.
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- If the property
value can't be assigned or retrieved.
**Throws:** SAXNotSupportedException

Method Detail

- reset

```java
public abstract void reset()
```

Reset this

Validator

to its original configuration.

Validator

is reset to the same state as when it was created with

Schema.newValidator()

.

reset()

is designed to allow the reuse of existing

Validator

s
thus saving resources associated with the creation of new

Validator

s.

The reset

Validator

is not guaranteed to have
the same

LSResourceResolver

or

ErrorHandler

Object

s, e.g.

Object.equals(Object obj)

.
It is guaranteed to have a functionally equal

LSResourceResolver

and

ErrorHandler

.

- validate

```java
public void validate​(
Source
source)
throws
SAXException
,

IOException
```

Validates the specified input.

This is just a convenience method for

validate(Source source, Result result)

with

result

of

null

.

**Parameters:** source

- XML to be validated. Must be an XML document or
XML element and must not be null. For backwards compatibility,
the results of attempting to validate anything other than
a document or element are implementation-dependent.
Implementations must either recognize and process the input
or throw an IllegalArgumentException.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the

Source

is an XML artifact that the implementation cannot
validate (for example, a processing instruction).
**Throws:** SAXException

- If the

ErrorHandler

throws a

SAXException

or
if a fatal error is found and the

ErrorHandler

returns
normally.
**Throws:** IOException

- If the validator is processing a

SAXSource

and the
underlying

XMLReader

throws an

IOException

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

source

is

null

.
**See Also:** validate(Source source, Result result)

- validate

```java
public abstract void validate​(
Source
source,

Result
result)
throws
SAXException
,

IOException
```

Validates the specified input and send the augmented validation
result to the specified output.

This method places the following restrictions on the types of
the

Source

/

Result

accepted.

Source

To validate one

Source

into another kind of

Result

, use the identity transformer (see

TransformerFactory.newTransformer()

).

Errors found during the validation is sent to the specified

ErrorHandler

.

If a document is valid, or if a document contains some errors
but none of them were fatal and the

ErrorHandler

didn't
throw any exception, then the method returns normally.

**Parameters:** source

- XML to be validated. Must be an XML document or
XML element and must not be null. For backwards compatibility,
the results of attempting to validate anything other than
a document or element are implementation-dependent.
Implementations must either recognize and process the input
or throw an IllegalArgumentException.
**Parameters:** result

- The

Result

object that receives (possibly augmented)
XML. This parameter can be null if the caller is not interested
in it.

Note that when a

DOMResult

is used,
a validator might just pass the same DOM node from

DOMSource

to

DOMResult

(in which case

source.getNode()==result.getNode()

),
it might copy the entire DOM tree, or it might alter the
node given by the source.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the

Result

type doesn't match the

Source

type of if the

Source

is an XML artifact that the implementation cannot
validate (for example, a processing instruction).
**Throws:** SAXException

- If the

ErrorHandler

throws a

SAXException

or
if a fatal error is found and the

ErrorHandler

returns
normally.
**Throws:** IOException

- If the validator is processing a

SAXSource

and the
underlying

XMLReader

throws an

IOException

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If the

source

parameter is

null

.
**See Also:** validate(Source source)

- setErrorHandler

```java
public abstract void setErrorHandler​(
ErrorHandler
errorHandler)
```

Sets the

ErrorHandler

to receive errors encountered
during the

validate

method invocation.

Error handler can be used to customize the error handling process
during a validation. When an

ErrorHandler

is set,
errors found during the validation will be first sent
to the

ErrorHandler

.

The error handler can abort further validation immediately
by throwing

SAXException

from the handler. Or for example
it can print an error to the screen and try to continue the
validation by returning normally from the

ErrorHandler

If any

Throwable

is thrown from an

ErrorHandler

,
the caller of the

validate

method will be thrown
the same

Throwable

object.

Validator

is not allowed to
throw

SAXException

without first reporting it to

ErrorHandler

.

When the

ErrorHandler

is null, the implementation will
behave as if the following

ErrorHandler

is set:

```java
class DraconianErrorHandler implements
ErrorHandler
{
public void fatalError(
SAXParseException
e ) throws
SAXException
{
throw e;
}
public void error(
SAXParseException
e ) throws
SAXException
{
throw e;
}
public void warning(
SAXParseException
e ) throws
SAXException
{
// noop
}
}
```

When a new

Validator

object is created, initially
this field is set to null.

**Parameters:** errorHandler

- A new error handler to be set. This parameter can be null.

- getErrorHandler

```java
public abstract
ErrorHandler
getErrorHandler()
```

Gets the current

ErrorHandler

set to this

Validator

.

**Returns:** This method returns the object that was last set through
the

setErrorHandler(ErrorHandler)

method, or null
if that method has never been called since this

Validator

has created.
**See Also:** setErrorHandler(ErrorHandler)

- setResourceResolver

```java
public abstract void setResourceResolver​(
LSResourceResolver
resourceResolver)
```

Sets the

LSResourceResolver

to customize
resource resolution while in a validation episode.

Validator

uses a

LSResourceResolver

when it needs to locate external resources while a validation,
although exactly what constitutes "locating external resources" is
up to each schema language.

When the

LSResourceResolver

is null, the implementation will
behave as if the following

LSResourceResolver

is set:

```java
class DumbLSResourceResolver implements
LSResourceResolver
{
public
LSInput
resolveResource(
String publicId, String systemId, String baseURI) {

return null; // always return null
}
}
```

If a

LSResourceResolver

throws a

RuntimeException

(or instances of its derived classes),
then the

Validator

will abort the parsing and
the caller of the

validate

method will receive
the same

RuntimeException

.

When a new

Validator

object is created, initially
this field is set to null.

**Parameters:** resourceResolver

- A new resource resolver to be set. This parameter can be null.

- getResourceResolver

```java
public abstract
LSResourceResolver
getResourceResolver()
```

Gets the current

LSResourceResolver

set to this

Validator

.

**Returns:** This method returns the object that was last set through
the

setResourceResolver(LSResourceResolver)

method, or null
if that method has never been called since this

Validator

has created.
**See Also:** setErrorHandler(ErrorHandler)

- getFeature

```java
public boolean getFeature​(
String
name)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Look up the value of a feature flag.

The feature name is any fully-qualified URI. It is
possible for a

Validator

to recognize a feature name but
temporarily be unable to return its value.
Some feature values may be available only in specific
contexts, such as before, during, or after a validation.

Implementors are free (and encouraged) to invent their own features,
using names built on their own URIs.

**Parameters:** name

- The feature name, which is a non-null fully-qualified URI.
**Returns:** The current value of the feature (true or false).
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- If the feature
value can't be assigned or retrieved.
**Throws:** SAXNotSupportedException

- When the

Validator

recognizes the feature name but
cannot determine its value at this time.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- When the name parameter is null.
**See Also:** setFeature(String, boolean)

- setFeature

```java
public void setFeature​(
String
name,
boolean value)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Set the value of a feature flag.

Feature can be used to control the way a

Validator

parses schemas, although

Validator

s are not required
to recognize any specific feature names.

The feature name is any fully-qualified URI. It is
possible for a

Validator

to expose a feature value but
to be unable to change the current value.
Some feature values may be immutable or mutable only
in specific contexts, such as before, during, or after
a validation.

**Parameters:** name

- The feature name, which is a non-null fully-qualified URI.
**Parameters:** value

- The requested value of the feature (true or false).
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- If the feature
value can't be assigned or retrieved.
**Throws:** SAXNotSupportedException

- When the

Validator

recognizes the feature name but
cannot set the requested value.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- When the name parameter is null.
**See Also:** getFeature(String)

- setProperty

```java
public void setProperty​(
String
name,

Object
object)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Set the value of a property.

The property name is any fully-qualified URI. It is
possible for a

Validator

to recognize a property name but
to be unable to change the current value.
Some property values may be immutable or mutable only
in specific contexts, such as before, during, or after
a validation.

All implementations that implement JAXP 1.5 or newer are required to
support the

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD

and

XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA

properties.

- Access to external DTDs in source or Schema file is restricted to

will be thrown by the

validate(Source)

method.

**Parameters:** name

- The property name, which is a non-null fully-qualified URI.
**Parameters:** object

- The requested value for the property.
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- If the property

public
Object
getProperty​(
String
name)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException

setResourceResolver

```java
public abstract void setResourceResolver​(
LSResourceResolver
resourceResolver)
```

Sets the

LSResourceResolver

to customize
resource resolution while in a validation episode.

Validator

uses a

LSResourceResolver

when it needs to locate external resources while a validation,
although exactly what constitutes "locating external resources" is
up to each schema language.

When the

LSResourceResolver

is null, the implementation will
behave as if the following

LSResourceResolver

is set:

```java
class DumbLSResourceResolver implements
LSResourceResolver
{
public
LSInput
resolveResource(

return null; // always return null
}
}
```

If a

LSResourceResolver

throws a

RuntimeException

(or instances of its derived classes),
then the

Validator

will abort the parsing and
the caller of the

validate

method will receive
the same

RuntimeException

.

getFeature

```java
public boolean getFeature​(
String
name)
throws
SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Look up the value of a feature flag.

The feature name is any fully-qualified URI. It is
possible for a

Validator

to recognize a feature name but
temporarily be unable to return its value.
Some feature values may be available only in specific
contexts, such as before, during, or after a validation.

Implementors are free (and encouraged) to invent their own features,
using names built on their own URIs.

**Parameters:** name

- The feature name, which is a non-null fully-qualified URI.
**Returns:** The current value of the feature (true or false).
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- If the feature
value can't be assigned or retrieved.
**Throws:** SAXNotSupportedException

- When the

Validator

recognizes the feature name but
cannot determine its value at this time.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- When the name parameter is null.
