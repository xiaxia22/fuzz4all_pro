# Class KeyPairGenerator

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\KeyPairGenerator.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
KeyPairGenerator

extends
KeyPairGeneratorSpi
```

The KeyPairGenerator class is used to generate pairs of
public and private keys. Key pair generators are constructed using the

getInstance

factory methods (static methods that
return instances of a given class).

A Key pair generator for a particular algorithm creates a public/private
key pair that can be used with this algorithm. It also associates
algorithm-specific parameters with each of the generated keys.

There are two ways to generate a key pair: in an algorithm-independent
manner, and in an algorithm-specific manner.
The only difference between the two is the initialization of the object:

- Algorithm-Independent Initialization

All key pair generators share the concepts of a keysize and a
source of randomness. The keysize is interpreted differently for different
algorithms (e.g., in the case of the

DSA

algorithm, the keysize
corresponds to the length of the modulus).
There is an

initialize

method in this KeyPairGenerator class that takes these two universally
shared types of arguments. There is also one that takes just a

keysize

argument, and uses the

SecureRandom

implementation of the highest-priority installed provider as the source
of randomness. (If none of the installed providers supply an implementation
of

SecureRandom

, a system-provided source of randomness is
used.)

Since no other parameters are specified when you call the above
algorithm-independent

initialize

methods, it is up to the
provider what to do about the algorithm-specific parameters (if any) to be
associated with each of the keys.

If the algorithm is the

DSA

algorithm, and the keysize (modulus
size) is 512, 768, 1024, or 2048, then the

Sun

provider uses a set of
precomputed values for the

p

,

q

, and

g

parameters. If the modulus size is not one of the above
values, the

Sun

provider creates a new set of parameters. Other
providers might have precomputed parameter sets for more than just the
modulus sizes mentioned above. Still others might not have a list of
precomputed parameters at all and instead always create new parameter sets.

Algorithm-Specific Initialization

For situations where a set of algorithm-specific parameters already
exists (e.g., so-called

community parameters

in DSA), there are two

initialize

methods that have an

AlgorithmParameterSpec

argument. One also has a

SecureRandom

argument, while
the other uses the

SecureRandom

implementation of the highest-priority installed provider as the source
of randomness. (If none of the installed providers supply an implementation
of

SecureRandom

, a system-provided source of randomness is
used.)

In case the client does not explicitly initialize the KeyPairGenerator
(via a call to an

initialize

method), each provider must
supply (and document) a default initialization.
See the Keysize Restriction sections of the

JDK Providers

document for information on the KeyPairGenerator defaults used by
JDK providers.
However, note that defaults may vary across different providers.
Additionally, the default value for a provider may change in a future
version. Therefore, it is recommended to explicitly initialize the
KeyPairGenerator instead of relying on provider-specific defaults.

Note that this class is abstract and extends from

KeyPairGeneratorSpi

for historical reasons.
Application developers should only take notice of the methods defined in
this

KeyPairGenerator

class; all the methods in
the superclass are intended for cryptographic service providers who wish to
supply their own implementations of key pair generators.

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard

KeyPairGenerator

algorithms and keysizes in
parentheses:

- DiffieHellman

(1024, 2048, 4096)
- DSA

(1024, 2048)
- RSA

(1024, 2048, 4096)

These algorithms are described in the

KeyPairGenerator section

of the
Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.
Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
other algorithms are supported.

The KeyPairGenerator class is used to generate pairs of

A Key pair generator for a particular algorithm creates a public/private
key pair that can be used with this algorithm. It also associates
algorithm-specific parameters with each of the generated keys.

There are two ways to generate a key pair: in an algorithm-independent

All key pair generators share the concepts of a keysize and a

Since no other parameters are specified when you call the above

If the algorithm is the

, and

g

parameters. If the modulus size is not one of the above
values, the

Sun

provider creates a new set of parameters. Other
providers might have precomputed parameter sets for more than just the
modulus sizes mentioned above. Still others might not have a list of
precomputed parameters at all and instead always create new parameter sets.

Algorithm-Specific Initialization

For situations where a set of algorithm-specific parameters already
exists (e.g., so-called

community parameters

in DSA), there are two

initialize

methods that have an

AlgorithmParameterSpec

argument. One also has a

SecureRandom

argument, while
the other uses the

SecureRandom

implementation of the highest-priority installed provider as the source
of randomness. (If none of the installed providers supply an implementation
of

SecureRandom

, a system-provided source of randomness is
used.)

Since no other parameters are specified when you call the above
algorithm-independent

initialize

methods, it is up to the
provider what to do about the algorithm-specific parameters (if any) to be
associated with each of the keys.

If the algorithm is the

DSA

algorithm, and the keysize (modulus
size) is 512, 768, 1024, or 2048, then the

Sun

provider uses a set of
precomputed values for the

p

,

q

, and

g

parameters. If the modulus size is not one of the above
values, the

Sun

provider creates a new set of parameters. Other
providers might have precomputed parameter sets for more than just the
modulus sizes mentioned above. Still others might not have a list of
precomputed parameters at all and instead always create new parameter sets.

In case the client does not explicitly initialize the KeyPairGenerator
(via a call to an

initialize

method), each provider must
supply (and document) a default initialization.
See the Keysize Restriction sections of the

JDK Providers

document for information on the KeyPairGenerator defaults used by
JDK providers.
However, note that defaults may vary across different providers.
Additionally, the default value for a provider may change in a future
version. Therefore, it is recommended to explicitly initialize the
KeyPairGenerator instead of relying on provider-specific defaults.

Security

property to determine
the preferred provider order for the specified algorithm. This
may be different than the order of providers returned by

Security.getProviders()

.
**Parameters:** algorithm

- the standard string name of the algorithm.
See the KeyPairGenerator section in the

Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification

for information about standard algorithm names.
**Returns:** the new

**Throws:** NoSuchAlgorithmException

- if no

Provider

supports a

KeyPairGeneratorSpi

implementation for the
specified algorithm
**Throws:** NullPointerException
