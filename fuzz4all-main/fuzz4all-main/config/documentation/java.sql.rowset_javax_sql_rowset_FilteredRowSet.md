# Interface FilteredRowSet

**Source:** `java.sql.rowset\javax\sql\rowset\FilteredRowSet.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
FilteredRowSet

extends
WebRowSet
```

The standard interface that all standard implementations of

FilteredRowSet

must implement. The

FilteredRowSetImpl

class
provides the reference implementation which may be extended if required.
Alternatively, a vendor is free to implement its own version
by implementing this interface.

1.0 Background

There are occasions when a

RowSet

object has a need to provide a degree
of filtering to its contents. One possible solution is to provide
a query language for all standard

RowSet

implementations; however,
this is an impractical approach for lightweight components such as disconnected

RowSet

objects. The

FilteredRowSet

interface seeks to address this need
without supplying a heavyweight query language along with the processing that
such a query language would require.

A JDBC

FilteredRowSet

standard implementation implements the

RowSet

interfaces and extends the

CachedRowSet

™ class. The

CachedRowSet

class provides a set of protected cursor manipulation
methods, which a

FilteredRowSet

implementation can override
to supply filtering support.

2.0 Predicate Sharing

If a

FilteredRowSet

implementation is shared using the
inherited

createShared

method in parent interfaces, the

Predicate

should be shared without modification by all

FilteredRowSet

instance clones.

3.0 Usage

By implementing a

Predicate

(see example in

Predicate

class JavaDoc), a

FilteredRowSet

could then be used as described
below.

```java
FilteredRowSet frs = new FilteredRowSetImpl();
frs.populate(rs);

Range name = new Range("Alpha", "Bravo", "columnName");
frs.setFilter(name);

frs.next() // only names from "Alpha" to "Bravo" will be returned
```

In the example above, we initialize a

Range

object which
implements the

Predicate

interface. This object expresses
the following constraints: All rows outputted or modified from this

FilteredRowSet

object must fall between the values 'Alpha' and
'Bravo' both values inclusive, in the column 'columnName'. If a filter is
applied to a

FilteredRowSet

object that contains no data that
falls within the range of the filter, no rows are returned.

This framework allows multiple classes implementing predicates to be
used in combination to achieved the required filtering result with
out the need for query language processing.

4.0 Updating a

FilteredRowSet

Object

The predicate set on a

FilteredRowSet

object
applies a criterion on all rows in a

RowSet

object to manage a subset of rows in a

RowSet

object. This criterion governs the subset of rows that are visible and also
defines which rows can be modified, deleted or inserted.

Therefore, the predicate set on a

FilteredRowSet

object must be
considered as bi-directional and the set criterion as the gating mechanism
for all views and updates to the

FilteredRowSet

object. Any attempt
to update the

FilteredRowSet

that violates the criterion will
result in a

SQLException

object being thrown.

The

FilteredRowSet

range criterion can be modified by applying
a new

Predicate

object to the

FilteredRowSet

instance at any time. This is possible if no additional references to the

FilteredRowSet

object are detected. A new filter has an
immediate effect on criterion enforcement within the

FilteredRowSet

object, and all subsequent views and updates will be
subject to similar enforcement.

5.0 Behavior of Rows Outside the Filter

Rows that fall outside of the filter set on a

FilteredRowSet

object cannot be modified until the filter is removed or a
new filter is applied.

Furthermore, only rows that fall within the bounds of a filter will be
synchronized with the data source.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### void setFilter​(
Predicate
p)
throws
SQLException

Applies the given

Predicate

object to this

FilteredRowSet

object. The filter applies controls both to inbound and outbound views,
constraining which rows are visible and which
rows can be manipulated.

A new

Predicate

object may be set at any time. This has the
effect of changing constraints on the

RowSet

object's data.
In addition, modifying the filter at runtime presents issues whereby
multiple components may be operating on one

FilteredRowSet

object.
Application developers must take responsibility for managing multiple handles
to

FilteredRowSet

objects when their underling

Predicate

objects change.

**Parameters:**
- p

- a

Predicate

object defining the filter for this

FilteredRowSet

object. Setting a

null

value
will clear the predicate, allowing all rows to become visible.

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an error occurs when setting the

Predicate

object

---

#### Predicate
getFilter()

Retrieves the active filter for this

FilteredRowSet

object.

**Returns:**
- p the

Predicate

for this

FilteredRowSet

object;

null

if no filter has been set.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- setFilter

```java
void setFilter​(
Predicate
p)
throws
SQLException
```

Applies the given

Predicate

object to this

FilteredRowSet

object. The filter applies controls both to inbound and outbound views,
constraining which rows are visible and which
rows can be manipulated.

A new

Predicate

object may be set at any time. This has the
effect of changing constraints on the

RowSet

object's data.
In addition, modifying the filter at runtime presents issues whereby
multiple components may be operating on one

FilteredRowSet

object.
Application developers must take responsibility for managing multiple handles
to

FilteredRowSet

objects when their underling

Predicate

objects change.

**Parameters:** p

- a

Predicate

object defining the filter for this

FilteredRowSet

object. Setting a

null

value
will clear the predicate, allowing all rows to become visible.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs when setting the

Predicate

object

- getFilter

```java
Predicate
getFilter()
```

Retrieves the active filter for this

FilteredRowSet

object.

**Returns:** p the

Predicate

for this

FilteredRowSet

object;

null

if no filter has been set.
