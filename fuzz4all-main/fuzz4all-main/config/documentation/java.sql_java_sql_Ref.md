### Class Description

```java
public interface
Ref
```

The mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL

REF

value, which is a reference to an SQL structured type value in the database.

SQL

REF

values are stored in a table that contains
instances of a referenceable SQL structured type, and each

REF

value is a unique identifier for one instance in that table.
An SQL

REF

value may be used in place of the
SQL structured type it references, either as a column value in a
table or an attribute value in a structured type.

Because an SQL

REF

value is a logical pointer to an
SQL structured type, a

Ref

object is by default also a logical
pointer. Thus, retrieving an SQL

REF

value as
a

Ref

object does not materialize
the attributes of the structured type on the client.

A

Ref

object can be stored in the database using the

PreparedStatement.setRef

method.

All methods on the

Ref

interface must be fully implemented if the
JDBC driver supports the data type.

### Method Details

#### String
getBaseTypeName()
throws
SQLException

Retrieves the fully-qualified SQL name of the SQL structured type that
this

Ref

object references.

**Returns:**
- the fully-qualified SQL name of the referenced SQL structured type

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs
- SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not support
this method

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### Object
getObject​(
Map
<
String
,​
Class
<?>> map)
throws
SQLException

Retrieves the referenced object and maps it to a Java type
using the given type map.

**Parameters:**
- map

- a

java.util.Map

object that contains
the mapping to use (the fully-qualified name of the SQL
structured type being referenced and the class object for

SQLData

implementation to which the SQL
structured type will be mapped)

**Returns:**
- a Java

Object

that is the custom mapping for
the SQL structured type to which this

Ref

object refers

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs
- SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not support
this method

**See Also:**
- setObject(java.lang.Object)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### Object
getObject()
throws
SQLException

Retrieves the SQL structured type instance referenced by
this

Ref

object. If the connection's type map has an entry
for the structured type, the instance will be custom mapped to
the Java class indicated in the type map. Otherwise, the
structured type instance will be mapped to a

Struct

object.

**Returns:**
- a Java

Object

that is the mapping for
the SQL structured type to which this

Ref

object refers

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs
- SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not support
this method

**See Also:**
- setObject(java.lang.Object)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### void setObject​(
Object
value)
throws
SQLException

Sets the structured type value that this

Ref

object references to the given instance of

Object

.
The driver converts this to an SQL structured type when it
sends it to the database.

**Parameters:**
- value

- an

Object

representing the SQL
structured type instance that this

Ref

object will reference

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs
- SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not support
this method

**See Also:**
- getObject()

,

getObject(Map)

,

PreparedStatement.setObject(int, Object)

,

CallableStatement.setObject(String, Object)
