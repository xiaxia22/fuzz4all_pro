# Class DynamicLinkerFactory

**Source:** `jdk.dynalink\jdk\dynalink\DynamicLinkerFactory.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
DynamicLinkerFactory

extends
Object
```

A factory class for creating

DynamicLinker

objects. Dynamic linkers
are the central objects in Dynalink; these are composed of several

GuardingDynamicLinker

objects and coordinate linking of call sites
with them. The usual dynamic linker is a linker
composed of all

GuardingDynamicLinker

objects explicitly pre-created
by the user of the factory and configured with

setPrioritizedLinkers(List)

, as well as any

automatically discovered

ones, and
finally the ones configured with

setFallbackLinkers(List)

; this last
category usually includes

BeansLinker

.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public DynamicLinkerFactory()

Creates a new dynamic linker factory with default configuration. Upon
creation, the factory can be configured using various

setXxx()

methods and used to create one or more dynamic linkers according to its
current configuration using

createLinker()

.

---

### Method Details

#### public void setClassLoader​(
ClassLoader
classLoader)

Sets the class loader for automatic discovery of available guarding
dynamic linkers.

GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter

implementations
available through this class loader will be automatically instantiated
using the

ServiceLoader

mechanism and the linkers they provide
will be incorporated into

DynamicLinker

s that this factory
creates. This allows for cross-language interoperability where call sites
belonging to this language runtime can be linked by linkers from these
automatically discovered runtimes if their native objects are passed to
this runtime. If class loader is not set explicitly by invoking this
method, then the thread context class loader of the thread invoking

createLinker()

will be used. If this method is invoked
explicitly with null then

ServiceLoader.loadInstalled(Class)

will
be used to load the linkers.

**Parameters:**
- classLoader

- the class loader used for the automatic discovery of
available linkers.

---

#### public void setPrioritizedLinkers​(
List
<? extends
GuardingDynamicLinker
> prioritizedLinkers)

Sets the prioritized guarding dynamic linkers. Language runtimes using
Dynalink will usually have at least one linker for their own language.
These linkers will be consulted first by the resulting dynamic linker
when it is linking call sites, before any autodiscovered and fallback
linkers. If the factory also autodiscovers a linker class matching one
of the prioritized linkers, the autodiscovered class will be ignored and
the explicit prioritized instance will be used.

**Parameters:**
- prioritizedLinkers

- the list of prioritized linkers. Can be null.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if any of the list elements are null.

---

#### public void setPrioritizedLinkers​(
GuardingDynamicLinker
... prioritizedLinkers)

Sets the prioritized guarding dynamic linkers. Identical to calling

setPrioritizedLinkers(List)

with

Arrays.asList(prioritizedLinkers)

.

**Parameters:**
- prioritizedLinkers

- an array of prioritized linkers. Can be null.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if any of the array elements are null.

---

#### public void setPrioritizedLinker​(
GuardingDynamicLinker
prioritizedLinker)

Sets a single prioritized linker. Identical to calling

setPrioritizedLinkers(List)

with a single-element list.

**Parameters:**
- prioritizedLinker

- the single prioritized linker. Must not be null.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if null is passed.

---

#### public void setFallbackLinkers​(
List
<? extends
GuardingDynamicLinker
> fallbackLinkers)

Sets the fallback guarding dynamic linkers. These linkers will be
consulted last by the resulting dynamic linker when it is linking call
sites, after any autodiscovered and prioritized linkers. If the factory
also autodiscovers a linker class matching one of the fallback linkers,
the autodiscovered class will be ignored and the explicit fallback
instance will be used.

**Parameters:**
- fallbackLinkers

- the list of fallback linkers. Can be empty to
indicate the caller wishes to set no fallback linkers. Note that if this
method is not invoked explicitly or is passed null, then the factory
will create an instance of

BeansLinker

to serve as the default
fallback linker.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if any of the list elements are null.

---

#### public void setFallbackLinkers​(
GuardingDynamicLinker
... fallbackLinkers)

Sets the fallback guarding dynamic linkers. Identical to calling

setFallbackLinkers(List)

with

Arrays.asList(fallbackLinkers)

.

**Parameters:**
- fallbackLinkers

- an array of fallback linkers. Can be empty to
indicate the caller wishes to set no fallback linkers. Note that if this
method is not invoked explicitly or is passed null, then the factory
will create an instance of

BeansLinker

to serve as the default
fallback linker.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if any of the array elements are null.

---

#### public void setSyncOnRelink​(boolean syncOnRelink)

Sets whether the dynamic linker created by this factory will invoke

MutableCallSite.syncAll(MutableCallSite[])

after a call site is
relinked. Defaults to false. You probably want to set it to true if your
runtime supports multithreaded execution of dynamically linked code.

**Parameters:**
- syncOnRelink

- true for invoking sync on relink, false otherwise.

---

#### public void setUnstableRelinkThreshold​(int unstableRelinkThreshold)

Sets the unstable relink threshold; the number of times a call site is
relinked after which it will be considered unstable, and subsequent link
requests for it will indicate this. Defaults to 8 when not set explicitly.

**Parameters:**
- unstableRelinkThreshold

- the new threshold. Must not be less than
zero. The value of zero means that call sites will never be considered
unstable.

**See Also:**
- LinkRequest.isCallSiteUnstable()

---

#### public void setPrelinkTransformer​(
GuardedInvocationTransformer
prelinkTransformer)

Set the pre-link transformer. This is a

GuardedInvocationTransformer

that will get the final chance to
modify the guarded invocation after it has been created by a component
linker and before the dynamic linker links it into the call site. It is
normally used to adapt the return value type of the invocation to the
type of the call site. When not set explicitly, a default pre-link
transformer will be used that simply calls

GuardedInvocation.asType(LinkerServices, MethodType)

. Customized
pre-link transformers are rarely needed; they are mostly used as a
building block for implementing advanced techniques such as code
deoptimization strategies.

**Parameters:**
- prelinkTransformer

- the pre-link transformer for the dynamic
linker. Can be null to have the factory use the default transformer.

---

#### public void setAutoConversionStrategy​(
MethodTypeConversionStrategy
autoConversionStrategy)

Sets an object representing the conversion strategy for automatic type
conversions. After

LinkerServices.asType(MethodHandle, MethodType)

has applied all
custom conversions to a method handle, it still needs to effect

method
invocation conversions

that can usually be automatically applied as per

MethodHandle.asType(MethodType)

. However, sometimes language
runtimes will want to customize even those conversions for their own call
sites. A typical example is allowing unboxing of null return values,
which is by default prohibited by ordinary

MethodHandles.asType()

. In this case, a language runtime can
install its own custom automatic conversion strategy, that can deal with
null values. Note that when the strategy's

MethodTypeConversionStrategy.asType(MethodHandle, MethodType)

is invoked, the custom language conversions will already have been
applied to the method handle, so by design the difference between the
handle's current method type and the desired final type will always only
be ones that can be subjected to method invocation conversions. The
strategy also doesn't need to invoke a final

MethodHandle.asType()

as that will be done internally as the
final step.

**Parameters:**
- autoConversionStrategy

- the strategy for applying method invocation
conversions for the linker created by this factory. Can be null for no
custom strategy.

---

#### public void setInternalObjectsFilter​(
MethodHandleTransformer
internalObjectsFilter)

Sets a method handle transformer that is supposed to act as the
implementation of

LinkerServices.filterInternalObjects(MethodHandle)

for linker
services of dynamic linkers created by this factory. Some language
runtimes can have internal objects that should not escape their scope.
They can add a transformer here that will modify the method handle so
that any parameters that can receive potentially internal language
runtime objects will have a filter added on them to prevent them from
escaping, potentially by wrapping them. The transformer can also
potentially add an unwrapping filter to the return value.

DefaultInternalObjectFilter

is provided as a convenience class
for easily creating such filtering transformers.

**Parameters:**
- internalObjectsFilter

- a method handle transformer filtering out
internal objects, or null.

---

#### public
DynamicLinker
createLinker()

Creates a new dynamic linker based on the current configuration. This
method can be invoked more than once to create multiple dynamic linkers.
Automatically discovered linkers are newly instantiated on every
invocation of this method. It is allowed to change the factory's
configuration between invocations. The method is not thread safe. After
invocation, callers can invoke

getAutoLoadingErrors()

to
retrieve a list of

ServiceConfigurationError

s that occurred while
trying to load automatically discovered linkers. These are never thrown
from the call to this method as it makes every effort to recover from
them and ignore the failing linkers.

**Returns:**
- the new dynamic Linker

---

#### public
List
<
ServiceConfigurationError
> getAutoLoadingErrors()

Returns a list of

ServiceConfigurationError

s that were
encountered while loading automatically discovered linkers during the
last invocation of

createLinker()

. They can be any non-Dynalink
specific service configuration issues, as well as some Dynalink-specific
errors when an exporter that the factory tried to automatically load:

- did not have the runtime permission named

GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter.AUTOLOAD_PERMISSION_NAME

in a
system with a security manager, or
- returned null from

Supplier.get()

, or
- the list returned from

Supplier.get()

had a null element.

**Returns:**
- an immutable list of encountered

ServiceConfigurationError

s. Can be empty.

.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- setClassLoader

```java
public void setClassLoader​(
ClassLoader
classLoader)
```

Sets the class loader for automatic discovery of available guarding
dynamic linkers.

GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter

implementations
available through this class loader will be automatically instantiated
using the

ServiceLoader

mechanism and the linkers they provide
will be incorporated into

DynamicLinker

s that this factory
creates. This allows for cross-language interoperability where call sites
belonging to this language runtime can be linked by linkers from these
automatically discovered runtimes if their native objects are passed to
this runtime. If class loader is not set explicitly by invoking this
method, then the thread context class loader of the thread invoking

createLinker()

will be used. If this method is invoked
explicitly with null then

ServiceLoader.loadInstalled(Class)

will
be used to load the linkers.

**Parameters:** classLoader

- the class loader used for the automatic discovery of
available linkers.

- setPrioritizedLinkers

```java
public void setPrioritizedLinkers​(
List
<? extends
GuardingDynamicLinker
> prioritizedLinkers)
```

Sets the prioritized guarding dynamic linkers. Language runtimes using
Dynalink will usually have at least one linker for their own language.
These linkers will be consulted first by the resulting dynamic linker
when it is linking call sites, before any autodiscovered and fallback
linkers. If the factory also autodiscovers a linker class matching one
of the prioritized linkers, the autodiscovered class will be ignored and
the explicit prioritized instance will be used.

**Parameters:** prioritizedLinkers

- the list of prioritized linkers. Can be null.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the list elements are null.

- setPrioritizedLinkers

```java
public void setPrioritizedLinkers​(
GuardingDynamicLinker
... prioritizedLinkers)
```

Sets the prioritized guarding dynamic linkers. Identical to calling

setPrioritizedLinkers(List)

with

Arrays.asList(prioritizedLinkers)

.

**Parameters:** prioritizedLinkers

- an array of prioritized linkers. Can be null.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the array elements are null.

- setPrioritizedLinker

```java
public void setPrioritizedLinker​(
GuardingDynamicLinker
prioritizedLinker)
```

Sets a single prioritized linker. Identical to calling

setPrioritizedLinkers(List)

with a single-element list.

**Parameters:** prioritizedLinker

- the single prioritized linker. Must not be null.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if null is passed.

- setFallbackLinkers

```java
public void setFallbackLinkers​(
List
<? extends
GuardingDynamicLinker
> fallbackLinkers)
```

Sets the fallback guarding dynamic linkers. These linkers will be
consulted last by the resulting dynamic linker when it is linking call
sites, after any autodiscovered and prioritized linkers. If the factory
also autodiscovers a linker class matching one of the fallback linkers,
the autodiscovered class will be ignored and the explicit fallback
instance will be used.

**Parameters:** fallbackLinkers

- the list of fallback linkers. Can be empty to
indicate the caller wishes to set no fallback linkers. Note that if this
method is not invoked explicitly or is passed null, then the factory
will create an instance of

BeansLinker

to serve as the default
fallback linker.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the list elements are null.

- setFallbackLinkers

```java
public void setFallbackLinkers​(
GuardingDynamicLinker
... fallbackLinkers)
```

Sets the fallback guarding dynamic linkers. Identical to calling

setFallbackLinkers(List)

with

Arrays.asList(fallbackLinkers)

.

**Parameters:** fallbackLinkers

- an array of fallback linkers. Can be empty to
indicate the caller wishes to set no fallback linkers. Note that if this
method is not invoked explicitly or is passed null, then the factory
will create an instance of

BeansLinker

to serve as the default
fallback linker.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the array elements are null.

- setSyncOnRelink

```java
public void setSyncOnRelink​(boolean syncOnRelink)
```

Sets whether the dynamic linker created by this factory will invoke

MutableCallSite.syncAll(MutableCallSite[])

after a call site is
relinked. Defaults to false. You probably want to set it to true if your
runtime supports multithreaded execution of dynamically linked code.

**Parameters:** syncOnRelink

- true for invoking sync on relink, false otherwise.

- setUnstableRelinkThreshold

```java
public void setUnstableRelinkThreshold​(int unstableRelinkThreshold)
```

Sets the unstable relink threshold; the number of times a call site is
relinked after which it will be considered unstable, and subsequent link
requests for it will indicate this. Defaults to 8 when not set explicitly.

**Parameters:** unstableRelinkThreshold

- the new threshold. Must not be less than
zero. The value of zero means that call sites will never be considered
unstable.
**See Also:** LinkRequest.isCallSiteUnstable()

- setPrelinkTransformer

```java
public void setPrelinkTransformer​(
GuardedInvocationTransformer
prelinkTransformer)
```

Set the pre-link transformer. This is a

GuardedInvocationTransformer

that will get the final chance to
modify the guarded invocation after it has been created by a component
linker and before the dynamic linker links it into the call site. It is
normally used to adapt the return value type of the invocation to the
type of the call site. When not set explicitly, a default pre-link
transformer will be used that simply calls

GuardedInvocation.asType(LinkerServices, MethodType)

. Customized
pre-link transformers are rarely needed; they are mostly used as a
building block for implementing advanced techniques such as code
deoptimization strategies.

**Parameters:** prelinkTransformer

- the pre-link transformer for the dynamic
linker. Can be null to have the factory use the default transformer.

- setAutoConversionStrategy

```java
public void setAutoConversionStrategy​(
MethodTypeConversionStrategy
autoConversionStrategy)
```

Sets an object representing the conversion strategy for automatic type
conversions. After

LinkerServices.asType(MethodHandle, MethodType)

has applied all

for linker
services of dynamic linkers created by this factory. Some language
runtimes can have internal objects that should not escape their scope.
They can add a transformer here that will modify the method handle so

DefaultInternalObjectFilter

is provided as a convenience class

**Parameters:** internalObjectsFilter

- a method handle transformer filtering out
internal objects, or null.

- createLinker

```java
public
DynamicLinker
createLinker()
```

Creates a new dynamic linker based on the current configuration. This
method can be invoked more than once to create multiple dynamic linkers.
Automatically discovered linkers are newly instantiated on every
invocation of this method. It is allowed to change the factory's
configuration between invocations. The method is not thread safe. After
invocation, callers can invoke

getAutoLoadingErrors()

to
retrieve a list of

ServiceConfigurationError

s that occurred while
trying to load automatically discovered linkers. These are never thrown
from the call to this method as it makes every effort to recover from
them and ignore the failing linkers.

**Returns:** the new dynamic Linker

- getAutoLoadingErrors

```java
public
List
<
ServiceConfigurationError
> getAutoLoadingErrors()
```

Returns a list of

ServiceConfigurationError

s that were
encountered while loading automatically discovered linkers during the
last invocation of

createLinker()

. They can be any non-Dynalink
specific service configuration issues, as well as some Dynalink-specific
errors when an exporter that the factory tried to automatically load:

- did not have the runtime permission named

GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter.AUTOLOAD_PERMISSION_NAME

in a
system with a security manager, or
- returned null from

Supplier.get()

, or
- the list returned from

Supplier.get()

had a null element.

**Returns:** an immutable list of encountered

ServiceConfigurationError

s. Can be empty.

**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the list elements are null.

- setPrioritizedLinkers

```java
public void setPrioritizedLinkers​(
GuardingDynamicLinker
... prioritizedLinkers)
```

Sets the prioritized guarding dynamic linkers. Identical to calling

setPrioritizedLinkers(List)

with

Arrays.asList(prioritizedLinkers)

.

**Parameters:** prioritizedLinkers

- an array of prioritized linkers. Can be null.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the array elements are null.

- setPrioritizedLinker

```java
public void setPrioritizedLinker​(
GuardingDynamicLinker
prioritizedLinker)
```

Sets a single prioritized linker. Identical to calling

setPrioritizedLinkers(List)

with a single-element list.

**Parameters:** prioritizedLinker

- the single prioritized linker. Must not be null.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if null is passed.

- setFallbackLinkers

```java
public void setFallbackLinkers​(
List
<? extends
GuardingDynamicLinker
> fallbackLinkers)
```

Sets the fallback guarding dynamic linkers. These linkers will be
consulted last by the resulting dynamic linker when it is linking call
sites, after any autodiscovered and prioritized linkers. If the factory
also autodiscovers a linker class matching one of the fallback linkers,
the autodiscovered class will be ignored and the explicit fallback
instance will be used.

**Parameters:** fallbackLinkers

- the list of fallback linkers. Can be empty to
indicate the caller wishes to set no fallback linkers. Note that if this
method is not invoked explicitly or is passed null, then the factory
will create an instance of

BeansLinker

to serve as the default
fallback linker.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the list elements are null.

- setFallbackLinkers

```java
public void setFallbackLinkers​(
GuardingDynamicLinker
... fallbackLinkers)
```

Sets the fallback guarding dynamic linkers. Identical to calling

setFallbackLinkers(List)

with

Arrays.asList(fallbackLinkers)

.

**Parameters:** fallbackLinkers

- an array of fallback linkers. Can be empty to
indicate the caller wishes to set no fallback linkers. Note that if this
method is not invoked explicitly or is passed null, then the factory
will create an instance of

BeansLinker

to serve as the default
fallback linker.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the array elements are null.

- setSyncOnRelink

```java
public void setSyncOnRelink​(boolean syncOnRelink)
```

Sets whether the dynamic linker created by this factory will invoke

MutableCallSite.syncAll(MutableCallSite[])

after a call site is
relinked. Defaults to false. You probably want to set it to true if your
runtime supports multithreaded execution of dynamically linked code.

**Parameters:** syncOnRelink

- true for invoking sync on relink, false otherwise.

- setUnstableRelinkThreshold

```java
public void setUnstableRelinkThreshold​(int unstableRelinkThreshold)
```

Sets the unstable relink threshold; the number of times a call site is
relinked after which it will be considered unstable, and subsequent link
requests for it will indicate this. Defaults to 8 when not set explicitly.

**Parameters:** unstableRelinkThreshold

- the new threshold. Must not be less than
zero. The value of zero means that call sites will never be considered
unstable.
**See Also:** LinkRequest.isCallSiteUnstable()

- setPrelinkTransformer

```java
public void setPrelinkTransformer​(
GuardedInvocationTransformer
prelinkTransformer)
```

Set the pre-link transformer. This is a

GuardedInvocationTransformer

that will get the final chance to
modify the guarded invocation after it has been created by a component
linker and before the dynamic linker links it into the call site. It is
normally used to adapt the return value type of the invocation to the
type of the call site. When not set explicitly, a default pre-link
transformer will be used that simply calls

GuardedInvocation.asType(LinkerServices, MethodType)

. Customized
pre-link transformers are rarely needed; they are mostly used as a
building block for implementing advanced techniques such as code
deoptimization strategies.

**Parameters:** prelinkTransformer

- the pre-link transformer for the dynamic
linker. Can be null to have the factory use the default transformer.

- setAutoConversionStrategy

```java
public void setAutoConversionStrategy​(
MethodTypeConversionStrategy
autoConversionStrategy)
```

Sets an object representing the conversion strategy for automatic type
conversions. After

LinkerServices.asType(MethodHandle, MethodType)

has applied all
custom conversions to a method handle, it still needs to effect

method
invocation conversions

that can usually be automatically applied as per

MethodHandle.asType(MethodType)

. However, sometimes language
runtimes will want to customize even those conversions for their own call
sites. A typical example is allowing unboxing of null return values,
which is by default prohibited by ordinary

MethodHandles.asType()

. In this case, a language runtime can
install its own custom automatic conversion strategy, that can deal with
null values. Note that when the strategy's

MethodTypeConversionStrategy.asType(MethodHandle, MethodType)

is invoked, the custom language conversions will already have been
applied to the method handle, so by design the difference between the
handle's current method type and the desired final type will always only
be ones that can be subjected to method invocation conversions. The
strategy also doesn't need to invoke a final

MethodHandle.asType()

as that will be done internally as the
final step.

**Parameters:** autoConversionStrategy

- the strategy for applying method invocation
conversions for the linker created by this factory. Can be null for no
custom strategy.

- setInternalObjectsFilter

```java
public void setInternalObjectsFilter​(
MethodHandleTransformer
internalObjectsFilter)
```

Sets a method handle transformer that is supposed to act as the
implementation of

LinkerServices.filterInternalObjects(MethodHandle)

for linker
services of dynamic linkers created by this factory. Some language
runtimes can have internal objects that should not escape their scope.
They can add a transformer here that will modify the method handle so
that any parameters that can receive potentially internal language
runtime objects will have a filter added on them to prevent them from
escaping, potentially by wrapping them. The transformer can also
potentially add an unwrapping filter to the return value.

DefaultInternalObjectFilter

is provided as a convenience class
for easily creating such filtering transformers.

**Parameters:** internalObjectsFilter

- a method handle transformer filtering out
internal objects, or null.

- createLinker

```java
public
DynamicLinker
createLinker()
```

Creates a new dynamic linker based on the current configuration. This
method can be invoked more than once to create multiple dynamic linkers.
Automatically discovered linkers are newly instantiated on every
invocation of this method. It is allowed to change the factory's
configuration between invocations. The method is not thread safe. After
invocation, callers can invoke

getAutoLoadingErrors()

to
retrieve a list of

ServiceConfigurationError

s that occurred while
trying to load automatically discovered linkers. These are never thrown
from the call to this method as it makes every effort to recover from
them and ignore the failing linkers.

**Returns:** the new dynamic Linker

- getAutoLoadingErrors

```java
public
List
<
ServiceConfigurationError
> getAutoLoadingErrors()
```

Returns a list of

ServiceConfigurationError

s that were
encountered while loading automatically discovered linkers during the
last invocation of

createLinker()

. They can be any non-Dynalink
specific service configuration issues, as well as some Dynalink-specific
errors when an exporter that the factory tried to automatically load:

- did not have the runtime permission named

GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter.AUTOLOAD_PERMISSION_NAME

in a
system with a security manager, or
- returned null from

Supplier.get()

, or
- the list returned from

Supplier.get()

had a null element.

**Returns:** an immutable list of encountered

ServiceConfigurationError

s. Can be empty.

#### Method Detail

setClassLoader

```java
public void setClassLoader​(
ClassLoader
classLoader)
```

Sets the class loader for automatic discovery of available guarding
dynamic linkers.

GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter

implementations
available through this class loader will be automatically instantiated
using the

ServiceLoader

mechanism and the linkers they provide
will be incorporated into

DynamicLinker

s that this factory
creates. This allows for cross-language interoperability where call sites
belonging to this language runtime can be linked by linkers from these
automatically discovered runtimes if their native objects are passed to
this runtime. If class loader is not set explicitly by invoking this
method, then the thread context class loader of the thread invoking

createLinker()

will be used. If this method is invoked
explicitly with null then

ServiceLoader.loadInstalled(Class)

will
be used to load the linkers.

**Parameters:** classLoader

- the class loader used for the automatic discovery of
available linkers.

#### setClassLoader

public void setClassLoader​(

ClassLoader

classLoader)

Sets the class loader for automatic discovery of available guarding
dynamic linkers.

GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter

implementations
available through this class loader will be automatically instantiated
using the

ServiceLoader

s that this factory
creates. This allows for cross-language interoperability where call sites
belonging to this language runtime can be linked by linkers from these
automatically discovered runtimes if their native objects are passed to
this runtime. If class loader is not set explicitly by invoking this
method, then the thread context class loader of the thread invoking

createLinker()

will be used. If this method is invoked
explicitly with null then

ServiceLoader.loadInstalled(Class)

will
be used to load the linkers.

```java
public void setPrioritizedLinkers​(
List
<? extends
GuardingDynamicLinker

when it is linking call sites, before any autodiscovered and fallback
linkers. If the factory also autodiscovers a linker class matching one
of the prioritized linkers, the autodiscovered class will be ignored and
the explicit prioritized instance will be used.

**Parameters:** prioritizedLinkers

- the list of prioritized linkers. Can be null.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the list elements are null.
