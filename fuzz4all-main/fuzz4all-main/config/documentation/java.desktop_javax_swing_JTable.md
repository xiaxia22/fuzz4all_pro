```java
@JavaBean

public class
JTable

extends

,
RowSorterListener
```

The

JTable

is used to display and edit regular two-dimensional tables
of cells.
See

How to Use Tables

in

The Java Tutorial

for task-oriented documentation and examples of using

JTable

.

The

JTable

has many
facilities that make it possible to customize its rendering and editing
but provides defaults for these features so that simple tables can be
set up easily. For example, to set up a table with 10 rows and 10
columns of numbers:

```java
TableModel dataModel = new AbstractTableModel() {
public int getColumnCount() { return 10; }
public int getRowCount() { return 10;}
public Object getValueAt(int row, int col) { return Integer.valueOf(row*col); }
};
JTable table = new JTable(dataModel);
JScrollPane scrollpane = new JScrollPane(table);
```

JTable

s are typically placed inside of a

JScrollPane

. By
default, a

JTable

will adjust its width such that
a horizontal scrollbar is unnecessary. To allow for a horizontal scrollbar,
invoke

setAutoResizeMode(int)

with

AUTO_RESIZE_OFF

.
Note that if you wish to use a

JTable

in a standalone
view (outside of a

JScrollPane

) and want the header
displayed, you can get it using

getTableHeader()

and
display it separately.

To enable sorting and filtering of rows, use a

RowSorter

.
You can set up a row sorter in either of two ways:

- Directly set the

RowSorter

. For example:

table.setRowSorter(new TableRowSorter(model))

.

Set the

autoCreateRowSorter

property to

true

, so that the

JTable

creates a

RowSorter

for
you. For example:

setAutoCreateRowSorter(true)

.

When designing applications that use the

JTable

it is worth paying
close attention to the data structures that will represent the table's data.
The

DefaultTableModel

is a model implementation that
uses a

Vector

of

Vector

s of

Object

s to
store the cell values. As well as copying the data from an
application into the

DefaultTableModel

,
it is also possible to wrap the data in the methods of the

TableModel

interface so that the data can be passed to the

JTable

directly, as in the example above. This often results
in more efficient applications because the model is free to choose the
internal representation that best suits the data.
A good rule of thumb for deciding whether to use the

AbstractTableModel

or the

DefaultTableModel

is to use the

AbstractTableModel

as the base class for creating subclasses and the

DefaultTableModel

when subclassing is not required.

The "TableExample" directory in the demo area of the source distribution
gives a number of complete examples of

JTable

usage,
covering how the

JTable

can be used to provide an
editable view of data taken from a database and how to modify
the columns in the display to use specialized renderers and editors.

The

JTable

uses integers exclusively to refer to both the rows and the columns
of the model that it displays. The

JTable

simply takes a tabular range of cells
and uses

getValueAt(int, int)

to retrieve the
values from the model during painting. It is important to remember that
the column and row indexes returned by various

JTable

methods
are in terms of the

JTable

(the view) and are not
necessarily the same indexes used by the model.

By default, columns may be rearranged in the

JTable

so that the
view's columns appear in a different order to the columns in the model.
This does not affect the implementation of the model at all: when the
columns are reordered, the

JTable

maintains the new order of the columns
internally and converts its column indices before querying the model.

So, when writing a

TableModel

, it is not necessary to listen for column
reordering events as the model will be queried in its own coordinate
system regardless of what is happening in the view.
In the examples area there is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making
use of exactly this technique to interpose yet another coordinate system
where the order of the rows is changed, rather than the order of the columns.

Similarly when using the sorting and filtering functionality
provided by

RowSorter

the underlying

TableModel

does not need to know how to do sorting,
rather

RowSorter

will handle it. Coordinate
conversions will be necessary when using the row based methods of

JTable

with the underlying

TableModel

.
All of

JTable

s row based methods are in terms of the

RowSorter

, which is not necessarily the same as that
of the underlying

TableModel

. For example, the
selection is always in terms of

JTable

so that when
using

RowSorter

you will need to convert using

convertRowIndexToView

or

convertRowIndexToModel

. The following shows how to
convert coordinates from

JTable

to that of the
underlying model:

```java
int[] selection = table.getSelectedRows();
for (int i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) {
selection[i] = table.convertRowIndexToModel(selection[i]);
}
// selection is now in terms of the underlying TableModel
```

By default if sorting is enabled

JTable

will persist the
selection and variable row heights in terms of the model on
sorting. For example if row 0, in terms of the underlying model,
is currently selected, after the sort row 0, in terms of the
underlying model will be selected. Visually the selection may
change, but in terms of the underlying model it will remain the
same. The one exception to that is if the model index is no longer
visible or was removed. For example, if row 0 in terms of model
was filtered out the selection will be empty after the sort.

J2SE 5 adds methods to

JTable

to provide convenient access to some
common printing needs. Simple new

print()

methods allow for quick
and easy addition of printing support to your application. In addition, a new

getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

method is available for more advanced printing needs.

As for all

JComponent

classes, you can use

InputMap

and

ActionMap

to associate an

Action

object with a

KeyStroke

and execute the
action under specified conditions.

Warning:

Swing is not thread safe. For more

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
table's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the table's

TableUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
an item (in single selection mode) or a selection (in other selection
modes) and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
table's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:**
- b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

#### public final void setDropMode​(
DropMode
dropMode)

Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility,
the default for this property is

DropMode.USE_SELECTION

.
Usage of one of the other modes is recommended, however, for an
improved user experience.

DropMode.ON

, for instance,
offers similar behavior of showing items as selected, but does so without
affecting the actual selection in the table.

JTable

supports the following drop modes:

- DropMode.USE_SELECTION
- DropMode.ON
- DropMode.INSERT
- DropMode.INSERT_ROWS
- DropMode.INSERT_COLS
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT_ROWS
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT_COLS

The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a

TransferHandler

that accepts drops.

**Parameters:**
- dropMode

- the drop mode to use

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the drop mode is unsupported
or

null

getDropLocation()

Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
or

null

if no location is to currently be shown.

This method is not meant for querying the drop location
from a

TransferHandler

, as the drop location is only
set after the

="The selection mode used by the row and column selection models.")
public void setSelectionMode​(int selectionMode)

Sets the table's selection mode to allow only single selections, a single
contiguous interval, or multiple intervals.

Note:

JTable

provides all the methods for handling
column and row selection. When setting states,
such as

setSelectionMode

, it not only
updates the mode for the row selection model but also sets similar
values in the selection model of the

columnModel

.
If you want to have the row and column selection models operating
in different modes, set them both directly.

Both the row and column selection models for

JTable

default to using a

DefaultListSelectionModel

so that

JTable

works the same way as the

JList

. See the

setSelectionMode

method
in

JList

for details about the modes.

**Parameters:**
- selectionMode

- the mode used by the row and column selection models

both the

rowSelectionAllowed

property and

columnSelectionAllowed

property of the

columnModel

to the supplied value.

Updates the selection models of the table, depending on the state of the
two flags:

toggle

and

extend

. Most changes
to the selection that are the result of keyboard or mouse events received
by the UI are channeled through this method so that the behavior may be
overridden by a subclass. Some UIs may need more functionality than
this method provides, such as when manipulating the lead for discontiguous
selection, and may not call into this method for some selection changes.

This implementation uses the following conventions:

- toggle

:

false

,

extend

:

false

.
Clear the previous selection and ensure the new cell is selected.

toggle

:

false

,

extend

:

true

.
Extend the previous selection from the anchor to the specified cell,
clearing all other selections.

toggle

:

true

,

extend

:

false

.
If the specified cell is selected, deselect it. If it is not selected, select it.

toggle

:

true

,

extend

:

true

.
Apply the selection state of the anchor to all cells between it and the
specified cell.

**Parameters:**
- rowIndex

- affects the selection at

row
- columnIndex

- affects the selection at

column

you can use:

```java
addColumn(new TableColumn(modelColumn, width, cellRenderer, cellEditor));
```

[Any of the

TableColumn

constructors can be used
instead of this one.]
The model column number is stored inside the

TableColumn

and is used during rendering and editing to locate the appropriates
data values in the model. The model column number does not change
when columns are reordered in the view.

TableColumn

to be added

**See Also:**
- removeColumn(javax.swing.table.TableColumn)

---

#### public void removeColumn​(

#### public
Rectangle
getCellRect​(int row,
int column,
boolean includeSpacing)

Returns a rectangle for the cell that lies at the intersection of

row

and

column

.
If

includeSpacing

is true then the value returned
has the full height and width of the row and column
specified. If it is false, the returned rectangle is inset by the
intercell spacing to return the true bounds of the rendering or
editing component as it will be set during rendering.

If the column index is valid but the row index is less
than zero the method returns a rectangle with the

y

and

height

values set appropriately
and the

x

and

width

values both set
to zero. In general, when either the row or column indices indicate a
cell outside the appropriate range, the method returns a rectangle
depicting the closest edge of the closest cell that is within
the table's range. When both row and column indices are out
of range the returned rectangle covers the closest
point of the closest cell.

In all cases, calculations that use this method to calculate
results along one axis will not fail because of anomalies in
calculations along the other axis. When the cell is not valid
the

includeSpacing

parameter is ignored.

**Parameters:**
- row

- the row index where the desired cell
is located
- column

- the column index where the desired cell

#### public void doLayout()

Causes this table to lay out its rows and columns. Overridden so
that columns can be resized to accommodate a change in the size of
a containing parent.
Resizes one or more of the columns in the table
so that the total width of all of this

JTable

's
columns is equal to the width of the table.

Before the layout begins the method gets the

resizingColumn

of the

tableHeader

.
When the method is called as a result of the resizing of an enclosing window,
the

resizingColumn

is

null

. This means that resizing
has taken place "outside" the

JTable

and the change -
or "delta" - should be distributed to all of the columns regardless
of this

JTable

's automatic resize mode.

If the

resizingColumn

is not

null

, it is one of
the columns in the table that has changed size rather than
the table itself. In this case the auto-resize modes govern
the way the extra (or deficit) space is distributed
amongst the available columns.

The modes are:

- AUTO_RESIZE_OFF: Don't automatically adjust the column's
widths at all. Use a horizontal scrollbar to accommodate the
columns when their sum exceeds the width of the

Viewport

. If the

JTable

is not
enclosed in a

JScrollPane

this may
leave parts of the table invisible.

AUTO_RESIZE_NEXT_COLUMN: Use just the column after the
resizing column. This results in the "boundary" or divider
between adjacent cells being independently adjustable.

AUTO_RESIZE_SUBSEQUENT_COLUMNS: Use all columns after the
one being adjusted to absorb the changes. This is the
default behavior.

AUTO_RESIZE_LAST_COLUMN: Automatically adjust the
size of the last column only. If the bounds of the last column
prevent the desired size from being allocated, set the
width of the last column to the appropriate limit and make
no further adjustments.

AUTO_RESIZE_ALL_COLUMNS: Spread the delta amongst all the columns
in the

JTable

, including the one that is being
adjusted.

Note:

When a

JTable

makes adjustments
to the widths of the columns it respects their minimum and
maximum values absolutely. It is therefore possible that,
even after this method is called, the total width of the columns
is still not equal to the width of the table. When this happens
the

JTable

does not put itself
in AUTO_RESIZE_OFF mode to bring up a scroll bar, or break other
commitments of its current auto-resize mode -- instead it
allows its bounds to be set larger (or smaller) than the total of the
column minimum or maximum, meaning, either that there
will not be enough room to display all of the columns, or that the
columns will not fill the

JTable

's bounds.
These respectively, result in the clipping of some columns
or an area being painted in the

JTable

's
background color during painting.

The mechanism for distributing the delta amongst the available
columns is provided in a private method in the

JTable

class:

```java
adjustSizes(long targetSize, final Resizable3 r, boolean inverse)
```

an explanation of which is provided in the following section.

Resizable3

is a private
interface that allows any data structure containing a collection
of elements with a size, preferred size, maximum size and minimum size
to have its elements manipulated by the algorithm.

Distributing the delta

Overview

Call "DELTA" the difference between the target size and the
sum of the preferred sizes of the elements in r. The individual
sizes are calculated by taking the original preferred
sizes and adding a share of the DELTA - that share being based on
how far each preferred size is from its limiting bound (minimum or
maximum).

Definition

Call the individual constraints min[i], max[i], and pref[i].

Call their respective sums: MIN, MAX, and PREF.

Each new size will be calculated using:

```java
size[i] = pref[i] + delta[i]
```

where each individual delta[i] is calculated according to:

If (DELTA < 0) we are in shrink mode where:

```java
DELTA
delta[i] = ------------ * (pref[i] - min[i])
(PREF - MIN)
```

If (DELTA > 0) we are in expand mode where:

```java
DELTA
delta[i] = ------------ * (max[i] - pref[i])
(MAX - PREF)
```

The overall effect is that the total size moves that same percentage,
k, towards the total minimum or maximum and that percentage guarantees
accommodation of the required space, DELTA.

Details

Naive evaluation of the formulae presented here would be subject to
the aggregated rounding errors caused by doing this operation in finite
precision (using ints). To deal with this, the multiplying factor above,
is constantly recalculated and this takes account of the rounding
errors in the previous iterations. The result is an algorithm that
produces a set of integers whose values exactly sum to the supplied

targetSize

, and does so by spreading the rounding
errors evenly over the given elements.

When the MAX and MIN bounds are hit

When

targetSize

is outside the [MIN, MAX] range,
the algorithm sets all sizes to their appropriate limiting value
(maximum or minimum).

HeadlessException

Prints this

JTable

. Takes steps that the majority of
developers would take in order to print a

JTable

.
In short, it prepares the table, calls

getPrintable

to
fetch an appropriate

Printable

, and then sends it to the
printer.

A

boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether or not
a printing dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user may
use the dialog to change the destination printer or printing attributes,
or even to cancel the print. Another two parameters allow for a

PrintService

and printing attributes to be specified.
These parameters can be used either to provide initial values for the
print dialog, or to specify values when the dialog is not shown.

A second

boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether
or not to perform printing in an interactive mode. If

true

,
a modal progress dialog, with an abort option, is displayed for the
duration of printing . This dialog also prevents any user action which
may affect the table. However, it can not prevent the table from being
modified by code (for example, another thread that posts updates using

SwingUtilities.invokeLater

). It is therefore the
responsibility of the developer to ensure that no other code modifies
the table in any way during printing (invalid modifications include
changes in: size, renderers, or underlying data). Printing behavior is
undefined when the table is changed during printing.

If

false

is specified for this parameter, no dialog will
be displayed and printing will begin immediately on the event-dispatch
thread. This blocks any other events, including repaints, from being
processed until printing is complete. Although this effectively prevents
the table from being changed, it doesn't provide a good user experience.
For this reason, specifying

false

is only recommended when
printing from an application with no visible GUI.

Note: Attempting to show the printing dialog or run interactively, while
in headless mode, will result in a

HeadlessException

.

Before fetching the printable, this method will gracefully terminate
editing, if necessary, to prevent an editor from showing in the printed
result. Additionally,

JTable

will prepare its renderers
during printing such that selection and focus are not indicated.
As far as customizing further how the table looks in the printout,
developers can provide custom renderers or paint code that conditionalize
on the value of

JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

.

See

getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

for more description on how the table is
printed.

**Parameters:**
- printMode

#### public
Printable
getPrintable​(
JTable.PrintMode
printMode,

MessageFormat
headerFormat,

MessageFormat
footerFormat)

Return a

Printable

for use in printing this JTable.

This method is meant for those wishing to customize the default

Printable

implementation used by

JTable

's

print

methods. Developers wanting simply to print the table
should use one of those methods directly.

The

Printable

can be requested in one of two printing modes.
In both modes, it spreads table rows naturally in sequence across
multiple pages, fitting as many rows as possible per page.

PrintMode.NORMAL

specifies that the table be
printed at its current size. In this mode, there may be a need to spread
columns across pages in a similar manner to that of the rows. When the
need arises, columns are distributed in an order consistent with the
table's

ComponentOrientation

.

PrintMode.FIT_WIDTH

specifies that the output be
scaled smaller, if necessary, to fit the table's entire width
(and thereby all columns) on each page. Width and height are scaled
equally, maintaining the aspect ratio of the output.

The

Printable

heads the portion of table on each page
with the appropriate section from the table's

JTableHeader

,
if it has one.

Header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests
Strings from the formats, providing a single item which may be included
in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the current
page number.

You are encouraged to read the documentation for

MessageFormat

as some characters, such as single-quote,
are special and need to be escaped.

Here's an example of creating a

MessageFormat

that can be
used to print "Duke's Table: Page - " and the current page number:

```java
// notice the escaping of the single quote
// notice how the page number is included with "{0}"
MessageFormat format = new MessageFormat("Duke''s Table: Page - {0}");
```

The

Printable

constrains what it draws to the printable
area of each page that it prints. Under certain circumstances, it may
find it impossible to fit all of a page's content into that area. In
these cases the output may be clipped, but the implementation
makes an effort to do something reasonable. Here are a few situations
where this is known to occur, and how they may be handled by this
particular implementation:

- In any mode, when the header or footer text is too wide to fit
completely in the printable area -- print as much of the text as
possible starting from the beginning, as determined by the table's

ComponentOrientation

.

In any mode, when a row is too tall to fit in the
printable area -- print the upper-most portion of the row
and paint no lower border on the table.

In

PrintMode.NORMAL

when a column
is too wide to fit in the printable area -- print the center
portion of the column and leave the left and right borders
off the table.

It is entirely valid for this

Printable

to be wrapped
inside another in order to create complex reports and documents. You may
even request that different pages be rendered into different sized
printable areas. The implementation must be prepared to handle this
(possibly by doing its layout calculations on the fly). However,
providing different heights to each page will likely not work well
with

PrintMode.NORMAL

when it has to spread columns
across pages.

As far as customizing how the table looks in the printed result,

JTable

itself will take care of hiding the selection
and focus during printing. For additional customizations, your
renderers or painting code can customize the look based on the value
of

JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

Also,

before

calling this method you may wish to

first

modify the state of the table, such as to cancel cell editing or
have the user size the table appropriately. However, you must not
modify the state of the table

after

this

Printable

has been fetched (invalid modifications include changes in size or
underlying data). The behavior of the returned

Printable

is undefined once the table has been changed.

**Parameters:**
- printMode

- the printing mode that the printable should use
- headerFormat

- a

MessageFormat

specifying the text to
be used in printing a header, or null for none
- footerFormat

- a

MessageFormat

The

JTable

is used to display and edit regular two-dimensional tables
of cells.
See

How to Use Tables

in

The Java Tutorial

for task-oriented documentation and examples of using

JTable

.

The

JTable

has many
facilities that make it possible to customize its rendering and editing
but provides defaults for these features so that simple tables can be
set up easily. For example, to set up a table with 10 rows and 10
columns of numbers:

```java
TableModel dataModel = new AbstractTableModel() {
public int getColumnCount() { return 10; }
public int getRowCount() { return 10;}
public Object getValueAt(int row, int col) { return Integer.valueOf(row*col); }
};
JTable table = new JTable(dataModel);
JScrollPane scrollpane = new JScrollPane(table);
```

JTable

s are typically placed inside of a

JScrollPane

. By
default, a

JTable

will adjust its width such that
a horizontal scrollbar is unnecessary. To allow for a horizontal scrollbar,
invoke

setAutoResizeMode(int)

with

AUTO_RESIZE_OFF

.
Note that if you wish to use a

JTable

in a standalone
view (outside of a

JScrollPane

) and want the header
displayed, you can get it using

getTableHeader()

and
display it separately.

To enable sorting and filtering of rows, use a

RowSorter

.
You can set up a row sorter in either of two ways:

- Directly set the

RowSorter

. For example:

table.setRowSorter(new TableRowSorter(model))

.

Set the

autoCreateRowSorter

property to

true

, so that the

JTable

creates a

RowSorter

for
you. For example:

setAutoCreateRowSorter(true)

.

When designing applications that use the

JTable

it is worth paying
close attention to the data structures that will represent the table's data.
The

DefaultTableModel

is a model implementation that
uses a

Vector

of

Vector

s of

Object

s to
store the cell values. As well as copying the data from an
application into the

DefaultTableModel

,
it is also possible to wrap the data in the methods of the

TableModel

interface so that the data can be passed to the

JTable

directly, as in the example above. This often results
in more efficient applications because the model is free to choose the
internal representation that best suits the data.
A good rule of thumb for deciding whether to use the

AbstractTableModel

or the

DefaultTableModel

is to use the

AbstractTableModel

as the base class for creating subclasses and the

DefaultTableModel

when subclassing is not required.

The "TableExample" directory in the demo area of the source distribution
gives a number of complete examples of

JTable

usage,
covering how the

JTable

can be used to provide an
editable view of data taken from a database and how to modify
the columns in the display to use specialized renderers and editors.

The

JTable

uses integers exclusively to refer to both the rows and the columns
of the model that it displays. The

JTable

simply takes a tabular range of cells
and uses

getValueAt(int, int)

to retrieve the
values from the model during painting. It is important to remember that
the column and row indexes returned by various

JTable

methods
are in terms of the

JTable

(the view) and are not
necessarily the same indexes used by the model.

By default, columns may be rearranged in the

JTable

so that the
view's columns appear in a different order to the columns in the model.
This does not affect the implementation of the model at all: when the
columns are reordered, the

JTable

maintains the new order of the columns
internally and converts its column indices before querying the model.

So, when writing a

TableModel

, it is not necessary to listen for column
reordering events as the model will be queried in its own coordinate
system regardless of what is happening in the view.
In the examples area there is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making
use of exactly this technique to interpose yet another coordinate system
where the order of the rows is changed, rather than the order of the columns.

Similarly when using the sorting and filtering functionality
provided by

RowSorter

the underlying

TableModel

does not need to know how to do sorting,
rather

RowSorter

will handle it. Coordinate
conversions will be necessary when using the row based methods of

JTable

with the underlying

TableModel

.
All of

JTable

s row based methods are in terms of the

RowSorter

, which is not necessarily the same as that
of the underlying

TableModel

. For example, the
selection is always in terms of

JTable

so that when
using

RowSorter

you will need to convert using

convertRowIndexToView

or

convertRowIndexToModel

. The following shows how to
convert coordinates from

JTable

to that of the
underlying model:

```java
int[] selection = table.getSelectedRows();
for (int i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) {
selection[i] = table.convertRowIndexToModel(selection[i]);
}
// selection is now in terms of the underlying TableModel
```

By default if sorting is enabled

JTable

will persist the
selection and variable row heights in terms of the model on
sorting. For example if row 0, in terms of the underlying model,
is currently selected, after the sort row 0, in terms of the
underlying model will be selected. Visually the selection may
change, but in terms of the underlying model it will remain the
same. The one exception to that is if the model index is no longer
visible or was removed. For example, if row 0 in terms of model
was filtered out the selection will be empty after the sort.

J2SE 5 adds methods to

JTable

to provide convenient access to some
common printing needs. Simple new

print()

methods allow for quick
and easy addition of printing support to your application. In addition, a new

getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

method is available for more advanced printing needs.

As for all

JComponent

classes, you can use

InputMap

and

ActionMap

to associate an

Action

object with a

KeyStroke

and execute the
action under specified conditions.

will adjust its width such that
a horizontal scrollbar is unnecessary. To allow for a horizontal scrollbar,
invoke

setAutoResizeMode(int)

with

AUTO_RESIZE_OFF

.
Note that if you wish to use a

JTable

in a standalone
view (outside of a

JScrollPane

) and want the header
displayed, you can get it using

getTableHeader()

and
display it separately.

To enable sorting and filtering of rows, use a

RowSorter

.
You can set up a row sorter in either of two ways:

- Directly set the

RowSorter

. For example:

table.setRowSorter(new TableRowSorter(model))

.

Set the

autoCreateRowSorter

property to

true

, so that the

JTable

creates a

RowSorter

for
you. For example:

setAutoCreateRowSorter(true)

.

When designing applications that use the

JTable

it is worth paying
close attention to the data structures that will represent the table's data.
The

DefaultTableModel

is a model implementation that
uses a

Vector

of

Vector

s of

Object

s to
store the cell values. As well as copying the data from an
application into the

DefaultTableModel

,
it is also possible to wrap the data in the methods of the

TableModel

interface so that the data can be passed to the

JTable

directly, as in the example above. This often results
in more efficient applications because the model is free to choose the
internal representation that best suits the data.
A good rule of thumb for deciding whether to use the

AbstractTableModel

or the

DefaultTableModel

is to use the

AbstractTableModel

as the base class for creating subclasses and the

DefaultTableModel

when subclassing is not required.

The "TableExample" directory in the demo area of the source distribution
gives a number of complete examples of

JTable

usage,
covering how the

JTable

can be used to provide an
editable view of data taken from a database and how to modify
the columns in the display to use specialized renderers and editors.

The

JTable

uses integers exclusively to refer to both the rows and the columns
of the model that it displays. The

JTable

simply takes a tabular range of cells
and uses

getValueAt(int, int)

to retrieve the
values from the model during painting. It is important to remember that
the column and row indexes returned by various

JTable

methods
are in terms of the

JTable

(the view) and are not
necessarily the same indexes used by the model.

By default, columns may be rearranged in the

JTable

so that the
view's columns appear in a different order to the columns in the model.
This does not affect the implementation of the model at all: when the
columns are reordered, the

JTable

maintains the new order of the columns
internally and converts its column indices before querying the model.

So, when writing a

TableModel

, it is not necessary to listen for column
reordering events as the model will be queried in its own coordinate
system regardless of what is happening in the view.
In the examples area there is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making
use of exactly this technique to interpose yet another coordinate system
where the order of the rows is changed, rather than the order of the columns.

Similarly when using the sorting and filtering functionality
provided by

RowSorter

the underlying

TableModel

does not need to know how to do sorting,
rather

RowSorter

will handle it. Coordinate
conversions will be necessary when using the row based methods of

JTable

with the underlying

TableModel

.
All of

JTable

s row based methods are in terms of the

RowSorter

, which is not necessarily the same as that
of the underlying

TableModel

. For example, the
selection is always in terms of

JTable

so that when
using

RowSorter

you will need to convert using

convertRowIndexToView

or

convertRowIndexToModel

. The following shows how to
convert coordinates from

JTable

to that of the
underlying model:

```java
int[] selection = table.getSelectedRows();
for (int i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) {
selection[i] = table.convertRowIndexToModel(selection[i]);
}
// selection is now in terms of the underlying TableModel
```

By default if sorting is enabled

JTable

will persist the
selection and variable row heights in terms of the model on
sorting. For example if row 0, in terms of the underlying model,
is currently selected, after the sort row 0, in terms of the
underlying model will be selected. Visually the selection may
change, but in terms of the underlying model it will remain the
same. The one exception to that is if the model index is no longer
visible or was removed. For example, if row 0 in terms of model
was filtered out the selection will be empty after the sort.

J2SE 5 adds methods to

JTable

to provide convenient access to some
common printing needs. Simple new

print()

methods allow for quick
and easy addition of printing support to your application. In addition, a new

getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

method is available for more advanced printing needs.

and execute the

reordering events as the model will be queried in its own coordinate
system regardless of what is happening in the view.
In the examples area there is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making
use of exactly this technique to interpose yet another coordinate system
where the order of the rows is changed, rather than the order of the columns.

Similarly when using the sorting and filtering functionality
provided by

RowSorter

the underlying

TableModel

does not need to know how to do sorting,
rather

RowSorter

will handle it. Coordinate
conversions will be necessary when using the row based methods of

JTable

with the underlying

TableModel

.
All of

JTable

s row based methods are in terms of the

RowSorter

, which is not necessarily the same as that
of the underlying

TableModel

. For example, the
selection is always in terms of

JTable

so that when
using

RowSorter

you will need to convert using

convertRowIndexToView

or

convertRowIndexToModel

. The following shows how to
convert coordinates from

JTable

to that of the
underlying model:

```java
int[] selection = table.getSelectedRows();
for (int i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) {
selection[i] = table.convertRowIndexToModel(selection[i]);
}
// selection is now in terms of the underlying TableModel
```

By default if sorting is enabled

JTable

will persist the
selection and variable row heights in terms of the model on
sorting. For example if row 0, in terms of the underlying model,
is currently selected, after the sort row 0, in terms of the
underlying model will be selected. Visually the selection may
change, but in terms of the underlying model it will remain the
same. The one exception to that is if the model index is no longer
visible or was removed. For example, if row 0 in terms of model
was filtered out the selection will be empty after the sort.

J2SE 5 adds methods to

JTable

to provide convenient access to some
common printing needs. Simple new

print()

methods allow for quick
and easy addition of printing support to your application. In addition, a new

getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

method is available for more advanced printing needs.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- addNotify

```java
public void addNotify()
```

Calls the

configureEnclosingScrollPane

method.

**Overrides:** addNotify

in class

JComponent
**See Also:** configureEnclosingScrollPane()

- configureEnclosingScrollPane

```java
protected void configureEnclosingScrollPane()
```

If this

JTable

is the

viewportView

of an enclosing

JScrollPane

(the usual situation), configure this

ScrollPane

by, amongst other things,
installing the table's

tableHeader

as the

columnHeaderView

of the scroll pane.
When a

JTable

is added to a

JScrollPane

in the usual way,
using

new JScrollPane(myTable)

,

addNotify

is
called in the

JTable

(when the table is added to the viewport).

JTable

's

addNotify

method in turn calls this method,
which is protected so that this default installation procedure can
be overridden by a subclass.

**See Also:** addNotify()

- removeNotify

```java
public void removeNotify()
```

Calls the

unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane

method.

**Overrides:** removeNotify

in class

JComponent
**See Also:** unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane()

- unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane

```java
protected void unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane()
```

Reverses the effect of

configureEnclosingScrollPane

by replacing the

columnHeaderView

of the enclosing
scroll pane with

null

.

JTable

's

removeNotify

method calls
this method, which is protected so that this default uninstallation
procedure can be overridden by a subclass.

TableColumn

. During the editing of cells the editor is fetched from
a

Hashtable

of entries according to the class of the cells in the column. If
there is no entry for this

columnClass

the method returns
the entry for the most specific superclass. The

JTable

installs entries
for

Object

,

Number

, and

Boolean

, all of which can be modified
or replaced.

**Parameters:** columnClass

- return the default cell editor for this columnClass
**Returns:** the default cell editor to be used for this columnClass
**See Also:** setDefaultEditor(java.lang.Class<?>, javax.swing.table.TableCellEditor)

getColumnClass(int)

- setDragEnabled

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)
```

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
table's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the table's

TableUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
an item (in single selection mode) or a selection (in other selection
modes) and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
table's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:** b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

,

getDragEnabled()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDragEnabled

```java
public boolean getDragEnabled()
```

Returns whether or not automatic drag handling is enabled.

**Returns:** the value of the

dragEnabled

property
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setDragEnabled(boolean)

- setDropMode

```java
public final void setDropMode​(
DropMode
dropMode)
```

Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility,
the default for this property is

DropMode.USE_SELECTION

.
Usage of one of the other modes is recommended, however, for an
improved user experience.

DropMode.ON

, for instance,
offers similar behavior of showing items as selected, but does so without
affecting the actual selection in the table.

JTable

supports the following drop modes:

- DropMode.USE_SELECTION
- DropMode.ON
- DropMode.INSERT
- DropMode.INSERT_ROWS
- DropMode.INSERT_COLS
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT_ROWS
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT_COLS

The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a

TransferHandler

that accepts drops.

**Parameters:** dropMode

- the drop mode to use
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the drop mode is unsupported
or

null
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** getDropMode()

,

getDropLocation()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDropMode

```java
public final
DropMode
getDropMode()
```

Returns the drop mode for this component.

**Returns:** the drop mode for this component
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

- getDropLocation

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public final
JTable.DropLocation
getDropLocation()
```

Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
or

null

if no location is to currently be shown.

This method is not meant for querying the drop location
from a

TransferHandler

, as the drop location is only
set after the

TransferHandler

's

canImport

has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown.

When this property changes, a property change event with
name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.

**Returns:** the drop location
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

,

TransferHandler.canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)

- setAutoCreateRowSorter

```java
@BeanProperty
(
preferred
=true,

description
="Whether or not to turn on sorting by default.")
public void setAutoCreateRowSorter​(boolean autoCreateRowSorter)
```

Specifies whether a

RowSorter

should be created for the
table whenever its model changes.

When

setAutoCreateRowSorter(true)

is invoked, a

TableRowSorter

is immediately created and installed on the
table. While the

autoCreateRowSorter

property remains

true

, every time the model is changed, a new

TableRowSorter

is created and set as the table's row sorter.
The default value for the

autoCreateRowSorter

property is

false

.

**Parameters:** autoCreateRowSorter

- whether or not a

RowSorter

should be automatically created
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** TableRowSorter

- getAutoCreateRowSorter

```java
public boolean getAutoCreateRowSorter()
```

Returns

true

if whenever the model changes, a new

RowSorter

should be created and installed
as the table's sorter; otherwise, returns

false

.

**Returns:** true if a

RowSorter

should be created when
the model changes
**Since:** 1.6

- setUpdateSelectionOnSort

```java
@BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="Whether or not to update the selection on sorting")
public void setUpdateSelectionOnSort​(boolean update)
```

Specifies whether the selection should be updated after sorting.
If true, on sorting the selection is reset such that
the same rows, in terms of the model, remain selected. The default
is true.

**Parameters:** update

- whether or not to update the selection on sorting
**Since:** 1.6

- getUpdateSelectionOnSort

```java
public boolean getUpdateSelectionOnSort()
```

Returns true if the selection should be updated after sorting.

**Returns:** whether to update the selection on a sort
**Since:** 1.6

- setRowSorter

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="The table\'s RowSorter")
public void setRowSorter​(
RowSorter
<? extends
TableModel
> sorter)
```

Sets the

RowSorter

.

RowSorter

is used
to provide sorting and filtering to a

JTable

.

This method clears the selection and resets any variable row heights.

This method fires a

PropertyChangeEvent

when appropriate,
with the property name

"rowSorter"

. For
backward-compatibility, this method fires an additional event with the
property name

"sorter"

.

If the underlying model of the

RowSorter

differs from
that of this

JTable

undefined behavior will result.

**Parameters:** sorter

- the

RowSorter

;

null

turns
sorting off
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** TableRowSorter

- getRowSorter

```java
public
RowSorter
<? extends
TableModel
> getRowSorter()
```

Returns the object responsible for sorting.

**Returns:** the object responsible for sorting
**Since:** 1.6

- setSelectionMode

```java
@BeanProperty
(
enumerationValues
={"ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION","ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION","ListSelectionModel.MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION"},

description
="The selection mode used by the row and column selection models.")
public void setSelectionMode​(int selectionMode)
```

Sets the table's selection mode to allow only single selections, a single
contiguous interval, or multiple intervals.

Note:

JTable

provides all the methods for handling
column and row selection. When setting states,
such as

setSelectionMode

, it not only
updates the mode for the row selection model but also sets similar
values in the selection model of the

columnModel

.
If you want to have the row and column selection models operating
in different modes, set them both directly.

Both the row and column selection models for

JTable

default to using a

DefaultListSelectionModel

so that

JTable

works the same way as the

JList

. See the

setSelectionMode

method
in

JList

for details about the modes.

**Parameters:** selectionMode

- the mode used by the row and column selection models
**See Also:** JList.setSelectionMode(int)

Updates the selection models of the table, depending on the state of the
two flags:

toggle

and

extend

. Most changes
to the selection that are the result of keyboard or mouse events received
by the UI are channeled through this method so that the behavior may be
overridden by a subclass. Some UIs may need more functionality than
this method provides, such as when manipulating the lead for discontiguous
selection, and may not call into this method for some selection changes.

This implementation uses the following conventions:

- toggle

:

false

,

extend

:

false

.
Clear the previous selection and ensure the new cell is selected.

toggle

:

false

,

extend

:

true

.
Extend the previous selection from the anchor to the specified cell,
clearing all other selections.

toggle

:

true

,

extend

:

false

.
If the specified cell is selected, deselect it. If it is not selected, select it.

toggle

:

true

,

extend

:

true

.
Apply the selection state of the anchor to all cells between it and the
specified cell.

**Parameters:** rowIndex

row
**Parameters:** columnIndex

- affects the selection at

column

```

Appends

aColumn

to the end of the array of columns held by
this

JTable

's column model.
If the column name of

aColumn

is

.

To add a column to this

JTable

to display the

modelColumn

'th column of data in the model with a
given

width

,

cellRenderer

,
and

cellEditor

you can use:

```java
addColumn(new TableColumn(modelColumn, width, cellRenderer, cellEditor));
```

[Any of the

TableColumn

constructors can be used
instead of this one.]
The model column number is stored inside the

TableColumn

and is used during rendering and editing to locate the appropriates
data values in the model. The model column number does not change
when columns are reordered in the view.

**Parameters:** aColumn

- the

TableColumn

to be added
**See Also:** removeColumn(javax.swing.table.TableColumn)

- removeColumn

```java
public void removeColumn​(
TableColumn
aColumn)
```

Removes

aColumn

from this

JTable

's
array of columns. Note: this method does not remove the column
of data from the model; it just removes the

TableColumn

that was responsible for displaying it.

**Parameters:** aColumn

- the

TableColumn

to be removed
**See Also:** addColumn(javax.swing.table.TableColumn)

- moveColumn

```java
public void moveColumn​(int column,

targetColumn

is
shifted left or right to make room.

**Parameters:** column

- the index of column to be moved
**Parameters:** targetColumn

- the new index of the column

- columnAtPoint

```java
public int columnAtPoint​(
Point
point)
```

Returns the index of the column that

point

lies in,
or -1 if the result is not in the range
[0,

getColumnCount()

-1].

**Parameters:** point

- the location of interest
**Returns:** the index of the column that

point

lies in,
or -1 if the result is not in the range
[0,

getColumnCount()

-1]
**See Also:** rowAtPoint(java.awt.Point)

- rowAtPoint

```java
public int rowAtPoint​(
Point
point)
```

point

lies in,
or -1 if the result is not in the range
[0,

getRowCount()

-1].

**Parameters:** point

- the location of interest
**Returns:** the index of the row that

point

lies in,
or -1 if the result is not in the range
[0,

getRowCount()

-1]
**See Also:** columnAtPoint(java.awt.Point)

- getCellRect

```java
public
Rectangle
getCellRect​(int row,
int column,
boolean includeSpacing)
```

Returns a rectangle for the cell that lies at the intersection of

row

and

column

.
If

includeSpacing

is true then the value returned
has the full height and width of the row and column
specified. If it is false, the returned rectangle is inset by the
intercell spacing to return the true bounds of the rendering or
editing component as it will be set during rendering.

If the column index is valid but the row index is less
than zero the method returns a rectangle with the

y

and

height

values set appropriately
and the

x

and

width

values both set
to zero. In general, when either the row or column indices indicate a
cell outside the appropriate range, the method returns a rectangle
depicting the closest edge of the closest cell that is within
the table's range. When both row and column indices are out
of range the returned rectangle covers the closest
point of the closest cell.

In all cases, calculations that use this method to calculate
results along one axis will not fail because of anomalies in
calculations along the other axis. When the cell is not valid
the

includeSpacing

parameter is ignored.

**Parameters:** row

- the row index where the desired cell
is located
**Parameters:** column

- the column index where the desired cell
is located in the display; this is not
necessarily the same as the column index
in the data model for the table; the

convertColumnIndexToView(int)

method may be used to convert a data
model column index to a display
column index
**Parameters:** includeSpacing

- if false, return the true cell bounds -
computed by subtracting the intercell
spacing from the height and widths of
the column and row models
**Returns:** the rectangle containing the cell at location

row

,

column
**See Also:** getIntercellSpacing()

- doLayout

```java
public void doLayout()
```

Causes this table to lay out its rows and columns. Overridden so
that columns can be resized to accommodate a change in the size of
a containing parent.
Resizes one or more of the columns in the table
so that the total width of all of this

JTable

's
columns is equal to the width of the table.

Before the layout begins the method gets the

resizingColumn

of the

tableHeader

.
When the method is called as a result of the resizing of an enclosing window,
the

resizingColumn

is

null

. This means that resizing
has taken place "outside" the

JTable

and the change -
or "delta" - should be distributed to all of the columns regardless
of this

JTable

's automatic resize mode.

If the

resizingColumn

is not

null

, it is one of
the columns in the table that has changed size rather than
the table itself. In this case the auto-resize modes govern
the way the extra (or deficit) space is distributed
amongst the available columns.

The modes are:

- AUTO_RESIZE_OFF: Don't automatically adjust the column's
widths at all. Use a horizontal scrollbar to accommodate the
columns when their sum exceeds the width of the

Viewport

. If the

JTable

is not
enclosed in a

JScrollPane

this may
leave parts of the table invisible.

AUTO_RESIZE_NEXT_COLUMN: Use just the column after the
resizing column. This results in the "boundary" or divider
between adjacent cells being independently adjustable.

AUTO_RESIZE_SUBSEQUENT_COLUMNS: Use all columns after the
one being adjusted to absorb the changes. This is the
default behavior.

AUTO_RESIZE_LAST_COLUMN: Automatically adjust the
size of the last column only. If the bounds of the last column
prevent the desired size from being allocated, set the
width of the last column to the appropriate limit and make
no further adjustments.

AUTO_RESIZE_ALL_COLUMNS: Spread the delta amongst all the columns
in the

JTable

, including the one that is being
adjusted.

Note:

When a

JTable

makes adjustments
to the widths of the columns it respects their minimum and
maximum values absolutely. It is therefore possible that,
even after this method is called, the total width of the columns
is still not equal to the width of the table. When this happens
the

JTable

does not put itself
in AUTO_RESIZE_OFF mode to bring up a scroll bar, or break other
commitments of its current auto-resize mode -- instead it
allows its bounds to be set larger (or smaller) than the total of the
column minimum or maximum, meaning, either that there
will not be enough room to display all of the columns, or that the
columns will not fill the

JTable

's bounds.
These respectively, result in the clipping of some columns
or an area being painted in the

JTable

's
background color during painting.

The mechanism for distributing the delta amongst the available
columns is provided in a private method in the

JTable

class:

```java
adjustSizes(long targetSize, final Resizable3 r, boolean inverse)
```

an explanation of which is provided in the following section.

Resizable3

is a private
interface that allows any data structure containing a collection
of elements with a size, preferred size, maximum size and minimum size
to have its elements manipulated by the algorithm.

Distributing the delta

Overview

Call "DELTA" the difference between the target size and the
sum of the preferred sizes of the elements in r. The individual
sizes are calculated by taking the original preferred
sizes and adding a share of the DELTA - that share being based on
how far each preferred size is from its limiting bound (minimum or
maximum).

Definition

Call the individual constraints min[i], max[i], and pref[i].

Call their respective sums: MIN, MAX, and PREF.

Each new size will be calculated using:

```java
size[i] = pref[i] + delta[i]
```

where each individual delta[i] is calculated according to:

If (DELTA < 0) we are in shrink mode where:

```java
DELTA
delta[i] = ------------ * (pref[i] - min[i])
(PREF - MIN)
```

If (DELTA > 0) we are in expand mode where:

```java
DELTA
delta[i] = ------------ * (max[i] - pref[i])
(MAX - PREF)
```

The overall effect is that the total size moves that same percentage,
k, towards the total minimum or maximum and that percentage guarantees
accommodation of the required space, DELTA.

Details

Naive evaluation of the formulae presented here would be subject to
the aggregated rounding errors caused by doing this operation in finite
precision (using ints). To deal with this, the multiplying factor above,
is constantly recalculated and this takes account of the rounding
errors in the previous iterations. The result is an algorithm that
produces a set of integers whose values exactly sum to the supplied

targetSize

, and does so by spreading the rounding
errors evenly over the given elements.

When the MAX and MIN bounds are hit

When

targetSize

is outside the [MIN, MAX] range,
the algorithm sets all sizes to their appropriate limiting value
(maximum or minimum).

Prints this

JTable

. Takes steps that the majority of
developers would take in order to print a

JTable

.
In short, it prepares the table, calls

getPrintable

to
fetch an appropriate

Printable

, and then sends it to the
printer.

A

boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether or not
a printing dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user may
use the dialog to change the destination printer or printing attributes,
or even to cancel the print. Another two parameters allow for a

PrintService

and printing attributes to be specified.
These parameters can be used either to provide initial values for the
print dialog, or to specify values when the dialog is not shown.

A second

boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether
or not to perform printing in an interactive mode. If

true

,
a modal progress dialog, with an abort option, is displayed for the
duration of printing . This dialog also prevents any user action which
may affect the table. However, it can not prevent the table from being
modified by code (for example, another thread that posts updates using

SwingUtilities.invokeLater

). It is therefore the
responsibility of the developer to ensure that no other code modifies
the table in any way during printing (invalid modifications include
changes in: size, renderers, or underlying data). Printing behavior is
undefined when the table is changed during printing.

If

false

is specified for this parameter, no dialog will
be displayed and printing will begin immediately on the event-dispatch
thread. This blocks any other events, including repaints, from being
processed until printing is complete. Although this effectively prevents
the table from being changed, it doesn't provide a good user experience.
For this reason, specifying

false

is only recommended when
printing from an application with no visible GUI.

Note: Attempting to show the printing dialog or run interactively, while
in headless mode, will result in a

HeadlessException

.

Before fetching the printable, this method will gracefully terminate
editing, if necessary, to prevent an editor from showing in the printed
result. Additionally,

JTable

will prepare its renderers
during printing such that selection and focus are not indicated.
As far as customizing further how the table looks in the printout,
developers can provide custom renderers or paint code that conditionalize
on the value of

JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

.

See

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- getPrintable

```java
public
Printable
getPrintable​(
JTable.PrintMode
printMode,

MessageFormat
headerFormat,

MessageFormat
footerFormat)
```

Return a

Printable

for use in printing this JTable.

This method is meant for those wishing to customize the default

Printable

implementation used by

JTable

's

print

methods. Developers wanting simply to print the table
should use one of those methods directly.

The

Printable

can be requested in one of two printing modes.
In both modes, it spreads table rows naturally in sequence across
multiple pages, fitting as many rows as possible per page.

PrintMode.NORMAL

specifies that the table be
printed at its current size. In this mode, there may be a need to spread
columns across pages in a similar manner to that of the rows. When the
need arises, columns are distributed in an order consistent with the
table's

ComponentOrientation

.

PrintMode.FIT_WIDTH

specifies that the output be
scaled smaller, if necessary, to fit the table's entire width
(and thereby all columns) on each page. Width and height are scaled
equally, maintaining the aspect ratio of the output.

The

Printable

heads the portion of table on each page
with the appropriate section from the table's

JTableHeader

,
if it has one.

Header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests
Strings from the formats, providing a single item which may be included
in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the current
page number.

You are encouraged to read the documentation for

MessageFormat

as some characters, such as single-quote,
are special and need to be escaped.

Here's an example of creating a

MessageFormat

that can be
used to print "Duke's Table: Page - " and the current page number:

```java
// notice the escaping of the single quote
// notice how the page number is included with "{0}"
MessageFormat format = new MessageFormat("Duke''s Table: Page - {0}");
```

The

Printable

constrains what it draws to the printable
area of each page that it prints. Under certain circumstances, it may
find it impossible to fit all of a page's content into that area. In
these cases the output may be clipped, but the implementation
makes an effort to do something reasonable. Here are a few situations
where this is known to occur, and how they may be handled by this
particular implementation:

- In any mode, when the header or footer text is too wide to fit
completely in the printable area -- print as much of the text as
possible starting from the beginning, as determined by the table's

ComponentOrientation

.

In any mode, when a row is too tall to fit in the
printable area -- print the upper-most portion of the row
and paint no lower border on the table.

In

PrintMode.NORMAL

when a column
is too wide to fit in the printable area -- print the center
portion of the column and leave the left and right borders
off the table.

It is entirely valid for this

Printable

to be wrapped
inside another in order to create complex reports and documents. You may
even request that different pages be rendered into different sized
printable areas. The implementation must be prepared to handle this
(possibly by doing its layout calculations on the fly). However,
providing different heights to each page will likely not work well
with

PrintMode.NORMAL

when it has to spread columns
across pages.

As far as customizing how the table looks in the printed result,

JTable

itself will take care of hiding the selection
and focus during printing. For additional customizations, your
renderers or painting code can customize the look based on the value
of

JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

Also,

before

calling this method you may wish to

first

modify the state of the table, such as to cancel cell editing or
have the user size the table appropriately. However, you must not
modify the state of the table

after

this

Printable

has been fetched (invalid modifications include changes in size or
underlying data). The behavior of the returned

Printable

is undefined once the table has been changed.

**Parameters:** printMode

- the printing mode that the printable should use
**Parameters:** headerFormat

- a

MessageFormat

specifying the text to
be used in printing a header, or null for none
**Parameters:** footerFormat

- a

MessageFormat

specifying the text to
be used in printing a footer, or null for none

Method Detail

- addNotify

```java
public void addNotify()
```

Calls the

configureEnclosingScrollPane

method.

**Overrides:** addNotify

in class

JComponent
**See Also:** configureEnclosingScrollPane()

- configureEnclosingScrollPane

```java
protected void configureEnclosingScrollPane()
```

If this

JTable

is the

viewportView

of an enclosing

JScrollPane

(the usual situation), configure this

ScrollPane

by, amongst other things,
installing the table's

tableHeader

as the

columnHeaderView

of the scroll pane.
When a

JTable

is added to a

JScrollPane

in the usual way,
using

new JScrollPane(myTable)

,

addNotify

is
called in the

JTable

(when the table is added to the viewport).

JTable

's

addNotify

method in turn calls this method,
which is protected so that this default installation procedure can
be overridden by a subclass.

**See Also:** addNotify()

- removeNotify

```java
public void removeNotify()
```

Calls the

unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane

method.

**Overrides:** removeNotify

in class

JComponent
**See Also:** unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane()

- unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane

```java
protected void unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane()
```

Reverses the effect of

configureEnclosingScrollPane

by replacing the

columnHeaderView

of the enclosing
scroll pane with

null

.

JTable

's

removeNotify

method calls
this method, which is protected so that this default uninstallation
procedure can be overridden by a subclass.

**Since:** 1.3

getColumnClass(int)

- setDragEnabled

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)
```

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
table's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the table's

TableUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
an item (in single selection mode) or a selection (in other selection
modes) and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
table's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:** b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

,

getDragEnabled()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDragEnabled

```java
public boolean getDragEnabled()
```

Returns whether or not automatic drag handling is enabled.

**Returns:** the value of the

dragEnabled

property
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setDragEnabled(boolean)

- setDropMode

```java
public final void setDropMode​(
DropMode
dropMode)
```

Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility,
the default for this property is

DropMode.USE_SELECTION

.
Usage of one of the other modes is recommended, however, for an
improved user experience.

DropMode.ON

, for instance,
offers similar behavior of showing items as selected, but does so without
affecting the actual selection in the table.

JTable

supports the following drop modes:

- DropMode.USE_SELECTION
- DropMode.ON
- DropMode.INSERT
- DropMode.INSERT_ROWS
- DropMode.INSERT_COLS
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT_ROWS
- DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT_COLS

The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a

TransferHandler

that accepts drops.

**Parameters:** dropMode

- the drop mode to use
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the drop mode is unsupported
or

null
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** getDropMode()

,

getDropLocation()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDropMode

```java
public final
DropMode
getDropMode()
```

Returns the drop mode for this component.

**Returns:** the drop mode for this component
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

- getDropLocation

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public final
JTable.DropLocation
getDropLocation()
```

Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
or

null

if no location is to currently be shown.

This method is not meant for querying the drop location
from a

TransferHandler

, as the drop location is only
set after the

TransferHandler

's

canImport

has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown.

When this property changes, a property change event with
name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.

**Returns:** the drop location
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

,

TransferHandler.canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)

- setAutoCreateRowSorter

```java
@BeanProperty
(
preferred
=true,

description
="Whether or not to turn on sorting by default.")
public void setAutoCreateRowSorter​(boolean autoCreateRowSorter)
```

Specifies whether a

RowSorter

should be created for the
table whenever its model changes.

When

setAutoCreateRowSorter(true)

is invoked, a

TableRowSorter

is immediately created and installed on the
table. While the

autoCreateRowSorter

property remains

true

, every time the model is changed, a new

TableRowSorter

is created and set as the table's row sorter.
The default value for the

autoCreateRowSorter

property is

false

.

**Parameters:** autoCreateRowSorter

- whether or not a

RowSorter

should be automatically created
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** TableRowSorter

- getAutoCreateRowSorter

```java
public boolean getAutoCreateRowSorter()
```

Returns

true

if whenever the model changes, a new

RowSorter

should be created and installed
as the table's sorter; otherwise, returns

false

.

**Returns:** true if a

RowSorter

should be created when
the model changes
**Since:** 1.6

- setUpdateSelectionOnSort

```java
@BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="Whether or not to update the selection on sorting")
public void setUpdateSelectionOnSort​(boolean update)
```

Specifies whether the selection should be updated after sorting.
If true, on sorting the selection is reset such that
the same rows, in terms of the model, remain selected. The default
is true.

**Parameters:** update

- whether or not to update the selection on sorting
**Since:** 1.6

- getUpdateSelectionOnSort

```java
public boolean getUpdateSelectionOnSort()
```

Returns true if the selection should be updated after sorting.

**Returns:** whether to update the selection on a sort
**Since:** 1.6

- setRowSorter

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="The table\'s RowSorter")
public void setRowSorter​(
RowSorter
<? extends
TableModel
> sorter)
```

Sets the

RowSorter

.

RowSorter

is used
to provide sorting and filtering to a

JTable

.

This method clears the selection and resets any variable row heights.

This method fires a

PropertyChangeEvent

when appropriate,
with the property name

"rowSorter"

. For
backward-compatibility, this method fires an additional event with the
property name

"sorter"

.

If the underlying model of the

RowSorter

differs from
that of this

JTable

undefined behavior will result.

**Parameters:** sorter

- the

RowSorter

;

null

turns
sorting off
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** TableRowSorter

- getRowSorter

```java
public
RowSorter
<? extends
TableModel
> getRowSorter()
```

Returns the object responsible for sorting.

**Returns:** the object responsible for sorting
**Since:** 1.6

- setSelectionMode

```java
@BeanProperty
(
enumerationValues
={"ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION","ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION","ListSelectionModel.MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION"},

description
="The selection mode used by the row and column selection models.")
public void setSelectionMode​(int selectionMode)
```

Sets the table's selection mode to allow only single selections, a single
contiguous interval, or multiple intervals.

Note:

JTable

provides all the methods for handling
column and row selection. When setting states,
such as

setSelectionMode

, it not only
updates the mode for the row selection model but also sets similar
values in the selection model of the

columnModel

.
If you want to have the row and column selection models operating
in different modes, set them both directly.

Both the row and column selection models for

JTable

default to using a

DefaultListSelectionModel

so that

JTable

works the same way as the

JList

. See the

setSelectionMode

method
in

JList

for details about the modes.

**Parameters:** selectionMode

- the mode used by the row and column selection models
**See Also:** JList.setSelectionMode(int)

- setRowSelectionAllowed

visualUpdate
=true,

description
="Select a rectangular region of cells rather than rows or columns.")
public void setCellSelectionEnabled​(boolean cellSelectionEnabled)
```

Sets whether this table allows both a column selection and a
row selection to exist simultaneously. When set,
the table treats the intersection of the row and column selection
models as the selected cells. Override

change this default behavior. This method is equivalent to setting
both the

rowSelectionAllowed

property and

columnSelectionAllowed

property of the

columnModel

to the supplied value.

**Parameters:** cellSelectionEnabled

- changeSelection

```java
public void changeSelection​(int rowIndex,
int columnIndex,
boolean toggle,

Updates the selection models of the table, depending on the state of the
two flags:

toggle

and

extend

. Most changes
to the selection that are the result of keyboard or mouse events received
by the UI are channeled through this method so that the behavior may be
overridden by a subclass. Some UIs may need more functionality than
this method provides, such as when manipulating the lead for discontiguous
selection, and may not call into this method for some selection changes.

This implementation uses the following conventions:

- toggle

:

false

,

extend

:

false

.
Clear the previous selection and ensure the new cell is selected.

toggle

:

false

,

extend

:

true

.
Extend the previous selection from the anchor to the specified cell,
clearing all other selections.

toggle

:

true

,

extend

:

false

.
If the specified cell is selected, deselect it. If it is not selected, select it.

toggle

:

true

,

extend

:

true

.
Apply the selection state of the anchor to all cells between it and the
specified cell.

**Parameters:** rowIndex

- affects the selection at

row
**Parameters:** columnIndex

- affects the selection at

column

.

To add a column to this

JTable

to display the

modelColumn

'th column of data in the model with a
given

width

,

cellRenderer

,
and

cellEditor

you can use:

```java
addColumn(new TableColumn(modelColumn, width, cellRenderer, cellEditor));
```

[Any of the

TableColumn

constructors can be used
instead of this one.]
The model column number is stored inside the

TableColumn

and is used during rendering and editing to locate the appropriates
data values in the model. The model column number does not change
when columns are reordered in the view.

**Parameters:** aColumn

- the

TableColumn

to be added
**See Also:** removeColumn(javax.swing.table.TableColumn)

- removeColumn

```java
public void removeColumn​(
TableColumn
aColumn)
```

Removes

aColumn

from this

JTable

's
array of columns. Note: this method does not remove the column
of data from the model; it just removes the

TableColumn

that was responsible for displaying it.

**Parameters:** aColumn

- the

TableColumn

to be removed
**See Also:** addColumn(javax.swing.table.TableColumn)

- moveColumn

```java
public void moveColumn​(int column,

targetColumn

is
shifted left or right to make room.

**Parameters:** column

**Parameters:** targetColumn

- the new index of the column

- columnAtPoint

```java
public int columnAtPoint​(
Point
point)
```

Returns the index of the column that

point

lies in,
or -1 if the result is not in the range
[0,

getColumnCount()

-1].

**Parameters:** point

- the location of interest
**Returns:** the index of the column that

point

lies in,
or -1 if the result is not in the range
[0,

getColumnCount()

-1]
**See Also:** rowAtPoint(java.awt.Point)

- rowAtPoint

```java
public int rowAtPoint​(
Point
point)

point

lies in,
or -1 if the result is not in the range
[0,

getRowCount()

-1].

**Parameters:** point

- the location of interest
**Returns:** the index of the row that

point

lies in,
or -1 if the result is not in the range
[0,

- getCellRect

```java
public
Rectangle
getCellRect​(int row,
int column,
boolean includeSpacing)
```

Returns a rectangle for the cell that lies at the intersection of

row

and

column

.
If

includeSpacing

is true then the value returned
has the full height and width of the row and column
specified. If it is false, the returned rectangle is inset by the
intercell spacing to return the true bounds of the rendering or
editing component as it will be set during rendering.

If the column index is valid but the row index is less
than zero the method returns a rectangle with the

y

and

height

values set appropriately
and the

x

and

width

values both set
to zero. In general, when either the row or column indices indicate a
cell outside the appropriate range, the method returns a rectangle
depicting the closest edge of the closest cell that is within
the table's range. When both row and column indices are out
of range the returned rectangle covers the closest
point of the closest cell.

In all cases, calculations that use this method to calculate
results along one axis will not fail because of anomalies in
calculations along the other axis. When the cell is not valid
the

includeSpacing

parameter is ignored.

**Parameters:** row

- the row index where the desired cell
is located
**Parameters:** column

- the column index where the desired cell
is located in the display; this is not
necessarily the same as the column index
in the data model for the table; the

convertColumnIndexToView(int)

method may be used to convert a data
model column index to a display
column index
**Parameters:** includeSpacing

- if false, return the true cell bounds -
computed by subtracting the intercell
spacing from the height and widths of
the column and row models
**Returns:** the rectangle containing the cell at location

row

,

column
**See Also:** getIntercellSpacing()

- doLayout

```java
public void doLayout()
```

Causes this table to lay out its rows and columns. Overridden so
that columns can be resized to accommodate a change in the size of
a containing parent.
Resizes one or more of the columns in the table
so that the total width of all of this

JTable

's
columns is equal to the width of the table.

Before the layout begins the method gets the

resizingColumn

of the

tableHeader

.
When the method is called as a result of the resizing of an enclosing window,
the

resizingColumn

is

null

. This means that resizing
has taken place "outside" the

JTable

and the change -
or "delta" - should be distributed to all of the columns regardless
of this

JTable

's automatic resize mode.

If the

resizingColumn

is not

null

, it is one of
the columns in the table that has changed size rather than
the table itself. In this case the auto-resize modes govern
the way the extra (or deficit) space is distributed
amongst the available columns.

The modes are:

- AUTO_RESIZE_OFF: Don't automatically adjust the column's
widths at all. Use a horizontal scrollbar to accommodate the
columns when their sum exceeds the width of the

Viewport

. If the

JTable

is not
enclosed in a

JScrollPane

this may
leave parts of the table invisible.

AUTO_RESIZE_NEXT_COLUMN: Use just the column after the
resizing column. This results in the "boundary" or divider
between adjacent cells being independently adjustable.

AUTO_RESIZE_SUBSEQUENT_COLUMNS: Use all columns after the
one being adjusted to absorb the changes. This is the
default behavior.

AUTO_RESIZE_LAST_COLUMN: Automatically adjust the
size of the last column only. If the bounds of the last column
prevent the desired size from being allocated, set the
width of the last column to the appropriate limit and make
no further adjustments.

AUTO_RESIZE_ALL_COLUMNS: Spread the delta amongst all the columns
in the

JTable

, including the one that is being
adjusted.

Note:

When a

JTable

makes adjustments
to the widths of the columns it respects their minimum and
maximum values absolutely. It is therefore possible that,
even after this method is called, the total width of the columns
is still not equal to the width of the table. When this happens
the

JTable

does not put itself
in AUTO_RESIZE_OFF mode to bring up a scroll bar, or break other
commitments of its current auto-resize mode -- instead it
allows its bounds to be set larger (or smaller) than the total of the
column minimum or maximum, meaning, either that there
will not be enough room to display all of the columns, or that the
columns will not fill the

JTable

's bounds.
These respectively, result in the clipping of some columns
or an area being painted in the

JTable

's
background color during painting.

The mechanism for distributing the delta amongst the available
columns is provided in a private method in the

JTable

class:

```java
adjustSizes(long targetSize, final Resizable3 r, boolean inverse)
```

an explanation of which is provided in the following section.

Resizable3

is a private
interface that allows any data structure containing a collection
of elements with a size, preferred size, maximum size and minimum size
to have its elements manipulated by the algorithm.

Distributing the delta

Overview

Call "DELTA" the difference between the target size and the
sum of the preferred sizes of the elements in r. The individual
sizes are calculated by taking the original preferred
sizes and adding a share of the DELTA - that share being based on
how far each preferred size is from its limiting bound (minimum or
maximum).

Definition

Call the individual constraints min[i], max[i], and pref[i].

Call their respective sums: MIN, MAX, and PREF.

Each new size will be calculated using:

```java
size[i] = pref[i] + delta[i]
```

where each individual delta[i] is calculated according to:

If (DELTA < 0) we are in shrink mode where:

```java
DELTA
delta[i] = ------------ * (pref[i] - min[i])
(PREF - MIN)
```

If (DELTA > 0) we are in expand mode where:

```java
DELTA
delta[i] = ------------ * (max[i] - pref[i])
(MAX - PREF)
```

The overall effect is that the total size moves that same percentage,
k, towards the total minimum or maximum and that percentage guarantees
accommodation of the required space, DELTA.

Details

Naive evaluation of the formulae presented here would be subject to
the aggregated rounding errors caused by doing this operation in finite
precision (using ints). To deal with this, the multiplying factor above,
is constantly recalculated and this takes account of the rounding
errors in the previous iterations. The result is an algorithm that
produces a set of integers whose values exactly sum to the supplied

targetSize

, and does so by spreading the rounding
errors evenly over the given elements.

When the MAX and MIN bounds are hit

When

targetSize

is outside the [MIN, MAX] range,
the algorithm sets all sizes to their appropriate limiting value
(maximum or minimum).

```

Prints this

JTable

. Takes steps that the majority of
developers would take in order to print a

JTable

.
In short, it prepares the table, calls

getPrintable

to
fetch an appropriate

Printable

, and then sends it to the
printer.

A

boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether or not
a printing dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user may
use the dialog to change the destination printer or printing attributes,
or even to cancel the print. Another two parameters allow for a

PrintService

and printing attributes to be specified.
These parameters can be used either to provide initial values for the
print dialog, or to specify values when the dialog is not shown.

A second

boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether
or not to perform printing in an interactive mode. If

true

,
a modal progress dialog, with an abort option, is displayed for the
duration of printing . This dialog also prevents any user action which
may affect the table. However, it can not prevent the table from being
modified by code (for example, another thread that posts updates using

SwingUtilities.invokeLater

). It is therefore the
responsibility of the developer to ensure that no other code modifies
the table in any way during printing (invalid modifications include
changes in: size, renderers, or underlying data). Printing behavior is
undefined when the table is changed during printing.

If

false

is specified for this parameter, no dialog will
be displayed and printing will begin immediately on the event-dispatch
thread. This blocks any other events, including repaints, from being
processed until printing is complete. Although this effectively prevents
the table from being changed, it doesn't provide a good user experience.
For this reason, specifying

false

is only recommended when
printing from an application with no visible GUI.

Note: Attempting to show the printing dialog or run interactively, while
in headless mode, will result in a

HeadlessException

.

Before fetching the printable, this method will gracefully terminate
editing, if necessary, to prevent an editor from showing in the printed
result. Additionally,

JTable

will prepare its renderers
during printing such that selection and focus are not indicated.
As far as customizing further how the table looks in the printout,
developers can provide custom renderers or paint code that conditionalize
on the value of

JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

.

See

getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- getPrintable

```java
public
Printable
getPrintable​(
JTable.PrintMode
printMode,

MessageFormat
headerFormat,

MessageFormat
footerFormat)
```

Return a

Printable

for use in printing this JTable.

This method is meant for those wishing to customize the default

Printable

implementation used by

JTable

's

print

methods. Developers wanting simply to print the table
should use one of those methods directly.

The

Printable

can be requested in one of two printing modes.
In both modes, it spreads table rows naturally in sequence across
multiple pages, fitting as many rows as possible per page.

PrintMode.NORMAL

specifies that the table be
printed at its current size. In this mode, there may be a need to spread
columns across pages in a similar manner to that of the rows. When the
need arises, columns are distributed in an order consistent with the
table's

ComponentOrientation

.

PrintMode.FIT_WIDTH

specifies that the output be
scaled smaller, if necessary, to fit the table's entire width
(and thereby all columns) on each page. Width and height are scaled
equally, maintaining the aspect ratio of the output.

The

Printable

heads the portion of table on each page
with the appropriate section from the table's

JTableHeader

,
if it has one.

Header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests
Strings from the formats, providing a single item which may be included
in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the current
page number.

You are encouraged to read the documentation for

MessageFormat

as some characters, such as single-quote,
are special and need to be escaped.

Here's an example of creating a

MessageFormat

that can be
used to print "Duke's Table: Page - " and the current page number:

```java
// notice the escaping of the single quote
// notice how the page number is included with "{0}"
MessageFormat format = new MessageFormat("Duke''s Table: Page - {0}");
```

The

Printable

constrains what it draws to the printable
area of each page that it prints. Under certain circumstances, it may
find it impossible to fit all of a page's content into that area. In
these cases the output may be clipped, but the implementation
makes an effort to do something reasonable. Here are a few situations
where this is known to occur, and how they may be handled by this
particular implementation:

- In any mode, when the header or footer text is too wide to fit
completely in the printable area -- print as much of the text as
possible starting from the beginning, as determined by the table's

ComponentOrientation

.

In any mode, when a row is too tall to fit in the
printable area -- print the upper-most portion of the row
and paint no lower border on the table.

In

PrintMode.NORMAL

when a column
is too wide to fit in the printable area -- print the center
portion of the column and leave the left and right borders
off the table.

It is entirely valid for this

Printable

to be wrapped
inside another in order to create complex reports and documents. You may
even request that different pages be rendered into different sized
printable areas. The implementation must be prepared to handle this
(possibly by doing its layout calculations on the fly). However,
providing different heights to each page will likely not work well
with

PrintMode.NORMAL

when it has to spread columns
across pages.

As far as customizing how the table looks in the printed result,

JTable

itself will take care of hiding the selection
and focus during printing. For additional customizations, your
renderers or painting code can customize the look based on the value
of

JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

Also,

before

calling this method you may wish to

first

modify the state of the table, such as to cancel cell editing or
have the user size the table appropriately. However, you must not
modify the state of the table

after

this

Printable

has been fetched (invalid modifications include changes in size or
underlying data). The behavior of the returned

Printable

is undefined once the table has been changed.

**Parameters:** printMode

- the printing mode that the printable should use
**Parameters:** headerFormat

- a

MessageFormat

specifying the text to
be used in printing a header, or null for none
**Parameters:** footerFormat

- a

MessageFormat

specifying the text to
be used in printing a footer, or null for none
**Returns:** a

Printable

for printing this JTable

setDragEnabled

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)
```

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
table's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the table's

TableUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
an item (in single selection mode) or a selection (in other selection
modes) and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
table's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:** b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling
**Throws:** HeadlessException

```

Updates the selection models of the table, depending on the state of the
two flags:

toggle

and

extend

. Most changes
to the selection that are the result of keyboard or mouse events received
by the UI are channeled through this method so that the behavior may be
overridden by a subclass. Some UIs may need more functionality than
this method provides, such as when manipulating the lead for discontiguous
selection, and may not call into this method for some selection changes.

This implementation uses the following conventions:

- toggle

:

false

,

extend

:

false

.
Clear the previous selection and ensure the new cell is selected.

toggle

:

false

,

extend

:

true

.
Extend the previous selection from the anchor to the specified cell,
clearing all other selections.

toggle

:

true

,

extend

:

false

.
If the specified cell is selected, deselect it. If it is not selected, select it.

toggle

:

true

,

extend

:

true

.
Apply the selection state of the anchor to all cells between it and the
specified cell.

**Parameters:** rowIndex

- affects the selection at

row
**Parameters:** columnIndex

- affects the selection at

column
**Parameters:** toggle

- see description above
**Parameters:** extend

to the selection that are the result of keyboard or mouse events received
by the UI are channeled through this method so that the behavior may be
overridden by a subclass. Some UIs may need more functionality than
this method provides, such as when manipulating the lead for discontiguous
selection, and may not call into this method for some selection changes.

getCellRect

```java
public
Rectangle
getCellRect​(int row,
int column,
boolean includeSpacing)
```

Returns a rectangle for the cell that lies at the intersection of

row

and

column

.
If

includeSpacing

is true then the value returned
has the full height and width of the row and column
specified. If it is false, the returned rectangle is inset by the
intercell spacing to return the true bounds of the rendering or
editing component as it will be set during rendering.

If the column index is valid but the row index is less
than zero the method returns a rectangle with the

y

and

height

values set appropriately
and the

x

and

width

values both set
to zero. In general, when either the row or column indices indicate a
cell outside the appropriate range, the method returns a rectangle
depicting the closest edge of the closest cell that is within
the table's range. When both row and column indices are out
of range the returned rectangle covers the closest
point of the closest cell.

In all cases, calculations that use this method to calculate
results along one axis will not fail because of anomalies in
calculations along the other axis. When the cell is not valid
the

includeSpacing

parameter is ignored.

**Parameters:** row

- the row index where the desired cell
is located
**Parameters:** column

- the column index where the desired cell
is located in the display; this is not
necessarily the same as the column index
in the data model for the table; the

convertColumnIndexToView(int)

method may be used to convert a data
model column index to a display
column index
**Parameters:** includeSpacing

- if false, return the true cell bounds -
computed by subtracting the intercell
spacing from the height and widths of
the column and row models
**Returns:** the rectangle containing the cell at location

row

,

column
**See Also:** getIntercellSpacing()

doLayout

```java
public void doLayout()
```

Causes this table to lay out its rows and columns. Overridden so
that columns can be resized to accommodate a change in the size of
a containing parent.
Resizes one or more of the columns in the table
so that the total width of all of this

JTable

's
columns is equal to the width of the table.

Before the layout begins the method gets the

resizingColumn

of the

tableHeader

.
When the method is called as a result of the resizing of an enclosing window,
the

resizingColumn

is

null

. This means that resizing
has taken place "outside" the

JTable

and the change -
or "delta" - should be distributed to all of the columns regardless
of this

JTable

's automatic resize mode.

If the

resizingColumn

is not

null

, it is one of
the columns in the table that has changed size rather than
the table itself. In this case the auto-resize modes govern
the way the extra (or deficit) space is distributed
amongst the available columns.

The modes are:

- AUTO_RESIZE_OFF: Don't automatically adjust the column's
widths at all. Use a horizontal scrollbar to accommodate the
columns when their sum exceeds the width of the

Viewport

. If the

JTable

is not
enclosed in a

JScrollPane

this may
leave parts of the table invisible.

AUTO_RESIZE_NEXT_COLUMN: Use just the column after the
resizing column. This results in the "boundary" or divider
between adjacent cells being independently adjustable.

AUTO_RESIZE_SUBSEQUENT_COLUMNS: Use all columns after the
one being adjusted to absorb the changes. This is the
default behavior.

AUTO_RESIZE_LAST_COLUMN: Automatically adjust the
size of the last column only. If the bounds of the last column
prevent the desired size from being allocated, set the
width of the last column to the appropriate limit and make
no further adjustments.

AUTO_RESIZE_ALL_COLUMNS: Spread the delta amongst all the columns
in the

JTable

, including the one that is being
adjusted.

Note:

When a

JTable

makes adjustments
to the widths of the columns it respects their minimum and
maximum values absolutely. It is therefore possible that,
even after this method is called, the total width of the columns
is still not equal to the width of the table. When this happens
the

JTable

does not put itself
in AUTO_RESIZE_OFF mode to bring up a scroll bar, or break other
commitments of its current auto-resize mode -- instead it
allows its bounds to be set larger (or smaller) than the total of the
column minimum or maximum, meaning, either that there
will not be enough room to display all of the columns, or that the
columns will not fill the

JTable

's bounds.
These respectively, result in the clipping of some columns
or an area being painted in the

JTable

's
background color during painting.

The mechanism for distributing the delta amongst the available
columns is provided in a private method in the

JTable

Resizable3

is a private
interface that allows any data structure containing a collection
of elements with a size, preferred size, maximum size and minimum size
to have its elements manipulated by the algorithm.

Distributing the delta

Overview

Call "DELTA" the difference between the target size and the
sum of the preferred sizes of the elements in r. The individual
sizes are calculated by taking the original preferred
sizes and adding a share of the DELTA - that share being based on
how far each preferred size is from its limiting bound (minimum or
maximum).

Definition

Call the individual constraints min[i], max[i], and pref[i].

Call their respective sums: MIN, MAX, and PREF.

Each new size will be calculated using:

```java
size[i] = pref[i] + delta[i]
```

where each individual delta[i] is calculated according to:

If (DELTA < 0) we are in shrink mode where:

```java
DELTA
delta[i] = ------------ * (pref[i] - min[i])
(PREF - MIN)
```

If (DELTA > 0) we are in expand mode where:

```java
DELTA
delta[i] = ------------ * (max[i] - pref[i])
(MAX - PREF)
```

The overall effect is that the total size moves that same percentage,
k, towards the total minimum or maximum and that percentage guarantees
accommodation of the required space, DELTA.

Details

Naive evaluation of the formulae presented here would be subject to
the aggregated rounding errors caused by doing this operation in finite
precision (using ints). To deal with this, the multiplying factor above,
is constantly recalculated and this takes account of the rounding
errors in the previous iterations. The result is an algorithm that
produces a set of integers whose values exactly sum to the supplied

targetSize

, and does so by spreading the rounding
errors evenly over the given elements.

When the MAX and MIN bounds are hit

When

targetSize

is outside the [MIN, MAX] range,
the algorithm sets all sizes to their appropriate limiting value
(maximum or minimum).

#### doLayout

public void doLayout()

Causes this table to lay out its rows and columns. Overridden so
that columns can be resized to accommodate a change in the size of
a containing parent.
Resizes one or more of the columns in the table
so that the total width of all of this

JTable

's
columns is equal to the width of the table.

Before the layout begins the method gets the

resizingColumn

of the

tableHeader

.
When the method is called as a result of the resizing of an enclosing window,
the

resizingColumn

is

null

. This means that resizing
has taken place "outside" the

JTable

and the change -
or "delta" - should be distributed to all of the columns regardless
of this

JTable

's automatic resize mode.

If the

resizingColumn

is not

null

, it is one of
the columns in the table that has changed size rather than
the table itself. In this case the auto-resize modes govern
the way the extra (or deficit) space is distributed
amongst the available columns.

The modes are:

- AUTO_RESIZE_OFF: Don't automatically adjust the column's
widths at all. Use a horizontal scrollbar to accommodate the
columns when their sum exceeds the width of the

Viewport

. If the

JTable

is not
enclosed in a

JScrollPane

this may
leave parts of the table invisible.

AUTO_RESIZE_NEXT_COLUMN: Use just the column after the
resizing column. This results in the "boundary" or divider
between adjacent cells being independently adjustable.

AUTO_RESIZE_SUBSEQUENT_COLUMNS: Use all columns after the
one being adjusted to absorb the changes. This is the
default behavior.

AUTO_RESIZE_LAST_COLUMN: Automatically adjust the
size of the last column only. If the bounds of the last column
prevent the desired size from being allocated, set the
width of the last column to the appropriate limit and make
no further adjustments.

AUTO_RESIZE_ALL_COLUMNS: Spread the delta amongst all the columns
in the

JTable

, including the one that is being
adjusted.

Note:

When a

JTable

makes adjustments
to the widths of the columns it respects their minimum and
maximum values absolutely. It is therefore possible that,
even after this method is called, the total width of the columns
is still not equal to the width of the table. When this happens
the

JTable

does not put itself
in AUTO_RESIZE_OFF mode to bring up a scroll bar, or break other
commitments of its current auto-resize mode -- instead it
allows its bounds to be set larger (or smaller) than the total of the
column minimum or maximum, meaning, either that there
will not be enough room to display all of the columns, or that the
columns will not fill the

JTable

's bounds.
These respectively, result in the clipping of some columns
or an area being painted in the

JTable

's
background color during painting.

columns is provided in a private method in the

errors evenly over the given elements.

When the MAX and MIN bounds are hit

When

targetSize

is outside the [MIN, MAX] range,
the algorithm sets all sizes to their appropriate limiting value
(maximum or minimum).

Each new size will be calculated using:

```java
size[i] = pref[i] + delta[i]
```

where each individual delta[i] is calculated according to:

If (DELTA < 0) we are in shrink mode where:

```java
DELTA
delta[i] = ------------ * (pref[i] - min[i])
(PREF - MIN)
```

If (DELTA > 0) we are in expand mode where:

```java
DELTA
delta[i] = ------------ * (max[i] - pref[i])
(MAX - PREF)
```

The overall effect is that the total size moves that same percentage,
k, towards the total minimum or maximum and that percentage guarantees
accommodation of the required space, DELTA.

Naive evaluation of the formulae presented here would be subject to
the aggregated rounding errors caused by doing this operation in finite
precision (using ints). To deal with this, the multiplying factor above,
is constantly recalculated and this takes account of the rounding
errors in the previous iterations. The result is an algorithm that
produces a set of integers whose values exactly sum to the supplied

targetSize

, and does so by spreading the rounding
errors evenly over the given elements.

Prints this

JTable

. Takes steps that the majority of
developers would take in order to print a

JTable

.
In short, it prepares the table, calls

getPrintable

to
fetch an appropriate

Printable

, and then sends it to the
printer.

A

boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether or not
a printing dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user may
use the dialog to change the destination printer or printing attributes,
or even to cancel the print. Another two parameters allow for a

PrintService

and printing attributes to be specified.
These parameters can be used either to provide initial values for the
print dialog, or to specify values when the dialog is not shown.

A second

boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether
or not to perform printing in an interactive mode. If

true

,
a modal progress dialog, with an abort option, is displayed for the
duration of printing . This dialog also prevents any user action which
may affect the table. However, it can not prevent the table from being
modified by code (for example, another thread that posts updates using

SwingUtilities.invokeLater

). It is therefore the
responsibility of the developer to ensure that no other code modifies
the table in any way during printing (invalid modifications include
changes in: size, renderers, or underlying data). Printing behavior is
undefined when the table is changed during printing.

If

false

is specified for this parameter, no dialog will
be displayed and printing will begin immediately on the event-dispatch
thread. This blocks any other events, including repaints, from being
processed until printing is complete. Although this effectively prevents
the table from being changed, it doesn't provide a good user experience.
For this reason, specifying

false

is only recommended when
printing from an application with no visible GUI.

Note: Attempting to show the printing dialog or run interactively, while
in headless mode, will result in a

HeadlessException

.

Before fetching the printable, this method will gracefully terminate
editing, if necessary, to prevent an editor from showing in the printed
result. Additionally,

JTable

will prepare its renderers
during printing such that selection and focus are not indicated.
As far as customizing further how the table looks in the printout,
developers can provide custom renderers or paint code that conditionalize
on the value of

JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

.

See

getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

printed.

the table from being changed, it doesn't provide a good user experience.
For this reason, specifying

false

is only recommended when
printing from an application with no visible GUI.

Note: Attempting to show the printing dialog or run interactively, while
in headless mode, will result in a

HeadlessException

.

Before fetching the printable, this method will gracefully terminate
editing, if necessary, to prevent an editor from showing in the printed
result. Additionally,

JTable

will prepare its renderers
during printing such that selection and focus are not indicated.
As far as customizing further how the table looks in the printout,
developers can provide custom renderers or paint code that conditionalize
on the value of

JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

.

See

getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

for more description on how the table is
printed.

A

boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether or not
a printing dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user may
use the dialog to change the destination printer or printing attributes,
or even to cancel the print. Another two parameters allow for a

PrintService

and printing attributes to be specified.
These parameters can be used either to provide initial values for the
print dialog, or to specify values when the dialog is not shown.

A second

boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether
or not to perform printing in an interactive mode. If

true

,
a modal progress dialog, with an abort option, is displayed for the
duration of printing . This dialog also prevents any user action which
may affect the table. However, it can not prevent the table from being
modified by code (for example, another thread that posts updates using

SwingUtilities.invokeLater

). It is therefore the
responsibility of the developer to ensure that no other code modifies
the table in any way during printing (invalid modifications include
changes in: size, renderers, or underlying data). Printing behavior is
undefined when the table is changed during printing.

If

false

is specified for this parameter, no dialog will
be displayed and printing will begin immediately on the event-dispatch
thread. This blocks any other events, including repaints, from being
processed until printing is complete. Although this effectively prevents
the table from being changed, it doesn't provide a good user experience.

```java

getPrintable​(
JTable.PrintMode
printMode,

footerFormat)
```

Return a

Printable

for use in printing this JTable.

This method is meant for those wishing to customize the default

Printable

implementation used by

JTable

's

print

methods. Developers wanting simply to print the table
should use one of those methods directly.

The

Printable

can be requested in one of two printing modes.
In both modes, it spreads table rows naturally in sequence across
multiple pages, fitting as many rows as possible per page.

PrintMode.NORMAL

specifies that the table be
printed at its current size. In this mode, there may be a need to spread
columns across pages in a similar manner to that of the rows. When the
need arises, columns are distributed in an order consistent with the
table's

ComponentOrientation

.

PrintMode.FIT_WIDTH

specifies that the output be
scaled smaller, if necessary, to fit the table's entire width
(and thereby all columns) on each page. Width and height are scaled
equally, maintaining the aspect ratio of the output.

The

Printable

heads the portion of table on each page
with the appropriate section from the table's

JTableHeader

,
if it has one.

Header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests
Strings from the formats, providing a single item which may be included
in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the current
page number.

You are encouraged to read the documentation for

MessageFormat

as some characters, such as single-quote,
are special and need to be escaped.

Here's an example of creating a

MessageFormat

that can be
used to print "Duke's Table: Page - " and the current page number:

```java
// notice the escaping of the single quote
// notice how the page number is included with "{0}"
MessageFormat format = new MessageFormat("Duke''s Table: Page - {0}");
```

The

Printable

constrains what it draws to the printable
area of each page that it prints. Under certain circumstances, it may
find it impossible to fit all of a page's content into that area. In
these cases the output may be clipped, but the implementation
makes an effort to do something reasonable. Here are a few situations
where this is known to occur, and how they may be handled by this
particular implementation:

- In any mode, when the header or footer text is too wide to fit
completely in the printable area -- print as much of the text as
possible starting from the beginning, as determined by the table's

ComponentOrientation

.

In any mode, when a row is too tall to fit in the
printable area -- print the upper-most portion of the row
and paint no lower border on the table.

In

PrintMode.NORMAL

when a column
is too wide to fit in the printable area -- print the center
portion of the column and leave the left and right borders
off the table.

It is entirely valid for this

Printable

to be wrapped
inside another in order to create complex reports and documents. You may
even request that different pages be rendered into different sized
printable areas. The implementation must be prepared to handle this
(possibly by doing its layout calculations on the fly). However,
providing different heights to each page will likely not work well
with

PrintMode.NORMAL

when it has to spread columns
across pages.

As far as customizing how the table looks in the printed result,

JTable

itself will take care of hiding the selection
and focus during printing. For additional customizations, your
renderers or painting code can customize the look based on the value
of

JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

Also,

before

calling this method you may wish to

first

modify the state of the table, such as to cancel cell editing or
have the user size the table appropriately. However, you must not
modify the state of the table

after

this

Printable

has been fetched (invalid modifications include changes in size or
underlying data). The behavior of the returned

Printable

is undefined once the table has been changed.

**Parameters:** printMode

- the printing mode that the printable should use
**Parameters:** headerFormat

- a

MessageFormat

specifying the text to
be used in printing a header, or null for none
**Parameters:** footerFormat

is undefined once the table has been changed.

Here's an example of creating a

MessageFormat

that can be
used to print "Duke's Table: Page - " and the current page number:

```java
// notice the escaping of the single quote
// notice how the page number is included with "{0}"
MessageFormat format = new MessageFormat("Duke''s Table: Page - {0}");
```

The

Printable

constrains what it draws to the printable
area of each page that it prints. Under certain circumstances, it may
find it impossible to fit all of a page's content into that area. In
these cases the output may be clipped, but the implementation
makes an effort to do something reasonable. Here are a few situations
where this is known to occur, and how they may be handled by this
particular implementation:

- In any mode, when the header or footer text is too wide to fit
completely in the printable area -- print as much of the text as
possible starting from the beginning, as determined by the table's

ComponentOrientation

.

In any mode, when a row is too tall to fit in the
printable area -- print the upper-most portion of the row
and paint no lower border on the table.

In

PrintMode.NORMAL

when a column
is too wide to fit in the printable area -- print the center
portion of the column and leave the left and right borders
off the table.

It is entirely valid for this

Printable

to be wrapped
inside another in order to create complex reports and documents. You may
even request that different pages be rendered into different sized
printable areas. The implementation must be prepared to handle this
(possibly by doing its layout calculations on the fly). However,
providing different heights to each page will likely not work well
with

PrintMode.NORMAL

when it has to spread columns
across pages.

As far as customizing how the table looks in the printed result,

JTable

itself will take care of hiding the selection
and focus during printing. For additional customizations, your
renderers or painting code can customize the look based on the value
of

JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()

Also,

before

calling this method you may wish to

first

modify the state of the table, such as to cancel cell editing or
have the user size the table appropriately. However, you must not
modify the state of the table

after
