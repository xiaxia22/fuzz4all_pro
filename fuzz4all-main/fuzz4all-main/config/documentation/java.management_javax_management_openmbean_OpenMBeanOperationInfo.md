# Interface OpenMBeanOperationInfo

**Source:** `java.management\javax\management\openmbean\OpenMBeanOperationInfo.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
```

Describes an operation of an Open MBean.

This interface declares the same methods as the class

MBeanOperationInfo

. A class implementing this
interface (typically

OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport

) should
extend

MBeanOperationInfo

.

The

getSignature()

method should return at runtime an
array of instances of a subclass of

MBeanParameterInfo

which implements the

OpenMBeanParameterInfo

interface
(typically

OpenMBeanParameterInfoSupport

).

**All Known Implementing Classes:** OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport

### Method Details

#### String
getDescription()

Returns a human readable description of the operation
described by this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance.

**Returns:**
- the description.

---

#### String
getName()

Returns the name of the operation
described by this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance.

**Returns:**
- the name.

---

#### MBeanParameterInfo
[] getSignature()

Returns an array of

OpenMBeanParameterInfo

instances
describing each parameter in the signature of the operation
described by this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance.
Each instance in the returned array should actually be a
subclass of

MBeanParameterInfo

which implements the

OpenMBeanParameterInfo

interface (typically

OpenMBeanParameterInfoSupport

).

**Returns:**
- the signature.

---

#### int getImpact()

Returns an

int

constant qualifying the impact of the
operation described by this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance.

The returned constant is one of

MBeanOperationInfo.INFO

,

MBeanOperationInfo.ACTION

,

MBeanOperationInfo.ACTION_INFO

, or

MBeanOperationInfo.UNKNOWN

.

**Returns:**
- the impact code.

---

#### String
getReturnType()

Returns the fully qualified Java class name of the values
returned by the operation described by this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance. This method should
return the same value as a call to

getReturnOpenType().getClassName()

.

**Returns:**
- the return type.

---

#### OpenType
<?> getReturnOpenType()

Returns the

open type

of the values returned by the
operation described by this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance.

**Returns:**
- the return type.

---

#### boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Compares the specified

obj

parameter with this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance for equality.

Returns

true

if and only if all of the following statements are true:

- obj

is non null,
- obj

also implements the

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

interface,
- their names are equal
- their signatures are equal
- their return open types are equal
- their impacts are equal

This ensures that this

equals

method works properly for

obj

parameters which are
different implementations of the

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

interface.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to be compared for equality with this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance;

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified object is equal to this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance.

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance.

The hash code of an

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance is the sum of the hash codes
of all elements of information used in

equals

comparisons
(ie: its name, return open type, impact and signature,
where the signature hashCode is calculated by a call to

java.util.Arrays.asList(this.getSignature).hashCode()

).

This ensures that

t1.equals(t2)

implies that

t1.hashCode()==t2.hashCode()

for any two

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instances

t1

and

t2

,
as required by the general contract of the method

Object.hashCode()

.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- the hash code value for this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### String
toString()

Returns a string representation of this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance.

The string representation consists of the name of this class
(ie

javax.management.openmbean.OpenMBeanOperationInfo

),
and the name, signature, return open type and impact of the described operation.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this

OpenMBeanOperationInfo

instance
