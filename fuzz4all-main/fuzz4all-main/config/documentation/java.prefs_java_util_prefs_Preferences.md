# Class Preferences

**Source:** `java.prefs\java\util\prefs\Preferences.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Preferences

extends
Object
```

A node in a hierarchical collection of preference data. This class
allows applications to store and retrieve user and system
preference and configuration data. This data is stored
persistently in an implementation-dependent backing store. Typical
implementations include flat files, OS-specific registries,
directory servers and SQL databases. The user of this class needn't
be concerned with details of the backing store.

There are two separate trees of preference nodes, one for user
preferences and one for system preferences. Each user has a separate user
preference tree, and all users in a given system share the same system
preference tree. The precise description of "user" and "system" will vary
from implementation to implementation. Typical information stored in the
user preference tree might include font choice, color choice, or preferred
window location and size for a particular application. Typical information
stored in the system preference tree might include installation
configuration data for an application.

Nodes in a preference tree are named in a similar fashion to
directories in a hierarchical file system. Every node in a preference
tree has a

node name

(which is not necessarily unique),
a unique

absolute path name

, and a path name

relative

to each
ancestor including itself.

The root node has a node name of the empty string (""). Every other
node has an arbitrary node name, specified at the time it is created. The
only restrictions on this name are that it cannot be the empty string, and
it cannot contain the slash character ('/').

The root node has an absolute path name of

"/"

. Children of
the root node have absolute path names of

"/" +

<node
name>

. All other nodes have absolute path names of

<parent's
absolute path name>

+ "/" +

<node name>

.
Note that all absolute path names begin with the slash character.

A node

n

's path name relative to its ancestor

a

is simply the string that must be appended to

a

's absolute path name
in order to form

n

's absolute path name, with the initial slash
character (if present) removed. Note that:

- No relative path names begin with the slash character.

Every node's path name relative to itself is the empty string.

Every node's path name relative to its parent is its node name (except
for the root node, which does not have a parent).

Every node's path name relative to the root is its absolute path name
with the initial slash character removed.

Note finally that:

- No path name contains multiple consecutive slash characters.

No path name with the exception of the root's absolute path name
ends in the slash character.

Any string that conforms to these two rules is a valid path name.

All of the methods that modify preferences data are permitted to operate
asynchronously; they may return immediately, and changes will eventually
propagate to the persistent backing store with an implementation-dependent
delay. The

flush

method may be used to synchronously force
updates to the backing store. Normal termination of the Java Virtual
Machine will

not

result in the loss of pending updates -- an explicit

flush

invocation is

not

required upon termination to ensure
that pending updates are made persistent.

All of the methods that read preferences from a

Preferences

object require the invoker to provide a default value. The default value is
returned if no value has been previously set

or if the backing store is
unavailable

. The intent is to allow applications to operate, albeit
with slightly degraded functionality, even if the backing store becomes
unavailable. Several methods, like

flush

, have semantics that
prevent them from operating if the backing store is unavailable. Ordinary
applications should have no need to invoke any of these methods, which can
be identified by the fact that they are declared to throw

BackingStoreException

.

The methods in this class may be invoked concurrently by multiple threads
in a single JVM without the need for external synchronization, and the
results will be equivalent to some serial execution. If this class is used
concurrently

by multiple JVMs

that store their preference data in
the same backing store, the data store will not be corrupted, but no
other guarantees are made concerning the consistency of the preference
data.

This class contains an export/import facility, allowing preferences
to be "exported" to an XML document, and XML documents representing
preferences to be "imported" back into the system. This facility
may be used to back up all or part of a preference tree, and
subsequently restore from the backup.

The XML document has the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

Note that the system URI (http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd) is

not

accessed when exporting or importing preferences; it merely
serves as a string to uniquely identify the DTD, which is:

```java
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- DTD for a Preferences tree. -->

<!-- The preferences element is at the root of an XML document
representing a Preferences tree. -->
<!ELEMENT preferences (root)>

<!-- The preferences element contains an optional version attribute,
which specifies version of DTD. -->
<!ATTLIST preferences EXTERNAL_XML_VERSION CDATA "0.0" >

<!-- The root element has a map representing the root's preferences
(if any), and one node for each child of the root (if any). -->
<!ELEMENT root (map, node*) >

<!-- Additionally, the root contains a type attribute, which
specifies whether it's the system or user root. -->
<!ATTLIST root
type (system|user) #REQUIRED >

<!-- Each node has a map representing its preferences (if any),
and one node for each child (if any). -->
<!ELEMENT node (map, node*) >

<!-- Additionally, each node has a name attribute -->
<!ATTLIST node
name CDATA #REQUIRED >

<!-- A map represents the preferences stored at a node (if any). -->
<!ELEMENT map (entry*) >

<!-- An entry represents a single preference, which is simply
a key-value pair. -->
<!ELEMENT entry EMPTY >
<!ATTLIST entry
key CDATA #REQUIRED
value CDATA #REQUIRED >
```

Every

Preferences

implementation must have an associated

PreferencesFactory

implementation. Every Java(TM) SE implementation must provide
some means of specifying which

PreferencesFactory

implementation
is used to generate the root preferences nodes. This allows the
administrator to replace the default preferences implementation with an
alternative implementation.

implicit.)

---

### Method Details

#### public static
Preferences
userNodeForPackage​(
Class
<?> c)

Returns the preference node from the calling user's preference tree
that is associated (by convention) with the specified class's package.
The convention is as follows: the absolute path name of the node is the
fully qualified package name, preceded by a slash (

'/'

), and
with each period (

'.'

) replaced by a slash. For example the
absolute path name of the node associated with the class

com.acme.widget.Foo

is

/com/acme/widget

.

This convention does not apply to the unnamed package, whose
associated preference node is

<unnamed>

. This node
is not intended for long term use, but for convenience in the early
development of programs that do not yet belong to a package, and
for "throwaway" programs.

Valuable data should not be stored
at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.

A class

Foo

wishing to access preferences pertaining to its
package can obtain a preference node as follows:

```java
static Preferences prefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(Foo.class);
```

This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the
preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a run-time failure.
(If the class name is misspelled, it will typically result in a
compile-time error.)

Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned
node and its ancestors if they do not already exist. If the returned
node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that
were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until
the

flush

method is called on the returned node (or one of its
ancestors or descendants).

**Parameters:**
- c

- the class for whose package a user preference node is desired.

**Returns:**
- the user preference node associated with the package of which

c

is a member.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

c

is

null

.
- SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and
it denies

RuntimePermission("preferences")

.

#### public static
Preferences
systemNodeForPackage​(
Class
<?> c)

Returns the preference node from the system preference tree that is
associated (by convention) with the specified class's package. The
convention is as follows: the absolute path name of the node is the
fully qualified package name, preceded by a slash (

'/'

), and
with each period (

'.'

) replaced by a slash. For example the
absolute path name of the node associated with the class

com.acme.widget.Foo

is

/com/acme/widget

.

This convention does not apply to the unnamed package, whose
associated preference node is

<unnamed>

. This node
is not intended for long term use, but for convenience in the early
development of programs that do not yet belong to a package, and
for "throwaway" programs.

Valuable data should not be stored
at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.

A class

Foo

wishing to access preferences pertaining to its
package can obtain a preference node as follows:

```java
static Preferences prefs = Preferences.systemNodeForPackage(Foo.class);
```

This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the
preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a run-time failure.
(If the class name is misspelled, it will typically result in a
compile-time error.)

Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned
node and its ancestors if they do not already exist. If the returned
node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that
were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until
the

flush

method is called on the returned node (or one of its
ancestors or descendants).

**Parameters:**
- c

- the class for whose package a system preference node is desired.

preference node. This call has no effect on any descendants
of this node.

If this implementation supports

stored defaults

, and this
node in the preferences hierarchy contains any such defaults,
the stored defaults will be "exposed" by this call, in the sense that
they will be returned by succeeding calls to

get

.

**Throws:**

from the

Base64 Alphabet

; no newline characters or
extraneous characters are permitted. This method is intended for use
in conjunction with

putByteArray(java.lang.String, byte[])

.

Returns the specified default if there is no value
associated with the key, the backing store is inaccessible, or if the
associated value is not a valid Base64 encoded byte array
(as defined above).

If the implementation supports

stored defaults

and such a
default exists and is accessible, it is used in preference to the
specified default, unless the stored default is not a valid Base64
encoded byte array (as defined above), in which case the
specified default is used.

**Parameters:**
- key

- key whose associated value is to be returned as a byte array.
- def

- the value to be returned in the event that this
preference node has no value associated with

key

or the associated value cannot be interpreted as a byte array,
or the backing store is inaccessible.

**Returns:**
- the byte array value represented by the string associated with

key

in this preference node, or

def

if the
associated value does not exist or cannot be interpreted as
a byte array.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
- NullPointerException

- if

key

is

null

. (A

null

value for

def

is

permitted.)
- IllegalArgumentException

- if key contains the null control
character, code point U+0000.

#### public abstract
String
[] keys()
throws
BackingStoreException

Returns all of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node. (The returned array will be of size zero if
this node has no preferences.)

If the implementation supports

stored defaults

and there
are any such defaults at this node that have not been overridden,
by explicit preferences, the defaults are returned in the array in
addition to any explicit preferences.

**Returns:**
- an array of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

#### public abstract
String
[] childrenNames()
throws
BackingStoreException

Returns the names of the children of this preference node, relative to
this node. (The returned array will be of size zero if this node has
no children.)

**Returns:**
- the names of the children of this preference node.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

---

#### public abstract

if this is
the root.

**Returns:**
- the parent of this preference node.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

---

#### public abstract
Preferences
node​(
String
pathName)

Returns the named preference node in the same tree as this node,
creating it and any of its ancestors if they do not already exist.
Accepts a relative or absolute path name. Relative path names
(which do not begin with the slash character

('/')

) are
interpreted relative to this preference node.

If the returned node did not exist prior to this call, this node and
any ancestors that were created by this call are not guaranteed
to become permanent until the

flush

method is called on
the returned node (or one of its ancestors or descendants).

**Parameters:**
- pathName

- the path name of the preference node to return.

**Returns:**
- the specified preference node.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
- NullPointerException

- if path name is

null

.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

**See Also:**
- flush()

---

#### public abstract boolean nodeExists​(
String
pathName)
throws
BackingStoreException

Returns true if the named preference node exists in the same tree
as this node. Relative path names (which do not begin with the slash
character

('/')

) are interpreted relative to this preference
node.

If this node (or an ancestor) has already been removed with the

removeNode()

method, it

is

legal to invoke this method,
but only with the path name

""

; the invocation will return

false

. Thus, the idiom

p.nodeExists("")

may be
used to test whether

p

has been removed.

**Parameters:**
- pathName

- the path name of the node whose existence
is to be checked.

**Returns:**
- true if the specified node exists.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
- NullPointerException

- if path name is

null

.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method and

pathName

is not the empty string (

""

).

---

#### public abstract void removeNode()
throws
BackingStoreException

Removes this preference node and all of its descendants, invalidating
any preferences contained in the removed nodes. Once a node has been
removed, attempting any method other than

name()

,

absolutePath()

,

isUserNode()

,

flush()

or

nodeExists("")

on the corresponding

Preferences

instance will fail with an

IllegalStateException

. (The methods defined on

Object

can still be invoked on a node after it has been removed; they will not
throw

IllegalStateException

.)

The removal is not guaranteed to be persistent until the

flush

method is called on this node (or an ancestor).

If this implementation supports

stored defaults

, removing a
node exposes any stored defaults at or below this node. Thus, a
subsequent call to

nodeExists

on this node's path name may
return

true

, and a subsequent call to

node

on this
path name may return a (different)

Preferences

instance
representing a non-empty collection of preferences and/or children.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has already
been removed with the

removeNode()

method.
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if this method is invoked on
the root node.

**See Also:**
- flush()

---

#### public abstract

name()

Returns this preference node's name, relative to its parent.

**Returns:**
- this preference node's name, relative to its parent.

---

#### public abstract
String
absolutePath()

Returns this preference node's absolute path name.

**Returns:**
- this preference node's absolute path name.

---

#### public abstract boolean isUserNode()

Returns

true

if this preference node is in the user
preference tree,

false

if it's in the system preference tree.

**Returns:**
- true

if this preference node is in the user
preference tree,

false

if it's in the system
preference tree.

---

#### public abstract
String
toString()

Returns a string representation of this preferences node,
as if computed by the expression:

(this.isUserNode() ? "User" :
"System") + " Preference Node: " + this.absolutePath()

.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a string representation of the object.

---

#### public abstract void flush()
throws
BackingStoreException

Forces any changes in the contents of this preference node and its
descendants to the persistent store. Once this method returns
successfully, it is safe to assume that all changes made in the
subtree rooted at this node prior to the method invocation have become
permanent.

Implementations are free to flush changes into the persistent store
at any time. They do not need to wait for this method to be called.

When a flush occurs on a newly created node, it is made persistent,
as are any ancestors (and descendants) that have yet to be made
persistent. Note however that any preference value changes in
ancestors are

not

guaranteed to be made persistent.

If this method is invoked on a node that has been removed with
the

removeNode()

method, flushSpi() is invoked on this node,
but not on others.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

**See Also:**
- sync()

---

#### public abstract void sync()
throws
BackingStoreException

Ensures that future reads from this preference node and its
descendants reflect any changes that were committed to the persistent
store (from any VM) prior to the

sync

invocation. As a
side-effect, forces any changes in the contents of this preference node
and its descendants to the persistent store, as if the

flush

method had been invoked on this node.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

**See Also:**

#### public abstract void addPreferenceChangeListener​(
PreferenceChangeListener
pcl)

Registers the specified listener to receive

preference change
events

for this preference node. A preference change event is
generated when a preference is added to this node, removed from this
node, or when the value associated with a preference is changed.
(Preference change events are

not

generated by the

removeNode()

method, which generates a

node change event

.
Preference change events

are

generated by the

clear

method.)

Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
events for changes made outside this JVM. Events may be generated
before the changes have been made persistent. Events are not generated
when preferences are modified in descendants of this node; a caller
desiring such events must register with each descendant.

**Parameters:**
- pcl

- The preference change listener to add.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

pcl

is null.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

**See Also:**
- removePreferenceChangeListener(PreferenceChangeListener)

,

addNodeChangeListener(NodeChangeListener)

---

#### public abstract void removePreferenceChangeListener​(
PreferenceChangeListener
pcl)

Removes the specified preference change listener, so it no longer
receives preference change events.

**Parameters:**
- pcl

- The preference change listener to remove.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

pcl

was not a registered
preference change listener on this node.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

**See Also:**
- addPreferenceChangeListener(PreferenceChangeListener)

---

#### public abstract void addNodeChangeListener​(
NodeChangeListener
ncl)

Registers the specified listener to receive

node change events

for this node. A node change event is generated when a child node is
added to or removed from this node. (A single

removeNode()

invocation results in multiple

node change events

, one for every
node in the subtree rooted at the removed node.)

Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
events for changes made outside this JVM. Events may be generated
before the changes have become permanent. Events are not generated
when indirect descendants of this node are added or removed; a
caller desiring such events must register with each descendant.

Few guarantees can be made regarding node creation. Because nodes
are created implicitly upon access, it may not be feasible for an
implementation to determine whether a child node existed in the backing
store prior to access (for example, because the backing store is
unreachable or cached information is out of date). Under these
circumstances, implementations are neither required to generate node
change events nor prohibited from doing so.

**Parameters:**
- ncl

- The

NodeChangeListener

to add.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

ncl

is null.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

**See Also:**
- removeNodeChangeListener(NodeChangeListener)

,

#### public abstract void removeNodeChangeListener​(
NodeChangeListener
ncl)

Removes the specified

NodeChangeListener

, so it no longer
receives change events.

**Parameters:**
- ncl

- The

NodeChangeListener

to remove.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

ncl

was not a registered

NodeChangeListener

on this node.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

This XML document is, in effect, an offline backup of the node.

The XML document will have the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">

results equivalent to some serial execution. If the preferences
at this node are modified concurrently with an invocation of this
method, the exported preferences comprise a "fuzzy snapshot" of the
preferences contained in the node; some of the concurrent modifications
may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.

**Parameters:**
- os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

#### Class Preferences

java.lang.Object

- java.util.prefs.Preferences

java.util.prefs.Preferences

**Direct Known Subclasses:** AbstractPreferences

```java
public abstract class
Preferences

extends
Object
```

A node in a hierarchical collection of preference data. This class
allows applications to store and retrieve user and system
preference and configuration data. This data is stored
persistently in an implementation-dependent backing store. Typical
implementations include flat files, OS-specific registries,
directory servers and SQL databases. The user of this class needn't
be concerned with details of the backing store.

There are two separate trees of preference nodes, one for user
preferences and one for system preferences. Each user has a separate user
preference tree, and all users in a given system share the same system
preference tree. The precise description of "user" and "system" will vary
from implementation to implementation. Typical information stored in the
user preference tree might include font choice, color choice, or preferred
window location and size for a particular application. Typical information
stored in the system preference tree might include installation
configuration data for an application.

Nodes in a preference tree are named in a similar fashion to
directories in a hierarchical file system. Every node in a preference
tree has a

node name

(which is not necessarily unique),
a unique

absolute path name

, and a path name

relative

to each
ancestor including itself.

The root node has a node name of the empty string (""). Every other
node has an arbitrary node name, specified at the time it is created. The
only restrictions on this name are that it cannot be the empty string, and
it cannot contain the slash character ('/').

The root node has an absolute path name of

"/"

. Children of
the root node have absolute path names of

"/" +

<node
name>

. All other nodes have absolute path names of

<parent's
absolute path name>

+ "/" +

<node name>

.
Note that all absolute path names begin with the slash character.

A node

n

's path name relative to its ancestor

a

is simply the string that must be appended to

a

's absolute path name
in order to form

n

's absolute path name, with the initial slash
character (if present) removed. Note that:

- No relative path names begin with the slash character.

Every node's path name relative to itself is the empty string.

Every node's path name relative to its parent is its node name (except
for the root node, which does not have a parent).

Every node's path name relative to the root is its absolute path name
with the initial slash character removed.

Note finally that:

- No path name contains multiple consecutive slash characters.

No path name with the exception of the root's absolute path name
ends in the slash character.

Any string that conforms to these two rules is a valid path name.

All of the methods that modify preferences data are permitted to operate
asynchronously; they may return immediately, and changes will eventually
propagate to the persistent backing store with an implementation-dependent
delay. The

flush

method may be used to synchronously force
updates to the backing store. Normal termination of the Java Virtual
Machine will

not

result in the loss of pending updates -- an explicit

flush

invocation is

not

required upon termination to ensure
that pending updates are made persistent.

All of the methods that read preferences from a

Preferences

object require the invoker to provide a default value. The default value is
returned if no value has been previously set

or if the backing store is
unavailable

. The intent is to allow applications to operate, albeit
with slightly degraded functionality, even if the backing store becomes
unavailable. Several methods, like

flush

, have semantics that
prevent them from operating if the backing store is unavailable. Ordinary
applications should have no need to invoke any of these methods, which can
be identified by the fact that they are declared to throw

BackingStoreException

.

The methods in this class may be invoked concurrently by multiple threads
in a single JVM without the need for external synchronization, and the
results will be equivalent to some serial execution. If this class is used
concurrently

by multiple JVMs

that store their preference data in
the same backing store, the data store will not be corrupted, but no
other guarantees are made concerning the consistency of the preference
data.

This class contains an export/import facility, allowing preferences
to be "exported" to an XML document, and XML documents representing
preferences to be "imported" back into the system. This facility
may be used to back up all or part of a preference tree, and
subsequently restore from the backup.

The XML document has the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

Note that the system URI (http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd) is

not

accessed when exporting or importing preferences; it merely
serves as a string to uniquely identify the DTD, which is:

```java
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- DTD for a Preferences tree. -->

<!-- The preferences element is at the root of an XML document
representing a Preferences tree. -->
<!ELEMENT preferences (root)>

<!-- The preferences element contains an optional version attribute,
which specifies version of DTD. -->
<!ATTLIST preferences EXTERNAL_XML_VERSION CDATA "0.0" >

<!-- The root element has a map representing the root's preferences
(if any), and one node for each child of the root (if any). -->
<!ELEMENT root (map, node*) >

<!-- Additionally, the root contains a type attribute, which
specifies whether it's the system or user root. -->
<!ATTLIST root
type (system|user) #REQUIRED >

<!-- Each node has a map representing its preferences (if any),
and one node for each child (if any). -->
<!ELEMENT node (map, node*) >

<!-- Additionally, each node has a name attribute -->
<!ATTLIST node
name CDATA #REQUIRED >

<!-- A map represents the preferences stored at a node (if any). -->
<!ELEMENT map (entry*) >

<!-- An entry represents a single preference, which is simply
a key-value pair. -->
<!ELEMENT entry EMPTY >
<!ATTLIST entry
key CDATA #REQUIRED
value CDATA #REQUIRED >
```

Every

Preferences

implementation must have an associated

PreferencesFactory

implementation. Every Java(TM) SE implementation must provide
some means of specifying which

PreferencesFactory

implementation
is used to generate the root preferences nodes. This allows the
administrator to replace the default preferences implementation with an
alternative implementation.

**Implementation Note:** The

PreferencesFactory

implementation is located as follows:

- If the system property

java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory

is defined, then it is
taken to be the fully-qualified name of a class implementing the

PreferencesFactory

interface. The class is loaded and
instantiated; if this process fails then an unspecified error is
thrown.
- If a

PreferencesFactory

implementation class file
has been installed in a jar file that is visible to the

system class loader

,
and that jar file contains a provider-configuration file named

java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory

in the resource
directory

META-INF/services

, then the first class name
specified in that file is taken. If more than one such jar file is
provided, the first one found will be used. The class is loaded
and instantiated; if this process fails then an unspecified error
is thrown.
- Finally, if neither the above-mentioned system property nor
an extension jar file is provided, then the system-wide default

PreferencesFactory

implementation for the underlying
platform is loaded and instantiated.
**Since:** 1.4

A node in a hierarchical collection of preference data. This class
allows applications to store and retrieve user and system
preference and configuration data. This data is stored
persistently in an implementation-dependent backing store. Typical
implementations include flat files, OS-specific registries,

Every node's path name relative to itself is the empty string.

Every node's path name relative to its parent is its node name (except
for the root node, which does not have a parent).

Every node's path name relative to the root is its absolute path name
with the initial slash character removed.

Note finally that:

- No path name contains multiple consecutive slash characters.

No path name with the exception of the root's absolute path name
ends in the slash character.

Any string that conforms to these two rules is a valid path name.

Every

Preferences

implementation must have an associated

PreferencesFactory

implementation. Every Java(TM) SE implementation must provide
some means of specifying which

PreferencesFactory

implementation
is used to generate the root preferences nodes. This allows the
administrator to replace the default preferences implementation with an
alternative implementation.

There are two separate trees of preference nodes, one for user
preferences and one for system preferences. Each user has a separate user
preference tree, and all users in a given system share the same system
preference tree. The precise description of "user" and "system" will vary
from implementation to implementation. Typical information stored in the
user preference tree might include font choice, color choice, or preferred
window location and size for a particular application. Typical information
stored in the system preference tree might include installation
configuration data for an application.

Nodes in a preference tree are named in a similar fashion to
directories in a hierarchical file system. Every node in a preference
tree has a

node name

(which is not necessarily unique),
a unique

absolute path name

, and a path name

relative

to each
ancestor including itself.

The root node has a node name of the empty string (""). Every other
node has an arbitrary node name, specified at the time it is created. The
only restrictions on this name are that it cannot be the empty string, and
it cannot contain the slash character ('/').

The root node has an absolute path name of

"/"

. Children of
the root node have absolute path names of

"/" +

<node
name>

. All other nodes have absolute path names of

<parent's
absolute path name>

+ "/" +

<node name>

.
Note that all absolute path names begin with the slash character.

A node

n

's path name relative to its ancestor

a

is simply the string that must be appended to

a

's absolute path name
in order to form

n

's absolute path name, with the initial slash
character (if present) removed. Note that:

- No relative path names begin with the slash character.

Every node's path name relative to itself is the empty string.

Every node's path name relative to its parent is its node name (except
for the root node, which does not have a parent).

Every node's path name relative to the root is its absolute path name
with the initial slash character removed.

Note finally that:

- No path name contains multiple consecutive slash characters.

No path name with the exception of the root's absolute path name
ends in the slash character.

Any string that conforms to these two rules is a valid path name.

All of the methods that modify preferences data are permitted to operate
asynchronously; they may return immediately, and changes will eventually
propagate to the persistent backing store with an implementation-dependent
delay. The

flush

method may be used to synchronously force
updates to the backing store. Normal termination of the Java Virtual
Machine will

not

result in the loss of pending updates -- an explicit

flush

invocation is

not

required upon termination to ensure
that pending updates are made persistent.

All of the methods that read preferences from a

Preferences

object require the invoker to provide a default value. The default value is
returned if no value has been previously set

or if the backing store is
unavailable

. The intent is to allow applications to operate, albeit
with slightly degraded functionality, even if the backing store becomes
unavailable. Several methods, like

flush

, have semantics that
prevent them from operating if the backing store is unavailable. Ordinary
applications should have no need to invoke any of these methods, which can
be identified by the fact that they are declared to throw

BackingStoreException

.

The methods in this class may be invoked concurrently by multiple threads
in a single JVM without the need for external synchronization, and the
results will be equivalent to some serial execution. If this class is used
concurrently

by multiple JVMs

that store their preference data in
the same backing store, the data store will not be corrupted, but no
other guarantees are made concerning the consistency of the preference
data.

This class contains an export/import facility, allowing preferences
to be "exported" to an XML document, and XML documents representing
preferences to be "imported" back into the system. This facility
may be used to back up all or part of a preference tree, and
subsequently restore from the backup.

The XML document has the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

Note that the system URI (http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd) is

not

accessed when exporting or importing preferences; it merely
serves as a string to uniquely identify the DTD, which is:

```java
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- DTD for a Preferences tree. -->

<!-- The preferences element is at the root of an XML document
representing a Preferences tree. -->

be identified by the fact that they are declared to throw

BackingStoreException

.

The methods in this class may be invoked concurrently by multiple threads
in a single JVM without the need for external synchronization, and the
results will be equivalent to some serial execution. If this class is used
concurrently

by multiple JVMs

that store their preference data in
the same backing store, the data store will not be corrupted, but no
other guarantees are made concerning the consistency of the preference
data.

This class contains an export/import facility, allowing preferences
to be "exported" to an XML document, and XML documents representing
preferences to be "imported" back into the system. This facility
may be used to back up all or part of a preference tree, and
subsequently restore from the backup.

The XML document has the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

Note that the system URI (http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd) is

not

accessed when exporting or importing preferences; it merely
serves as a string to uniquely identify the DTD, which is:

```java
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- DTD for a Preferences tree. -->

<!-- The preferences element is at the root of an XML document
representing a Preferences tree. -->
<!ELEMENT preferences (root)>

<!-- The preferences element contains an optional version attribute,
which specifies version of DTD. -->
<!ATTLIST preferences EXTERNAL_XML_VERSION CDATA "0.0" >

<!-- The root element has a map representing the root's preferences
(if any), and one node for each child of the root (if any). -->
<!ELEMENT root (map, node*) >

<!-- Additionally, the root contains a type attribute, which
specifies whether it's the system or user root. -->
<!ATTLIST root
type (system|user) #REQUIRED >

<!-- Each node has a map representing its preferences (if any),
and one node for each child (if any). -->
<!ELEMENT node (map, node*) >

<!-- Additionally, each node has a name attribute -->
<!ATTLIST node

<!ELEMENT map (entry*) >

<!-- An entry represents a single preference, which is simply
a key-value pair. -->
<!ELEMENT entry EMPTY >
<!ATTLIST entry
key CDATA #REQUIRED
value CDATA #REQUIRED >
```

Every

Preferences

implementation must have an associated

PreferencesFactory

implementation. Every Java(TM) SE implementation must provide
some means of specifying which

PreferencesFactory

implementation
is used to generate the root preferences nodes. This allows the
administrator to replace the default preferences implementation with an
alternative implementation.

All of the methods that read preferences from a

Preferences

object require the invoker to provide a default value. The default value is
returned if no value has been previously set

or if the backing store is
unavailable

. The intent is to allow applications to operate, albeit
with slightly degraded functionality, even if the backing store becomes
unavailable. Several methods, like

flush

, have semantics that
prevent them from operating if the backing store is unavailable. Ordinary
applications should have no need to invoke any of these methods, which can
be identified by the fact that they are declared to throw

BackingStoreException

.

- userNodeForPackage

```java
public static
Preferences
userNodeForPackage​(
Class
<?> c)
```

Returns the preference node from the calling user's preference tree
that is associated (by convention) with the specified class's package.
The convention is as follows: the absolute path name of the node is the
fully qualified package name, preceded by a slash (

'/'

), and
with each period (

'.'

) replaced by a slash. For example the
absolute path name of the node associated with the class

com.acme.widget.Foo

is

/com/acme/widget

.

This convention does not apply to the unnamed package, whose
associated preference node is

<unnamed>

. This node
is not intended for long term use, but for convenience in the early
development of programs that do not yet belong to a package, and
for "throwaway" programs.

Valuable data should not be stored
at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.

A class

Foo

wishing to access preferences pertaining to its
package can obtain a preference node as follows:

```java
static Preferences prefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(Foo.class);
```

This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the
preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a run-time failure.
(If the class name is misspelled, it will typically result in a
compile-time error.)

Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned
node and its ancestors if they do not already exist. If the returned
node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that
were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until
the

flush

method is called on the returned node (or one of its
ancestors or descendants).

**Parameters:** c

- the class for whose package a user preference node is desired.
**Returns:** the user preference node associated with the package of which

c

is a member.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

c

is

null

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and
it denies

RuntimePermission("preferences")

.
**See Also:** RuntimePermission

- systemNodeForPackage

```java
public static
Preferences
systemNodeForPackage​(
Class
<?> c)
```

Returns the preference node from the system preference tree that is
associated (by convention) with the specified class's package. The
convention is as follows: the absolute path name of the node is the
fully qualified package name, preceded by a slash (

'/'

), and
with each period (

'.'

) replaced by a slash. For example the
absolute path name of the node associated with the class

com.acme.widget.Foo

is

/com/acme/widget

.

This convention does not apply to the unnamed package, whose
associated preference node is

<unnamed>

. This node
is not intended for long term use, but for convenience in the early
development of programs that do not yet belong to a package, and
for "throwaway" programs.

Valuable data should not be stored
at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.

A class

Foo

wishing to access preferences pertaining to its
package can obtain a preference node as follows:

```java
static Preferences prefs = Preferences.systemNodeForPackage(Foo.class);
```

This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the
preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a run-time failure.
(If the class name is misspelled, it will typically result in a
compile-time error.)

Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned
node and its ancestors if they do not already exist. If the returned
node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that
were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until

Returns the names of the children of this preference node, relative to
this node. (The returned array will be of size zero if this node has
no children.)

**Returns:** the names of the children of this preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- parent

```java
public abstract
Preferences
parent()
```

Returns the parent of this preference node, or

null

if this is
the root.

**Returns:** the parent of this preference node.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- node

```java
public abstract
Preferences
node​(
String
pathName)
```

Returns the named preference node in the same tree as this node,
creating it and any of its ancestors if they do not already exist.
Accepts a relative or absolute path name. Relative path names
(which do not begin with the slash character

('/')

) are
interpreted relative to this preference node.

If the returned node did not exist prior to this call, this node and
any ancestors that were created by this call are not guaranteed
to become permanent until the

flush

method is called on
the returned node (or one of its ancestors or descendants).

**Parameters:** pathName

- the path name of the preference node to return.
**Returns:** the specified preference node.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if path name is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** flush()

- nodeExists

```java
public abstract boolean nodeExists​(
String
pathName)
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Returns true if the named preference node exists in the same tree
as this node. Relative path names (which do not begin with the slash
character

('/')

) are interpreted relative to this preference
node.

If this node (or an ancestor) has already been removed with the

removeNode()

method, it

is

legal to invoke this method,
but only with the path name

""

; the invocation will return

false

. Thus, the idiom

p.nodeExists("")

may be
used to test whether

p

has been removed.

**Parameters:** pathName

- the path name of the node whose existence
is to be checked.
**Returns:** true if the specified node exists.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if path name is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method and

pathName

is not the empty string (

""

).

- removeNode

```java
public abstract void removeNode()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Removes this preference node and all of its descendants, invalidating
any preferences contained in the removed nodes. Once a node has been
removed, attempting any method other than

name()

,

absolutePath()

,

isUserNode()

,

flush()

or

nodeExists("")

on the corresponding

Preferences

instance will fail with an

IllegalStateException

. (The methods defined on

Object

can still be invoked on a node after it has been removed; they will not
throw

IllegalStateException

.)

The removal is not guaranteed to be persistent until the

flush

method is called on this node (or an ancestor).

If this implementation supports

stored defaults

, removing a
node exposes any stored defaults at or below this node. Thus, a
subsequent call to

nodeExists

on this node's path name may
return

true

, and a subsequent call to

node

on this
path name may return a (different)

Preferences

instance
representing a non-empty collection of preferences and/or children.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has already
been removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this method is invoked on
the root node.
**See Also:** flush()

- name

```java
public abstract
String
name()
```

Returns this preference node's name, relative to its parent.

**Returns:** this preference node's name, relative to its parent.

- absolutePath

```java
public abstract
String
absolutePath()
```

Returns this preference node's absolute path name.

**Returns:** this preference node's absolute path name.

- isUserNode

```java
public abstract boolean isUserNode()
```

Returns

true

if this preference node is in the user
preference tree,

false

if it's in the system preference tree.

**Returns:** true

if this preference node is in the user
preference tree,

false

if it's in the system
preference tree.

- toString

```java
public abstract
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this preferences node,
as if computed by the expression:

(this.isUserNode() ? "User" :
"System") + " Preference Node: " + this.absolutePath()

.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of the object.

- flush

```java
public abstract void flush()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Forces any changes in the contents of this preference node and its
descendants to the persistent store. Once this method returns
successfully, it is safe to assume that all changes made in the
subtree rooted at this node prior to the method invocation have become
permanent.

Implementations are free to flush changes into the persistent store
at any time. They do not need to wait for this method to be called.

When a flush occurs on a newly created node, it is made persistent,
as are any ancestors (and descendants) that have yet to be made
persistent. Note however that any preference value changes in
ancestors are

not

guaranteed to be made persistent.

If this method is invoked on a node that has been removed with
the

removeNode()

method, flushSpi() is invoked on this node,
but not on others.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**See Also:** sync()

- sync

```java
public abstract void sync()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Ensures that future reads from this preference node and its
descendants reflect any changes that were committed to the persistent
store (from any VM) prior to the

sync

invocation. As a
side-effect, forces any changes in the contents of this preference node
and its descendants to the persistent store, as if the

flush

method had been invoked on this node.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** flush()

- addPreferenceChangeListener

```java
public abstract void addPreferenceChangeListener​(
PreferenceChangeListener
pcl)
```

Registers the specified listener to receive

preference change
events

for this preference node. A preference change event is
generated when a preference is added to this node, removed from this
node, or when the value associated with a preference is changed.
(Preference change events are

not

generated by the

removeNode()

method, which generates a

node change event

.
Preference change events

are

generated by the

clear

method.)

Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
events for changes made outside this JVM. Events may be generated
before the changes have been made persistent. Events are not generated
when preferences are modified in descendants of this node; a caller
desiring such events must register with each descendant.

**Parameters:** pcl

- The preference change listener to add.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

pcl

is null.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** removePreferenceChangeListener(PreferenceChangeListener)

,

addNodeChangeListener(NodeChangeListener)

- removePreferenceChangeListener

```java
public abstract void removePreferenceChangeListener​(
PreferenceChangeListener
pcl)
```

Removes the specified preference change listener, so it no longer
receives preference change events.

**Parameters:** pcl

- The preference change listener to remove.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

pcl

was not a registered
preference change listener on this node.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** addPreferenceChangeListener(PreferenceChangeListener)

- addNodeChangeListener

```java
public abstract void addNodeChangeListener​(
NodeChangeListener
ncl)
```

Registers the specified listener to receive

node change events

for this node. A node change event is generated when a child node is
added to or removed from this node. (A single

removeNode()

invocation results in multiple

node change events

, one for every
node in the subtree rooted at the removed node.)

Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
events for changes made outside this JVM. Events may be generated
before the changes have become permanent. Events are not generated
when indirect descendants of this node are added or removed; a
caller desiring such events must register with each descendant.

Few guarantees can be made regarding node creation. Because nodes
are created implicitly upon access, it may not be feasible for an
implementation to determine whether a child node existed in the backing
store prior to access (for example, because the backing store is
unreachable or cached information is out of date). Under these
circumstances, implementations are neither required to generate node
change events nor prohibited from doing so.

**Parameters:** ncl

- The

NodeChangeListener

to add.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

ncl

is null.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** removeNodeChangeListener(NodeChangeListener)

,

addPreferenceChangeListener(PreferenceChangeListener)

- removeNodeChangeListener

```java
public abstract void removeNodeChangeListener​(
NodeChangeListener
ncl)
```

Removes the specified

NodeChangeListener

, so it no longer
receives change events.

**Parameters:** ncl

- The

NodeChangeListener

to remove.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

ncl

was not a registered

NodeChangeListener

on this node.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** addNodeChangeListener(NodeChangeListener)

- exportNode

```java
public abstract void exportNode​(
OutputStream
os)
throws
IOException
,

BackingStoreException
```

Emits on the specified output stream an XML document representing all
of the preferences contained in this node (but not its descendants).
This XML document is, in effect, an offline backup of the node.

The XML document will have the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

The UTF-8 character encoding will be used.

This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
results equivalent to some serial execution. If the preferences
at this node are modified concurrently with an invocation of this
method, the exported preferences comprise a "fuzzy snapshot" of the
preferences contained in the node; some of the concurrent modifications
may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.

**Parameters:** os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

IOException

.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if preference data cannot be read from
backing store.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** importPreferences(InputStream)

- exportSubtree

```java
public abstract void exportSubtree​(
OutputStream
os)
throws
IOException
,

BackingStoreException
```

Emits an XML document representing all of the preferences contained
in this node and all of its descendants. This XML document is, in
effect, an offline backup of the subtree rooted at the node.

The XML document will have the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

The UTF-8 character encoding will be used.

This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
results equivalent to some serial execution. If the preferences
or nodes in the subtree rooted at this node are modified concurrently
with an invocation of this method, the exported preferences comprise a
"fuzzy snapshot" of the subtree; some of the concurrent modifications
may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.

**Parameters:** os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

IOException

.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if preference data cannot be read from
backing store.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** importPreferences(InputStream)

,

exportNode(OutputStream)

- importPreferences

```java
public static void importPreferences​(
InputStream
is)
throws
IOException
,

InvalidPreferencesFormatException
```

Imports all of the preferences represented by the XML document on the
specified input stream. The document may represent user preferences or
system preferences. If it represents user preferences, the preferences
will be imported into the calling user's preference tree (even if they
originally came from a different user's preference tree). If any of
the preferences described by the document inhabit preference nodes that
do not exist, the nodes will be created.

The XML document must have the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

(This method is designed for use in conjunction with

exportNode(OutputStream)

and

exportSubtree(OutputStream)

.

This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
results equivalent to some serial execution. The method behaves
as if implemented on top of the other public methods in this class,
notably

node(String)

and

put(String, String)

.

**Parameters:** is

- the input stream from which to read the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if reading from the specified input stream
results in an

IOException

.
**Throws:** InvalidPreferencesFormatException

- Data on input stream does not
constitute a valid XML document with the mandated document type.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is present and
it denies

RuntimePermission("preferences")

.

Method Detail

- userNodeForPackage

```java
public static
Preferences
userNodeForPackage​(
Class
<?> c)
```

Returns the preference node from the calling user's preference tree
that is associated (by convention) with the specified class's package.
The convention is as follows: the absolute path name of the node is the
fully qualified package name, preceded by a slash (

'/'

), and
with each period (

'.'

) replaced by a slash. For example the
absolute path name of the node associated with the class

com.acme.widget.Foo

is

/com/acme/widget

.

This convention does not apply to the unnamed package, whose
associated preference node is

<unnamed>

. This node
is not intended for long term use, but for convenience in the early
development of programs that do not yet belong to a package, and
for "throwaway" programs.

Valuable data should not be stored
at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.

A class

Foo

wishing to access preferences pertaining to its
package can obtain a preference node as follows:

```java
static Preferences prefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(Foo.class);
```

This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the
preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a run-time failure.
(If the class name is misspelled, it will typically result in a
compile-time error.)

Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned
node and its ancestors if they do not already exist. If the returned
node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that
were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until
the

flush

method is called on the returned node (or one of its
ancestors or descendants).

**Parameters:** c

- the class for whose package a user preference node is desired.
**Returns:** the user preference node associated with the package of which

c

is a member.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

c

is

null

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and
it denies

RuntimePermission("preferences")

.
**See Also:** RuntimePermission

- systemNodeForPackage

```java
public static
Preferences
systemNodeForPackage​(
Class
<?> c)
```

Returns the preference node from the system preference tree that is
associated (by convention) with the specified class's package. The
convention is as follows: the absolute path name of the node is the
fully qualified package name, preceded by a slash (

'/'

), and
with each period (

'.'

) replaced by a slash. For example the
absolute path name of the node associated with the class

com.acme.widget.Foo

is

/com/acme/widget

.

This convention does not apply to the unnamed package, whose
associated preference node is

<unnamed>

. This node
is not intended for long term use, but for convenience in the early
development of programs that do not yet belong to a package, and
for "throwaway" programs.

Valuable data should not be stored
at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.

A class

Foo

wishing to access preferences pertaining to its
package can obtain a preference node as follows:

```java
static Preferences prefs = Preferences.systemNodeForPackage(Foo.class);
```

This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the
preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a run-time failure.
(If the class name is misspelled, it will typically result in a
compile-time error.)

Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned
node and its ancestors if they do not already exist. If the returned
node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that
were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until
the

flush

method is called on the returned node (or one of its
ancestors or descendants).

**Parameters:** c

- the class for whose package a system preference node is desired.
**Returns:** the system preference node associated with the package of which

c

is a member.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

c

is

null

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is present and
it denies

RuntimePermission("preferences")

.

- userRoot

```java
public static
Preferences
userRoot()
```

Returns the root preference node for the calling user.

**Returns:** the root preference node for the calling user.

it denies

RuntimePermission("preferences")

.
**See Also:** RuntimePermission

- systemRoot

```java
public static
Preferences
systemRoot()
```

Returns the root preference node for the system.

**Returns:** the root preference node for the system.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is present and
it denies

RuntimePermission("preferences")

.
**See Also:** RuntimePermission

- put

```java
public abstract void put​(
String
key,

String
value)
```

Associates the specified value with the specified key in this
preference node.

**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated.
**Parameters:** value

- value to be associated with the specified key.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if key or value is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

key.length()

exceeds

MAX_KEY_LENGTH

or if

value.length

exceeds

MAX_VALUE_LENGTH

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if either key or value contain
the null control character, code point U+0000.

- get

```java
public abstract
String
get​(
String
key,

String
def)
```

Returns the value associated with the specified key in this preference
node. Returns the specified default if there is no value associated
with the key, or the backing store is inaccessible.

Some implementations may store default values in their backing
stores. If there is no value associated with the specified key
but there is such a

stored default

, it is returned in
preference to the specified default.

**Parameters:** key

- key whose associated value is to be returned.
**Parameters:** def

- the value to be returned in the event that this
preference node has no value associated with

key

.
**Returns:** the value associated with

key

, or

def

if no value is associated with

key

, or the backing
store is inaccessible.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

. (A

null

value for

def

is

permitted.)

- if key contains the null control
character, code point U+0000.

- remove

```java
public abstract void remove​(
String
key)
```

Removes the value associated with the specified key in this preference
node, if any.

If this implementation supports

stored defaults

, and there is
such a default for the specified preference, the stored default will be
"exposed" by this call, in the sense that it will be returned
by a succeeding call to

get

.

**Parameters:** key

- key whose mapping is to be removed from the preference node.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

key

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if key contains the null control
character, code point U+0000.

- clear

```java
public abstract void clear()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Removes all of the preferences (key-value associations) in this
preference node. This call has no effect on any descendants
of this node.

If this implementation supports

stored defaults

, and this
node in the preferences hierarchy contains any such defaults,
the stored defaults will be "exposed" by this call, in the sense that
they will be returned by succeeding calls to

get

.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** removeNode()

- putInt

```java
public abstract void putInt​(
String
key,
int value)
```

Associates a string representing the specified int value with the
specified key in this preference node. The associated string is the
one that would be returned if the int value were passed to

Integer.toString(int)

. This method is intended for use in
conjunction with

getInt(java.lang.String, int)

.

**Parameters:** key

- key with which the string form of value is to be associated.
**Parameters:** value

- value whose string form is to be associated with key.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

key

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

key.length()

exceeds

MAX_KEY_LENGTH

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

- if key contains
the null control character, code point U+0000.
**See Also:** getInt(String,int)

- getInt

```java
public abstract int getInt​(
String
key,
int def)
```

specified key in this preference node. The string is converted to
an integer as by

Integer.parseInt(String)

. Returns the
specified default if there is no value associated with the key,
the backing store is inaccessible, or if

Integer.parseInt(String)

would throw a

NumberFormatException

if the associated value were passed. This
method is intended for use in conjunction with

putInt(java.lang.String, int)

.

If the implementation supports

stored defaults

and such a
default exists, is accessible, and could be converted to an int
with

Integer.parseInt

, this int is returned in preference to
the specified default.

**Parameters:** key

- key whose associated value is to be returned as an int.
**Parameters:** def

- the value to be returned in the event that this
preference node has no value associated with

key

or the associated value cannot be interpreted as an int,

key

in this preference node, or

def

if the
associated value does not exist or cannot be interpreted as
an int.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

key

is

null

.

,

get(String,String)

- putLong

```java
public abstract void putLong​(
String
key,
long value)
```

Associates a string representing the specified long value with the
specified key in this preference node. The associated string is the
one that would be returned if the long value were passed to

Long.toString(long)

. This method is intended for use in
conjunction with

getLong(java.lang.String, long)

.

**Parameters:** key

- key with which the string form of value is to be associated.
**Parameters:** value

- value whose string form is to be associated with key.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

key

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if key contains
the null control character, code point U+0000.
**See Also:** getLong(String,long)

- getLong

```java
public abstract long getLong​(
String
key,
long def)
```

Returns the long value represented by the string associated with the
specified key in this preference node. The string is converted to
a long as by

Long.parseLong(String)

. Returns the
specified default if there is no value associated with the key,
the backing store is inaccessible, or if

Long.parseLong(String)

would throw a

NumberFormatException

if the associated value were passed. This
method is intended for use in conjunction with

putLong(java.lang.String, long)

.

If the implementation supports

stored defaults

and such a
default exists, is accessible, and could be converted to a long
with

Long.parseLong

, this long is returned in preference to
the specified default.

**Parameters:** key

- key whose associated value is to be returned as a long.
**Parameters:** def

- getBoolean

```java
public abstract boolean getBoolean​(
String
key,
boolean def)
```

Returns the boolean value represented by the string associated with the
specified key in this preference node. Valid strings
are

"true"

, which represents true, and

"false"

, which
represents false. Case is ignored, so, for example,

"TRUE"

and

"False"

are also valid. This method is intended for use in
conjunction with

putBoolean(java.lang.String, boolean)

.

Returns the specified default if there is no value
associated with the key, the backing store is inaccessible, or if the
associated value is something other than

"true"

or

"false"

, ignoring case.

If the implementation supports

stored defaults

and such a
default exists and is accessible, it is used in preference to the
specified default, unless the stored default is something other than

"true"

or

"false"

, ignoring case, in which case the
specified default is used.

**Parameters:** key

- key whose associated value is to be returned as a boolean.

Float.parseFloat(String)

would throw a

NumberFormatException

if the associated value were passed.
This method is intended for use in conjunction with

putFloat(java.lang.String, float)

.

If the implementation supports

stored defaults

and such a
default exists, is accessible, and could be converted to a float
with

Float.parseFloat

, this float is returned in preference to
the specified default.

Returns the double value represented by the string associated with the
specified key in this preference node. The string is converted to an
integer as by

Double.parseDouble(String)

. Returns the specified
default if there is no value associated with the key, the backing store
is inaccessible, or if

Double.parseDouble(String)

would throw a

NumberFormatException

if the associated value were passed.
This method is intended for use in conjunction with

putDouble(java.lang.String, double)

.

If the implementation supports

stored defaults

and such a
default exists, is accessible, and could be converted to a double
with

get(String,String)

- putByteArray

```java
public abstract void putByteArray​(
String
key,
byte[] value)
```

Associates a string representing the specified byte array with the
specified key in this preference node. The associated string is
the

Base64

encoding of the byte array, as defined in

RFC 2045

, Section 6.8,
with one minor change: the string will consist solely of characters
from the

Base64 Alphabet

; it will not contain any newline
characters. Note that the maximum length of the byte array is limited
to three quarters of

MAX_VALUE_LENGTH

so that the length
of the Base64 encoded String does not exceed

MAX_VALUE_LENGTH

.
This method is intended for use in conjunction with

getByteArray(java.lang.String, byte[])

.

**Parameters:** key

- key with which the string form of value is to be associated.
**Parameters:** value

- value whose string form is to be associated with key.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if key or value is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if key.length() exceeds MAX_KEY_LENGTH
or if value.length exceeds MAX_VALUE_LENGTH*3/4.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if key contains
the null control character, code point U+0000.
**See Also:** getByteArray(String,byte[])

,

get(String,String)

- getByteArray

```java
public abstract byte[] getByteArray​(
String
key,
byte[] def)
```

Returns the byte array value represented by the string associated with
the specified key in this preference node. Valid strings are

Base64

encoded binary data, as defined in

RFC 2045

, Section 6.8,
with one minor change: the string must consist solely of characters
from the

Base64 Alphabet

; no newline characters or
extraneous characters are permitted. This method is intended for use
in conjunction with

putByteArray(java.lang.String, byte[])

.

Returns the specified default if there is no value
associated with the key, the backing store is inaccessible, or if the
associated value is not a valid Base64 encoded byte array
(as defined above).

If the implementation supports

stored defaults

and such a
default exists and is accessible, it is used in preference to the
specified default, unless the stored default is not a valid Base64
encoded byte array (as defined above), in which case the
specified default is used.

**Parameters:** key

- key whose associated value is to be returned as a byte array.
**Parameters:** def

- the value to be returned in the event that this
preference node has no value associated with

key

or the associated value cannot be interpreted as a byte array,
or the backing store is inaccessible.
**Returns:** the byte array value represented by the string associated with

key

in this preference node, or

def

if the
associated value does not exist or cannot be interpreted as
a byte array.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

key

is

null

. (A

null

value for

def

is

permitted.)
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if key contains the null control
character, code point U+0000.
**See Also:** get(String,String)

,

putByteArray(String,byte[])

- keys

```java
public abstract
String
[] keys()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Returns all of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node. (The returned array will be of size zero if
this node has no preferences.)

If the implementation supports

stored defaults

and there
are any such defaults at this node that have not been overridden,
by explicit preferences, the defaults are returned in the array in
addition to any explicit preferences.

**Returns:** an array of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- childrenNames

```java
public abstract
String
[] childrenNames()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Returns the names of the children of this preference node, relative to
this node. (The returned array will be of size zero if this node has
no children.)

**Returns:** the names of the children of this preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- parent

```java
public abstract
Preferences
parent()
```

Returns the parent of this preference node, or

null

if this is
the root.

**Returns:** the parent of this preference node.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- node

```java
public abstract
Preferences
node​(
String
pathName)
```

Returns the named preference node in the same tree as this node,
creating it and any of its ancestors if they do not already exist.
Accepts a relative or absolute path name. Relative path names
(which do not begin with the slash character

('/')

) are
interpreted relative to this preference node.

If the returned node did not exist prior to this call, this node and
any ancestors that were created by this call are not guaranteed
to become permanent until the

flush

method is called on
the returned node (or one of its ancestors or descendants).

**Parameters:** pathName

- the path name of the preference node to return.
**Returns:** the specified preference node.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if path name is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** flush()

- nodeExists

```java
public abstract boolean nodeExists​(
String
pathName)
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Returns true if the named preference node exists in the same tree
as this node. Relative path names (which do not begin with the slash
character

('/')

) are interpreted relative to this preference
node.

If this node (or an ancestor) has already been removed with the

removeNode()

method, it

is

legal to invoke this method,
but only with the path name

""

; the invocation will return

false

. Thus, the idiom

p.nodeExists("")

may be
used to test whether

p

has been removed.

**Parameters:** pathName

- the path name of the node whose existence
is to be checked.
**Returns:** true if the specified node exists.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if path name is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method and

pathName

is not the empty string (

""

).

- removeNode

```java
public abstract void removeNode()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Removes this preference node and all of its descendants, invalidating
any preferences contained in the removed nodes. Once a node has been
removed, attempting any method other than

name()

,

absolutePath()

,

isUserNode()

,

flush()

or

nodeExists("")

on the corresponding

Preferences

instance will fail with an

IllegalStateException

. (The methods defined on

Object

can still be invoked on a node after it has been removed; they will not
throw

IllegalStateException

.)

The removal is not guaranteed to be persistent until the

flush

method is called on this node (or an ancestor).

If this implementation supports

stored defaults

, removing a
node exposes any stored defaults at or below this node. Thus, a
subsequent call to

nodeExists

on this node's path name may
return

true

, and a subsequent call to

node

on this
path name may return a (different)

Preferences

instance
representing a non-empty collection of preferences and/or children.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has already
been removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this method is invoked on
the root node.
**See Also:** flush()

- name

```java
public abstract
String
name()
```

Returns this preference node's name, relative to its parent.

**Returns:** this preference node's name, relative to its parent.

- absolutePath

```java
public abstract
String
absolutePath()
```

Returns this preference node's absolute path name.

**Returns:** this preference node's absolute path name.

- isUserNode

```java
public abstract boolean isUserNode()
```

Returns

true

if this preference node is in the user
preference tree,

false

if it's in the system preference tree.

**Returns:** true

if this preference node is in the user
preference tree,

false

if it's in the system
preference tree.

- toString

```java
public abstract
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this preferences node,
as if computed by the expression:

(this.isUserNode() ? "User" :
"System") + " Preference Node: " + this.absolutePath()

.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of the object.

- flush

```java
public abstract void flush()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Forces any changes in the contents of this preference node and its
descendants to the persistent store. Once this method returns
successfully, it is safe to assume that all changes made in the
subtree rooted at this node prior to the method invocation have become
permanent.

Implementations are free to flush changes into the persistent store
at any time. They do not need to wait for this method to be called.

When a flush occurs on a newly created node, it is made persistent,
as are any ancestors (and descendants) that have yet to be made
persistent. Note however that any preference value changes in
ancestors are

not

guaranteed to be made persistent.

If this method is invoked on a node that has been removed with
the

removeNode()

method, flushSpi() is invoked on this node,
but not on others.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**See Also:** sync()

- sync

```java
public abstract void sync()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Ensures that future reads from this preference node and its
descendants reflect any changes that were committed to the persistent
store (from any VM) prior to the

sync

invocation. As a
side-effect, forces any changes in the contents of this preference node
and its descendants to the persistent store, as if the

flush

method had been invoked on this node.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** flush()

- addPreferenceChangeListener

```java
public abstract void addPreferenceChangeListener​(
PreferenceChangeListener
pcl)
```

Registers the specified listener to receive

preference change
events

for this preference node. A preference change event is
generated when a preference is added to this node, removed from this
node, or when the value associated with a preference is changed.
(Preference change events are

not

generated by the

removeNode()

method, which generates a

node change event

.
Preference change events

are

generated by the

clear

method.)

Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
events for changes made outside this JVM. Events may be generated
before the changes have been made persistent. Events are not generated
when preferences are modified in descendants of this node; a caller
desiring such events must register with each descendant.

**Parameters:** pcl

- The preference change listener to add.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

pcl

is null.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** removePreferenceChangeListener(PreferenceChangeListener)

,

addNodeChangeListener(NodeChangeListener)

- removePreferenceChangeListener

```java
public abstract void removePreferenceChangeListener​(
PreferenceChangeListener
pcl)
```

Removes the specified preference change listener, so it no longer
receives preference change events.

**Parameters:** pcl

- The preference change listener to remove.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

pcl

was not a registered
preference change listener on this node.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** addPreferenceChangeListener(PreferenceChangeListener)

- addNodeChangeListener

```java
public abstract void addNodeChangeListener​(
NodeChangeListener
ncl)
```

Registers the specified listener to receive

node change events

for this node. A node change event is generated when a child node is
added to or removed from this node. (A single

removeNode()

invocation results in multiple

node change events

, one for every
node in the subtree rooted at the removed node.)

Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
events for changes made outside this JVM. Events may be generated
before the changes have become permanent. Events are not generated
when indirect descendants of this node are added or removed; a
caller desiring such events must register with each descendant.

Few guarantees can be made regarding node creation. Because nodes
are created implicitly upon access, it may not be feasible for an
implementation to determine whether a child node existed in the backing
store prior to access (for example, because the backing store is
unreachable or cached information is out of date). Under these
circumstances, implementations are neither required to generate node
change events nor prohibited from doing so.

**Parameters:** ncl

- The

NodeChangeListener

to add.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

ncl

is null.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** removeNodeChangeListener(NodeChangeListener)

,

addPreferenceChangeListener(PreferenceChangeListener)

- removeNodeChangeListener

```java
public abstract void removeNodeChangeListener​(
NodeChangeListener
ncl)
```

Removes the specified

NodeChangeListener

, so it no longer
receives change events.

**Parameters:** ncl

- The

NodeChangeListener

to remove.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

ncl

was not a registered

NodeChangeListener

on this node.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** addNodeChangeListener(NodeChangeListener)

- exportNode

```java
public abstract void exportNode​(
OutputStream
os)
throws
IOException
,

BackingStoreException
```

Emits on the specified output stream an XML document representing all
of the preferences contained in this node (but not its descendants).
This XML document is, in effect, an offline backup of the node.

The XML document will have the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

The UTF-8 character encoding will be used.

This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
results equivalent to some serial execution. If the preferences
at this node are modified concurrently with an invocation of this
method, the exported preferences comprise a "fuzzy snapshot" of the
preferences contained in the node; some of the concurrent modifications
may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.

**Parameters:** os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

IOException

.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if preference data cannot be read from
backing store.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** importPreferences(InputStream)

- exportSubtree

```java
public abstract void exportSubtree​(
OutputStream
os)
throws
IOException
,

BackingStoreException
```

Emits an XML document representing all of the preferences contained
in this node and all of its descendants. This XML document is, in
effect, an offline backup of the subtree rooted at the node.

The XML document will have the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

The UTF-8 character encoding will be used.

This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
results equivalent to some serial execution. If the preferences
or nodes in the subtree rooted at this node are modified concurrently
with an invocation of this method, the exported preferences comprise a
"fuzzy snapshot" of the subtree; some of the concurrent modifications
may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.

**Parameters:** os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

IOException

.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if preference data cannot be read from
backing store.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** importPreferences(InputStream)

,

exportNode(OutputStream)

- importPreferences

```java
public static void importPreferences​(
InputStream
is)
throws
IOException
,

InvalidPreferencesFormatException
```

Imports all of the preferences represented by the XML document on the
specified input stream. The document may represent user preferences or
system preferences. If it represents user preferences, the preferences
will be imported into the calling user's preference tree (even if they
originally came from a different user's preference tree). If any of
the preferences described by the document inhabit preference nodes that
do not exist, the nodes will be created.

The XML document must have the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

(This method is designed for use in conjunction with

exportNode(OutputStream)

and

exportSubtree(OutputStream)

.

This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
results equivalent to some serial execution. The method behaves
as if implemented on top of the other public methods in this class,
notably

node(String)

and

put(String, String)

.

**Parameters:** is

- the input stream from which to read the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if reading from the specified input stream
results in an

IOException

.
**Throws:** InvalidPreferencesFormatException

- Data on input stream does not
constitute a valid XML document with the mandated document type.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is present and
it denies

RuntimePermission("preferences")

.

#### Method Detail

userNodeForPackage

```java
public static
Preferences
userNodeForPackage​(
Class
<?> c)
```

Returns the preference node from the calling user's preference tree
that is associated (by convention) with the specified class's package.
The convention is as follows: the absolute path name of the node is the
fully qualified package name, preceded by a slash (

'/'

), and
with each period (

'.'

) replaced by a slash. For example the
absolute path name of the node associated with the class

com.acme.widget.Foo

is

/com/acme/widget

.

This convention does not apply to the unnamed package, whose
associated preference node is

<unnamed>

. This node
is not intended for long term use, but for convenience in the early
development of programs that do not yet belong to a package, and
for "throwaway" programs.

Valuable data should not be stored
at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.

A class

Foo

wishing to access preferences pertaining to its
package can obtain a preference node as follows:

```java
static Preferences prefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(Foo.class);
```

This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the
preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a run-time failure.
(If the class name is misspelled, it will typically result in a
compile-time error.)

Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned

#### userNodeForPackage

public static

Preferences

userNodeForPackage​(

Class

<?> c)

Returns the preference node from the calling user's preference tree
that is associated (by convention) with the specified class's package.
The convention is as follows: the absolute path name of the node is the
fully qualified package name, preceded by a slash (

'/'

), and
with each period (

'.'

) replaced by a slash. For example the
absolute path name of the node associated with the class

com.acme.widget.Foo

is

/com/acme/widget

.

This convention does not apply to the unnamed package, whose
associated preference node is

<unnamed>

. This node
is not intended for long term use, but for convenience in the early
development of programs that do not yet belong to a package, and
for "throwaway" programs.

Valuable data should not be stored
at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.

A class

Foo

wishing to access preferences pertaining to its
package can obtain a preference node as follows:

```java
static Preferences prefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(Foo.class);
```

This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the
preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a run-time failure.
(If the class name is misspelled, it will typically result in a
compile-time error.)

Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned
node and its ancestors if they do not already exist. If the returned
node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that
were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until
the

flush

method is called on the returned node (or one of its
ancestors or descendants).

Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
events for changes made outside this JVM. Events may be generated
before the changes have been made persistent. Events are not generated
when preferences are modified in descendants of this node; a caller
desiring such events must register with each descendant.

**Parameters:** pcl

- The preference change listener to add.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

pcl

is null.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

---

#### addPreferenceChangeListener

public abstract void addPreferenceChangeListener​(

PreferenceChangeListener

pcl)

Registers the specified listener to receive

preference change
events

for this preference node. A preference change event is
generated when a preference is added to this node, removed from this
node, or when the value associated with a preference is changed.
(Preference change events are

not

generated by the

removeNode()

method, which generates a

node change event

.
Preference change events

are

generated by the

clear

method.)

Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
events for changes made outside this JVM. Events may be generated
before the changes have been made persistent. Events are not generated
when preferences are modified in descendants of this node; a caller
desiring such events must register with each descendant.

removePreferenceChangeListener

```java
public abstract void removePreferenceChangeListener​(
PreferenceChangeListener
pcl)
```

Removes the specified preference change listener, so it no longer
receives preference change events.

**Parameters:** pcl

- The preference change listener to remove.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

pcl

was not a registered
preference change listener on this node.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

#### removePreferenceChangeListener

public abstract void removePreferenceChangeListener​(

PreferenceChangeListener

pcl)

Removes the specified preference change listener, so it no longer
receives preference change events.

addNodeChangeListener

```java
public abstract void addNodeChangeListener​(
NodeChangeListener
ncl)
```

Registers the specified listener to receive

node change events

for this node. A node change event is generated when a child node is
added to or removed from this node. (A single

removeNode()

invocation results in multiple

node change events

, one for every
node in the subtree rooted at the removed node.)

Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
events for changes made outside this JVM. Events may be generated
before the changes have become permanent. Events are not generated
when indirect descendants of this node are added or removed; a
caller desiring such events must register with each descendant.

Few guarantees can be made regarding node creation. Because nodes
are created implicitly upon access, it may not be feasible for an
implementation to determine whether a child node existed in the backing
store prior to access (for example, because the backing store is
unreachable or cached information is out of date). Under these
circumstances, implementations are neither required to generate node
change events nor prohibited from doing so.

**Parameters:** ncl

- The

NodeChangeListener

to add.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

ncl

is null.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

exportNode

```java
public abstract void exportNode​(
OutputStream
os)
throws
IOException
,

BackingStoreException
```

Emits on the specified output stream an XML document representing all
of the preferences contained in this node (but not its descendants).
This XML document is, in effect, an offline backup of the node.

The XML document will have the following DOCTYPE declaration:

```java
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
```

The UTF-8 character encoding will be used.

This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
results equivalent to some serial execution. If the preferences
at this node are modified concurrently with an invocation of this
method, the exported preferences comprise a "fuzzy snapshot" of the
preferences contained in the node; some of the concurrent modifications
may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.

**Parameters:** os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

IOException

.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if preference data cannot be read from
