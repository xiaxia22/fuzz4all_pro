### Class Description

```java
public interface
LoginModule
```

Service-provider interface for authentication technology providers.
LoginModules are plugged in under applications to provide a particular
type of authentication.

While applications write to the

LoginContext

API,
authentication technology providers implement the

LoginModule

interface.
A

Configuration

specifies the LoginModule(s)
to be used with a particular login application. Therefore different
LoginModules can be plugged in under the application without
requiring any modifications to the application itself.

The

LoginContext

is responsible for reading the

Configuration

and instantiating the appropriate
LoginModules. Each

LoginModule

is initialized with
a

Subject

, a

CallbackHandler

, shared

LoginModule

state, and LoginModule-specific options.

The

Subject

represents the

Subject

currently being authenticated and is updated
with relevant Credentials if authentication succeeds.
LoginModules use the

CallbackHandler

to
communicate with users. The

CallbackHandler

may be
used to prompt for usernames and passwords, for example.
Note that the

CallbackHandler

may be

null

. LoginModules
which absolutely require a

CallbackHandler

to authenticate
the

Subject

may throw a

LoginException

.
LoginModules optionally use the shared state to share information
or data among themselves.

The LoginModule-specific options represent the options
configured for this

LoginModule

by an administrator or user
in the login

Configuration

.
The options are defined by the

LoginModule

itself
and control the behavior within it. For example, a

LoginModule

may define options to support debugging/testing
capabilities. Options are defined using a key-value syntax,
such as

debug=true

. The

LoginModule

stores the options as a

Map

so that the values may
be retrieved using the key. Note that there is no limit to the number
of options a

LoginModule

chooses to define.

The calling application sees the authentication process as a single
operation. However, the authentication process within the

LoginModule

proceeds in two distinct phases.
In the first phase, the LoginModule's

login

method gets invoked by the LoginContext's

login

method. The

login

method for the

LoginModule

then performs
the actual authentication (prompt for and verify a password for example)
and saves its authentication status as private state
information. Once finished, the LoginModule's

login

method either returns

true

(if it succeeded) or

false

(if it should be ignored), or throws a

LoginException

to specify a failure.
In the failure case, the

LoginModule

must not retry the
authentication or introduce delays. The responsibility of such tasks
belongs to the application. If the application attempts to retry
the authentication, the LoginModule's

login

method will be
called again.

In the second phase, if the LoginContext's overall authentication
succeeded (the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL
LoginModules succeeded), then the

commit

method for the

LoginModule

gets invoked.
The

commit

method for a

LoginModule

checks its
privately saved state to see if its own authentication succeeded.
If the overall

LoginContext

authentication succeeded
and the LoginModule's own authentication succeeded, then the

commit

method associates the relevant
Principals (authenticated identities) and Credentials (authentication data
such as cryptographic keys) with the

Subject

located within the

LoginModule

.

If the LoginContext's overall authentication failed (the relevant
REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL LoginModules did not succeed),
then the

abort

method for each

LoginModule

gets invoked. In this case, the

LoginModule

removes/destroys
any authentication state originally saved.

Logging out a

Subject

involves only one phase.
The

LoginContext

invokes the LoginModule's

logout

method. The

logout

method for the

LoginModule

then performs the logout procedures, such as removing Principals or
Credentials from the

Subject

or logging session information.

A

LoginModule

implementation must have a constructor with
no arguments. This allows classes which load the

LoginModule

to instantiate it.

### Method Details

#### void initialize​(
Subject
subject,

CallbackHandler
callbackHandler,

Map
<
String
,​?> sharedState,

Map
<
String
,​?> options)

Initialize this

LoginModule

.

This method is called by the

LoginContext

after this

LoginModule

has been instantiated.
The purpose of this method is to initialize this

LoginModule

with the relevant information.
If this

LoginModule

does not understand
any of the data stored in

sharedState

or

options

parameters, they can be ignored.

**Parameters:**
- subject

- the

Subject

to be authenticated.
- callbackHandler

- a

CallbackHandler

for communicating
with the end user (prompting for usernames and
passwords, for example).
- sharedState

- state shared with other configured LoginModules.
- options

- options specified in the login

Configuration

for this particular

LoginModule

.

---

#### boolean login()
throws
LoginException

Method to authenticate a

Subject

(phase 1).

The implementation of this method authenticates
a

Subject

. For example, it may prompt for

Subject

information such
as a username and password and then attempt to verify the password.
This method saves the result of the authentication attempt
as private state within the

LoginModule

.

**Returns:**
- true

if the authentication succeeded, or

false

if this

LoginModule

should be ignored.

**Throws:**
- LoginException

- if the authentication fails

---

#### boolean commit()
throws
LoginException

Method to commit the authentication process (phase 2).

This method is called if the LoginContext's
overall authentication succeeded
(the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL LoginModules
succeeded).

If this LoginModule's own authentication attempt
succeeded (checked by retrieving the private state saved by the

login

method), then this method associates relevant
Principals and Credentials with the

Subject

located in the

LoginModule

. If this LoginModule's own
authentication attempted failed, then this method removes/destroys
any state that was originally saved.

**Returns:**
- true

if this method succeeded, or

false

if this

LoginModule

should be ignored.

**Throws:**
- LoginException

- if the commit fails

---

#### boolean abort()
throws
LoginException

Method to abort the authentication process (phase 2).

This method is called if the LoginContext's
overall authentication failed.
(the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL LoginModules
did not succeed).

If this LoginModule's own authentication attempt
succeeded (checked by retrieving the private state saved by the

login

method), then this method cleans up any state
that was originally saved.

**Returns:**
- true

if this method succeeded, or

false

if this

LoginModule

should be ignored.

**Throws:**
- LoginException

- if the abort fails

---

#### boolean logout()
throws
LoginException

Method which logs out a

Subject

.

An implementation of this method might remove/destroy a Subject's
Principals and Credentials.

**Returns:**
- true

if this method succeeded, or

false

if this

LoginModule

should be ignored.

**Throws:**
- LoginException

- if the logout fails

**Implementation Note:**
- Implementations should check if a variable is

null

before removing it from the Principals or Credentials set
of a

Subject

, otherwise a

NullPointerException

will be thrown as these sets

prohibit null elements

. This is especially important if
this method is called after a login failure.

(if it succeeded) or

false

(if it should be ignored), or throws a

LoginException

to specify a failure.
In the failure case, the

LoginModule

must not retry the
authentication or introduce delays. The responsibility of such tasks
belongs to the application. If the application attempts to retry
the authentication, the LoginModule's

login

method will be
called again.

In the second phase, if the LoginContext's overall authentication
succeeded (the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL
LoginModules succeeded), then the

commit

method for the

LoginModule

gets invoked.
The

commit

method for a

LoginModule

checks its
privately saved state to see if its own authentication succeeded.
If the overall

LoginContext

authentication succeeded
and the LoginModule's own authentication succeeded, then the

commit

method associates the relevant
Principals (authenticated identities) and Credentials (authentication data
such as cryptographic keys) with the

Subject

located within the

LoginModule

.

If the LoginContext's overall authentication failed (the relevant
REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL LoginModules did not succeed),
then the

abort

method for each

LoginModule

gets invoked. In this case, the

LoginModule

removes/destroys
any authentication state originally saved.

Logging out a

Subject

involves only one phase.
The

LoginContext

invokes the LoginModule's

logout

method. The

logout

method for the

LoginModule

then performs the logout procedures, such as removing Principals or
Credentials from the

Subject

or logging session information.

A

LoginModule

implementation must have a constructor with
no arguments. This allows classes which load the

LoginModule

to instantiate it.

In the second phase, if the LoginContext's overall authentication
succeeded (the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL
LoginModules succeeded), then the

commit

method for the

LoginModule
