# Interface Instrumentation

**Source:** `java.instrument\java\lang\instrument\Instrumentation.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Instrumentation
```

This class provides services needed to instrument Java
programming language code.
Instrumentation is the addition of byte-codes to methods for the
purpose of gathering data to be utilized by tools.
Since the changes are purely additive, these tools do not modify
application state or behavior.
Examples of such benign tools include monitoring agents, profilers,
coverage analyzers, and event loggers.

There are two ways to obtain an instance of the

Instrumentation

interface:

- When a JVM is launched in a way that indicates an agent
class. In that case an

Instrumentation

instance
is passed to the

premain

method of the agent class.
- When a JVM provides a mechanism to start agents sometime
after the JVM is launched. In that case an

Instrumentation

instance is passed to the

agentmain

method of the
agent code.

These mechanisms are described in the

package specification

.

Once an agent acquires an

Instrumentation

instance,
the agent may call methods on the instance at any time.

### Method Details

#### void addTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer,
boolean canRetransform)

Registers the supplied transformer. All future class definitions
will be seen by the transformer, except definitions of classes upon which any
registered transformer is dependent.
The transformer is called when classes are loaded, when they are

redefined

. and if

canRetransform

is true,
when they are

retransformed

.

ClassFileTransformer

defines the order of transform calls.

If a transformer throws
an exception during execution, the JVM will still call the other registered
transformers in order. The same transformer may be added more than once,
but it is strongly discouraged -- avoid this by creating a new instance of
transformer class.

This method is intended for use in instrumentation, as described in the

class specification

.

**Parameters:**
- transformer

- the transformer to register
- canRetransform

- can this transformer's transformations be retransformed

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if

canRetransform

is true and the current configuration of the JVM does not allow
retransformation (

isRetransformClassesSupported()

is false)

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### void addTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer)

Registers the supplied transformer.

Same as

addTransformer(transformer, false)

.

**Parameters:**
- transformer

- the transformer to register

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer

**See Also:**
- addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer,boolean)

---

#### boolean removeTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer)

Unregisters the supplied transformer. Future class definitions will
not be shown to the transformer. Removes the most-recently-added matching
instance of the transformer. Due to the multi-threaded nature of
class loading, it is possible for a transformer to receive calls
after it has been removed. Transformers should be written defensively
to expect this situation.

**Parameters:**
- transformer

- the transformer to unregister

**Returns:**
- true if the transformer was found and removed, false if the
transformer was not found

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer

---

#### boolean isRetransformClassesSupported()

Returns whether or not the current JVM configuration supports retransformation
of classes.
The ability to retransform an already loaded class is an optional capability
of a JVM.
Retransformation will only be supported if the

Can-Retransform-Classes

manifest attribute is set to

true

in the agent JAR file (as described in the

package specification

) and the JVM supports
this capability.
During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple calls to this
method will always return the same answer.

**Returns:**
- true if the current JVM configuration supports retransformation of
classes, false if not.

**See Also:**
- retransformClasses(java.lang.Class<?>...)

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### void retransformClasses​(
Class
<?>... classes)
throws
UnmodifiableClassException

Retransform the supplied set of classes.

This function facilitates the instrumentation
of already loaded classes.
When classes are initially loaded or when they are

redefined

,
the initial class file bytes can be transformed with the

ClassFileTransformer

.
This function reruns the transformation process
(whether or not a transformation has previously occurred).
This retransformation follows these steps:

- starting from the initial class file bytes
- for each transformer that was added with

canRetransform

false, the bytes returned by

transform

during the last class load or redefine are
reused as the output of the transformation; note that this is
equivalent to reapplying the previous transformation, unaltered;
except that

transform

method is not called.
- for each transformer that was added with

canRetransform

true, the

transform

method is called in these transformers
- the transformed class file bytes are installed as the new
definition of the class

The order of transformation is described in

ClassFileTransformer

.
This same order is used in the automatic reapplication of
retransformation incapable transforms.

The initial class file bytes represent the bytes passed to

ClassLoader.defineClass

or

redefineClasses

(before any transformations
were applied), however they might not exactly match them.
The constant pool might not have the same layout or contents.
The constant pool may have more or fewer entries.
Constant pool entries may be in a different order; however,
constant pool indices in the bytecodes of methods will correspond.
Some attributes may not be present.
Where order is not meaningful, for example the order of methods,
order might not be preserved.

This method operates on
a set in order to allow interdependent changes to more than one class at the same time
(a retransformation of class A can require a retransformation of class B).

If a retransformed method has active stack frames, those active frames continue to
run the bytecodes of the original method.
The retransformed method will be used on new invokes.

This method does not cause any initialization except that which would occur
under the customary JVM semantics. In other words, redefining a class
does not cause its initializers to be run. The values of static variables
will remain as they were prior to the call.

Instances of the retransformed class are not affected.

The retransformation may change method bodies, the constant pool and
attributes (unless explicitly prohibited).
The retransformation must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the
signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
The retransformation must not change the

NestHost

or

NestMembers

attributes.
These restrictions may be lifted in future versions.
The class file bytes are not checked, verified and installed
until after the transformations have been applied, if the resultant bytes are in
error this method will throw an exception.

If this method throws an exception, no classes have been retransformed.

This method is intended for use in instrumentation, as described in the

class specification

.

**Parameters:**
- classes

- array of classes to retransform;
a zero-length array is allowed, in this case, this method does nothing

**Throws:**
- UnmodifiableClassException

- if a specified class cannot be modified
(

isModifiableClass(java.lang.Class<?>)

would return

false

)
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the current configuration of the JVM does not allow
retransformation (

isRetransformClassesSupported()

is false) or the retransformation attempted
to make unsupported changes
- ClassFormatError

- if the data did not contain a valid class
- NoClassDefFoundError

- if the name in the class file is not equal to the name of the class
- UnsupportedClassVersionError

- if the class file version numbers are not supported
- ClassCircularityError

- if the new classes contain a circularity
- LinkageError

- if a linkage error occurs
- NullPointerException

- if the supplied classes array or any of its components
is

null

.

#### boolean isRedefineClassesSupported()

Returns whether or not the current JVM configuration supports redefinition
of classes.
The ability to redefine an already loaded class is an optional capability
of a JVM.
Redefinition will only be supported if the

Can-Redefine-Classes

manifest attribute is set to

true

in the agent JAR file (as described in the

package specification

) and the JVM supports
this capability.
During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple calls to this
method will always return the same answer.

**Returns:**
- true if the current JVM configuration supports redefinition of classes,
false if not.

**See Also:**
- redefineClasses(java.lang.instrument.ClassDefinition...)

---

#### void redefineClasses​(
ClassDefinition
... definitions)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
,

UnmodifiableClassException

Redefine the supplied set of classes using the supplied class files.

This method is used to replace the definition of a class without reference
to the existing class file bytes, as one might do when recompiling from source
for fix-and-continue debugging.
Where the existing class file bytes are to be transformed (for
example in bytecode instrumentation)

retransformClasses

should be used.

This method operates on
a set in order to allow interdependent changes to more than one class at the same time
(a redefinition of class A can require a redefinition of class B).

If a redefined method has active stack frames, those active frames continue to
run the bytecodes of the original method.
The redefined method will be used on new invokes.

This method does not cause any initialization except that which would occur
under the customary JVM semantics. In other words, redefining a class
does not cause its initializers to be run. The values of static variables
will remain as they were prior to the call.

Instances of the redefined class are not affected.

The redefinition may change method bodies, the constant pool and attributes
(unless explicitly prohibited).
The redefinition must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the
signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
The redefinition must not change the

NestHost

or

NestMembers

attributes.
These restrictions may be lifted in future versions.
The class file bytes are not checked, verified and installed
until after the transformations have been applied, if the resultant bytes are in
error this method will throw an exception.

If this method throws an exception, no classes have been redefined.

This method is intended for use in instrumentation, as described in the

class specification

.

**Parameters:**
- definitions

- array of classes to redefine with corresponding definitions;
a zero-length array is allowed, in this case, this method does nothing

**Throws:**
- UnmodifiableClassException

- if a specified class cannot be modified
(

isModifiableClass(java.lang.Class<?>)

would return

false

)
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the current configuration of the JVM does not allow
redefinition (

isRedefineClassesSupported()

is false) or the redefinition attempted
to make unsupported changes
- ClassFormatError

- if the data did not contain a valid class
- NoClassDefFoundError

- if the name in the class file is not equal to the name of the class
- UnsupportedClassVersionError

- if the class file version numbers are not supported
- ClassCircularityError

- if the new classes contain a circularity
- LinkageError

- if a linkage error occurs
- NullPointerException

- if the supplied definitions array or any of its components
is

null
- ClassNotFoundException

- Can never be thrown (present for compatibility reasons only)

#### boolean isModifiableClass​(
Class
<?> theClass)

Tests whether a class is modifiable by

retransformation

or

redefinition

.
If a class is modifiable then this method returns

true

.
If a class is not modifiable then this method returns

false

.

For a class to be retransformed,

isRetransformClassesSupported()

must also be true.
But the value of

isRetransformClassesSupported()

does not influence the value
returned by this function.
For a class to be redefined,

isRedefineClassesSupported()

must also be true.
But the value of

isRedefineClassesSupported()

does not influence the value
returned by this function.

Primitive classes (for example,

java.lang.Integer.TYPE

)
and array classes are never modifiable.

**Parameters:**
- theClass

- the class to check for being modifiable

**Returns:**
- whether or not the argument class is modifiable

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the specified class is

null

.

#### Class
[] getAllLoadedClasses()

Returns an array of all classes currently loaded by the JVM.

**Returns:**
- an array containing all the classes loaded by the JVM, zero-length if there are none

---

#### Class
[] getInitiatedClasses​(
ClassLoader
loader)

Returns an array of all classes for which

loader

is an initiating loader.
If the supplied loader is

null

, classes initiated by the bootstrap class
loader are returned.

**Parameters:**
- loader

- the loader whose initiated class list will be returned

**Returns:**
- an array containing all the classes for which loader is an initiating loader,
zero-length if there are none

---

#### long getObjectSize​(
Object
objectToSize)

Returns an implementation-specific approximation of the amount of storage consumed by
the specified object. The result may include some or all of the object's overhead,
and thus is useful for comparison within an implementation but not between implementations.

The estimate may change during a single invocation of the JVM.

**Parameters:**
- objectToSize

- the object to size

**Returns:**
- an implementation-specific approximation of the amount of storage consumed by the specified object

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the supplied Object is

null

.

---

#### void appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch​(
JarFile
jarfile)

Specifies a JAR file with instrumentation classes to be defined by the
bootstrap class loader.

When the virtual machine's built-in class loader, known as the "bootstrap
class loader", unsuccessfully searches for a class, the entries in the

JAR file

will be searched as well.

This method may be used multiple times to add multiple JAR files to be
searched in the order that this method was invoked.

The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any
classes or resources other than those to be defined by the bootstrap
class loader for the purpose of instrumentation.
Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected
behavior that is difficult to diagnose. For example, suppose there is a
loader L, and L's parent for delegation is the bootstrap class loader.
Furthermore, a method in class C, a class defined by L, makes reference to
a non-public accessor class C$1. If the JAR file contains a class C$1 then
the delegation to the bootstrap class loader will cause C$1 to be defined
by the bootstrap class loader. In this example an

IllegalAccessError

will be thrown that may cause the application to fail. One approach to
avoiding these types of issues, is to use a unique package name for the
instrumentation classes.

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

specifies that a subsequent attempt to resolve a symbolic
reference that the Java virtual machine has previously unsuccessfully attempted
to resolve always fails with the same error that was thrown as a result of the
initial resolution attempt. Consequently, if the JAR file contains an entry
that corresponds to a class for which the Java virtual machine has
unsuccessfully attempted to resolve a reference, then subsequent attempts to
resolve that reference will fail with the same error as the initial attempt.

**Parameters:**
- jarfile

- The JAR file to be searched when the bootstrap class loader
unsuccessfully searches for a class.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

jarfile

is

null

.

JarFile

**Since:**

---

#### void appendToSystemClassLoaderSearch​(
JarFile
jarfile)

Specifies a JAR file with instrumentation classes to be defined by the
system class loader.

When the system class loader for delegation (see

getSystemClassLoader()

)
unsuccessfully searches for a class, the entries in the

JarFile

will be searched as well.

This method may be used multiple times to add multiple JAR files to be
searched in the order that this method was invoked.

The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any
classes or resources other than those to be defined by the system class
loader for the purpose of instrumentation.
Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected
behavior that is difficult to diagnose (see

appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch

).

The system class loader supports adding a JAR file to be searched if
it implements a method named

appendToClassPathForInstrumentation

which takes a single parameter of type

java.lang.String

. The
method is not required to have

public

access. The name of
the JAR file is obtained by invoking the

getName()

method on the

jarfile

and this is provided as the
parameter to the

appendToClassPathForInstrumentation

method.

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

specifies that a subsequent attempt to resolve a symbolic
reference that the Java virtual machine has previously unsuccessfully attempted
to resolve always fails with the same error that was thrown as a result of the
initial resolution attempt. Consequently, if the JAR file contains an entry
that corresponds to a class for which the Java virtual machine has
unsuccessfully attempted to resolve a reference, then subsequent attempts to
resolve that reference will fail with the same error as the initial attempt.

This method does not change the value of

java.class.path

system property

.

**Parameters:**
- jarfile

- The JAR file to be searched when the system class loader
unsuccessfully searches for a class.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If the system class loader does not support appending a
a JAR file to be searched.
- NullPointerException

- If

jarfile

is

null

.

#### boolean isNativeMethodPrefixSupported()

Returns whether the current JVM configuration supports

setting a native method prefix

.
The ability to set a native method prefix is an optional
capability of a JVM.
Setting a native method prefix will only be supported if the

Can-Set-Native-Method-Prefix

manifest attribute is set to

true

in the agent JAR file (as described in the

package specification

) and the JVM supports
this capability.
During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple
calls to this method will always return the same answer.

**Returns:**
- true if the current JVM configuration supports
setting a native method prefix, false if not.

**See Also:**
- setNativeMethodPrefix(java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer, java.lang.String)

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### void setNativeMethodPrefix​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer,

String
prefix)

This method modifies the failure handling of
native method resolution by allowing retry
with a prefix applied to the name.
When used with the

ClassFileTransformer

,
it enables native methods to be
instrumented.

Since native methods cannot be directly instrumented
(they have no bytecodes), they must be wrapped with
a non-native method which can be instrumented.
For example, if we had:

```java
native boolean foo(int x);
```

We could transform the class file (with the
ClassFileTransformer during the initial definition
of the class) so that this becomes:

```java
boolean foo(int x) {

... record entry to foo ...

return wrapped_foo(x);
}

native boolean wrapped_foo(int x);
```

Where

foo

becomes a wrapper for the actual native
method with the appended prefix "wrapped_". Note that
"wrapped_" would be a poor choice of prefix since it
might conceivably form the name of an existing method
thus something like "$$$MyAgentWrapped$$$_" would be
better but would make these examples less readable.

The wrapper will allow data to be collected on the native
method call, but now the problem becomes linking up the
wrapped method with the native implementation.
That is, the method

wrapped_foo

needs to be
resolved to the native implementation of

foo

,
which might be:

```java
Java_somePackage_someClass_foo(JNIEnv* env, jint x)
```

This function allows the prefix to be specified and the
proper resolution to occur.
Specifically, when the standard resolution fails, the
resolution is retried taking the prefix into consideration.
There are two ways that resolution occurs, explicit
resolution with the JNI function

RegisterNatives

and the normal automatic resolution. For

RegisterNatives

, the JVM will attempt this
association:

```java
method(foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
the specified prefix prepended to the method name,
yielding the correct resolution:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

For automatic resolution, the JVM will attempt:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(wrapped_foo)
```

When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
the specified prefix deleted from the implementation name,
yielding the correct resolution:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

Note that since the prefix is only used when standard
resolution fails, native methods can be wrapped selectively.

Since each

ClassFileTransformer

can do its own transformation of the bytecodes, more
than one layer of wrappers may be applied. Thus each
transformer needs its own prefix. Since transformations
are applied in order, the prefixes, if applied, will
be applied in the same order
(see

addTransformer

).
Thus if three transformers applied
wrappers,

foo

might become

$trans3_$trans2_$trans1_foo

. But if, say,
the second transformer did not apply a wrapper to

foo

it would be just

$trans3_$trans1_foo

. To be able to
efficiently determine the sequence of prefixes,
an intermediate prefix is only applied if its non-native
wrapper exists. Thus, in the last example, even though

$trans1_foo

is not a native method, the

$trans1_

prefix is applied since

$trans1_foo

exists.

**Parameters:**
- transformer

- The ClassFileTransformer which wraps using this prefix.
- prefix

- The prefix to apply to wrapped native methods when
retrying a failed native method resolution. If prefix
is either

null

or the empty string, then
failed native method resolutions are not retried for
this transformer.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer.
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the current configuration of
the JVM does not allow setting a native method prefix
(

isNativeMethodPrefixSupported()

is false).
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the transformer is not registered
(see

addTransformer

).

<
Class
<?>,​
List
<
Class
<?>>> extraProvides)

Redefine a module to expand the set of modules that it reads, the set of
packages that it exports or opens, or the services that it uses or
provides. This method facilitates the instrumentation of code in named
modules where that instrumentation requires changes to the set of modules
that are read, the packages that are exported or open, or the services
that are used or provided.

This method cannot reduce the set of modules that a module reads, nor
reduce the set of packages that it exports or opens, nor reduce the set
of services that it uses or provides. This method is a no-op when invoked
to redefine an unnamed module.

When expanding the services that a module uses or provides then the
onus is on the agent to ensure that the service type will be accessible at
each instrumentation site where the service type is used. This method
does not check if the service type is a member of the module or in a
package exported to the module by another module that it reads.

The

extraExports

parameter is the map of additional packages
to export. The

extraOpens

parameter is the map of additional
packages to open. In both cases, the map key is the fully-qualified name
of the package as defined in section 6.5.3 of

The Java™ Language Specification

, for example,

"java.lang"

. The map value is the non-empty set of modules that the
package should be exported or opened to.

The

extraProvides

parameter is the additional service providers
for the module to provide. The map key is the service type. The map value
is the non-empty list of implementation types, each of which is a member
of the module and an implementation of the service.

This method is safe for concurrent use and so allows multiple agents
to instrument and update the same module at around the same time.

**Parameters:**
- module

- the module to redefine
- extraReads

- the possibly-empty set of additional modules to read
- extraExports

- the possibly-empty map of additional packages to export
- extraOpens

- the possibly-empty map of additional packages to open
- extraUses

- the possibly-empty set of additional services to use
- extraProvides

- the possibly-empty map of additional services to provide

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If

extraExports

or

extraOpens

contains a key
that is not a package in the module; if

extraExports

or

extraOpens

maps a key to an empty set; if a value in the

extraProvides

map contains a service provider type that
is not a member of the module or an implementation of the service;
or

extraProvides

maps a key to an empty list
- UnmodifiableModuleException

- if the module cannot be modified
- NullPointerException

- if any of the arguments are

null

or
any of the Sets or Maps contains a

null

key or value

**See Also:**
- isModifiableModule(Module)

**Since:**

#### boolean isModifiableModule​(
Module
module)

Tests whether a module can be modified with

redefineModule

. If a module is modifiable then this method returns

true

. If a module is not modifiable then this method returns

false

. This method always returns

true

when the module
is an unnamed module (as redefining an unnamed module is a no-op).

**Parameters:**
- module

- the module to test if it can be modified

**Returns:**
- true

if the module is modifiable, otherwise

false

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the module is

null

This class provides services needed to instrument Java
programming language code.
Instrumentation is the addition of byte-codes to methods for the
purpose of gathering data to be utilized by tools.
Since the changes are purely additive, these tools do not modify
application state or behavior.
Examples of such benign tools include monitoring agents, profilers,
coverage analyzers, and event loggers.

There are two ways to obtain an instance of the

Instrumentation

interface:

- When a JVM is launched in a way that indicates an agent
class. In that case an

Instrumentation

instance
is passed to the

premain

method of the agent class.
- When a JVM provides a mechanism to start agents sometime
after the JVM is launched. In that case an

Instrumentation

instance is passed to the

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- addTransformer

```java
void addTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer,
boolean canRetransform)
```

Registers the supplied transformer. All future class definitions
will be seen by the transformer, except definitions of classes upon which any
registered transformer is dependent.
The transformer is called when classes are loaded, when they are

redefined

. and if

canRetransform

is true,
when they are

retransformed

.

ClassFileTransformer

defines the order of transform calls.

If a transformer throws
an exception during execution, the JVM will still call the other registered
transformers in order. The same transformer may be added more than once,
but it is strongly discouraged -- avoid this by creating a new instance of
transformer class.

This method is intended for use in instrumentation, as described in the

class specification

.

**Parameters:** transformer

- the transformer to register
**Parameters:** canRetransform

- can this transformer's transformations be retransformed
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if

canRetransform

is true and the current configuration of the JVM does not allow
retransformation (

isRetransformClassesSupported()

is false)
**Since:** 1.6

- addTransformer

```java
void addTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer)
```

Registers the supplied transformer.

Same as

addTransformer(transformer, false)

.

**Parameters:** transformer

- the transformer to register
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer
**See Also:** addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer,boolean)

- removeTransformer

```java
boolean removeTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer)
```

Unregisters the supplied transformer. Future class definitions will
not be shown to the transformer. Removes the most-recently-added matching
instance of the transformer. Due to the multi-threaded nature of
class loading, it is possible for a transformer to receive calls
after it has been removed. Transformers should be written defensively
to expect this situation.

**Parameters:** transformer

- the transformer to unregister
**Returns:** true if the transformer was found and removed, false if the
transformer was not found
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer

- isRetransformClassesSupported

```java
boolean isRetransformClassesSupported()
```

Returns whether or not the current JVM configuration supports retransformation
of classes.
The ability to retransform an already loaded class is an optional capability
of a JVM.
Retransformation will only be supported if the

Can-Retransform-Classes

manifest attribute is set to

true

in the agent JAR file (as described in the

package specification

) and the JVM supports
this capability.
During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple calls to this
method will always return the same answer.

**Returns:** true if the current JVM configuration supports retransformation of
classes, false if not.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** retransformClasses(java.lang.Class<?>...)

- retransformClasses

```java
void retransformClasses​(
Class
<?>... classes)
throws
UnmodifiableClassException
```

Retransform the supplied set of classes.

This function facilitates the instrumentation
of already loaded classes.
When classes are initially loaded or when they are

redefined

,
the initial class file bytes can be transformed with the

ClassFileTransformer

.
This function reruns the transformation process
(whether or not a transformation has previously occurred).
This retransformation follows these steps:

- starting from the initial class file bytes
- for each transformer that was added with

canRetransform

false, the bytes returned by

transform

during the last class load or redefine are
reused as the output of the transformation; note that this is
equivalent to reapplying the previous transformation, unaltered;
except that

transform

method is not called.
- for each transformer that was added with

canRetransform

true, the

transform

method is called in these transformers
- the transformed class file bytes are installed as the new
definition of the class

The order of transformation is described in

ClassFileTransformer

.
This same order is used in the automatic reapplication of
retransformation incapable transforms.

The initial class file bytes represent the bytes passed to

ClassLoader.defineClass

or

redefineClasses

(before any transformations
were applied), however they might not exactly match them.
The constant pool might not have the same layout or contents.
The constant pool may have more or fewer entries.
Constant pool entries may be in a different order; however,
constant pool indices in the bytecodes of methods will correspond.
Some attributes may not be present.
Where order is not meaningful, for example the order of methods,
order might not be preserved.

This method operates on
a set in order to allow interdependent changes to more than one class at the same time
(a retransformation of class A can require a retransformation of class B).

If a retransformed method has active stack frames, those active frames continue to
run the bytecodes of the original method.
The retransformed method will be used on new invokes.

This method does not cause any initialization except that which would occur
under the customary JVM semantics. In other words, redefining a class
does not cause its initializers to be run. The values of static variables
will remain as they were prior to the call.

Instances of the retransformed class are not affected.

The retransformation may change method bodies, the constant pool and
attributes (unless explicitly prohibited).
The retransformation must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the
signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
The retransformation must not change the

NestHost

or

NestMembers

attributes.
These restrictions may be lifted in future versions.
The class file bytes are not checked, verified and installed
until after the transformations have been applied, if the resultant bytes are in
error this method will throw an exception.

If this method throws an exception, no classes have been retransformed.

This method is intended for use in instrumentation, as described in the

class specification

.

**Parameters:** classes

- array of classes to retransform;
a zero-length array is allowed, in this case, this method does nothing
**Throws:** UnmodifiableClassException

- if a specified class cannot be modified
(

isModifiableClass(java.lang.Class<?>)

would return

false

)
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the current configuration of the JVM does not allow
retransformation (

isRetransformClassesSupported()

is false) or the retransformation attempted
to make unsupported changes
**Throws:** ClassFormatError

- if the data did not contain a valid class
**Throws:** NoClassDefFoundError

- if the name in the class file is not equal to the name of the class
**Throws:** UnsupportedClassVersionError

- if the class file version numbers are not supported
**Throws:** ClassCircularityError

- if the new classes contain a circularity
**Throws:** LinkageError

- if a linkage error occurs
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the supplied classes array or any of its components
is

null

.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** isRetransformClassesSupported()

,

addTransformer(java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer, boolean)

,

ClassFileTransformer

- isRedefineClassesSupported

```java
boolean isRedefineClassesSupported()
```

Returns whether or not the current JVM configuration supports redefinition
of classes.
The ability to redefine an already loaded class is an optional capability
of a JVM.
Redefinition will only be supported if the

Can-Redefine-Classes

manifest attribute is set to

true

in the agent JAR file (as described in the

package specification

) and the JVM supports
this capability.
During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple calls to this
method will always return the same answer.

**Returns:** true if the current JVM configuration supports redefinition of classes,
false if not.
**See Also:** redefineClasses(java.lang.instrument.ClassDefinition...)

- redefineClasses

```java
void redefineClasses​(
ClassDefinition
... definitions)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
,

UnmodifiableClassException
```

Redefine the supplied set of classes using the supplied class files.

This method is used to replace the definition of a class without reference
to the existing class file bytes, as one might do when recompiling from source
for fix-and-continue debugging.
Where the existing class file bytes are to be transformed (for
example in bytecode instrumentation)

retransformClasses

should be used.

This method operates on
a set in order to allow interdependent changes to more than one class at the same time
(a redefinition of class A can require a redefinition of class B).

If a redefined method has active stack frames, those active frames continue to
run the bytecodes of the original method.
The redefined method will be used on new invokes.

This method does not cause any initialization except that which would occur
under the customary JVM semantics. In other words, redefining a class
does not cause its initializers to be run. The values of static variables
will remain as they were prior to the call.

Instances of the redefined class are not affected.

The redefinition may change method bodies, the constant pool and attributes
(unless explicitly prohibited).
The redefinition must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the
signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
The redefinition must not change the

NestHost

or

NestMembers

attributes.
These restrictions may be lifted in future versions.
The class file bytes are not checked, verified and installed
until after the transformations have been applied, if the resultant bytes are in
error this method will throw an exception.

If this method throws an exception, no classes have been redefined.

This method is intended for use in instrumentation, as described in the

class specification

.

**Parameters:** definitions

- array of classes to redefine with corresponding definitions;
a zero-length array is allowed, in this case, this method does nothing
**Throws:** UnmodifiableClassException

- if a specified class cannot be modified
(

isModifiableClass(java.lang.Class<?>)

would return

false

)
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the current configuration of the JVM does not allow
redefinition (

isRedefineClassesSupported()

is false) or the redefinition attempted
to make unsupported changes
**Throws:** ClassFormatError

- if the data did not contain a valid class
**Throws:** NoClassDefFoundError

- if the name in the class file is not equal to the name of the class
**Throws:** UnsupportedClassVersionError

- if the class file version numbers are not supported
**Throws:** ClassCircularityError

- if the new classes contain a circularity
**Throws:** LinkageError

- if a linkage error occurs
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the supplied definitions array or any of its components
is

null
**Throws:** ClassNotFoundException

- Can never be thrown (present for compatibility reasons only)

,

addTransformer(java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer, boolean)

,

ClassFileTransformer

- isModifiableClass

```java
boolean isModifiableClass​(
Class
<?> theClass)
```

Tests whether a class is modifiable by

retransformation

or

redefinition

.
If a class is modifiable then this method returns

true

.
If a class is not modifiable then this method returns

false

.

For a class to be retransformed,

isRetransformClassesSupported()

must also be true.
But the value of

isRetransformClassesSupported()

does not influence the value
returned by this function.
For a class to be redefined,

isRedefineClassesSupported()

must also be true.
But the value of

isRedefineClassesSupported()

does not influence the value
returned by this function.

Primitive classes (for example,

java.lang.Integer.TYPE

)
and array classes are never modifiable.

**Parameters:** theClass

- the class to check for being modifiable
**Returns:** whether or not the argument class is modifiable
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified class is

null

.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** retransformClasses(java.lang.Class<?>...)

,

isRetransformClassesSupported()

,

redefineClasses(java.lang.instrument.ClassDefinition...)

,

isRedefineClassesSupported()

- getAllLoadedClasses

```java
Class
[] getAllLoadedClasses()
```

Returns an array of all classes currently loaded by the JVM.

**Returns:** an array containing all the classes loaded by the JVM, zero-length if there are none

- getInitiatedClasses

```java
Class
[] getInitiatedClasses​(
ClassLoader
loader)
```

Returns an array of all classes for which

loader

is an initiating loader.
If the supplied loader is

null

, classes initiated by the bootstrap class
loader are returned.

**Parameters:** loader

- the loader whose initiated class list will be returned
**Returns:** an array containing all the classes for which loader is an initiating loader,
zero-length if there are none

- getObjectSize

```java
long getObjectSize​(
Object
objectToSize)
```

Returns an implementation-specific approximation of the amount of storage consumed by
the specified object. The result may include some or all of the object's overhead,
and thus is useful for comparison within an implementation but not between implementations.

The estimate may change during a single invocation of the JVM.

**Parameters:** objectToSize

- the object to size
**Returns:** an implementation-specific approximation of the amount of storage consumed by the specified object
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the supplied Object is

null

.

- appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch

```java
void appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch​(
JarFile
jarfile)
```

Specifies a JAR file with instrumentation classes to be defined by the
bootstrap class loader.

When the virtual machine's built-in class loader, known as the "bootstrap
class loader", unsuccessfully searches for a class, the entries in the

JAR file

will be searched as well.

This method may be used multiple times to add multiple JAR files to be
searched in the order that this method was invoked.

The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any
classes or resources other than those to be defined by the bootstrap
class loader for the purpose of instrumentation.
Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected
behavior that is difficult to diagnose. For example, suppose there is a
loader L, and L's parent for delegation is the bootstrap class loader.
Furthermore, a method in class C, a class defined by L, makes reference to
a non-public accessor class C$1. If the JAR file contains a class C$1 then
the delegation to the bootstrap class loader will cause C$1 to be defined
by the bootstrap class loader. In this example an

IllegalAccessError

will be thrown that may cause the application to fail. One approach to
avoiding these types of issues, is to use a unique package name for the
instrumentation classes.

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

specifies that a subsequent attempt to resolve a symbolic
reference that the Java virtual machine has previously unsuccessfully attempted
to resolve always fails with the same error that was thrown as a result of the
initial resolution attempt. Consequently, if the JAR file contains an entry
that corresponds to a class for which the Java virtual machine has
unsuccessfully attempted to resolve a reference, then subsequent attempts to
resolve that reference will fail with the same error as the initial attempt.

**Parameters:** jarfile

- The JAR file to be searched when the bootstrap class loader
unsuccessfully searches for a class.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

jarfile

is

null

.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** appendToSystemClassLoaderSearch(java.util.jar.JarFile)

,

ClassLoader

,

JarFile

- appendToSystemClassLoaderSearch

```java
void appendToSystemClassLoaderSearch​(
JarFile
jarfile)
```

Specifies a JAR file with instrumentation classes to be defined by the
system class loader.

When the system class loader for delegation (see

getSystemClassLoader()

)
unsuccessfully searches for a class, the entries in the

JarFile

will be searched as well.

This method may be used multiple times to add multiple JAR files to be
searched in the order that this method was invoked.

The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any
classes or resources other than those to be defined by the system class
loader for the purpose of instrumentation.
Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected
behavior that is difficult to diagnose (see

appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch

).

The system class loader supports adding a JAR file to be searched if
it implements a method named

appendToClassPathForInstrumentation

which takes a single parameter of type

java.lang.String

. The
method is not required to have

public

access. The name of
the JAR file is obtained by invoking the

getName()

method on the

jarfile

and this is provided as the
parameter to the

appendToClassPathForInstrumentation

method.

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

specifies that a subsequent attempt to resolve a symbolic
reference that the Java virtual machine has previously unsuccessfully attempted
to resolve always fails with the same error that was thrown as a result of the
initial resolution attempt. Consequently, if the JAR file contains an entry
that corresponds to a class for which the Java virtual machine has
unsuccessfully attempted to resolve a reference, then subsequent attempts to
resolve that reference will fail with the same error as the initial attempt.

This method does not change the value of

java.class.path

system property

.

**Parameters:** jarfile

- The JAR file to be searched when the system class loader
unsuccessfully searches for a class.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the system class loader does not support appending a
a JAR file to be searched.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

jarfile

is

null

.

- isNativeMethodPrefixSupported

```java
boolean isNativeMethodPrefixSupported()
```

Returns whether the current JVM configuration supports

setting a native method prefix

.
The ability to set a native method prefix is an optional
capability of a JVM.
Setting a native method prefix will only be supported if the

Can-Set-Native-Method-Prefix

manifest attribute is set to

true

in the agent JAR file (as described in the

package specification

) and the JVM supports
this capability.
During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple
calls to this method will always return the same answer.

**Returns:** true if the current JVM configuration supports
setting a native method prefix, false if not.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setNativeMethodPrefix(java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer, java.lang.String)

- setNativeMethodPrefix

```java
void setNativeMethodPrefix​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer,

String
prefix)
```

This method modifies the failure handling of
native method resolution by allowing retry
with a prefix applied to the name.
When used with the

ClassFileTransformer

,
it enables native methods to be
instrumented.

Since native methods cannot be directly instrumented
(they have no bytecodes), they must be wrapped with
a non-native method which can be instrumented.
For example, if we had:

```java
native boolean foo(int x);
```

We could transform the class file (with the
ClassFileTransformer during the initial definition
of the class) so that this becomes:

```java
boolean foo(int x) {

... record entry to foo ...

return wrapped_foo(x);
}

native boolean wrapped_foo(int x);
```

Where

foo

becomes a wrapper for the actual native
method with the appended prefix "wrapped_". Note that
"wrapped_" would be a poor choice of prefix since it
might conceivably form the name of an existing method
thus something like "$$$MyAgentWrapped$$$_" would be
better but would make these examples less readable.

The wrapper will allow data to be collected on the native
method call, but now the problem becomes linking up the
wrapped method with the native implementation.
That is, the method

wrapped_foo

needs to be
resolved to the native implementation of

foo

,
which might be:

```java
Java_somePackage_someClass_foo(JNIEnv* env, jint x)
```

This function allows the prefix to be specified and the
proper resolution to occur.
Specifically, when the standard resolution fails, the
resolution is retried taking the prefix into consideration.
There are two ways that resolution occurs, explicit
resolution with the JNI function

RegisterNatives

and the normal automatic resolution. For

RegisterNatives

, the JVM will attempt this
association:

```java
method(foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
the specified prefix prepended to the method name,
yielding the correct resolution:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

For automatic resolution, the JVM will attempt:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(wrapped_foo)
```

When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
the specified prefix deleted from the implementation name,
yielding the correct resolution:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

Note that since the prefix is only used when standard
resolution fails, native methods can be wrapped selectively.

Since each

ClassFileTransformer

can do its own transformation of the bytecodes, more
than one layer of wrappers may be applied. Thus each
transformer needs its own prefix. Since transformations
are applied in order, the prefixes, if applied, will
be applied in the same order
(see

addTransformer

).
Thus if three transformers applied
wrappers,

foo

might become

$trans3_$trans2_$trans1_foo

. But if, say,
the second transformer did not apply a wrapper to

foo

it would be just

$trans3_$trans1_foo

. To be able to
efficiently determine the sequence of prefixes,
an intermediate prefix is only applied if its non-native
wrapper exists. Thus, in the last example, even though

$trans1_foo

is not a native method, the

$trans1_

prefix is applied since

$trans1_foo

exists.

**Parameters:** transformer

- The ClassFileTransformer which wraps using this prefix.
**Parameters:** prefix

- The prefix to apply to wrapped native methods when
retrying a failed native method resolution. If prefix
is either

null

or the empty string, then
failed native method resolutions are not retried for
this transformer.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the current configuration of
the JVM does not allow setting a native method prefix
(

isNativeMethodPrefixSupported()

is false).
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the transformer is not registered
(see

addTransformer

).
**Since:** 1.6

- redefineModule

```java
void redefineModule​(
Module
module,

Set
<
Module
> extraReads,

Map
<
String
,​
Set
<
Module
>> extraExports,

Map
<

<
Module
>> extraOpens,

Set
<
Class
<?>> extraUses,

Map
<
Class
<?>,​
List
<
Class
<?>>> extraProvides)
```

Redefine a module to expand the set of modules that it reads, the set of
packages that it exports or opens, or the services that it uses or
provides. This method facilitates the instrumentation of code in named
modules where that instrumentation requires changes to the set of modules
that are read, the packages that are exported or open, or the services
that are used or provided.

This method cannot reduce the set of modules that a module reads, nor
reduce the set of packages that it exports or opens, nor reduce the set
of services that it uses or provides. This method is a no-op when invoked
to redefine an unnamed module.

When expanding the services that a module uses or provides then the
onus is on the agent to ensure that the service type will be accessible at
each instrumentation site where the service type is used. This method
does not check if the service type is a member of the module or in a
package exported to the module by another module that it reads.

The

extraExports

parameter is the map of additional packages
to export. The

extraOpens

parameter is the map of additional
packages to open. In both cases, the map key is the fully-qualified name
of the package as defined in section 6.5.3 of

The Java™ Language Specification

, for example,

"java.lang"

. The map value is the non-empty set of modules that the
package should be exported or opened to.

The

extraProvides

parameter is the additional service providers
for the module to provide. The map key is the service type. The map value
is the non-empty list of implementation types, each of which is a member
of the module and an implementation of the service.

This method is safe for concurrent use and so allows multiple agents
to instrument and update the same module at around the same time.

**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If

extraExports

or

extraOpens

contains a key
that is not a package in the module; if

extraExports

or

extraOpens

maps a key to an empty set; if a value in the

Method Detail

- addTransformer

```java
void addTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer,
boolean canRetransform)
```

Registers the supplied transformer. All future class definitions
will be seen by the transformer, except definitions of classes upon which any
registered transformer is dependent.
The transformer is called when classes are loaded, when they are

redefined

. and if

canRetransform

is true,
when they are

retransformed

.

ClassFileTransformer

defines the order of transform calls.

If a transformer throws
an exception during execution, the JVM will still call the other registered
transformers in order. The same transformer may be added more than once,
but it is strongly discouraged -- avoid this by creating a new instance of
transformer class.

This method is intended for use in instrumentation, as described in the

class specification

.

**Parameters:** transformer

- the transformer to register
**Parameters:** canRetransform

- can this transformer's transformations be retransformed
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if

canRetransform

is true and the current configuration of the JVM does not allow
retransformation (

isRetransformClassesSupported()

is false)
**Since:** 1.6

- addTransformer

```java
void addTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer)
```

Registers the supplied transformer.

Same as

addTransformer(transformer, false)

.

**Parameters:** transformer

- the transformer to register
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer
**See Also:** addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer,boolean)

- removeTransformer

```java
boolean removeTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer)
```

Unregisters the supplied transformer. Future class definitions will
not be shown to the transformer. Removes the most-recently-added matching
instance of the transformer. Due to the multi-threaded nature of
class loading, it is possible for a transformer to receive calls
after it has been removed. Transformers should be written defensively
to expect this situation.

**Parameters:** transformer

- the transformer to unregister
**Returns:** true if the transformer was found and removed, false if the
transformer was not found
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer

- isRetransformClassesSupported

```java
boolean isRetransformClassesSupported()
```

Returns whether or not the current JVM configuration supports retransformation
of classes.
The ability to retransform an already loaded class is an optional capability
of a JVM.
Retransformation will only be supported if the

Can-Retransform-Classes

manifest attribute is set to

true

in the agent JAR file (as described in the

package specification

) and the JVM supports
this capability.
During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple calls to this
method will always return the same answer.

**Returns:** true if the current JVM configuration supports retransformation of
classes, false if not.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** retransformClasses(java.lang.Class<?>...)

- retransformClasses

```java
void retransformClasses​(
Class
<?>... classes)
throws
UnmodifiableClassException
```

Retransform the supplied set of classes.

This function facilitates the instrumentation
of already loaded classes.
When classes are initially loaded or when they are

redefined

,
the initial class file bytes can be transformed with the

ClassFileTransformer

.
This function reruns the transformation process
(whether or not a transformation has previously occurred).
This retransformation follows these steps:

- starting from the initial class file bytes
- for each transformer that was added with

canRetransform

false, the bytes returned by

transform

during the last class load or redefine are
reused as the output of the transformation; note that this is
equivalent to reapplying the previous transformation, unaltered;
except that

transform

method is not called.
- for each transformer that was added with

canRetransform

true, the

transform

method is called in these transformers
- the transformed class file bytes are installed as the new
definition of the class

The order of transformation is described in

ClassFileTransformer

.
This same order is used in the automatic reapplication of
retransformation incapable transforms.

The initial class file bytes represent the bytes passed to

ClassLoader.defineClass

or

redefineClasses

(before any transformations
were applied), however they might not exactly match them.
The constant pool might not have the same layout or contents.
The constant pool may have more or fewer entries.
Constant pool entries may be in a different order; however,
constant pool indices in the bytecodes of methods will correspond.
Some attributes may not be present.
Where order is not meaningful, for example the order of methods,
order might not be preserved.

This method operates on
a set in order to allow interdependent changes to more than one class at the same time
(a retransformation of class A can require a retransformation of class B).

If a retransformed method has active stack frames, those active frames continue to
run the bytecodes of the original method.
The retransformed method will be used on new invokes.

This method does not cause any initialization except that which would occur
under the customary JVM semantics. In other words, redefining a class
does not cause its initializers to be run. The values of static variables
will remain as they were prior to the call.

Instances of the retransformed class are not affected.

The retransformation may change method bodies, the constant pool and
attributes (unless explicitly prohibited).
The retransformation must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the
signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
The retransformation must not change the

NestHost

or

NestMembers

attributes.
These restrictions may be lifted in future versions.
The class file bytes are not checked, verified and installed
until after the transformations have been applied, if the resultant bytes are in
error this method will throw an exception.

If this method throws an exception, no classes have been retransformed.

This method is intended for use in instrumentation, as described in the

class specification

.

**Parameters:** classes

- array of classes to retransform;
a zero-length array is allowed, in this case, this method does nothing
**Throws:** UnmodifiableClassException

- if a specified class cannot be modified
(

isModifiableClass(java.lang.Class<?>)

would return

false

)
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the current configuration of the JVM does not allow
retransformation (

isRetransformClassesSupported()

is false) or the retransformation attempted
to make unsupported changes
**Throws:** ClassFormatError

- if the data did not contain a valid class
**Throws:** NoClassDefFoundError

- if the name in the class file is not equal to the name of the class
**Throws:** UnsupportedClassVersionError

- if the class file version numbers are not supported
**Throws:** ClassCircularityError

- if the new classes contain a circularity
**Throws:** LinkageError

addTransformer(java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer, boolean)

,

ClassFileTransformer

- isRedefineClassesSupported

```java
boolean isRedefineClassesSupported()
```

Returns whether or not the current JVM configuration supports redefinition
of classes.
The ability to redefine an already loaded class is an optional capability
of a JVM.
Redefinition will only be supported if the

Can-Redefine-Classes

manifest attribute is set to

true

in the agent JAR file (as described in the

package specification

) and the JVM supports
this capability.
During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple calls to this
method will always return the same answer.

**Returns:** true if the current JVM configuration supports redefinition of classes,
false if not.
**See Also:** redefineClasses(java.lang.instrument.ClassDefinition...)

- redefineClasses

```java
void redefineClasses​(
ClassDefinition
... definitions)
throws
ClassNotFoundException
,

UnmodifiableClassException
```

Redefine the supplied set of classes using the supplied class files.

This method is used to replace the definition of a class without reference
to the existing class file bytes, as one might do when recompiling from source
for fix-and-continue debugging.
Where the existing class file bytes are to be transformed (for
example in bytecode instrumentation)

retransformClasses

should be used.

This method operates on
a set in order to allow interdependent changes to more than one class at the same time
(a redefinition of class A can require a redefinition of class B).

If a redefined method has active stack frames, those active frames continue to
run the bytecodes of the original method.
The redefined method will be used on new invokes.

This method does not cause any initialization except that which would occur
under the customary JVM semantics. In other words, redefining a class
does not cause its initializers to be run. The values of static variables
will remain as they were prior to the call.

Instances of the redefined class are not affected.

The redefinition may change method bodies, the constant pool and attributes
(unless explicitly prohibited).
The redefinition must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the
signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
The redefinition must not change the

NestHost

or

NestMembers

attributes.
These restrictions may be lifted in future versions.
The class file bytes are not checked, verified and installed
until after the transformations have been applied, if the resultant bytes are in
error this method will throw an exception.

If this method throws an exception, no classes have been redefined.

This method is intended for use in instrumentation, as described in the

class specification

.

**Parameters:** definitions

- array of classes to redefine with corresponding definitions;
a zero-length array is allowed, in this case, this method does nothing
**Throws:** UnmodifiableClassException

ClassFileTransformer

- isModifiableClass

```java
boolean isModifiableClass​(
Class
<?> theClass)
```

Tests whether a class is modifiable by

retransformation

or

redefinition

.
If a class is modifiable then this method returns

true

.
If a class is not modifiable then this method returns

false

.

For a class to be retransformed,

isRetransformClassesSupported()

must also be true.
But the value of

isRetransformClassesSupported()

does not influence the value
returned by this function.
For a class to be redefined,

isRedefineClassesSupported()

must also be true.
But the value of

isRedefineClassesSupported()

does not influence the value
returned by this function.

Primitive classes (for example,

java.lang.Integer.TYPE

)
and array classes are never modifiable.

**Parameters:** theClass

- the class to check for being modifiable
**Returns:** whether or not the argument class is modifiable
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified class is

null

.
**Since:** 1.6

- getAllLoadedClasses

```java
Class
[] getAllLoadedClasses()
```

Returns an array of all classes currently loaded by the JVM.

**Returns:** an array containing all the classes loaded by the JVM, zero-length if there are none

- getInitiatedClasses

```java
Class
[] getInitiatedClasses​(
ClassLoader
loader)
```

Returns an array of all classes for which

loader

is an initiating loader.
If the supplied loader is

null

, classes initiated by the bootstrap class
loader are returned.

**Parameters:** loader

- the loader whose initiated class list will be returned
**Returns:** an array containing all the classes for which loader is an initiating loader,
zero-length if there are none

- getObjectSize

```java
long getObjectSize​(
Object
objectToSize)
```

Returns an implementation-specific approximation of the amount of storage consumed by
the specified object. The result may include some or all of the object's overhead,
and thus is useful for comparison within an implementation but not between implementations.

The estimate may change during a single invocation of the JVM.

**Parameters:** objectToSize

- the object to size
**Returns:** an implementation-specific approximation of the amount of storage consumed by the specified object
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the supplied Object is

null

.

- appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch

```java
void appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch​(
JarFile
jarfile)
```

Specifies a JAR file with instrumentation classes to be defined by the
bootstrap class loader.

When the virtual machine's built-in class loader, known as the "bootstrap
class loader", unsuccessfully searches for a class, the entries in the

JAR file

will be searched as well.

This method may be used multiple times to add multiple JAR files to be
searched in the order that this method was invoked.

The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any
classes or resources other than those to be defined by the bootstrap
class loader for the purpose of instrumentation.
Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected
behavior that is difficult to diagnose. For example, suppose there is a
loader L, and L's parent for delegation is the bootstrap class loader.
Furthermore, a method in class C, a class defined by L, makes reference to
a non-public accessor class C$1. If the JAR file contains a class C$1 then
the delegation to the bootstrap class loader will cause C$1 to be defined
by the bootstrap class loader. In this example an

IllegalAccessError

will be thrown that may cause the application to fail. One approach to
avoiding these types of issues, is to use a unique package name for the
instrumentation classes.

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

specifies that a subsequent attempt to resolve a symbolic
reference that the Java virtual machine has previously unsuccessfully attempted
to resolve always fails with the same error that was thrown as a result of the
initial resolution attempt. Consequently, if the JAR file contains an entry
that corresponds to a class for which the Java virtual machine has
unsuccessfully attempted to resolve a reference, then subsequent attempts to
resolve that reference will fail with the same error as the initial attempt.

**Parameters:** jarfile

- The JAR file to be searched when the bootstrap class loader
unsuccessfully searches for a class.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

jarfile

is

null

JarFile

- appendToSystemClassLoaderSearch

```java
void appendToSystemClassLoaderSearch​(
JarFile
jarfile)
```

Specifies a JAR file with instrumentation classes to be defined by the
system class loader.

When the system class loader for delegation (see

getSystemClassLoader()

)
unsuccessfully searches for a class, the entries in the

JarFile

will be searched as well.

This method may be used multiple times to add multiple JAR files to be
searched in the order that this method was invoked.

The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any
classes or resources other than those to be defined by the system class
loader for the purpose of instrumentation.
Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected
behavior that is difficult to diagnose (see

appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch

).

The system class loader supports adding a JAR file to be searched if
it implements a method named

appendToClassPathForInstrumentation

which takes a single parameter of type

java.lang.String

. The
method is not required to have

public

access. The name of
the JAR file is obtained by invoking the

getName()

method on the

jarfile

and this is provided as the
parameter to the

appendToClassPathForInstrumentation

method.

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

specifies that a subsequent attempt to resolve a symbolic
reference that the Java virtual machine has previously unsuccessfully attempted
to resolve always fails with the same error that was thrown as a result of the
initial resolution attempt. Consequently, if the JAR file contains an entry
that corresponds to a class for which the Java virtual machine has
unsuccessfully attempted to resolve a reference, then subsequent attempts to
resolve that reference will fail with the same error as the initial attempt.

This method does not change the value of

java.class.path

system property

.

**Parameters:** jarfile

- The JAR file to be searched when the system class loader
unsuccessfully searches for a class.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the system class loader does not support appending a
a JAR file to be searched.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

jarfile

is

null

- isNativeMethodPrefixSupported

```java
boolean isNativeMethodPrefixSupported()
```

Returns whether the current JVM configuration supports

setting a native method prefix

.
The ability to set a native method prefix is an optional
capability of a JVM.
Setting a native method prefix will only be supported if the

Can-Set-Native-Method-Prefix

manifest attribute is set to

true

in the agent JAR file (as described in the

package specification

) and the JVM supports
this capability.
During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple
calls to this method will always return the same answer.

**Returns:** true if the current JVM configuration supports
setting a native method prefix, false if not.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setNativeMethodPrefix(java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer, java.lang.String)

- setNativeMethodPrefix

```java
void setNativeMethodPrefix​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer,

String
prefix)
```

This method modifies the failure handling of
native method resolution by allowing retry
with a prefix applied to the name.
When used with the

ClassFileTransformer

,
it enables native methods to be
instrumented.

Since native methods cannot be directly instrumented
(they have no bytecodes), they must be wrapped with
a non-native method which can be instrumented.
For example, if we had:

```java
native boolean foo(int x);
```

We could transform the class file (with the
ClassFileTransformer during the initial definition
of the class) so that this becomes:

```java
boolean foo(int x) {

... record entry to foo ...

return wrapped_foo(x);
}

native boolean wrapped_foo(int x);
```

Where

foo

becomes a wrapper for the actual native
method with the appended prefix "wrapped_". Note that
"wrapped_" would be a poor choice of prefix since it
might conceivably form the name of an existing method
thus something like "$$$MyAgentWrapped$$$_" would be
better but would make these examples less readable.

The wrapper will allow data to be collected on the native
method call, but now the problem becomes linking up the
wrapped method with the native implementation.
That is, the method

wrapped_foo

needs to be
resolved to the native implementation of

foo

,
which might be:

```java
Java_somePackage_someClass_foo(JNIEnv* env, jint x)
```

This function allows the prefix to be specified and the
proper resolution to occur.
Specifically, when the standard resolution fails, the
resolution is retried taking the prefix into consideration.
There are two ways that resolution occurs, explicit
resolution with the JNI function

RegisterNatives

and the normal automatic resolution. For

RegisterNatives

, the JVM will attempt this
association:

```java
method(foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
the specified prefix prepended to the method name,
yielding the correct resolution:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

For automatic resolution, the JVM will attempt:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(wrapped_foo)
```

When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
the specified prefix deleted from the implementation name,
yielding the correct resolution:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

Note that since the prefix is only used when standard
resolution fails, native methods can be wrapped selectively.

Since each

ClassFileTransformer

can do its own transformation of the bytecodes, more
than one layer of wrappers may be applied. Thus each
transformer needs its own prefix. Since transformations
are applied in order, the prefixes, if applied, will
be applied in the same order
(see

addTransformer

).
Thus if three transformers applied
wrappers,

foo

might become

$trans3_$trans2_$trans1_foo

. But if, say,
the second transformer did not apply a wrapper to

foo

it would be just

$trans3_$trans1_foo

. To be able to
efficiently determine the sequence of prefixes,
an intermediate prefix is only applied if its non-native
wrapper exists. Thus, in the last example, even though

$trans1_foo

is not a native method, the

$trans1_

prefix is applied since

$trans1_foo

exists.

**Parameters:** transformer

- The ClassFileTransformer which wraps using this prefix.
**Parameters:** prefix

- The prefix to apply to wrapped native methods when
retrying a failed native method resolution. If prefix
is either

null

or the empty string, then
failed native method resolutions are not retried for
this transformer.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the current configuration of
the JVM does not allow setting a native method prefix
(

isNativeMethodPrefixSupported()

is false).
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the transformer is not registered
(see

addTransformer

).

<?>,​
List
<
Class
<?>>> extraProvides)
```

Redefine a module to expand the set of modules that it reads, the set of
packages that it exports or opens, or the services that it uses or
provides. This method facilitates the instrumentation of code in named
modules where that instrumentation requires changes to the set of modules
that are read, the packages that are exported or open, or the services
that are used or provided.

This method cannot reduce the set of modules that a module reads, nor
reduce the set of packages that it exports or opens, nor reduce the set
of services that it uses or provides. This method is a no-op when invoked
to redefine an unnamed module.

When expanding the services that a module uses or provides then the
onus is on the agent to ensure that the service type will be accessible at
each instrumentation site where the service type is used. This method
does not check if the service type is a member of the module or in a
package exported to the module by another module that it reads.

The

extraExports

parameter is the map of additional packages
to export. The

extraOpens

parameter is the map of additional
packages to open. In both cases, the map key is the fully-qualified name
of the package as defined in section 6.5.3 of

The Java™ Language Specification

, for example,

"java.lang"

. The map value is the non-empty set of modules that the
package should be exported or opened to.

The

extraProvides

parameter is the additional service providers
for the module to provide. The map key is the service type. The map value
is the non-empty list of implementation types, each of which is a member
of the module and an implementation of the service.

This method is safe for concurrent use and so allows multiple agents
to instrument and update the same module at around the same time.

**Parameters:** module

- the module to redefine
**Parameters:** extraReads

- the possibly-empty set of additional modules to read
**Parameters:** extraExports

- the possibly-empty map of additional packages to export
**Parameters:** extraOpens

- the possibly-empty map of additional packages to open
**Parameters:** extraUses

- the possibly-empty set of additional services to use
**Parameters:** extraProvides

- the possibly-empty map of additional services to provide
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If

extraExports

or

extraOpens

contains a key
that is not a package in the module; if

extraExports

or

extraOpens

maps a key to an empty set; if a value in the

extraProvides

map contains a service provider type that
is not a member of the module or an implementation of the service;
or

extraProvides

maps a key to an empty list
**Throws:** UnmodifiableModuleException

- if the module cannot be modified
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the arguments are

null

or
any of the Sets or Maps contains a

null

key or value

**Parameters:** module

- the module to test if it can be modified
**Returns:** true

if the module is modifiable, otherwise

void addTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer)
```

Registers the supplied transformer.

Same as

addTransformer(transformer, false)

.

**Parameters:** transformer

- the transformer to register
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer
**See Also:** addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer,boolean)

---

#### addTransformer

void addTransformer​(

transformer)

Registers the supplied transformer.

Same as

addTransformer(transformer, false)

.

Same as

addTransformer(transformer, false)

.

removeTransformer

```java
boolean removeTransformer​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer)
```

Unregisters the supplied transformer. Future class definitions will
not be shown to the transformer. Removes the most-recently-added matching
instance of the transformer. Due to the multi-threaded nature of
class loading, it is possible for a transformer to receive calls
after it has been removed. Transformers should be written defensively
to expect this situation.

**Parameters:** transformer

- the transformer to unregister
**Returns:** true if the transformer was found and removed, false if the
transformer was not found
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer

---

#### removeTransformer

boolean removeTransformer​(

ClassFileTransformer

transformer)

Unregisters the supplied transformer. Future class definitions will
not be shown to the transformer. Removes the most-recently-added matching
instance of the transformer. Due to the multi-threaded nature of
class loading, it is possible for a transformer to receive calls
after it has been removed. Transformers should be written defensively
to expect this situation.

isRetransformClassesSupported

```java
boolean isRetransformClassesSupported()
```

Returns whether or not the current JVM configuration supports retransformation
of classes.
The ability to retransform an already loaded class is an optional capability
of a JVM.
Retransformation will only be supported if the

Can-Retransform-Classes

manifest attribute is set to

true

in the agent JAR file (as described in the

package specification

) and the JVM supports
this capability.
During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple calls to this
method will always return the same answer.

**Returns:** true if the current JVM configuration supports retransformation of
classes, false if not.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** retransformClasses(java.lang.Class<?>...)

retransformClasses

```java
void retransformClasses​(
Class
<?>... classes)
throws
UnmodifiableClassException
```

Retransform the supplied set of classes.

This function facilitates the instrumentation
of already loaded classes.
When classes are initially loaded or when they are

redefined

,
the initial class file bytes can be transformed with the

ClassFileTransformer

.
This function reruns the transformation process
(whether or not a transformation has previously occurred).
This retransformation follows these steps:

- starting from the initial class file bytes
- for each transformer that was added with

canRetransform

false, the bytes returned by

transform

during the last class load or redefine are
reused as the output of the transformation; note that this is
equivalent to reapplying the previous transformation, unaltered;
except that

transform

method is not called.
- for each transformer that was added with

canRetransform

true, the

transform

method is called in these transformers
- the transformed class file bytes are installed as the new
definition of the class

The order of transformation is described in

ClassFileTransformer

.
This same order is used in the automatic reapplication of
retransformation incapable transforms.

The initial class file bytes represent the bytes passed to

ClassLoader.defineClass

or

redefineClasses

(before any transformations
were applied), however they might not exactly match them.
The constant pool might not have the same layout or contents.
The constant pool may have more or fewer entries.
Constant pool entries may be in a different order; however,
constant pool indices in the bytecodes of methods will correspond.
Some attributes may not be present.
Where order is not meaningful, for example the order of methods,
order might not be preserved.

This method operates on
a set in order to allow interdependent changes to more than one class at the same time
(a retransformation of class A can require a retransformation of class B).

If a retransformed method has active stack frames, those active frames continue to
run the bytecodes of the original method.
The retransformed method will be used on new invokes.

This method does not cause any initialization except that which would occur
under the customary JVM semantics. In other words, redefining a class
does not cause its initializers to be run. The values of static variables
will remain as they were prior to the call.

Instances of the retransformed class are not affected.

The retransformation may change method bodies, the constant pool and
attributes (unless explicitly prohibited).
The retransformation must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the
signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
The retransformation must not change the

NestHost

or

NestMembers

attributes.
These restrictions may be lifted in future versions.
The class file bytes are not checked, verified and installed
until after the transformations have been applied, if the resultant bytes are in
error this method will throw an exception.

If this method throws an exception, no classes have been retransformed.

This method is intended for use in instrumentation, as described in the

class specification

.

**Parameters:** classes

- array of classes to retransform;
a zero-length array is allowed, in this case, this method does nothing
**Throws:** UnmodifiableClassException

- if a specified class cannot be modified
(

isModifiableClass(java.lang.Class<?>)

would return

false

)
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the current configuration of the JVM does not allow
retransformation (

isRetransformClassesSupported()

is false) or the retransformation attempted
to make unsupported changes
**Throws:** ClassFormatError

- if the data did not contain a valid class
**Throws:** NoClassDefFoundError

- if the name in the class file is not equal to the name of the class
**Throws:** UnsupportedClassVersionError

- if the class file version numbers are not supported
**Throws:** ClassCircularityError

- if the new classes contain a circularity
**Throws:** LinkageError

- if a linkage error occurs
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the supplied classes array or any of its components
is

null

.

appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch

```java
void appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch​(
JarFile
jarfile)
```

Specifies a JAR file with instrumentation classes to be defined by the
bootstrap class loader.

When the virtual machine's built-in class loader, known as the "bootstrap
class loader", unsuccessfully searches for a class, the entries in the

JAR file

will be searched as well.

This method may be used multiple times to add multiple JAR files to be
searched in the order that this method was invoked.

The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any
classes or resources other than those to be defined by the bootstrap
class loader for the purpose of instrumentation.
Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected
behavior that is difficult to diagnose. For example, suppose there is a
loader L, and L's parent for delegation is the bootstrap class loader.
Furthermore, a method in class C, a class defined by L, makes reference to
a non-public accessor class C$1. If the JAR file contains a class C$1 then
the delegation to the bootstrap class loader will cause C$1 to be defined
by the bootstrap class loader. In this example an

IllegalAccessError

will be thrown that may cause the application to fail. One approach to
avoiding these types of issues, is to use a unique package name for the
instrumentation classes.

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

specifies that a subsequent attempt to resolve a symbolic
reference that the Java virtual machine has previously unsuccessfully attempted
to resolve always fails with the same error that was thrown as a result of the
initial resolution attempt. Consequently, if the JAR file contains an entry
that corresponds to a class for which the Java virtual machine has
unsuccessfully attempted to resolve a reference, then subsequent attempts to
resolve that reference will fail with the same error as the initial attempt.

**Parameters:** jarfile

setNativeMethodPrefix

```java
void setNativeMethodPrefix​(
ClassFileTransformer
transformer,

String
prefix)
```

This method modifies the failure handling of
native method resolution by allowing retry
with a prefix applied to the name.
When used with the

ClassFileTransformer

,
it enables native methods to be
instrumented.

Since native methods cannot be directly instrumented
(they have no bytecodes), they must be wrapped with
a non-native method which can be instrumented.
For example, if we had:

```java
native boolean foo(int x);
```

We could transform the class file (with the
ClassFileTransformer during the initial definition
of the class) so that this becomes:

```java
boolean foo(int x) {

... record entry to foo ...

return wrapped_foo(x);
}

native boolean wrapped_foo(int x);
```

Where

foo

becomes a wrapper for the actual native
method with the appended prefix "wrapped_". Note that
"wrapped_" would be a poor choice of prefix since it
might conceivably form the name of an existing method
thus something like "$$$MyAgentWrapped$$$_" would be
better but would make these examples less readable.

The wrapper will allow data to be collected on the native
method call, but now the problem becomes linking up the
wrapped method with the native implementation.
That is, the method

wrapped_foo

needs to be
resolved to the native implementation of

foo

,
which might be:

```java
Java_somePackage_someClass_foo(JNIEnv* env, jint x)
```

This function allows the prefix to be specified and the
proper resolution to occur.
Specifically, when the standard resolution fails, the
resolution is retried taking the prefix into consideration.
There are two ways that resolution occurs, explicit
resolution with the JNI function

RegisterNatives

and the normal automatic resolution. For

RegisterNatives

, the JVM will attempt this
association:

```java
method(foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
the specified prefix prepended to the method name,
yielding the correct resolution:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

For automatic resolution, the JVM will attempt:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(wrapped_foo)
```

When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
the specified prefix deleted from the implementation name,
yielding the correct resolution:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

Note that since the prefix is only used when standard
resolution fails, native methods can be wrapped selectively.

Since each

ClassFileTransformer

can do its own transformation of the bytecodes, more
than one layer of wrappers may be applied. Thus each
transformer needs its own prefix. Since transformations
are applied in order, the prefixes, if applied, will
be applied in the same order
(see

addTransformer

).
Thus if three transformers applied
wrappers,

foo

might become

$trans3_$trans2_$trans1_foo

. But if, say,
the second transformer did not apply a wrapper to

foo

it would be just

$trans3_$trans1_foo

. To be able to
efficiently determine the sequence of prefixes,
an intermediate prefix is only applied if its non-native
wrapper exists. Thus, in the last example, even though

$trans1_foo

is not a native method, the

$trans1_

prefix is applied since

$trans1_foo

exists.

**Parameters:** transformer

- The ClassFileTransformer which wraps using this prefix.
**Parameters:** prefix

- The prefix to apply to wrapped native methods when
retrying a failed native method resolution. If prefix
is either

null

or the empty string, then
failed native method resolutions are not retried for
this transformer.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if passed a

null

transformer.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the current configuration of
the JVM does not allow setting a native method prefix
(

isNativeMethodPrefixSupported()

is false).
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the transformer is not registered
(see

addTransformer

).

Thus if three transformers applied
wrappers,

foo

might become

$trans3_$trans2_$trans1_foo

. But if, say,
the second transformer did not apply a wrapper to

foo

it would be just

$trans3_$trans1_foo

. To be able to
efficiently determine the sequence of prefixes,
an intermediate prefix is only applied if its non-native
wrapper exists. Thus, in the last example, even though

$trans1_foo

is not a native method, the

$trans1_

prefix is applied since

$trans1_foo

exists.

Since native methods cannot be directly instrumented
(they have no bytecodes), they must be wrapped with
a non-native method which can be instrumented.
For example, if we had:

```java
native boolean foo(int x);
```

We could transform the class file (with the
ClassFileTransformer during the initial definition
of the class) so that this becomes:

```java
boolean foo(int x) {

... record entry to foo ...

return wrapped_foo(x);
}

native boolean wrapped_foo(int x);
```

Where

foo

becomes a wrapper for the actual native
method with the appended prefix "wrapped_". Note that
"wrapped_" would be a poor choice of prefix since it
might conceivably form the name of an existing method
thus something like "$$$MyAgentWrapped$$$_" would be
better but would make these examples less readable.

The wrapper will allow data to be collected on the native
method call, but now the problem becomes linking up the
wrapped method with the native implementation.
That is, the method

wrapped_foo

needs to be
resolved to the native implementation of

foo

,
which might be:

```java
Java_somePackage_someClass_foo(JNIEnv* env, jint x)
```

This function allows the prefix to be specified and the
proper resolution to occur.
Specifically, when the standard resolution fails, the
resolution is retried taking the prefix into consideration.
There are two ways that resolution occurs, explicit
resolution with the JNI function

RegisterNatives

and the normal automatic resolution. For

RegisterNatives

, the JVM will attempt this
association:

```java
method(foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
the specified prefix prepended to the method name,
yielding the correct resolution:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

For automatic resolution, the JVM will attempt:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(wrapped_foo)
```

When this fails, the resolution will be retried with
the specified prefix deleted from the implementation name,
yielding the correct resolution:

```java
method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)
```

Note that since the prefix is only used when standard
resolution fails, native methods can be wrapped selectively.

Since each

ClassFileTransformer

can do its own transformation of the bytecodes, more
than one layer of wrappers may be applied. Thus each
transformer needs its own prefix. Since transformations
are applied in order, the prefixes, if applied, will
be applied in the same order
(see

addTransformer

).
Thus if three transformers applied
wrappers,

foo

might become

$trans3_$trans2_$trans1_foo

. But if, say,
the second transformer did not apply a wrapper to

foo

it would be just

$trans3_$trans1_foo

```

Redefine a module to expand the set of modules that it reads, the set of
packages that it exports or opens, or the services that it uses or
provides. This method facilitates the instrumentation of code in named
modules where that instrumentation requires changes to the set of modules
that are read, the packages that are exported or open, or the services
that are used or provided.

This method cannot reduce the set of modules that a module reads, nor
reduce the set of packages that it exports or opens, nor reduce the set
of services that it uses or provides. This method is a no-op when invoked
to redefine an unnamed module.

When expanding the services that a module uses or provides then the
onus is on the agent to ensure that the service type will be accessible at
each instrumentation site where the service type is used. This method
does not check if the service type is a member of the module or in a
package exported to the module by another module that it reads.

The

extraExports

parameter is the map of additional packages
to export. The

extraOpens

parameter is the map of additional
packages to open. In both cases, the map key is the fully-qualified name
of the package as defined in section 6.5.3 of

The Java™ Language Specification

, for example,

"java.lang"

. The map value is the non-empty set of modules that the
package should be exported or opened to.

The

extraProvides

parameter is the additional service providers
for the module to provide. The map key is the service type. The map value
is the non-empty list of implementation types, each of which is a member
of the module and an implementation of the service.

This method is safe for concurrent use and so allows multiple agents
to instrument and update the same module at around the same time.
