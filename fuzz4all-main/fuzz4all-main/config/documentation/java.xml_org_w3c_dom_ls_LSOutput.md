# Interface LSOutput

**Source:** `java.xml\org\w3c\dom\ls\LSOutput.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
LSOutput
```

This interface represents an output destination for data.

This interface allows an application to encapsulate information about
an output destination in a single object, which may include a URI, a byte
stream (possibly with a specified encoding), a base URI, and/or a
character stream.

The exact definitions of a byte stream and a character stream are
binding dependent.

The application is expected to provide objects that implement this
interface whenever such objects are needed. The application can either
provide its own objects that implement this interface, or it can use the
generic factory method

DOMImplementationLS.createLSOutput()

to create objects that implement this interface.

The

LSSerializer

will use the

LSOutput

object
to determine where to serialize the output to. The

LSSerializer

will look at the different outputs specified in
the

LSOutput

in the following order to know which one to
output to, the first one that is not null and not an empty string will be
used:

- LSOutput.characterStream
- LSOutput.byteStream
- LSOutput.systemId

LSOutput

objects belong to the application. The DOM
implementation will never modify them (though it may make copies and
modify the copies, if necessary).

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load
and Save Specification

### Method Details

#### Writer
getCharacterStream()

An attribute of a language and binding dependent type that represents
a writable stream to which 16-bit units can be output.

---

#### void setCharacterStream​(
Writer
characterStream)

An attribute of a language and binding dependent type that represents
a writable stream to which 16-bit units can be output.

---

#### OutputStream
getByteStream()

An attribute of a language and binding dependent type that represents
a writable stream of bytes.

---

#### void setByteStream​(
OutputStream
byteStream)

An attribute of a language and binding dependent type that represents
a writable stream of bytes.

---

#### String
getSystemId()

The system identifier, a URI reference [

IETF RFC 2396

], for this
output destination.

If the system ID is a relative URI reference (see section 5 in [

IETF RFC 2396

]), the
behavior is implementation dependent.

---

#### void setSystemId​(
String
systemId)

The system identifier, a URI reference [

IETF RFC 2396

], for this
output destination.

If the system ID is a relative URI reference (see section 5 in [

IETF RFC 2396

]), the
behavior is implementation dependent.

---

#### String
getEncoding()

The character encoding to use for the output. The encoding must be a
string acceptable for an XML encoding declaration ([

XML 1.0

] section
4.3.3 "Character Encoding in Entities"), it is recommended that
character encodings registered (as charsets) with the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority [

IANA-CHARSETS

]
should be referred to using their registered names.

---

#### void setEncoding​(
String
encoding)

The character encoding to use for the output. The encoding must be a
string acceptable for an XML encoding declaration ([

XML 1.0

] section
4.3.3 "Character Encoding in Entities"), it is recommended that
character encodings registered (as charsets) with the Internet
