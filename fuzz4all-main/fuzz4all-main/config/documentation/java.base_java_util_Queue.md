# Interface Queue<E>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Queue.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Queue<E>

extends
Collection
<E>
```

A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
Besides basic

Collection

operations, queues provide
additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations.
Each of these methods exists in two forms: one throws an exception
if the operation fails, the other returns a special value (either

null

or

false

, depending on the operation). The
latter form of the insert operation is designed specifically for
use with capacity-restricted

Queue

implementations; in most
implementations, insert operations cannot fail.

Summary of Queue methods

Throws exception

Returns special value

Insert

add(e)

offer(e)

Remove

remove()

poll()

Examine

element()

peek()

Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a
FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner. Among the exceptions are
priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied
comparator, or the elements' natural ordering, and LIFO queues (or
stacks) which order the elements LIFO (last-in-first-out).
Whatever the ordering used, the

head

of the queue is that
element which would be removed by a call to

remove()

or

poll()

. In a FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at
the

tail

of the queue. Other kinds of queues may use
different placement rules. Every

Queue

implementation
must specify its ordering properties.

The

offer

method inserts an element if possible,
otherwise returning

false

. This differs from the

Collection.add

method, which can fail to
add an element only by throwing an unchecked exception. The

offer

method is designed for use when failure is a normal,
rather than exceptional occurrence, for example, in fixed-capacity
(or "bounded") queues.

The

remove()

and

poll()

methods remove and
return the head of the queue.
Exactly which element is removed from the queue is a
function of the queue's ordering policy, which differs from
implementation to implementation. The

remove()

and

poll()

methods differ only in their behavior when the
queue is empty: the

remove()

method throws an exception,
while the

poll()

method returns

null

.

The

element()

and

peek()

methods return, but do
not remove, the head of the queue.

The

Queue

interface does not define the

blocking queue
methods

, which are common in concurrent programming. These methods,
which wait for elements to appear or for space to become available, are
defined in the

BlockingQueue

interface, which
extends this interface.

Queue

implementations generally do not allow insertion
of

null

elements, although some implementations, such as

LinkedList

, do not prohibit insertion of

null

.
Even in the implementations that permit it,

null

should
not be inserted into a

Queue

, as

null

is also
used as a special return value by the

poll

method to
indicate that the queue contains no elements.

Queue

implementations generally do not define
element-based versions of methods

equals

and

hashCode

but instead inherit the identity based versions
from class

Object

, because element-based equality is not
always well-defined for queues with the same elements but different
ordering properties.

This interface is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

**Type Parameters:** E

- the type of elements held in this queue

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### boolean add​(
E
e)

Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so
immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning

true

upon success and throwing an

IllegalStateException

if no space is currently available.

**Specified by:**
- add

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- e

- the element to add

**Returns:**
- true

(as specified by

Collection.add(E)

)

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the element cannot be added at this
time due to capacity restrictions
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this queue
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null and
this queue does not permit null elements
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of this element
prevents it from being added to this queue

---

#### boolean offer​(
E
e)

Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do
so immediately without violating capacity restrictions.
When using a capacity-restricted queue, this method is generally
preferable to

add(E)

, which can fail to insert an element only
by throwing an exception.

**Parameters:**
- e

- the element to add

**Returns:**
- true

if the element was added to this queue, else

false

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this queue
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null and
this queue does not permit null elements
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of this element
prevents it from being added to this queue

---

#### E
remove()

Retrieves and removes the head of this queue. This method differs
from

poll()

only in that it throws an exception if
this queue is empty.

**Returns:**
- the head of this queue

**Throws:**
- NoSuchElementException

- if this queue is empty

---

#### E
poll()

Retrieves and removes the head of this queue,
or returns

null

if this queue is empty.

**Returns:**
- the head of this queue, or

null

if this queue is empty

---

#### E
element()

Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue. This method
differs from

peek

only in that it throws an exception
if this queue is empty.

**Returns:**
- the head of this queue

**Throws:**
- NoSuchElementException

- if this queue is empty

---

#### E
peek()

Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue,
or returns

null

if this queue is empty.

**Returns:**
- the head of this queue, or

null

if this queue is empty

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- add

```java
boolean add​(
E

Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so
immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning

true

upon success and throwing an

IllegalStateException

if no space is currently available.

**Specified by:** add

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** e

- the element to add
**Returns:** true

(as specified by

Collection.add(E)

)
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the element cannot be added at this
time due to capacity restrictions
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this queue
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null and
this queue does not permit null elements
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of this element
prevents it from being added to this queue

- offer

```java
boolean offer​(

**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null and
this queue does not permit null elements
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of this element

E
remove()

E
poll()

```java
E
element()

E
peek()
