# Class Character

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\Character.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
Character

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
,
Comparable
<
Character
>
```

The

Character

class wraps a value of the primitive
type

char

in an object. An object of class

Character

contains a single field whose type is

char

.

In addition, this class provides a large number of static methods for
determining a character's category (lowercase letter, digit, etc.)
and for converting characters from uppercase to lowercase and vice
versa.

Unicode Conformance

The fields and methods of class

Character

are defined in terms
of character information from the Unicode Standard, specifically the

UnicodeData

file that is part of the Unicode Character Database.
This file specifies properties including name and category for every
assigned Unicode code point or character range. The file is available
from the Unicode Consortium at

http://www.unicode.org

.

The Java SE 11 Platform uses character information from version 10.0
of the Unicode Standard, with two extensions. First, the Java SE 11 Platform
allows an implementation of class

Character

to use the code points
in the range of

U+9FEB

to

U+9FEF

from the Unicode Standard
version 11.0, in order for the class to allow the "Implementation Level 2"
of the Chinese GB18030-2022 standard. Second, the Java SE 11 Platform
allows an implementation of class

Character

to use the Japanese Era
code point,

U+32FF

, from the Unicode Standard version 12.1.
Consequently, the behavior of
fields and methods of class

Character

may vary across
implementations of the Java SE 11 Platform when processing the
aforementioned code point ( outside of version 10.0 ), except for
the following methods that define Java identifiers:

isJavaIdentifierStart(int)

,

isJavaIdentifierStart(char)

,

isJavaIdentifierPart(int)

, and

isJavaIdentifierPart(char)

.
Code points in Java identifiers must be drawn from version 10.0 of
the Unicode Standard.

Unicode Character Representations

The

char

data type (and therefore the value that a

Character

object encapsulates) are based on the
original Unicode specification, which defined characters as
fixed-width 16-bit entities. The Unicode Standard has since been
changed to allow for characters whose representation requires more
than 16 bits. The range of legal

code point

s is now
U+0000 to U+10FFFF, known as

Unicode scalar value

.
(Refer to the

definition

of the U+

n

notation in the Unicode
Standard.)

The set of characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF

is
sometimes referred to as the

Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)

.

Characters

whose code points are greater
than U+FFFF are called

supplementary character

s. The Java
platform uses the UTF-16 representation in

char

arrays and
in the

String

and

StringBuffer

classes. In
this representation, supplementary characters are represented as a pair
of

char

values, the first from the

high-surrogates

range, (\uD800-\uDBFF), the second from the

low-surrogates

range (\uDC00-\uDFFF).

A

char

value, therefore, represents Basic
Multilingual Plane (BMP) code points, including the surrogate
code points, or code units of the UTF-16 encoding. An

int

value represents all Unicode code points,
including supplementary code points. The lower (least significant)
21 bits of

int

are used to represent Unicode code
points and the upper (most significant) 11 bits must be zero.
Unless otherwise specified, the behavior with respect to
supplementary characters and surrogate

char

values is
as follows:

- The methods that only accept a

char

value cannot support
supplementary characters. They treat

char

values from the
surrogate ranges as undefined characters. For example,

Character.isLetter('\uD840')

returns

false

, even though
this specific value if followed by any low-surrogate value in a string
would represent a letter.

The methods that accept an

int

value support all
Unicode characters, including supplementary characters. For
example,

Character.isLetter(0x2F81A)

returns

true

because the code point value represents a letter
(a CJK ideograph).

In the Java SE API documentation,

Unicode code point

is
used for character values in the range between U+0000 and U+10FFFF,
and

Unicode code unit

is used for 16-bit

char

values that are code units of the

UTF-16

encoding. For more information on Unicode terminology, refer to the

Unicode Glossary

through

'\u007A'

), and
full width variant (

'\uFF21'

through

'\uFF3A'

and

'\uFF41'

through

'\uFF5A'

) forms have numeric values from 10
through 35. This is independent of the Unicode specification,
which does not assign numeric values to these

char

values.

If the character does not have a numeric value, then -1 is returned.
If the character has a numeric value that cannot be represented as a
nonnegative integer (for example, a fractional value), then -2
is returned.

**Parameters:**
- codePoint

- the character (Unicode code point) to be converted.

**Returns:**
- the numeric value of the character, as a nonnegative

int

value; -2 if the character has a numeric value but the value
can not be represented as a nonnegative

int

value;
-1 if the character has no numeric value.

The

Character

class wraps a value of the primitive
type

char

in an object. An object of class

Character

contains a single field whose type is

char

.

In addition, this class provides a large number of static methods for
determining a character's category (lowercase letter, digit, etc.)
and for converting characters from uppercase to lowercase and vice
versa.

Unicode Conformance

The fields and methods of class

Character

are defined in terms
of character information from the Unicode Standard, specifically the

UnicodeData

file that is part of the Unicode Character Database.
This file specifies properties including name and category for every
assigned Unicode code point or character range. The file is available
from the Unicode Consortium at

http://www.unicode.org

.

The Java SE 11 Platform uses character information from version 10.0
of the Unicode Standard, with two extensions. First, the Java SE 11 Platform
allows an implementation of class

Character

to use the code points
in the range of

U+9FEB

to

U+9FEF

from the Unicode Standard
version 11.0, in order for the class to allow the "Implementation Level 2"
of the Chinese GB18030-2022 standard. Second, the Java SE 11 Platform
allows an implementation of class

Character

to use the Japanese Era
code point,

U+32FF

, from the Unicode Standard version 12.1.
Consequently, the behavior of
fields and methods of class

Character

may vary across
implementations of the Java SE 11 Platform when processing the
aforementioned code point ( outside of version 10.0 ), except for
the following methods that define Java identifiers:

isJavaIdentifierStart(int)

,

isJavaIdentifierStart(char)

,

isJavaIdentifierPart(int)

, and

isJavaIdentifierPart(char)

.
Code points in Java identifiers must be drawn from version 10.0 of
the Unicode Standard.

Unicode Character Representations

The

char

data type (and therefore the value that a

Character

object encapsulates) are based on the
original Unicode specification, which defined characters as
fixed-width 16-bit entities. The Unicode Standard has since been
changed to allow for characters whose representation requires more
than 16 bits. The range of legal

code point

s is now
U+0000 to U+10FFFF, known as

Unicode scalar value

.
(Refer to the

definition

of the U+

n

notation in the Unicode
Standard.)

The set of characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF

is
sometimes referred to as the

Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)

.

Characters

whose code points are greater
than U+FFFF are called

supplementary character

s. The Java
platform uses the UTF-16 representation in

char

arrays and
in the

String

and

StringBuffer

classes. In
this representation, supplementary characters are represented as a pair
of

char

values, the first from the

high-surrogates

range, (\uD800-\uDBFF), the second from the

low-surrogates

range (\uDC00-\uDFFF).

A

char

value, therefore, represents Basic
Multilingual Plane (BMP) code points, including the surrogate
code points, or code units of the UTF-16 encoding. An

int

value represents all Unicode code points,
including supplementary code points. The lower (least significant)
21 bits of

int

are used to represent Unicode code
points and the upper (most significant) 11 bits must be zero.
Unless otherwise specified, the behavior with respect to
supplementary characters and surrogate

char

values is
as follows:

- The methods that only accept a

char

value cannot support
supplementary characters. They treat

char

values from the
surrogate ranges as undefined characters. For example,

Character.isLetter('\uD840')

returns

false

, even though
this specific value if followed by any low-surrogate value in a string
would represent a letter.

The methods that accept an

int

value support all
Unicode characters, including supplementary characters. For
example,

Character.isLetter(0x2F81A)

returns

true

because the code point value represents a letter
(a CJK ideograph).

In the Java SE API documentation,

Unicode code point

is
used for character values in the range between U+0000 and U+10FFFF,
and

Unicode code unit

is used for 16-bit

char

values that are code units of the

UTF-16

encoding. For more information on Unicode terminology, refer to the

false

, even though
this specific value if followed by any low-surrogate value in a string
would represent a letter.

The methods that accept an

int

value support all
Unicode characters, including supplementary characters. For
example,

Character.isLetter(0x2F81A)

returns

true

because the code point value represents a letter
(a CJK ideograph).

In the Java SE API documentation,

Unicode code point

is
used for character values in the range between U+0000 and U+10FFFF,
and

Unicode code unit

is used for 16-bit

char

values that are code units of the

UTF-16

encoding. For more information on Unicode terminology, refer to the

Unicode Glossary

.

In addition, this class provides a large number of static methods for
determining a character's category (lowercase letter, digit, etc.)
and for converting characters from uppercase to lowercase and vice
versa.

Unicode Conformance

The fields and methods of class

Character

are defined in terms
of character information from the Unicode Standard, specifically the

UnicodeData

file that is part of the Unicode Character Database.
This file specifies properties including name and category for every
assigned Unicode code point or character range. The file is available
from the Unicode Consortium at

http://www.unicode.org

.

The Java SE 11 Platform uses character information from version 10.0
of the Unicode Standard, with two extensions. First, the Java SE 11 Platform
allows an implementation of class

Character

to use the code points
in the range of

U+9FEB

to

U+9FEF

from the Unicode Standard
version 11.0, in order for the class to allow the "Implementation Level 2"
of the Chinese GB18030-2022 standard. Second, the Java SE 11 Platform
allows an implementation of class

Character

to use the Japanese Era
code point,

U+32FF

, from the Unicode Standard version 12.1.
Consequently, the behavior of
fields and methods of class

Character

may vary across
implementations of the Java SE 11 Platform when processing the
aforementioned code point ( outside of version 10.0 ), except for
the following methods that define Java identifiers:

isJavaIdentifierStart(int)

,

isJavaIdentifierStart(char)

,

isJavaIdentifierPart(int)

, and

isJavaIdentifierPart(char)

.
Code points in Java identifiers must be drawn from version 10.0 of
the Unicode Standard.

Unicode Character Representations

The

char

data type (and therefore the value that a

Character

object encapsulates) are based on the
original Unicode specification, which defined characters as
fixed-width 16-bit entities. The Unicode Standard has since been
changed to allow for characters whose representation requires more
than 16 bits. The range of legal

code point

s is now
U+0000 to U+10FFFF, known as

Unicode scalar value

.
(Refer to the

definition

of the U+

n

notation in the Unicode
Standard.)

The set of characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF

is
sometimes referred to as the

Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)

.

Characters

whose code points are greater
than U+FFFF are called

supplementary character

s. The Java
platform uses the UTF-16 representation in

char

arrays and
in the

String

and

StringBuffer

classes. In
this representation, supplementary characters are represented as a pair
of

char

values, the first from the

high-surrogates

range, (\uD800-\uDBFF), the second from the

low-surrogates

range (\uDC00-\uDFFF).

A

char

value, therefore, represents Basic
Multilingual Plane (BMP) code points, including the surrogate
code points, or code units of the UTF-16 encoding. An

int

value represents all Unicode code points,
including supplementary code points. The lower (least significant)
21 bits of

int

are used to represent Unicode code
points and the upper (most significant) 11 bits must be zero.
Unless otherwise specified, the behavior with respect to
supplementary characters and surrogate

char

values is
as follows:

- The methods that only accept a

char

value cannot support
supplementary characters. They treat

char

values from the
surrogate ranges as undefined characters. For example,

Character.isLetter('\uD840')

returns

false

, even though
this specific value if followed by any low-surrogate value in a string
would represent a letter.

The methods that accept an

int

value support all

example,

Character.isLetter(0x2F81A)

returns

the

isTitleCase(int)

method.

. To support
all Unicode characters, including supplementary characters, use
the

isTitleCase(int)

method.

isTitleCase

```java
public static boolean isTitleCase​(int codePoint)
```

Determines if the specified character (Unicode code point) is a titlecase character.

A character is a titlecase character if its general
category type, provided by

getType(codePoint)

,
is

TITLECASE_LETTER

.

Some characters look like pairs of Latin letters. For example, there
is an uppercase letter that looks like "LJ" and has a corresponding
lowercase letter that looks like "lj". A third form, which looks like "Lj",
is the appropriate form to use when rendering a word in lowercase
with initial capitals, as for a book title.

These are some of the Unicode characters for which this method returns

true

:

- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH SMALL LETTER Z WITH CARON

LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L WITH SMALL LETTER J

LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH SMALL LETTER J

LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH SMALL LETTER Z

Many other Unicode characters are titlecase too.

**Parameters:** codePoint

- the character (Unicode code point) to be tested.
**Returns:** true

if the character is titlecase;

false

otherwise.

#### getDirectionality

public static byte getDirectionality​(int codePoint)

Returns the Unicode directionality property for the given
character (Unicode code point). Character directionality is
used to calculate the visual ordering of text. The
directionality value of undefined character is

DIRECTIONALITY_UNDEFINED

.

isMirrored

```java
public static boolean isMirrored​(char ch)
```

Determines whether the character is mirrored according to the
Unicode specification. Mirrored characters should have their
glyphs horizontally mirrored when displayed in text that is
right-to-left. For example,

'\u0028'

LEFT
PARENTHESIS is semantically defined to be an

opening
parenthesis

. This will appear as a "(" in text that is
left-to-right but as a ")" in text that is right-to-left.

Note:

This method cannot handle

supplementary characters

. To support
all Unicode characters, including supplementary characters, use
the

isMirrored(int)

method.

**Parameters:** ch

-

char

for which the mirrored property is requested
**Returns:** true

if the char is mirrored,

false

if the

char

is not mirrored or is not defined.
**Since:** 1.4
