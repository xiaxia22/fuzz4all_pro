# Interface NamedNodeMap

**Source:** `java.xml\org\w3c\dom\NamedNodeMap.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
NamedNodeMap
```

Objects implementing the

NamedNodeMap

interface are used to
represent collections of nodes that can be accessed by name. Note that

NamedNodeMap

does not inherit from

NodeList

;

NamedNodeMaps

are not maintained in any particular order.
Objects contained in an object implementing

NamedNodeMap

may
also be accessed by an ordinal index, but this is simply to allow
convenient enumeration of the contents of a

NamedNodeMap

,
and does not imply that the DOM specifies an order to these Nodes.

NamedNodeMap

objects in the DOM are live.

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### Node
getNamedItem​(
String
name)

Retrieves a node specified by name.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The

nodeName

of a node to retrieve.

**Returns:**
- A

Node

(of any type) with the specified

nodeName

, or

null

if it does not identify
any node in this map.

---

#### Node
setNamedItem​(
Node
arg)
throws
DOMException

Adds a node using its

nodeName

attribute. If a node with
that name is already present in this map, it is replaced by the new
one. Replacing a node by itself has no effect.

As the

nodeName

attribute is used to derive the name
which the node must be stored under, multiple nodes of certain types
(those that have a "special" string value) cannot be stored as the
names would clash. This is seen as preferable to allowing nodes to be
aliased.

**Parameters:**
- arg

- A node to store in this map. The node will later be
accessible using the value of its

nodeName

attribute.

**Returns:**
- If the new

Node

replaces an existing node the
replaced

Node

is returned, otherwise

null

is returned.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised if

arg

was created from a
different document than the one that created this map.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this map is readonly.

INUSE_ATTRIBUTE_ERR: Raised if

arg

is an

Attr

that is already an attribute of another

Element

object. The DOM user must explicitly clone

Attr

nodes to re-use them in other elements.

HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if an attempt is made to add a node
doesn't belong in this NamedNodeMap. Examples would include trying
to insert something other than an Attr node into an Element's map
of attributes, or a non-Entity node into the DocumentType's map of
Entities.

---

#### Node
removeNamedItem​(
String
name)
throws
DOMException

Removes a node specified by name. When this map contains the attributes
attached to an element, if the removed attribute is known to have a
default value, an attribute immediately appears containing the
default value as well as the corresponding namespace URI, local name,
and prefix when applicable.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The

nodeName

of the node to remove.

**Returns:**
- The node removed from this map if a node with such a name
exists.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- NOT_FOUND_ERR: Raised if there is no node named

name

in
this map.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this map is readonly.

---

#### Node
item​(int index)

Returns the

index

th item in the map. If

index

is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in this map, this
returns

null

.

**Parameters:**
- index

- Index into this map.

**Returns:**
- The node at the

index

th position in the map, or

null

if that is not a valid index.

---

#### int getLength()

The number of nodes in this map. The range of valid child node indices
is

0

to

length-1

inclusive.

---

#### Node
getNamedItemNS​(
String
namespaceURI,

String
localName)
throws
DOMException

Retrieves a node specified by local name and namespace URI.

Per [

XML Namespaces

]
, applications must use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter
for methods if they wish to have no namespace.

**Parameters:**
- namespaceURI

- The namespace URI of the node to retrieve.
- localName

- The local name of the node to retrieve.

**Returns:**
- A

Node

(of any type) with the specified local
name and namespace URI, or

null

if they do not
identify any node in this map.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: May be raised if the implementation does not
support the feature "XML" and the language exposed through the
Document does not support XML Namespaces (such as [

HTML 4.01

]).

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### Node
setNamedItemNS​(
Node
arg)
throws
DOMException

Adds a node using its

namespaceURI

and

localName

. If a node with that namespace URI and that
local name is already present in this map, it is replaced by the new
one. Replacing a node by itself has no effect.

Per [

XML Namespaces

]
, applications must use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter
for methods if they wish to have no namespace.

**Parameters:**
- arg

- A node to store in this map. The node will later be
accessible using the value of its

namespaceURI

and

localName

attributes.

**Returns:**
- If the new

Node

replaces an existing node the
replaced

Node

is returned, otherwise

null

is returned.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised if

arg

was created from a
different document than the one that created this map.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this map is readonly.

INUSE_ATTRIBUTE_ERR: Raised if

arg

is an

Attr

that is already an attribute of another

Element

object. The DOM user must explicitly clone

Attr

nodes to re-use them in other elements.

HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if an attempt is made to add a node
doesn't belong in this NamedNodeMap. Examples would include trying
to insert something other than an Attr node into an Element's map
of attributes, or a non-Entity node into the DocumentType's map of
Entities.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: May be raised if the implementation does not
support the feature "XML" and the language exposed through the
Document does not support XML Namespaces (such as [

HTML 4.01

]).

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### Node
removeNamedItemNS​(
String
namespaceURI,

String
localName)
throws
DOMException

Removes a node specified by local name and namespace URI. A removed
attribute may be known to have a default value when this map contains
the attributes attached to an element, as returned by the attributes
attribute of the

Node

interface. If so, an attribute
immediately appears containing the default value as well as the
corresponding namespace URI, local name, and prefix when applicable.

Per [

XML Namespaces

]
, applications must use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter
for methods if they wish to have no namespace.

**Parameters:**
- namespaceURI

- The namespace URI of the node to remove.
- localName

- The local name of the node to remove.

**Returns:**
- The node removed from this map if a node with such a local
name and namespace URI exists.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- NOT_FOUND_ERR: Raised if there is no node with the specified

namespaceURI

and

localName

in this map.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this map is readonly.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: May be raised if the implementation does not
support the feature "XML" and the language exposed through the
Document does not support XML Namespaces (such as [

HTML 4.01

]).

default value as well as the corresponding namespace URI, local name,
and prefix when applicable.

**Parameters:** name

- The

nodeName

of the node to remove.
**Returns:** The node removed from this map if a node with such a name
exists.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_FOUND_ERR: Raised if there is no node named

name

in
this map.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this map is readonly.

#### removeNamedItem

Node

removeNamedItem​(

String

name)
throws

DOMException

Removes a node specified by name. When this map contains the attributes
attached to an element, if the removed attribute is known to have a
default value, an attribute immediately appears containing the
default value as well as the corresponding namespace URI, local name,
and prefix when applicable.

item

```java
Node
item​(int index)
```

Returns the

index

th item in the map. If

index

is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in this map, this
returns

null

.

**Parameters:** index

- Index into this map.
**Returns:** The node at the

index

th position in the map, or

null

if that is not a valid index.

```java
int getLength()
```

The number of nodes in this map. The range of valid child node indices
is

0

to

length-1

inclusive.

getNamedItemNS

```java
Node
getNamedItemNS​(
String
namespaceURI,

String
localName)
throws
DOMException
```

Retrieves a node specified by local name and namespace URI.

Per [

XML Namespaces

]
, applications must use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter
for methods if they wish to have no namespace.

**Parameters:** namespaceURI

- The namespace URI of the node to retrieve.
**Parameters:** localName

- The local name of the node to retrieve.
**Returns:** A

Node

(of any type) with the specified local
name and namespace URI, or

null

if they do not
identify any node in this map.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: May be raised if the implementation does not
support the feature "XML" and the language exposed through the
Document does not support XML Namespaces (such as [

HTML 4.01

]).
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

#### getNamedItemNS

Node

getNamedItemNS​(

String

namespaceURI,

String

localName)
throws

DOMException

Retrieves a node specified by local name and namespace URI.

Per [

XML Namespaces

]
, applications must use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter
for methods if they wish to have no namespace.

setNamedItemNS

```java
Node
setNamedItemNS​(
Node
arg)
throws
DOMException
```

Adds a node using its

namespaceURI

and

localName

. If a node with that namespace URI and that
local name is already present in this map, it is replaced by the new
one. Replacing a node by itself has no effect.

Per [

XML Namespaces

]
, applications must use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter
for methods if they wish to have no namespace.

**Parameters:** arg

- A node to store in this map. The node will later be
accessible using the value of its

namespaceURI

and

localName

attributes.
**Returns:** If the new

Node

replaces an existing node the
replaced

Node

is returned, otherwise

null

is returned.
**Throws:** DOMException

- WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised if

arg

was created from a
different document than the one that created this map.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this map is readonly.

INUSE_ATTRIBUTE_ERR: Raised if

arg

is an

Attr

that is already an attribute of another

Element

object. The DOM user must explicitly clone

Attr

nodes to re-use them in other elements.

HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if an attempt is made to add a node
doesn't belong in this NamedNodeMap. Examples would include trying
to insert something other than an Attr node into an Element's map
of attributes, or a non-Entity node into the DocumentType's map of
Entities.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: May be raised if the implementation does not
support the feature "XML" and the language exposed through the
Document does not support XML Namespaces (such as [

HTML 4.01

]).

throws
DOMException
```

Removes a node specified by local name and namespace URI. A removed
attribute may be known to have a default value when this map contains

attribute of the

Node

interface. If so, an attribute
immediately appears containing the default value as well as the
corresponding namespace URI, local name, and prefix when applicable.

Per [

**Returns:** The node removed from this map if a node with such a local
name and namespace URI exists.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_FOUND_ERR: Raised if there is no node with the specified

namespaceURI

and

localName

in this map.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this map is readonly.
