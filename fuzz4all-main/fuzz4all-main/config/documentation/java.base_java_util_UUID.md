# Class UUID

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\UUID.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
UUID

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
,
Comparable
<
UUID
>
```

A class that represents an immutable universally unique identifier (UUID).
A UUID represents a 128-bit value.

There exist different variants of these global identifiers. The methods
of this class are for manipulating the Leach-Salz variant, although the
constructors allow the creation of any variant of UUID (described below).

The layout of a variant 2 (Leach-Salz) UUID is as follows:

The most significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:

```java
0xFFFFFFFF00000000 time_low
0x00000000FFFF0000 time_mid
0x000000000000F000 version
0x0000000000000FFF time_hi
```

The least significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:

```java
0xC000000000000000 variant
0x3FFF000000000000 clock_seq
0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFF node
```

The variant field contains a value which identifies the layout of the

UUID

. The bit layout described above is valid only for a

UUID

with a variant value of 2, which indicates the Leach-Salz variant.

The version field holds a value that describes the type of this

UUID

. There are four different basic types of UUIDs: time-based, DCE
security, name-based, and randomly generated UUIDs. These types have a
version value of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public UUID​(long mostSigBits,
long leastSigBits)

Constructs a new

UUID

using the specified data.

mostSigBits

is used for the most significant 64 bits of the

UUID

and

leastSigBits

becomes the least significant 64 bits of
the

UUID

.

**Parameters:**
- mostSigBits

- The most significant bits of the

UUID
- leastSigBits

- The least significant bits of the

UUID

---

### Method Details

#### public static
UUID
randomUUID()

Static factory to retrieve a type 4 (pseudo randomly generated) UUID.

The

UUID

is generated using a cryptographically strong pseudo
random number generator.

**Returns:**
- A randomly generated

UUID

---

#### public static
UUID
nameUUIDFromBytes​(byte[] name)

Static factory to retrieve a type 3 (name based)

UUID

based on
the specified byte array.

**Parameters:**
- name

- A byte array to be used to construct a

UUID

**Returns:**
- A

UUID

generated from the specified array

---

#### public static
UUID
fromString​(
String
name)

Creates a

UUID

from the string standard representation as
described in the

toString()

method.

**Parameters:**
- name

- A string that specifies a

UUID

**Returns:**
- A

UUID

with the specified value

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If name does not conform to the string representation as
described in

toString()

---

#### public long getLeastSignificantBits()

Returns the least significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value.

**Returns:**
- The least significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value

---

#### public long getMostSignificantBits()

Returns the most significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value.

**Returns:**
- The most significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value

---

#### public int version()

The version number associated with this

UUID

. The version
number describes how this

UUID

was generated.

The version number has the following meaning:

- 1 Time-based UUID

2 DCE security UUID

3 Name-based UUID

4 Randomly generated UUID

**Returns:**
- The version number of this

UUID

---

#### public int variant()

. The resulting
timestamp is measured in 100-nanosecond units since midnight,
October 15, 1582 UTC.

The timestamp value is only meaningful in a time-based UUID, which
