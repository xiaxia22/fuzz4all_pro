# Class Graphics2D

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\Graphics2D.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Graphics2D

extends
Graphics
```

This

Graphics2D

class extends the

Graphics

class to provide more sophisticated
control over geometry, coordinate transformations, color management,
and text layout. This is the fundamental class for rendering
2-dimensional shapes, text and images on the Java(tm) platform.

Coordinate Spaces

All coordinates passed to a

Graphics2D

object are specified
in a device-independent coordinate system called User Space, which is
used by applications. The

Graphics2D

object contains
an

AffineTransform

object as part of its rendering state
that defines how to convert coordinates from user space to
device-dependent coordinates in Device Space.

Coordinates in device space usually refer to individual device pixels
and are aligned on the infinitely thin gaps between these pixels.
Some

Graphics2D

objects can be used to capture rendering
operations for storage into a graphics metafile for playback on a
concrete device of unknown physical resolution at a later time. Since
the resolution might not be known when the rendering operations are
captured, the

Graphics2D Transform

is set up
to transform user coordinates to a virtual device space that
approximates the expected resolution of the target device. Further
transformations might need to be applied at playback time if the
estimate is incorrect.

Some of the operations performed by the rendering attribute objects
occur in the device space, but all

Graphics2D

methods take
user space coordinates.

Every

Graphics2D

object is associated with a target that
defines where rendering takes place. A

GraphicsConfiguration

object defines the characteristics
of the rendering target, such as pixel format and resolution.
The same rendering target is used throughout the life of a

Graphics2D

object.

When creating a

Graphics2D

object, the

GraphicsConfiguration

specifies the

default transform

for
the target of the

Graphics2D

(a

Component

or

Image

). This default transform maps the
user space coordinate system to screen and printer device coordinates
such that the origin maps to the upper left hand corner of the
target region of the device with increasing X coordinates extending
to the right and increasing Y coordinates extending downward.
The scaling of the default transform is set to identity for those devices
that are close to 72 dpi, such as screen devices.
The scaling of the default transform is set to approximately 72 user
space coordinates per square inch for high resolution devices, such as
printers. For image buffers, the default transform is the

Identity

transform.

Rendering Process

The Rendering Process can be broken down into four phases that are
controlled by the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes.
The renderer can optimize many of these steps, either by caching the
results for future calls, by collapsing multiple virtual steps into
a single operation, or by recognizing various attributes as common
simple cases that can be eliminated by modifying other parts of the
operation.

The steps in the rendering process are:

- Determine what to render.

Constrain the rendering operation to the current

Clip

.
The

Clip

is specified by a

Shape

in user
space and is controlled by the program using the various clip
manipulation methods of

Graphics

and

Graphics2D

. This

user clip

is transformed into device space by the current

Transform

and combined with the

device clip

, which is defined by the visibility of windows and
device extents. The combination of the user clip and device clip
defines the

composite clip

, which determines the final clipping
region. The user clip is not modified by the rendering
system to reflect the resulting composite clip.

Determine what colors to render.

Apply the colors to the destination drawing surface using the current

Composite

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context.

The three types of rendering operations, along with details of each
of their particular rendering processes are:

- Shape

operations

- If the operation is a

draw(Shape)

operation, then
the

createStrokedShape

method on the current

Stroke

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context is used to construct a new

Shape

object that contains the outline of the specified

Shape

.

The

Shape

is transformed from user space to device space
using the current

Transform

in the

Graphics2D

context.

The outline of the

Shape

is extracted using the

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which returns a

PathIterator

object that iterates along the boundary of the

Shape

.

If the

Graphics2D

object cannot handle the curved segments
that the

PathIterator

object returns then it can call the
alternate

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which flattens the

Shape

.

The current

Paint

in the

Graphics2D

context
is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies the
colors to render in device space.

Text operations

- The following steps are used to determine the set of glyphs required
to render the indicated

String

:

- If the argument is a

String

, then the current

Font

in the

Graphics2D

context is asked to
convert the Unicode characters in the

String

into a set of
glyphs for presentation with whatever basic layout and shaping
algorithms the font implements.

If the argument is an

AttributedCharacterIterator

,
the iterator is asked to convert itself to a

TextLayout

using its embedded font attributes. The

TextLayout

implements more sophisticated glyph layout algorithms that
perform Unicode bi-directional layout adjustments automatically
for multiple fonts of differing writing directions.

If the argument is a

GlyphVector

, then the

GlyphVector

object already contains the appropriate
font-specific glyph codes with explicit coordinates for the position of
each glyph.

The current

Font

is queried to obtain outlines for the
indicated glyphs. These outlines are treated as shapes in user space
relative to the position of each glyph that was determined in step 1.

The character outlines are filled as indicated above
under

Shape

operations

.

The current

Paint

is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies
the colors to render in device space.

Image

Operations

- The region of interest is defined by the bounding box of the source

Image

.
This bounding box is specified in Image Space, which is the

Image

object's local coordinate system.

If an

AffineTransform

is passed to

drawImage(Image, AffineTransform, ImageObserver)

,
the

AffineTransform

is used to transform the bounding
box from image space to user space. If no

AffineTransform

is supplied, the bounding box is treated as if it is already in user space.

The bounding box of the source

Image

is transformed from user
space into device space using the current

Transform

.
Note that the result of transforming the bounding box does not
necessarily result in a rectangular region in device space.

The

Image

object determines what colors to render,
sampled according to the source to destination
coordinate mapping specified by the current

Transform

and the
optional image transform.

Default Rendering Attributes

The default values for the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes are:

Rendering Compatibility Issues

The JDK(tm) 1.1 rendering model is based on a pixelization model
that specifies that coordinates
are infinitely thin, lying between the pixels. Drawing operations are
performed using a one-pixel wide pen that fills the
pixel below and to the right of the anchor point on the path.
The JDK 1.1 rendering model is consistent with the
capabilities of most of the existing class of platform
renderers that need to resolve integer coordinates to a
discrete pen that must fall completely on a specified number of pixels.

The Java 2D(tm) (Java(tm) 2 platform) API supports antialiasing renderers.
A pen with a width of one pixel does not need to fall
completely on pixel N as opposed to pixel N+1. The pen can fall
partially on both pixels. It is not necessary to choose a bias
direction for a wide pen since the blending that occurs along the
pen traversal edges makes the sub-pixel position of the pen
visible to the user. On the other hand, when antialiasing is
turned off by setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint key
to the

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_OFF

hint value, the renderer might need
to apply a bias to determine which pixel to modify when the pen
is straddling a pixel boundary, such as when it is drawn
along an integer coordinate in device space. While the capabilities
of an antialiasing renderer make it no longer necessary for the
rendering model to specify a bias for the pen, it is desirable for the
antialiasing and non-antialiasing renderers to perform similarly for
the common cases of drawing one-pixel wide horizontal and vertical
lines on the screen. To ensure that turning on antialiasing by
setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint
key to

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON

does not cause such lines to suddenly become twice as wide and half
as opaque, it is desirable to have the model specify a path for such
lines so that they completely cover a particular set of pixels to help
increase their crispness.

Java 2D API maintains compatibility with JDK 1.1 rendering
behavior, such that legacy operations and existing renderer
behavior is unchanged under Java 2D API. Legacy
methods that map onto general

draw

and

fill

methods are defined, which clearly indicates
how

Graphics2D

extends

Graphics

based
on settings of

Stroke

and

Transform

attributes and rendering hints. The definition
performs identically under default attribute settings.
For example, the default

Stroke

is a

BasicStroke

with a width of 1 and no dashing and the
default Transform for screen drawing is an Identity transform.

The following two rules provide predictable rendering behavior whether
aliasing or antialiasing is being used.

- Device coordinates are defined to be between device pixels which
avoids any inconsistent results between aliased and antialiased
rendering. If coordinates were defined to be at a pixel's center, some
of the pixels covered by a shape, such as a rectangle, would only be
half covered.
With aliased rendering, the half covered pixels would either be
rendered inside the shape or outside the shape. With anti-aliased
rendering, the pixels on the entire edge of the shape would be half
covered. On the other hand, since coordinates are defined to be
between pixels, a shape like a rectangle would have no half covered
pixels, whether or not it is rendered using antialiasing.

Lines and paths stroked using the

BasicStroke

object may be "normalized" to provide consistent rendering of the
outlines when positioned at various points on the drawable and
whether drawn with aliased or antialiased rendering. This
normalization process is controlled by the

KEY_STROKE_CONTROL

hint.
The exact normalization algorithm is not specified, but the goals
of this normalization are to ensure that lines are rendered with
consistent visual appearance regardless of how they fall on the
pixel grid and to promote more solid horizontal and vertical
lines in antialiased mode so that they resemble their non-antialiased
counterparts more closely. A typical normalization step might
promote antialiased line endpoints to pixel centers to reduce the
amount of blending or adjust the subpixel positioning of
non-antialiased lines so that the floating point line widths
round to even or odd pixel counts with equal likelihood. This
process can move endpoints by up to half a pixel (usually towards
positive infinity along both axes) to promote these consistent
results.

The following definitions of general legacy methods
perform identically to previously specified behavior under default
attribute settings:

- For

fill

operations, including

fillRect

,

fillRoundRect

,

fillOval

,

fillArc

,

fillPolygon

, and

clearRect

,

fill

can now be called
with the desired

Shape

. For example, when filling a
rectangle:

```java
fill(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

Similarly, for draw operations, including

drawLine

,

drawRect

,

drawRoundRect

,

drawOval

,

drawArc

,

drawPolyline

,
and

drawPolygon

,

draw

can now be
called with the desired

Shape

. For example, when drawing a
rectangle:

```java
draw(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

The

draw3DRect

and

fill3DRect

methods were
implemented in terms of the

drawLine

and

fillRect

methods in the

Graphics

class which
would predicate their behavior upon the current

Stroke

and

Paint

objects in a

Graphics2D

context.
This class overrides those implementations with versions that use
the current

Color

exclusively, overriding the current

Paint

and which uses

fillRect

to describe
the exact same behavior as the preexisting methods regardless of the
setting of the current

Stroke

.

The

Graphics

class defines only the

setColor

method to control the color to be painted. Since the Java 2D API extends
the

Color

object to implement the new

Paint

interface, the existing

setColor

method is now a convenience method for setting the
current

Paint

attribute to a

Color

object.

setColor(c)

is equivalent to

setPaint(c)

.

The

Graphics

class defines two methods for controlling
how colors are applied to the destination.

- The

setPaintMode

method is implemented as a convenience
method to set the default

Composite

, equivalent to

setComposite(new AlphaComposite.SrcOver)

.

The

setXORMode(Color xorcolor)

method is implemented
as a convenience method to set a special

Composite

object that
ignores the

Alpha

components of source colors and sets the
destination color to the value:

```java
dstpixel = (PixelOf(srccolor) ^ PixelOf(xorcolor) ^ dstpixel);
```

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected Graphics2D()

Constructs a new

Graphics2D

object. Since

Graphics2D

is an abstract class, and since it must be
customized by subclasses for different output devices,

Graphics2D

objects cannot be created directly.
Instead,

Graphics2D

objects must be obtained from another

Graphics2D

object, created by a

Component

, or obtained from images such as

BufferedImage

objects.

#### public abstract void transform​(
AffineTransform
Tx)

Composes an

AffineTransform

object with the

Transform

to the rule last-specified-first-applied. If the current

Transform

is Cx, the result of composition
with Tx is a new

Transform

Cx'. Cx' becomes the
current

Transform

for this

Graphics2D

.
Transforming a point p by the updated

Transform

Cx' is
equivalent to first transforming p by Tx and then transforming
the result by the original

Transform

Cx. In other
words, Cx'(p) = Cx(Tx(p)). A copy of the Tx is made, if necessary,
so further modifications to Tx do not affect rendering.

#### public abstract void setTransform​(
AffineTransform
Tx)

Overwrites the Transform in the

Graphics2D

context.
WARNING: This method should

never

be used to apply a new
coordinate transform on top of an existing transform because the

Graphics2D

might already have a transform that is
needed for other purposes, such as rendering Swing
components or applying a scaling transformation to adjust for the
resolution of a printer.

To add a coordinate transform, use the

transform

,

rotate

,

scale

,
or

shear

methods. The

setTransform

method is intended only for restoring the original

Graphics2D

transform after rendering, as shown in this
example:

```java
// Get the current transform
AffineTransform saveAT = g2.getTransform();
// Perform transformation
g2d.transform(...);
// Render
g2d.draw(...);
// Restore original transform
g2d.setTransform(saveAT);
```

java.awt.Graphics2D

```java
public abstract class
Graphics2D

extends
Graphics
```

This

Graphics2D

class extends the

Graphics

class to provide more sophisticated
control over geometry, coordinate transformations, color management,
and text layout. This is the fundamental class for rendering
2-dimensional shapes, text and images on the Java(tm) platform.

Coordinate Spaces

All coordinates passed to a

Graphics2D

object are specified
in a device-independent coordinate system called User Space, which is
used by applications. The

Graphics2D

object contains
an

AffineTransform

object as part of its rendering state
that defines how to convert coordinates from user space to
device-dependent coordinates in Device Space.

Coordinates in device space usually refer to individual device pixels
and are aligned on the infinitely thin gaps between these pixels.
Some

Graphics2D

objects can be used to capture rendering
operations for storage into a graphics metafile for playback on a
concrete device of unknown physical resolution at a later time. Since
the resolution might not be known when the rendering operations are
captured, the

Graphics2D Transform

is set up
to transform user coordinates to a virtual device space that
approximates the expected resolution of the target device. Further
transformations might need to be applied at playback time if the
estimate is incorrect.

Some of the operations performed by the rendering attribute objects
occur in the device space, but all

Graphics2D

methods take
user space coordinates.

Every

Graphics2D

object is associated with a target that
defines where rendering takes place. A

GraphicsConfiguration

object defines the characteristics
of the rendering target, such as pixel format and resolution.
The same rendering target is used throughout the life of a

Graphics2D

object.

When creating a

Graphics2D

object, the

GraphicsConfiguration

specifies the

default transform

for
the target of the

Graphics2D

(a

Component

or

Image

). This default transform maps the
user space coordinate system to screen and printer device coordinates
such that the origin maps to the upper left hand corner of the
target region of the device with increasing X coordinates extending
to the right and increasing Y coordinates extending downward.
The scaling of the default transform is set to identity for those devices
that are close to 72 dpi, such as screen devices.
The scaling of the default transform is set to approximately 72 user
space coordinates per square inch for high resolution devices, such as
printers. For image buffers, the default transform is the

Identity

transform.

Rendering Process

The Rendering Process can be broken down into four phases that are
controlled by the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes.
The renderer can optimize many of these steps, either by caching the
results for future calls, by collapsing multiple virtual steps into
a single operation, or by recognizing various attributes as common
simple cases that can be eliminated by modifying other parts of the
operation.

The steps in the rendering process are:

- Determine what to render.

Constrain the rendering operation to the current

Clip

.
The

Clip

is specified by a

Shape

in user
space and is controlled by the program using the various clip
manipulation methods of

Graphics

and

Graphics2D

. This

user clip

is transformed into device space by the current

Transform

and combined with the

device clip

, which is defined by the visibility of windows and
device extents. The combination of the user clip and device clip
defines the

composite clip

, which determines the final clipping
region. The user clip is not modified by the rendering
system to reflect the resulting composite clip.

Determine what colors to render.

Apply the colors to the destination drawing surface using the current

Composite

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context.

The three types of rendering operations, along with details of each
of their particular rendering processes are:

- Shape

operations

- If the operation is a

draw(Shape)

operation, then
the

createStrokedShape

method on the current

Stroke

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context is used to construct a new

Shape

object that contains the outline of the specified

Shape

.

The

Shape

is transformed from user space to device space
using the current

Transform

in the

Graphics2D

context.

The outline of the

Shape

is extracted using the

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which returns a

PathIterator

object that iterates along the boundary of the

Shape

.

If the

Graphics2D

object cannot handle the curved segments
that the

PathIterator

object returns then it can call the
alternate

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which flattens the

Shape

.

The current

Paint

in the

Graphics2D

context
is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies the
colors to render in device space.

Text operations

- The following steps are used to determine the set of glyphs required
to render the indicated

String

:

- If the argument is a

String

, then the current

Font

in the

Graphics2D

context is asked to
convert the Unicode characters in the

String

into a set of
glyphs for presentation with whatever basic layout and shaping
algorithms the font implements.

If the argument is an

AttributedCharacterIterator

,
the iterator is asked to convert itself to a

TextLayout

using its embedded font attributes. The

TextLayout

implements more sophisticated glyph layout algorithms that
perform Unicode bi-directional layout adjustments automatically
for multiple fonts of differing writing directions.

If the argument is a

GlyphVector

, then the

GlyphVector

object already contains the appropriate
font-specific glyph codes with explicit coordinates for the position of
each glyph.

The current

Font

is queried to obtain outlines for the
indicated glyphs. These outlines are treated as shapes in user space
relative to the position of each glyph that was determined in step 1.

The character outlines are filled as indicated above
under

Shape

operations

.

The current

Paint

is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies
the colors to render in device space.

Image

Operations

- The region of interest is defined by the bounding box of the source

Image

.
This bounding box is specified in Image Space, which is the

Image

object's local coordinate system.

If an

AffineTransform

is passed to

drawImage(Image, AffineTransform, ImageObserver)

,
the

AffineTransform

is used to transform the bounding
box from image space to user space. If no

AffineTransform

is supplied, the bounding box is treated as if it is already in user space.

The bounding box of the source

Image

is transformed from user
space into device space using the current

Transform

.
Note that the result of transforming the bounding box does not
necessarily result in a rectangular region in device space.

The

Image

object determines what colors to render,
sampled according to the source to destination
coordinate mapping specified by the current

Transform

and the
optional image transform.

Default Rendering Attributes

The default values for the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes are:

Rendering Compatibility Issues

The JDK(tm) 1.1 rendering model is based on a pixelization model
that specifies that coordinates
are infinitely thin, lying between the pixels. Drawing operations are
performed using a one-pixel wide pen that fills the
pixel below and to the right of the anchor point on the path.
The JDK 1.1 rendering model is consistent with the
capabilities of most of the existing class of platform
renderers that need to resolve integer coordinates to a
discrete pen that must fall completely on a specified number of pixels.

The Java 2D(tm) (Java(tm) 2 platform) API supports antialiasing renderers.
A pen with a width of one pixel does not need to fall
completely on pixel N as opposed to pixel N+1. The pen can fall
partially on both pixels. It is not necessary to choose a bias
direction for a wide pen since the blending that occurs along the
pen traversal edges makes the sub-pixel position of the pen
visible to the user. On the other hand, when antialiasing is
turned off by setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint key
to the

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_OFF

hint value, the renderer might need
to apply a bias to determine which pixel to modify when the pen
is straddling a pixel boundary, such as when it is drawn
along an integer coordinate in device space. While the capabilities
of an antialiasing renderer make it no longer necessary for the
rendering model to specify a bias for the pen, it is desirable for the
antialiasing and non-antialiasing renderers to perform similarly for
the common cases of drawing one-pixel wide horizontal and vertical
lines on the screen. To ensure that turning on antialiasing by
setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint
key to

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON

does not cause such lines to suddenly become twice as wide and half
as opaque, it is desirable to have the model specify a path for such
lines so that they completely cover a particular set of pixels to help
increase their crispness.

Java 2D API maintains compatibility with JDK 1.1 rendering
behavior, such that legacy operations and existing renderer
behavior is unchanged under Java 2D API. Legacy
methods that map onto general

draw

and

fill

methods are defined, which clearly indicates
how

Graphics2D

extends

Graphics

based
on settings of

Stroke

and

Transform

attributes and rendering hints. The definition
performs identically under default attribute settings.
For example, the default

Stroke

is a

BasicStroke

with a width of 1 and no dashing and the
default Transform for screen drawing is an Identity transform.

The following two rules provide predictable rendering behavior whether
aliasing or antialiasing is being used.

- Device coordinates are defined to be between device pixels which
avoids any inconsistent results between aliased and antialiased
rendering. If coordinates were defined to be at a pixel's center, some
of the pixels covered by a shape, such as a rectangle, would only be
half covered.
With aliased rendering, the half covered pixels would either be
rendered inside the shape or outside the shape. With anti-aliased
rendering, the pixels on the entire edge of the shape would be half
covered. On the other hand, since coordinates are defined to be
between pixels, a shape like a rectangle would have no half covered
pixels, whether or not it is rendered using antialiasing.

Lines and paths stroked using the

BasicStroke

object may be "normalized" to provide consistent rendering of the
outlines when positioned at various points on the drawable and
whether drawn with aliased or antialiased rendering. This
normalization process is controlled by the

KEY_STROKE_CONTROL

hint.
The exact normalization algorithm is not specified, but the goals
of this normalization are to ensure that lines are rendered with
consistent visual appearance regardless of how they fall on the
pixel grid and to promote more solid horizontal and vertical
lines in antialiased mode so that they resemble their non-antialiased
counterparts more closely. A typical normalization step might
promote antialiased line endpoints to pixel centers to reduce the
amount of blending or adjust the subpixel positioning of
non-antialiased lines so that the floating point line widths
round to even or odd pixel counts with equal likelihood. This
process can move endpoints by up to half a pixel (usually towards
positive infinity along both axes) to promote these consistent
results.

The following definitions of general legacy methods
perform identically to previously specified behavior under default
attribute settings:

- For

fill

operations, including

fillRect

,

fillRoundRect

,

fillOval

,

fillArc

,

fillPolygon

, and

clearRect

,

fill

can now be called
with the desired

Shape

. For example, when filling a
rectangle:

```java
fill(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

Similarly, for draw operations, including

drawLine

,

drawRect

,

drawRoundRect

,

drawOval

,

drawArc

,

drawPolyline

,
and

drawPolygon

,

draw

can now be
called with the desired

Shape

. For example, when drawing a
rectangle:

```java
draw(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

The

draw3DRect

and

fill3DRect

methods were
implemented in terms of the

drawLine

and

fillRect

methods in the

Graphics

class which
would predicate their behavior upon the current

Stroke

and

Paint

objects in a

Graphics2D

context.
This class overrides those implementations with versions that use
the current

Color

exclusively, overriding the current

Paint

and which uses

fillRect

to describe
the exact same behavior as the preexisting methods regardless of the
setting of the current

Stroke

.

The

Graphics

class defines only the

setColor

method to control the color to be painted. Since the Java 2D API extends
the

Color

object to implement the new

Paint

interface, the existing

setColor

method is now a convenience method for setting the
current

Paint

attribute to a

Color

object.

setColor(c)

is equivalent to

setPaint(c)

.

The

Graphics

class defines two methods for controlling
how colors are applied to the destination.

- The

setPaintMode

method is implemented as a convenience
method to set the default

Composite

, equivalent to

setComposite(new AlphaComposite.SrcOver)

.

The

setXORMode(Color xorcolor)

method is implemented
as a convenience method to set a special

Composite

object that
ignores the

Alpha

components of source colors and sets the
destination color to the value:

```java
dstpixel = (PixelOf(srccolor) ^ PixelOf(xorcolor) ^ dstpixel);
```

Graphics2D

class extends the

Graphics

class to provide more sophisticated
control over geometry, coordinate transformations, color management,
and text layout. This is the fundamental class for rendering
2-dimensional shapes, text and images on the Java(tm) platform.

Coordinate Spaces

All coordinates passed to a

Graphics2D

object are specified
in a device-independent coordinate system called User Space, which is
used by applications. The

Graphics2D

object contains
an

AffineTransform

object as part of its rendering state
that defines how to convert coordinates from user space to
device-dependent coordinates in Device Space.

Coordinates in device space usually refer to individual device pixels
and are aligned on the infinitely thin gaps between these pixels.
Some

Graphics2D

objects can be used to capture rendering
operations for storage into a graphics metafile for playback on a
concrete device of unknown physical resolution at a later time. Since
the resolution might not be known when the rendering operations are
captured, the

Graphics2D Transform

is set up
to transform user coordinates to a virtual device space that
approximates the expected resolution of the target device. Further
transformations might need to be applied at playback time if the
estimate is incorrect.

Some of the operations performed by the rendering attribute objects
occur in the device space, but all

Graphics2D

methods take
user space coordinates.

Every

Graphics2D

object is associated with a target that
defines where rendering takes place. A

GraphicsConfiguration

object defines the characteristics
of the rendering target, such as pixel format and resolution.
The same rendering target is used throughout the life of a

Graphics2D

object.

When creating a

Graphics2D

object, the

GraphicsConfiguration

specifies the

default transform

for
the target of the

Graphics2D

(a

Component

or

Image

). This default transform maps the
user space coordinate system to screen and printer device coordinates
such that the origin maps to the upper left hand corner of the
target region of the device with increasing X coordinates extending
to the right and increasing Y coordinates extending downward.
The scaling of the default transform is set to identity for those devices
that are close to 72 dpi, such as screen devices.
The scaling of the default transform is set to approximately 72 user
space coordinates per square inch for high resolution devices, such as
printers. For image buffers, the default transform is the

Identity

transform.

Rendering Process

The Rendering Process can be broken down into four phases that are
controlled by the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes.
The renderer can optimize many of these steps, either by caching the
results for future calls, by collapsing multiple virtual steps into
a single operation, or by recognizing various attributes as common
simple cases that can be eliminated by modifying other parts of the
operation.

The steps in the rendering process are:

- Determine what to render.

Constrain the rendering operation to the current

Clip

.
The

Clip

is specified by a

Shape

in user
space and is controlled by the program using the various clip
manipulation methods of

Graphics

and

Graphics2D

. This

user clip

is transformed into device space by the current

Transform

and combined with the

device clip

, which is defined by the visibility of windows and
device extents. The combination of the user clip and device clip
defines the

composite clip

, which determines the final clipping
region. The user clip is not modified by the rendering
system to reflect the resulting composite clip.

Determine what colors to render.

Apply the colors to the destination drawing surface using the current

Composite

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context.

The three types of rendering operations, along with details of each
of their particular rendering processes are:

- Shape

operations

- If the operation is a

draw(Shape)

operation, then
the

createStrokedShape

method on the current

Stroke

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context is used to construct a new

Shape

object that contains the outline of the specified

Shape

.

The

Shape

is transformed from user space to device space
using the current

Transform

in the

Graphics2D

context.

The outline of the

Shape

is extracted using the

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which returns a

PathIterator

object that iterates along the boundary of the

Shape

.

If the

Graphics2D

object cannot handle the curved segments
that the

PathIterator

object returns then it can call the
alternate

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which flattens the

Shape

.

The current

Paint

in the

Graphics2D

context
is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies the
colors to render in device space.

Text operations

- The following steps are used to determine the set of glyphs required
to render the indicated

String

:

- If the argument is a

String

, then the current

Font

in the

Graphics2D

context is asked to
convert the Unicode characters in the

String

into a set of
glyphs for presentation with whatever basic layout and shaping
algorithms the font implements.

If the argument is an

AttributedCharacterIterator

,
the iterator is asked to convert itself to a

TextLayout

using its embedded font attributes. The

TextLayout

implements more sophisticated glyph layout algorithms that
perform Unicode bi-directional layout adjustments automatically
for multiple fonts of differing writing directions.

If the argument is a

GlyphVector

, then the

GlyphVector

object already contains the appropriate
font-specific glyph codes with explicit coordinates for the position of
each glyph.

The current

Font

is queried to obtain outlines for the
indicated glyphs. These outlines are treated as shapes in user space
relative to the position of each glyph that was determined in step 1.

The character outlines are filled as indicated above
under

Shape

operations

.

The current

Paint

is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies
the colors to render in device space.

Image

Operations

- The region of interest is defined by the bounding box of the source

Image

.
This bounding box is specified in Image Space, which is the

Image

object's local coordinate system.

If an

AffineTransform

is passed to

drawImage(Image, AffineTransform, ImageObserver)

,
the

AffineTransform

is used to transform the bounding
box from image space to user space. If no

AffineTransform

is supplied, the bounding box is treated as if it is already in user space.

The bounding box of the source

Image

is transformed from user
space into device space using the current

Transform

.
Note that the result of transforming the bounding box does not
necessarily result in a rectangular region in device space.

The

Image

object determines what colors to render,
sampled according to the source to destination
coordinate mapping specified by the current

Transform

and the
optional image transform.

Default Rendering Attributes

The default values for the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes are:

Rendering Compatibility Issues

The JDK(tm) 1.1 rendering model is based on a pixelization model
that specifies that coordinates
are infinitely thin, lying between the pixels. Drawing operations are
performed using a one-pixel wide pen that fills the
pixel below and to the right of the anchor point on the path.
The JDK 1.1 rendering model is consistent with the
capabilities of most of the existing class of platform
renderers that need to resolve integer coordinates to a
discrete pen that must fall completely on a specified number of pixels.

The Java 2D(tm) (Java(tm) 2 platform) API supports antialiasing renderers.
A pen with a width of one pixel does not need to fall
completely on pixel N as opposed to pixel N+1. The pen can fall
partially on both pixels. It is not necessary to choose a bias
direction for a wide pen since the blending that occurs along the
pen traversal edges makes the sub-pixel position of the pen
visible to the user. On the other hand, when antialiasing is
turned off by setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint key
to the

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_OFF

hint value, the renderer might need
to apply a bias to determine which pixel to modify when the pen
is straddling a pixel boundary, such as when it is drawn
along an integer coordinate in device space. While the capabilities
of an antialiasing renderer make it no longer necessary for the
rendering model to specify a bias for the pen, it is desirable for the
antialiasing and non-antialiasing renderers to perform similarly for
the common cases of drawing one-pixel wide horizontal and vertical
lines on the screen. To ensure that turning on antialiasing by
setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint
key to

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON

does not cause such lines to suddenly become twice as wide and half
as opaque, it is desirable to have the model specify a path for such
lines so that they completely cover a particular set of pixels to help
increase their crispness.

Java 2D API maintains compatibility with JDK 1.1 rendering
behavior, such that legacy operations and existing renderer
behavior is unchanged under Java 2D API. Legacy
methods that map onto general

draw

and

fill

methods are defined, which clearly indicates
how

Graphics2D

extends

Graphics

based
on settings of

Stroke

and

Transform

attributes and rendering hints. The definition
performs identically under default attribute settings.
For example, the default

Stroke

is a

BasicStroke

with a width of 1 and no dashing and the
default Transform for screen drawing is an Identity transform.

The following two rules provide predictable rendering behavior whether
aliasing or antialiasing is being used.

- Device coordinates are defined to be between device pixels which
avoids any inconsistent results between aliased and antialiased
rendering. If coordinates were defined to be at a pixel's center, some
of the pixels covered by a shape, such as a rectangle, would only be
half covered.
With aliased rendering, the half covered pixels would either be
rendered inside the shape or outside the shape. With anti-aliased
rendering, the pixels on the entire edge of the shape would be half
covered. On the other hand, since coordinates are defined to be
between pixels, a shape like a rectangle would have no half covered
pixels, whether or not it is rendered using antialiasing.

Lines and paths stroked using the

BasicStroke

object may be "normalized" to provide consistent rendering of the
outlines when positioned at various points on the drawable and
whether drawn with aliased or antialiased rendering. This
normalization process is controlled by the

KEY_STROKE_CONTROL

hint.
The exact normalization algorithm is not specified, but the goals
of this normalization are to ensure that lines are rendered with
consistent visual appearance regardless of how they fall on the
pixel grid and to promote more solid horizontal and vertical
lines in antialiased mode so that they resemble their non-antialiased
counterparts more closely. A typical normalization step might
promote antialiased line endpoints to pixel centers to reduce the
amount of blending or adjust the subpixel positioning of
non-antialiased lines so that the floating point line widths
round to even or odd pixel counts with equal likelihood. This
process can move endpoints by up to half a pixel (usually towards
positive infinity along both axes) to promote these consistent
results.

The following definitions of general legacy methods
perform identically to previously specified behavior under default
attribute settings:

- For

fill

operations, including

fillRect

,

fillRoundRect

,

fillOval

,

fillArc

,

fillPolygon

, and

clearRect

,

fill

can now be called
with the desired

Shape

. For example, when filling a
rectangle:

```java
fill(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

Similarly, for draw operations, including

drawLine

,

drawRect

,

drawRoundRect

,

drawOval

,

drawArc

,

drawPolyline

,
and

drawPolygon

,

draw

can now be
called with the desired

Shape

. For example, when drawing a
rectangle:

```java
draw(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

The

draw3DRect

and

fill3DRect

methods were
implemented in terms of the

drawLine

and

fillRect

methods in the

Graphics

class which
would predicate their behavior upon the current

Stroke

and

Paint

objects in a

Graphics2D

context.
This class overrides those implementations with versions that use
the current

Color

exclusively, overriding the current

Paint

and which uses

fillRect

to describe
the exact same behavior as the preexisting methods regardless of the
setting of the current

Stroke

.

The

Graphics

class defines only the

setColor

method to control the color to be painted. Since the Java 2D API extends
the

Color

object to implement the new

Paint

interface, the existing

setColor

method is now a convenience method for setting the
current

Paint

attribute to a

Color

object.

setColor(c)

is equivalent to

setPaint(c)

.

The

Graphics

class defines two methods for controlling
how colors are applied to the destination.

- The

setPaintMode

method is implemented as a convenience
method to set the default

Composite

, equivalent to

setComposite(new AlphaComposite.SrcOver)

.

The

setXORMode(Color xorcolor)

method is implemented
as a convenience method to set a special

Composite

object that
ignores the

Alpha

components of source colors and sets the
destination color to the value:

```java
dstpixel = (PixelOf(srccolor) ^ PixelOf(xorcolor) ^ dstpixel);
```

---

#### Coordinate Spaces

Coordinates in device space usually refer to individual device pixels
and are aligned on the infinitely thin gaps between these pixels.
Some

Graphics2D

objects can be used to capture rendering
operations for storage into a graphics metafile for playback on a
concrete device of unknown physical resolution at a later time. Since
the resolution might not be known when the rendering operations are
captured, the

Graphics2D Transform

is set up
to transform user coordinates to a virtual device space that
approximates the expected resolution of the target device. Further
transformations might need to be applied at playback time if the
estimate is incorrect.

Some of the operations performed by the rendering attribute objects
occur in the device space, but all

Graphics2D

methods take
user space coordinates.

Every

Graphics2D

object is associated with a target that
defines where rendering takes place. A

GraphicsConfiguration

object defines the characteristics
of the rendering target, such as pixel format and resolution.
The same rendering target is used throughout the life of a

Graphics2D

object.

When creating a

Graphics2D

object, the

GraphicsConfiguration

specifies the

default transform

for
the target of the

Graphics2D

(a

Component

or

Image

). This default transform maps the
user space coordinate system to screen and printer device coordinates
such that the origin maps to the upper left hand corner of the
target region of the device with increasing X coordinates extending
to the right and increasing Y coordinates extending downward.
The scaling of the default transform is set to identity for those devices
that are close to 72 dpi, such as screen devices.
The scaling of the default transform is set to approximately 72 user
space coordinates per square inch for high resolution devices, such as
printers. For image buffers, the default transform is the

Identity

transform.

Rendering Process

The Rendering Process can be broken down into four phases that are
controlled by the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes.
The renderer can optimize many of these steps, either by caching the
results for future calls, by collapsing multiple virtual steps into
a single operation, or by recognizing various attributes as common
simple cases that can be eliminated by modifying other parts of the
operation.

The steps in the rendering process are:

- Determine what to render.

Constrain the rendering operation to the current

Clip

.
The

Clip

is specified by a

Shape

in user
space and is controlled by the program using the various clip
manipulation methods of

Graphics

and

Graphics2D

. This

user clip

is transformed into device space by the current

Transform

and combined with the

device clip

, which is defined by the visibility of windows and
device extents. The combination of the user clip and device clip
defines the

composite clip

, which determines the final clipping
region. The user clip is not modified by the rendering
system to reflect the resulting composite clip.

Determine what colors to render.

Apply the colors to the destination drawing surface using the current

Composite

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context.

The three types of rendering operations, along with details of each
of their particular rendering processes are:

- Shape

operations

- If the operation is a

draw(Shape)

operation, then
the

createStrokedShape

method on the current

Stroke

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context is used to construct a new

Shape

object that contains the outline of the specified

Shape

.

The

Shape

is transformed from user space to device space
using the current

Transform

in the

Graphics2D

context.

The outline of the

Shape

is extracted using the

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which returns a

PathIterator

object that iterates along the boundary of the

Shape

.

If the

Graphics2D

object cannot handle the curved segments
that the

PathIterator

object returns then it can call the
alternate

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which flattens the

Shape

.

The current

Paint

in the

Graphics2D

context
is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies the
colors to render in device space.

Text operations

- The following steps are used to determine the set of glyphs required
to render the indicated

String

:

- If the argument is a

String

, then the current

Font

in the

Graphics2D

context is asked to
convert the Unicode characters in the

String

into a set of
glyphs for presentation with whatever basic layout and shaping
algorithms the font implements.

If the argument is an

AttributedCharacterIterator

,
the iterator is asked to convert itself to a

TextLayout

using its embedded font attributes. The

TextLayout

implements more sophisticated glyph layout algorithms that
perform Unicode bi-directional layout adjustments automatically
for multiple fonts of differing writing directions.

If the argument is a

GlyphVector

, then the

GlyphVector

object already contains the appropriate
font-specific glyph codes with explicit coordinates for the position of
each glyph.

The current

Font

is queried to obtain outlines for the
indicated glyphs. These outlines are treated as shapes in user space
relative to the position of each glyph that was determined in step 1.

The character outlines are filled as indicated above
under

Shape

operations

.

The current

Paint

is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies
the colors to render in device space.

Image

Operations

- The region of interest is defined by the bounding box of the source

Image

.
This bounding box is specified in Image Space, which is the

Image

object's local coordinate system.

If an

AffineTransform

is passed to

drawImage(Image, AffineTransform, ImageObserver)

,
the

AffineTransform

is used to transform the bounding
box from image space to user space. If no

AffineTransform

is supplied, the bounding box is treated as if it is already in user space.

The bounding box of the source

Image

is transformed from user
space into device space using the current

Transform

.
Note that the result of transforming the bounding box does not
necessarily result in a rectangular region in device space.

The

Image

object determines what colors to render,
sampled according to the source to destination
coordinate mapping specified by the current

Transform

and the
optional image transform.

Default Rendering Attributes

The default values for the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes are:

Rendering Compatibility Issues

The JDK(tm) 1.1 rendering model is based on a pixelization model
that specifies that coordinates
are infinitely thin, lying between the pixels. Drawing operations are
performed using a one-pixel wide pen that fills the
pixel below and to the right of the anchor point on the path.
The JDK 1.1 rendering model is consistent with the
capabilities of most of the existing class of platform
renderers that need to resolve integer coordinates to a
discrete pen that must fall completely on a specified number of pixels.

The Java 2D(tm) (Java(tm) 2 platform) API supports antialiasing renderers.
A pen with a width of one pixel does not need to fall
completely on pixel N as opposed to pixel N+1. The pen can fall
partially on both pixels. It is not necessary to choose a bias
direction for a wide pen since the blending that occurs along the
pen traversal edges makes the sub-pixel position of the pen
visible to the user. On the other hand, when antialiasing is
turned off by setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint key
to the

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_OFF

hint value, the renderer might need
to apply a bias to determine which pixel to modify when the pen
is straddling a pixel boundary, such as when it is drawn
along an integer coordinate in device space. While the capabilities
of an antialiasing renderer make it no longer necessary for the
rendering model to specify a bias for the pen, it is desirable for the
antialiasing and non-antialiasing renderers to perform similarly for
the common cases of drawing one-pixel wide horizontal and vertical
lines on the screen. To ensure that turning on antialiasing by
setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint
key to

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON

does not cause such lines to suddenly become twice as wide and half
as opaque, it is desirable to have the model specify a path for such
lines so that they completely cover a particular set of pixels to help
increase their crispness.

Java 2D API maintains compatibility with JDK 1.1 rendering
behavior, such that legacy operations and existing renderer
behavior is unchanged under Java 2D API. Legacy
methods that map onto general

draw

and

fill

methods are defined, which clearly indicates
how

Graphics2D

extends

Graphics

based
on settings of

Stroke

and

Transform

attributes and rendering hints. The definition
performs identically under default attribute settings.
For example, the default

Stroke

is a

BasicStroke

with a width of 1 and no dashing and the
default Transform for screen drawing is an Identity transform.

The following two rules provide predictable rendering behavior whether
aliasing or antialiasing is being used.

- Device coordinates are defined to be between device pixels which
avoids any inconsistent results between aliased and antialiased
rendering. If coordinates were defined to be at a pixel's center, some
of the pixels covered by a shape, such as a rectangle, would only be
half covered.
With aliased rendering, the half covered pixels would either be
rendered inside the shape or outside the shape. With anti-aliased
rendering, the pixels on the entire edge of the shape would be half
covered. On the other hand, since coordinates are defined to be
between pixels, a shape like a rectangle would have no half covered
pixels, whether or not it is rendered using antialiasing.

Lines and paths stroked using the

BasicStroke

object may be "normalized" to provide consistent rendering of the
outlines when positioned at various points on the drawable and
whether drawn with aliased or antialiased rendering. This
normalization process is controlled by the

KEY_STROKE_CONTROL

hint.
The exact normalization algorithm is not specified, but the goals
of this normalization are to ensure that lines are rendered with
consistent visual appearance regardless of how they fall on the
pixel grid and to promote more solid horizontal and vertical
lines in antialiased mode so that they resemble their non-antialiased
counterparts more closely. A typical normalization step might
promote antialiased line endpoints to pixel centers to reduce the
amount of blending or adjust the subpixel positioning of
non-antialiased lines so that the floating point line widths
round to even or odd pixel counts with equal likelihood. This
process can move endpoints by up to half a pixel (usually towards
positive infinity along both axes) to promote these consistent
results.

The following definitions of general legacy methods
perform identically to previously specified behavior under default
attribute settings:

- For

fill

operations, including

fillRect

,

fillRoundRect

,

fillOval

,

fillArc

,

fillPolygon

, and

clearRect

,

fill

can now be called
with the desired

Shape

. For example, when filling a
rectangle:

```java
fill(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

Similarly, for draw operations, including

drawLine

,

drawRect

,

drawRoundRect

,

drawOval

,

drawArc

,

drawPolyline

,
and

drawPolygon

,

draw

can now be
called with the desired

Shape

. For example, when drawing a
rectangle:

```java
draw(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

The

draw3DRect

and

fill3DRect

methods were
implemented in terms of the

drawLine

and

fillRect

methods in the

Graphics

class which
would predicate their behavior upon the current

Stroke

and

Paint

objects in a

Graphics2D

context.
This class overrides those implementations with versions that use
the current

Color

exclusively, overriding the current

Paint

and which uses

fillRect

to describe
the exact same behavior as the preexisting methods regardless of the
setting of the current

Stroke

.

The

Graphics

class defines only the

setColor

method to control the color to be painted. Since the Java 2D API extends
the

Color

object to implement the new

Paint

interface, the existing

setColor

method is now a convenience method for setting the
current

Paint

attribute to a

Color

object.

setColor(c)

is equivalent to

setPaint(c)

.

The

Graphics

class defines two methods for controlling
how colors are applied to the destination.

- The

setPaintMode

method is implemented as a convenience
method to set the default

Composite

, equivalent to

setComposite(new AlphaComposite.SrcOver)

.

The

setXORMode(Color xorcolor)

method is implemented
as a convenience method to set a special

Composite

object that
ignores the

Alpha

components of source colors and sets the
destination color to the value:

```java
dstpixel = (PixelOf(srccolor) ^ PixelOf(xorcolor) ^ dstpixel);
```

Some of the operations performed by the rendering attribute objects
occur in the device space, but all

Graphics2D

methods take
user space coordinates.

Every

Graphics2D

object is associated with a target that
defines where rendering takes place. A

GraphicsConfiguration

object defines the characteristics
of the rendering target, such as pixel format and resolution.
The same rendering target is used throughout the life of a

Graphics2D

object.

When creating a

Graphics2D

object, the

GraphicsConfiguration

specifies the

default transform

for
the target of the

Graphics2D

(a

Component

or

Image

). This default transform maps the
user space coordinate system to screen and printer device coordinates
such that the origin maps to the upper left hand corner of the
target region of the device with increasing X coordinates extending
to the right and increasing Y coordinates extending downward.
The scaling of the default transform is set to identity for those devices
that are close to 72 dpi, such as screen devices.
The scaling of the default transform is set to approximately 72 user
space coordinates per square inch for high resolution devices, such as
printers. For image buffers, the default transform is the

Identity

transform.

Rendering Process

The Rendering Process can be broken down into four phases that are
controlled by the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes.
The renderer can optimize many of these steps, either by caching the
results for future calls, by collapsing multiple virtual steps into
a single operation, or by recognizing various attributes as common
simple cases that can be eliminated by modifying other parts of the
operation.

The steps in the rendering process are:

- Determine what to render.

Constrain the rendering operation to the current

Clip

.
The

Clip

is specified by a

Shape

in user
space and is controlled by the program using the various clip
manipulation methods of

Graphics

and

Graphics2D

. This

user clip

is transformed into device space by the current

Transform

and combined with the

device clip

, which is defined by the visibility of windows and
device extents. The combination of the user clip and device clip
defines the

composite clip

, which determines the final clipping
region. The user clip is not modified by the rendering
system to reflect the resulting composite clip.

Determine what colors to render.

Apply the colors to the destination drawing surface using the current

Composite

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context.

The three types of rendering operations, along with details of each
of their particular rendering processes are:

- Shape

operations

- If the operation is a

draw(Shape)

operation, then
the

createStrokedShape

method on the current

Stroke

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context is used to construct a new

Shape

object that contains the outline of the specified

Shape

.

The

Shape

is transformed from user space to device space
using the current

Transform

in the

Graphics2D

context.

The outline of the

Shape

is extracted using the

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which returns a

PathIterator

object that iterates along the boundary of the

Shape

.

If the

Graphics2D

object cannot handle the curved segments
that the

PathIterator

object returns then it can call the
alternate

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which flattens the

Shape

.

The current

Paint

in the

Graphics2D

context
is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies the
colors to render in device space.

Text operations

- The following steps are used to determine the set of glyphs required
to render the indicated

String

:

- If the argument is a

String

, then the current

Font

in the

Graphics2D

context is asked to
convert the Unicode characters in the

String

into a set of
glyphs for presentation with whatever basic layout and shaping
algorithms the font implements.

If the argument is an

AttributedCharacterIterator

,
the iterator is asked to convert itself to a

TextLayout

using its embedded font attributes. The

TextLayout

implements more sophisticated glyph layout algorithms that
perform Unicode bi-directional layout adjustments automatically
for multiple fonts of differing writing directions.

If the argument is a

GlyphVector

, then the

GlyphVector

object already contains the appropriate
font-specific glyph codes with explicit coordinates for the position of
each glyph.

The current

Font

is queried to obtain outlines for the
indicated glyphs. These outlines are treated as shapes in user space
relative to the position of each glyph that was determined in step 1.

The character outlines are filled as indicated above
under

Shape

operations

.

The current

Paint

is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies
the colors to render in device space.

Image

Operations

- The region of interest is defined by the bounding box of the source

Image

.
This bounding box is specified in Image Space, which is the

Image

object's local coordinate system.

If an

AffineTransform

is passed to

drawImage(Image, AffineTransform, ImageObserver)

,
the

AffineTransform

is used to transform the bounding
box from image space to user space. If no

AffineTransform

is supplied, the bounding box is treated as if it is already in user space.

The bounding box of the source

Image

is transformed from user
space into device space using the current

Transform

.
Note that the result of transforming the bounding box does not
necessarily result in a rectangular region in device space.

The

Image

object determines what colors to render,
sampled according to the source to destination
coordinate mapping specified by the current

Transform

and the
optional image transform.

Default Rendering Attributes

rendering attributes are:

Rendering Compatibility Issues

The JDK(tm) 1.1 rendering model is based on a pixelization model
that specifies that coordinates
are infinitely thin, lying between the pixels. Drawing operations are
performed using a one-pixel wide pen that fills the
pixel below and to the right of the anchor point on the path.
The JDK 1.1 rendering model is consistent with the
capabilities of most of the existing class of platform
renderers that need to resolve integer coordinates to a
discrete pen that must fall completely on a specified number of pixels.

The Java 2D(tm) (Java(tm) 2 platform) API supports antialiasing renderers.
A pen with a width of one pixel does not need to fall
completely on pixel N as opposed to pixel N+1. The pen can fall
partially on both pixels. It is not necessary to choose a bias
direction for a wide pen since the blending that occurs along the
pen traversal edges makes the sub-pixel position of the pen
visible to the user. On the other hand, when antialiasing is
turned off by setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint key
to the

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_OFF

hint value, the renderer might need
to apply a bias to determine which pixel to modify when the pen
is straddling a pixel boundary, such as when it is drawn
along an integer coordinate in device space. While the capabilities
of an antialiasing renderer make it no longer necessary for the
rendering model to specify a bias for the pen, it is desirable for the
antialiasing and non-antialiasing renderers to perform similarly for
the common cases of drawing one-pixel wide horizontal and vertical
lines on the screen. To ensure that turning on antialiasing by
setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint
key to

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON

does not cause such lines to suddenly become twice as wide and half
as opaque, it is desirable to have the model specify a path for such
lines so that they completely cover a particular set of pixels to help
increase their crispness.

Java 2D API maintains compatibility with JDK 1.1 rendering
behavior, such that legacy operations and existing renderer
behavior is unchanged under Java 2D API. Legacy
methods that map onto general

draw

and

fill

methods are defined, which clearly indicates
how

Graphics2D

extends

Graphics

based
on settings of

Stroke

and

Transform

attributes and rendering hints. The definition
performs identically under default attribute settings.
For example, the default

Stroke

is a

BasicStroke

with a width of 1 and no dashing and the
default Transform for screen drawing is an Identity transform.

The following two rules provide predictable rendering behavior whether
aliasing or antialiasing is being used.

- Device coordinates are defined to be between device pixels which
avoids any inconsistent results between aliased and antialiased
rendering. If coordinates were defined to be at a pixel's center, some
of the pixels covered by a shape, such as a rectangle, would only be
half covered.
With aliased rendering, the half covered pixels would either be
rendered inside the shape or outside the shape. With anti-aliased
rendering, the pixels on the entire edge of the shape would be half
covered. On the other hand, since coordinates are defined to be
between pixels, a shape like a rectangle would have no half covered
pixels, whether or not it is rendered using antialiasing.

Lines and paths stroked using the

BasicStroke

object may be "normalized" to provide consistent rendering of the
outlines when positioned at various points on the drawable and
whether drawn with aliased or antialiased rendering. This
normalization process is controlled by the

KEY_STROKE_CONTROL

hint.
The exact normalization algorithm is not specified, but the goals
of this normalization are to ensure that lines are rendered with
consistent visual appearance regardless of how they fall on the
pixel grid and to promote more solid horizontal and vertical
lines in antialiased mode so that they resemble their non-antialiased
counterparts more closely. A typical normalization step might
promote antialiased line endpoints to pixel centers to reduce the
amount of blending or adjust the subpixel positioning of
non-antialiased lines so that the floating point line widths
round to even or odd pixel counts with equal likelihood. This
process can move endpoints by up to half a pixel (usually towards
positive infinity along both axes) to promote these consistent
results.

The following definitions of general legacy methods
perform identically to previously specified behavior under default
attribute settings:

- For

fill

operations, including

fillRect

,

fillRoundRect

,

fillOval

,

fillArc

,

fillPolygon

, and

clearRect

,

fill

can now be called
with the desired

Shape

. For example, when filling a
rectangle:

```java
fill(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

Similarly, for draw operations, including

drawLine

,

drawRect

,

drawRoundRect

,

drawOval

,

drawArc

,

drawPolyline

,
and

drawPolygon

,

draw

can now be
called with the desired

Shape

. For example, when drawing a
rectangle:

```java
draw(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

The

draw3DRect

and

fill3DRect

methods were
implemented in terms of the

drawLine

and

fillRect

methods in the

Graphics

class which
would predicate their behavior upon the current

Stroke

and

Paint

objects in a

Graphics2D

context.
This class overrides those implementations with versions that use
the current

Color

exclusively, overriding the current

Paint

and which uses

fillRect

to describe
the exact same behavior as the preexisting methods regardless of the
setting of the current

Stroke

.

The

Graphics

class defines only the

setColor

method to control the color to be painted. Since the Java 2D API extends
the

Color

object to implement the new

Paint

interface, the existing

setColor

method is now a convenience method for setting the
current

Paint

attribute to a

Color

object.

setColor(c)

is equivalent to

setPaint(c)

.

The

Graphics

class defines two methods for controlling
how colors are applied to the destination.

- The

setPaintMode

method is implemented as a convenience
method to set the default

Composite

, equivalent to

setComposite(new AlphaComposite.SrcOver)

.

The

setXORMode(Color xorcolor)

method is implemented
as a convenience method to set a special

Composite

object that
ignores the

Alpha

components of source colors and sets the
destination color to the value:

```java
dstpixel = (PixelOf(srccolor) ^ PixelOf(xorcolor) ^ dstpixel);
```

Every

Graphics2D

object is associated with a target that
defines where rendering takes place. A

GraphicsConfiguration

object defines the characteristics
of the rendering target, such as pixel format and resolution.
The same rendering target is used throughout the life of a

Graphics2D

object.

When creating a

Graphics2D

object, the

GraphicsConfiguration

specifies the

default transform

for
the target of the

Graphics2D

(a

Component

or

Image

). This default transform maps the
user space coordinate system to screen and printer device coordinates
such that the origin maps to the upper left hand corner of the
target region of the device with increasing X coordinates extending
to the right and increasing Y coordinates extending downward.
The scaling of the default transform is set to identity for those devices
that are close to 72 dpi, such as screen devices.
The scaling of the default transform is set to approximately 72 user
space coordinates per square inch for high resolution devices, such as
printers. For image buffers, the default transform is the

Identity

transform.

Rendering Process

The Rendering Process can be broken down into four phases that are
controlled by the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes.
The renderer can optimize many of these steps, either by caching the
results for future calls, by collapsing multiple virtual steps into
a single operation, or by recognizing various attributes as common
simple cases that can be eliminated by modifying other parts of the
operation.

The steps in the rendering process are:

- Determine what to render.

Constrain the rendering operation to the current

Clip

.
The

Clip

is specified by a

Shape

in user
space and is controlled by the program using the various clip
manipulation methods of

Graphics

and

Graphics2D

. This

user clip

is transformed into device space by the current

Transform

and combined with the

device clip

, which is defined by the visibility of windows and
device extents. The combination of the user clip and device clip
defines the

composite clip

, which determines the final clipping
region. The user clip is not modified by the rendering
system to reflect the resulting composite clip.

Determine what colors to render.

Apply the colors to the destination drawing surface using the current

Composite

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context.

The three types of rendering operations, along with details of each
of their particular rendering processes are:

- Shape

operations

- If the operation is a

draw(Shape)

operation, then
the

createStrokedShape

method on the current

Stroke

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context is used to construct a new

Shape

object that contains the outline of the specified

Shape

.

The

Shape

is transformed from user space to device space
using the current

Transform

in the

Graphics2D

context.

The outline of the

Shape

is extracted using the

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which returns a

PathIterator

object that iterates along the boundary of the

Shape

.

If the

Graphics2D

object cannot handle the curved segments
that the

PathIterator

object returns then it can call the
alternate

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which flattens the

Shape

.

The current

Paint

in the

Graphics2D

context
is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies the
colors to render in device space.

Text operations

- The following steps are used to determine the set of glyphs required
to render the indicated

String

:

- If the argument is a

String

, then the current

Font

in the

Graphics2D

context is asked to
convert the Unicode characters in the

String

into a set of
glyphs for presentation with whatever basic layout and shaping
algorithms the font implements.

If the argument is an

AttributedCharacterIterator

,
the iterator is asked to convert itself to a

TextLayout

using its embedded font attributes. The

TextLayout

implements more sophisticated glyph layout algorithms that
perform Unicode bi-directional layout adjustments automatically
for multiple fonts of differing writing directions.

If the argument is a

GlyphVector

, then the

GlyphVector

object already contains the appropriate
font-specific glyph codes with explicit coordinates for the position of
each glyph.

The current

Font

is queried to obtain outlines for the
indicated glyphs. These outlines are treated as shapes in user space
relative to the position of each glyph that was determined in step 1.

The character outlines are filled as indicated above
under

Shape

operations

.

The current

Paint

is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies
the colors to render in device space.

Image

Operations

- The region of interest is defined by the bounding box of the source

Image

.
This bounding box is specified in Image Space, which is the

Image

object's local coordinate system.

If an

AffineTransform

is passed to

drawImage(Image, AffineTransform, ImageObserver)

,
the

AffineTransform

is used to transform the bounding
box from image space to user space. If no

AffineTransform

is supplied, the bounding box is treated as if it is already in user space.

The bounding box of the source

Image

is transformed from user
space into device space using the current

Transform

.
Note that the result of transforming the bounding box does not
necessarily result in a rectangular region in device space.

The

Image

object determines what colors to render,
sampled according to the source to destination
coordinate mapping specified by the current

Transform

and the
optional image transform.

class defines two methods for controlling
how colors are applied to the destination.

- The

setPaintMode

method is implemented as a convenience
method to set the default

, equivalent to

setComposite(new AlphaComposite.SrcOver)

.

The

method is implemented
as a convenience method to set a special

object that
ignores the

Alpha

components of source colors and sets the
destination color to the value:

dstpixel = (PixelOf(srccolor) ^ PixelOf(xorcolor) ^ dstpixel);
```

---

#### Rendering Process

The steps in the rendering process are:

- Determine what to render.

Constrain the rendering operation to the current

Clip

.
The

Clip

is specified by a

Shape

in user
space and is controlled by the program using the various clip
manipulation methods of

Graphics

and

Graphics2D

. This

user clip

is transformed into device space by the current

Transform

and combined with the

device clip

, which is defined by the visibility of windows and
device extents. The combination of the user clip and device clip
defines the

composite clip

, which determines the final clipping
region. The user clip is not modified by the rendering
system to reflect the resulting composite clip.

Determine what colors to render.

Apply the colors to the destination drawing surface using the current

Composite

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context.

The three types of rendering operations, along with details of each
of their particular rendering processes are:

- Shape

operations

- If the operation is a

draw(Shape)

operation, then
the

createStrokedShape

method on the current

Stroke

attribute in the

Graphics2D

context is used to construct a new

Shape

object that contains the outline of the specified

Shape

.

The

Shape

is transformed from user space to device space
using the current

Transform

in the

Graphics2D

context.

The outline of the

Shape

is extracted using the

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which returns a

PathIterator

object that iterates along the boundary of the

Shape

.

If the

Graphics2D

object cannot handle the curved segments
that the

PathIterator

object returns then it can call the
alternate

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which flattens the

Shape

.

The current

Paint

in the

Graphics2D

context
is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies the
colors to render in device space.

Text operations

- The following steps are used to determine the set of glyphs required
to render the indicated

String

:

- If the argument is a

String

, then the current

Font

in the

Graphics2D

context is asked to
convert the Unicode characters in the

String

into a set of
glyphs for presentation with whatever basic layout and shaping
algorithms the font implements.

If the argument is an

AttributedCharacterIterator

,
the iterator is asked to convert itself to a

TextLayout

using its embedded font attributes. The

TextLayout

implements more sophisticated glyph layout algorithms that
perform Unicode bi-directional layout adjustments automatically
for multiple fonts of differing writing directions.

If the argument is a

GlyphVector

, then the

GlyphVector

object already contains the appropriate
font-specific glyph codes with explicit coordinates for the position of
each glyph.

The current

Font

is queried to obtain outlines for the
indicated glyphs. These outlines are treated as shapes in user space
relative to the position of each glyph that was determined in step 1.

The character outlines are filled as indicated above
under

Shape

operations

.

The current

Paint

is queried for a

PaintContext

, which specifies
the colors to render in device space.

Image

Operations

- The region of interest is defined by the bounding box of the source

Image

.
This bounding box is specified in Image Space, which is the

Image

object's local coordinate system.

If an

AffineTransform

is passed to

drawImage(Image, AffineTransform, ImageObserver)

,
the

AffineTransform

is used to transform the bounding
box from image space to user space. If no

AffineTransform

is supplied, the bounding box is treated as if it is already in user space.

The bounding box of the source

Image

is transformed from user
space into device space using the current

Transform

.
Note that the result of transforming the bounding box does not
necessarily result in a rectangular region in device space.

The

Image

object determines what colors to render,
sampled according to the source to destination
coordinate mapping specified by the current

Transform

and the
optional image transform.

Default Rendering Attributes

The default values for the

Graphics2D

rendering attributes are:

Rendering Compatibility Issues

The JDK(tm) 1.1 rendering model is based on a pixelization model
that specifies that coordinates
are infinitely thin, lying between the pixels. Drawing operations are
performed using a one-pixel wide pen that fills the
pixel below and to the right of the anchor point on the path.
The JDK 1.1 rendering model is consistent with the
capabilities of most of the existing class of platform
renderers that need to resolve integer coordinates to a
discrete pen that must fall completely on a specified number of pixels.

The Java 2D(tm) (Java(tm) 2 platform) API supports antialiasing renderers.
A pen with a width of one pixel does not need to fall
completely on pixel N as opposed to pixel N+1. The pen can fall
partially on both pixels. It is not necessary to choose a bias
direction for a wide pen since the blending that occurs along the
pen traversal edges makes the sub-pixel position of the pen
visible to the user. On the other hand, when antialiasing is
turned off by setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint key
to the

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_OFF

hint value, the renderer might need
to apply a bias to determine which pixel to modify when the pen
is straddling a pixel boundary, such as when it is drawn
along an integer coordinate in device space. While the capabilities
of an antialiasing renderer make it no longer necessary for the
rendering model to specify a bias for the pen, it is desirable for the
antialiasing and non-antialiasing renderers to perform similarly for
the common cases of drawing one-pixel wide horizontal and vertical
lines on the screen. To ensure that turning on antialiasing by
setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint
key to

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON

does not cause such lines to suddenly become twice as wide and half
as opaque, it is desirable to have the model specify a path for such
lines so that they completely cover a particular set of pixels to help
increase their crispness.

Java 2D API maintains compatibility with JDK 1.1 rendering
behavior, such that legacy operations and existing renderer
behavior is unchanged under Java 2D API. Legacy
methods that map onto general

draw

and

fill

methods are defined, which clearly indicates
how

Graphics2D

extends

Graphics

based
on settings of

Stroke

and

Transform

attributes and rendering hints. The definition
performs identically under default attribute settings.
For example, the default

Stroke

is a

BasicStroke

with a width of 1 and no dashing and the
default Transform for screen drawing is an Identity transform.

The following two rules provide predictable rendering behavior whether
aliasing or antialiasing is being used.

- Device coordinates are defined to be between device pixels which
avoids any inconsistent results between aliased and antialiased
rendering. If coordinates were defined to be at a pixel's center, some
of the pixels covered by a shape, such as a rectangle, would only be
half covered.
With aliased rendering, the half covered pixels would either be
rendered inside the shape or outside the shape. With anti-aliased
rendering, the pixels on the entire edge of the shape would be half
covered. On the other hand, since coordinates are defined to be
between pixels, a shape like a rectangle would have no half covered
pixels, whether or not it is rendered using antialiasing.

Lines and paths stroked using the

BasicStroke

object may be "normalized" to provide consistent rendering of the
outlines when positioned at various points on the drawable and
whether drawn with aliased or antialiased rendering. This
normalization process is controlled by the

KEY_STROKE_CONTROL

hint.
The exact normalization algorithm is not specified, but the goals
of this normalization are to ensure that lines are rendered with
consistent visual appearance regardless of how they fall on the
pixel grid and to promote more solid horizontal and vertical
lines in antialiased mode so that they resemble their non-antialiased
counterparts more closely. A typical normalization step might
promote antialiased line endpoints to pixel centers to reduce the
amount of blending or adjust the subpixel positioning of
non-antialiased lines so that the floating point line widths
round to even or odd pixel counts with equal likelihood. This
process can move endpoints by up to half a pixel (usually towards
positive infinity along both axes) to promote these consistent
results.

The following definitions of general legacy methods
perform identically to previously specified behavior under default
attribute settings:

- For

fill

operations, including

fillRect

,

fillRoundRect

,

fillOval

,

fillArc

,

fillPolygon

, and

clearRect

,

fill

can now be called
with the desired

Shape

. For example, when filling a
rectangle:

```java
fill(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

Similarly, for draw operations, including

drawLine

,

drawRect

,

drawRoundRect

,

drawOval

,

drawArc

,

drawPolyline

,
and

drawPolygon

,

draw

can now be
called with the desired

Shape

. For example, when drawing a
rectangle:

```java
draw(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

The

draw3DRect

and

fill3DRect

methods were
implemented in terms of the

drawLine

and

fillRect

methods in the

Graphics

class which
would predicate their behavior upon the current

Stroke

and

Paint

objects in a

Graphics2D

context.
This class overrides those implementations with versions that use
the current

Color

exclusively, overriding the current

Paint

and which uses

fillRect

to describe
the exact same behavior as the preexisting methods regardless of the
setting of the current

Stroke

.

The

Graphics

class defines only the

setColor

method to control the color to be painted. Since the Java 2D API extends
the

Color

object to implement the new

Paint

interface, the existing

setColor

method is now a convenience method for setting the
current

Paint

attribute to a

Color

object.

setColor(c)

is equivalent to

setPaint(c)

.

The

Graphics

class defines two methods for controlling
how colors are applied to the destination.

- The

setPaintMode

method is implemented as a convenience
method to set the default

Composite

, equivalent to

setComposite(new AlphaComposite.SrcOver)

.

The

setXORMode(Color xorcolor)

method is implemented
as a convenience method to set a special

Composite

object that
ignores the

Alpha

components of source colors and sets the
destination color to the value:

```java
dstpixel = (PixelOf(srccolor) ^ PixelOf(xorcolor) ^ dstpixel);
```

Determine what to render.

Constrain the rendering operation to the current

Clip

.
The

Clip

is specified by a

Shape

in user
space and is controlled by the program using the various clip
manipulation methods of

Graphics

and

Graphics2D

. This

user clip

is transformed into device space by the current

Transform

and combined with the

device clip

, which is defined by the visibility of windows and
device extents. The combination of the user clip and device clip
defines the

composite clip

, which determines the final clipping
region. The user clip is not modified by the rendering
system to reflect the resulting composite clip.

Determine what colors to render.

Apply the colors to the destination drawing surface using the current

Composite

Graphics2D

context.

Shape

operations

- If the operation is a

operation, then
the

createStrokedShape

method on the current

Shape

.

The

Shape

is transformed from user space to device space
using the current

in the

Graphics2D

context.

The outline of the

Shape

is extracted using the

getPathIterator

method of

Shape

, which returns a

#### Rendering Compatibility Issues

The Java 2D(tm) (Java(tm) 2 platform) API supports antialiasing renderers.
A pen with a width of one pixel does not need to fall
completely on pixel N as opposed to pixel N+1. The pen can fall
partially on both pixels. It is not necessary to choose a bias
direction for a wide pen since the blending that occurs along the
pen traversal edges makes the sub-pixel position of the pen
visible to the user. On the other hand, when antialiasing is
turned off by setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint key
to the

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_OFF

hint value, the renderer might need
to apply a bias to determine which pixel to modify when the pen
is straddling a pixel boundary, such as when it is drawn
along an integer coordinate in device space. While the capabilities
of an antialiasing renderer make it no longer necessary for the
rendering model to specify a bias for the pen, it is desirable for the
antialiasing and non-antialiasing renderers to perform similarly for
the common cases of drawing one-pixel wide horizontal and vertical
lines on the screen. To ensure that turning on antialiasing by
setting the

KEY_ANTIALIASING

hint
key to

VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON

does not cause such lines to suddenly become twice as wide and half
as opaque, it is desirable to have the model specify a path for such
lines so that they completely cover a particular set of pixels to help
increase their crispness.

KEY_STROKE_CONTROL

hint.
The exact normalization algorithm is not specified, but the goals
of this normalization are to ensure that lines are rendered with
consistent visual appearance regardless of how they fall on the
pixel grid and to promote more solid horizontal and vertical
lines in antialiased mode so that they resemble their non-antialiased
counterparts more closely. A typical normalization step might
promote antialiased line endpoints to pixel centers to reduce the
amount of blending or adjust the subpixel positioning of
non-antialiased lines so that the floating point line widths
round to even or odd pixel counts with equal likelihood. This
process can move endpoints by up to half a pixel (usually towards
positive infinity along both axes) to promote these consistent
results.

The following definitions of general legacy methods
perform identically to previously specified behavior under default
attribute settings:

- For

fill

operations, including

fillRect

,

fillRoundRect

,

fillOval

,

fillArc

,

fillPolygon

, and

clearRect

,

fill

can now be called
with the desired

Shape

. For example, when filling a
rectangle:

```java
fill(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

Similarly, for draw operations, including

drawLine

,

drawRect

,

drawRoundRect

,

drawOval

,

drawArc

,

drawPolyline

,
and

drawPolygon

,

draw

can now be
called with the desired

Shape

. For example, when drawing a
rectangle:

```java
draw(new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
```

is called.

The

draw3DRect

and

fill3DRect

methods were
implemented in terms of the

drawLine

and

fillRect

methods in the

Graphics

class which
would predicate their behavior upon the current

Stroke

and

Paint

objects in a

Graphics2D

context.
This class overrides those implementations with versions that use
the current

Color

exclusively, overriding the current

Paint

and which uses

fillRect

to describe
the exact same behavior as the preexisting methods regardless of the
setting of the current

Stroke

.

The

Graphics

class defines only the

setColor

method to control the color to be painted. Since the Java 2D API extends
the

Color

object to implement the new

Paint

interface, the existing

setColor

method is now a convenience method for setting the
current

Paint

attribute to a

Color

object.

setColor(c)

is equivalent to

setPaint(c)

.

The

Graphics

class defines two methods for controlling
how colors are applied to the destination.

- The

setPaintMode

method is implemented as a convenience
method to set the default

Composite

, equivalent to

setComposite(new AlphaComposite.SrcOver)

.

The

setXORMode(Color xorcolor)

method is implemented
as a convenience method to set a special

Composite

object that
ignores the

Alpha

components of source colors and sets the
destination color to the value:

```java
dstpixel = (PixelOf(srccolor) ^ PixelOf(xorcolor) ^ dstpixel);
```

Device coordinates are defined to be between device pixels which
avoids any inconsistent results between aliased and antialiased
rendering. If coordinates were defined to be at a pixel's center, some
of the pixels covered by a shape, such as a rectangle, would only be
half covered.
With aliased rendering, the half covered pixels would either be
rendered inside the shape or outside the shape. With anti-aliased
rendering, the pixels on the entire edge of the shape would be half
covered. On the other hand, since coordinates are defined to be
between pixels, a shape like a rectangle would have no half covered
pixels, whether or not it is rendered using antialiasing.

Lines and paths stroked using the

BasicStroke

object may be "normalized" to provide consistent rendering of the
outlines when positioned at various points on the drawable and
whether drawn with aliased or antialiased rendering. This
normalization process is controlled by the

KEY_STROKE_CONTROL

hint.
The exact normalization algorithm is not specified, but the goals
of this normalization are to ensure that lines are rendered with
consistent visual appearance regardless of how they fall on the
pixel grid and to promote more solid horizontal and vertical
lines in antialiased mode so that they resemble their non-antialiased
counterparts more closely. A typical normalization step might
promote antialiased line endpoints to pixel centers to reduce the
amount of blending or adjust the subpixel positioning of
non-antialiased lines so that the floating point line widths
round to even or odd pixel counts with equal likelihood. This
process can move endpoints by up to half a pixel (usually towards
positive infinity along both axes) to promote these consistent
results.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- Graphics2D

```java
protected Graphics2D()
```

Constructs a new

Graphics2D

object. Since

Graphics2D

is an abstract class, and since it must be
customized by subclasses for different output devices,

Graphics2D

objects cannot be created directly.
Instead,

Graphics2D

objects must be obtained from another

Graphics2D

object, created by a

Component

, or obtained from images such as

BufferedImage

objects.

x axis toward the positive y axis.

**Parameters:** theta

- the angle of rotation in radians

- rotate

```java
public abstract void rotate​(double theta,
double x,
double y)
```

Concatenates the current

Graphics2D

Transform

with a translated rotation
transform. Subsequent rendering is transformed by a transform
which is constructed by translating to the specified location,
rotating by the specified radians, and translating back by the same
amount as the original translation. This is equivalent to the
following sequence of calls:

```java
translate(x, y);
rotate(theta);
translate(-x, -y);
```

Rotating with a positive angle theta rotates points on the positive
x axis toward the positive y axis.

**Parameters:** theta

- the angle of rotation in radians

AffineTransform

represented by the following matrix:

```java
[ sx 0 0 ]
[ 0 sy 0 ]
[ 0 0 1 ]
```

**Parameters:** sx

Graphics2D

Transform

with a shearing transform.
Subsequent renderings are sheared by the specified
multiplier relative to the previous position.
This is equivalent to calling

transform(SH)

, where SH
is an

AffineTransform

represented by the following
matrix:

```java
[ 1 shx 0 ]
[ shy 1 0 ]
[ 0 0 1 ]
```

the positive X axis direction as a function of their Y coordinate
**Parameters:** shy

- the multiplier by which coordinates are shifted in
the positive Y axis direction as a function of their X coordinate

- transform

```java
public abstract void transform​(
AffineTransform
Tx)
```

Composes an

AffineTransform

object with the

Transform

in this

Graphics2D

according
to the rule last-specified-first-applied. If the current

Transform

is Cx, the result of composition
with Tx is a new

Transform

Cx'. Cx' becomes the
current

Transform

for this

Graphics2D

.
Transforming a point p by the updated

Transform

Cx' is
equivalent to first transforming p by Tx and then transforming
the result by the original

Transform

Cx. In other
words, Cx'(p) = Cx(Tx(p)). A copy of the Tx is made, if necessary,
so further modifications to Tx do not affect rendering.

**Parameters:** Tx

- the

AffineTransform

object to be composed with
the current

**See Also:** setTransform(java.awt.geom.AffineTransform)

,

AffineTransform

- setTransform

```java
public abstract void setTransform​(
AffineTransform
Tx)
```

Overwrites the Transform in the

Graphics2D

context.
WARNING: This method should

never

be used to apply a new
coordinate transform on top of an existing transform because the

Graphics2D

might already have a transform that is
needed for other purposes, such as rendering Swing
components or applying a scaling transformation to adjust for the
resolution of a printer.

To add a coordinate transform, use the

transform

,

rotate

,

scale

,
or

shear

methods. The

setTransform

method is intended only for restoring the original

Graphics2D

transform after rendering, as shown in this
example:

```java
// Get the current transform
AffineTransform saveAT = g2.getTransform();
// Perform transformation
g2d.transform(...);
// Render
g2d.draw(...);
// Restore original transform
g2d.setTransform(saveAT);
```

**Parameters:** Tx

- the

AffineTransform

that was retrieved
from the

getTransform

method
**See Also:** transform(java.awt.geom.AffineTransform)

,

getTransform()

,

AffineTransform

- getTransform

```java
public abstract
AffineTransform
getTransform()
```

Returns a copy of the current

Transform

in the

Graphics2D

context.

**Returns:** the current

AffineTransform

in the

Graphics2D

context.
**See Also:** transform(java.awt.geom.AffineTransform)

,

setTransform(java.awt.geom.AffineTransform)

- getPaint

```java
public abstract
Paint
getPaint()
```

Returns the current

Paint

of the

Graphics2D

context.

**Returns:** the current

Graphics2D Paint

,
which defines a color or pattern.
**See Also:** setPaint(java.awt.Paint)

,

Graphics.setColor(java.awt.Color)

- getComposite

```java
public abstract
Composite
getComposite()
```

Returns the current

Composite

in the

Graphics2D

context.

**Returns:** the current

Graphics2D Composite

,
which defines a compositing style.
**See Also:** setComposite(java.awt.Composite)

- setBackground

```java
public abstract void setBackground​(
Color
color)
```

Sets the background color for the

Graphics2D

context.
The background color is used for clearing a region.
When a

Graphics2D

is constructed for a

Component

, the background color is
inherited from the

Component

. Setting the background color
in the

Graphics2D

context only affects the subsequent

clearRect

calls and not the background color of the

Component

. To change the background
of the

Component

, use appropriate methods of
the

Component

.

**Parameters:** color

- the background color that is used in
subsequent calls to

clearRect
**See Also:** getBackground()

,

Graphics.clearRect(int, int, int, int)

- getBackground

```java
public abstract
Color
getBackground()
```

Returns the background color used for clearing a region.

- getStroke

```java
public abstract
Stroke
getStroke()
```

Returns the current

Stroke

in the

Graphics2D

context.

**Returns:** the current

Graphics2D Stroke

,
which defines the line style.
**See Also:** setStroke(java.awt.Stroke)

- clip

```java
public abstract void clip​(
Shape
s)
```

Intersects the current

Clip

with the interior of the
specified

Shape

and sets the

Clip

to the
resulting intersection. The specified

Shape

is
transformed with the current

Graphics2D

Transform

before being intersected with the current

Clip

. This method is used to make the current

Clip

smaller.
To make the

Clip

larger, use

setClip

.
The

user clip

modified by this method is independent of the
clipping associated with device bounds and visibility. If no clip has
previously been set, or if the clip has been cleared using

setClip

with a

null

argument, the specified

Shape

becomes the new
user clip.

**Parameters:** s

- the

Shape

to be intersected with the current

Clip

. If

s

is

null

,
this method clears the current

Clip

.

- getFontRenderContext

```java
public abstract
FontRenderContext
getFontRenderContext()
```

Get the rendering context of the

Font

within this

Graphics2D

context.
The

FontRenderContext

encapsulates application hints such as anti-aliasing and
fractional metrics, as well as target device specific information
such as dots-per-inch. This information should be provided by the
application when using objects that perform typographical
formatting, such as

Font

and

TextLayout

. This information should also be provided
by applications that perform their own layout and need accurate
measurements of various characteristics of glyphs such as advance
and line height when various rendering hints have been applied to
the text rendering.

**Returns:** a reference to an instance of FontRenderContext.
**Since:** 1.2

) in the current coordinate system.
Modifies the

Graphics2D

context so that its new origin
corresponds to the point (

x

,

y

) in the

Graphics2D

context's former coordinate system. All
coordinates used in subsequent rendering operations on this graphics
context are relative to this new origin.

**Specified by:** translate

in class

Graphics
**Parameters:** x

- the specified x coordinate
**Parameters:** y

- the specified y coordinate
**Since:** 1.0

- translate

```java
public abstract void translate​(double tx,
double ty)
```

Concatenates the current

Graphics2D Transform

with a translation transform.
Subsequent rendering is translated by the specified
distance relative to the previous position.
This is equivalent to calling transform(T), where T is an

AffineTransform

represented by the following matrix:

```java
[ 1 0 tx ]
[ 0 1 ty ]
[ 0 0 1 ]
```

**Parameters:** tx

- the distance to translate along the x-axis
**Parameters:** ty

- the distance to translate along the y-axis

- rotate

```java
public abstract void rotate​(double theta)
```

Concatenates the current

Graphics2D

Transform

with a rotation transform.
Subsequent rendering is rotated by the specified radians relative
to the previous origin.
This is equivalent to calling

transform(R)

, where R is an

AffineTransform

represented by the following matrix:

```java
[ cos(theta) -sin(theta) 0 ]
[ sin(theta) cos(theta) 0 ]
[ 0 0 1 ]
```

Rotating with a positive angle theta rotates points on the positive
x axis toward the positive y axis.

**Parameters:** theta

- the angle of rotation in radians

- rotate

```java
public abstract void rotate​(double theta,
double x,
double y)
```

Concatenates the current

Graphics2D

Transform

with a translated rotation
transform. Subsequent rendering is transformed by a transform
which is constructed by translating to the specified location,
rotating by the specified radians, and translating back by the same
amount as the original translation. This is equivalent to the
following sequence of calls:

```java
translate(x, y);
rotate(theta);
translate(-x, -y);
```

Rotating with a positive angle theta rotates points on the positive
x axis toward the positive y axis.

**Parameters:** theta

- the angle of rotation in radians
**Parameters:** x

- the x coordinate of the origin of the rotation
**Parameters:** y

- the y coordinate of the origin of the rotation

- scale

```java
public abstract void scale​(double sx,
double sy)
```

Concatenates the current

Graphics2D

Transform

with a scaling transformation
Subsequent rendering is resized according to the specified scaling
factors relative to the previous scaling.
This is equivalent to calling

transform(S)

, where S is an

AffineTransform

represented by the following matrix:

```java
[ sx 0 0 ]
[ 0 sy 0 ]
[ 0 0 1 ]
```

**Parameters:** sx

- the amount by which X coordinates in subsequent
rendering operations are multiplied relative to previous
rendering operations.
**Parameters:** sy

- the amount by which Y coordinates in subsequent
rendering operations are multiplied relative to previous
rendering operations.

- shear

```java
public abstract void shear​(double shx,
double shy)
```

Concatenates the current

Graphics2D

Transform

with a shearing transform.
Subsequent renderings are sheared by the specified
multiplier relative to the previous position.
This is equivalent to calling

transform(SH)

, where SH
is an

AffineTransform

represented by the following
matrix:

```java
[ 1 shx 0 ]
[ shy 1 0 ]
[ 0 0 1 ]
```

**Parameters:** shx

- the multiplier by which coordinates are shifted in
the positive X axis direction as a function of their Y coordinate
**Parameters:** shy

- the multiplier by which coordinates are shifted in
the positive Y axis direction as a function of their X coordinate

- transform

```java
public abstract void transform​(
AffineTransform
Tx)
```

Composes an

AffineTransform

object with the

Transform

in this

Graphics2D

according
to the rule last-specified-first-applied. If the current

Transform

is Cx, the result of composition
with Tx is a new

Transform

Cx'. Cx' becomes the
current

Transform

for this

Graphics2D

.
Transforming a point p by the updated

Transform

Cx' is
equivalent to first transforming p by Tx and then transforming
the result by the original

Transform

Cx. In other
words, Cx'(p) = Cx(Tx(p)). A copy of the Tx is made, if necessary,
so further modifications to Tx do not affect rendering.

**Parameters:** Tx

- the

AffineTransform

object to be composed with
the current

Transform
**See Also:** setTransform(java.awt.geom.AffineTransform)

,

AffineTransform

- setTransform

```java
public abstract void setTransform​(
AffineTransform
Tx)
```

Overwrites the Transform in the

Graphics2D

context.
WARNING: This method should

never

be used to apply a new
coordinate transform on top of an existing transform because the

Graphics2D

might already have a transform that is
needed for other purposes, such as rendering Swing
components or applying a scaling transformation to adjust for the
resolution of a printer.

To add a coordinate transform, use the

transform

,

rotate

,

scale

,
or

shear

methods. The

setTransform

method is intended only for restoring the original

Graphics2D

transform after rendering, as shown in this
example:

```java
// Get the current transform
AffineTransform saveAT = g2.getTransform();
// Perform transformation
g2d.transform(...);
// Render
g2d.draw(...);
// Restore original transform
g2d.setTransform(saveAT);
```

**Parameters:** Tx

- the

AffineTransform

that was retrieved
from the

getTransform

method
**See Also:** transform(java.awt.geom.AffineTransform)

,

getTransform()

,

AffineTransform

- getTransform

```java
public abstract
AffineTransform
getTransform()
```

Returns a copy of the current

Transform

in the

Graphics2D

context.

**Returns:** the current

AffineTransform

in the

Graphics2D

context.
**See Also:** transform(java.awt.geom.AffineTransform)

,

setTransform(java.awt.geom.AffineTransform)

- getPaint

```java
public abstract
Paint
getPaint()
```

Returns the current

Paint

of the

Graphics2D

context.

**Returns:** the current

Graphics2D Paint

,
which defines a color or pattern.
**See Also:** setPaint(java.awt.Paint)

,

Graphics.setColor(java.awt.Color)

- getComposite

```java
public abstract
Composite
getComposite()
```

Returns the current

Composite

in the

Graphics2D

context.

**Returns:** the current

Graphics2D Composite

,
which defines a compositing style.
**See Also:** setComposite(java.awt.Composite)

- setBackground

```java
public abstract void setBackground​(
Color
color)
```

Sets the background color for the

Graphics2D

context.
The background color is used for clearing a region.
When a

Graphics2D

is constructed for a

Component

, the background color is
inherited from the

Component

. Setting the background color
in the

Graphics2D

context only affects the subsequent

clearRect

calls and not the background color of the

Component

. To change the background
of the

Component

, use appropriate methods of
the

Component

.

**Parameters:** color

- the background color that is used in
subsequent calls to

clearRect
**See Also:** getBackground()

,

Graphics.clearRect(int, int, int, int)

- getBackground

```java
public abstract
Color
getBackground()
```

Returns the background color used for clearing a region.

**Returns:** the current

Graphics2D Color

- getStroke

```java
public abstract
Stroke
getStroke()
```

Returns the current

Stroke

in the

Graphics2D

context.

**Returns:** the current

Graphics2D Stroke

,
which defines the line style.
**See Also:** setStroke(java.awt.Stroke)

- clip

```java
public abstract void clip​(
Shape
s)
```

Intersects the current

Clip

with the interior of the
specified

Shape

and sets the

Clip

to the
resulting intersection. The specified

Shape

is
transformed with the current

Graphics2D

Transform

before being intersected with the current

Clip

. This method is used to make the current

Clip

smaller.
To make the

Clip

larger, use

setClip

.
The

user clip

modified by this method is independent of the
clipping associated with device bounds and visibility. If no clip has
previously been set, or if the clip has been cleared using

setClip

with a

null

argument, the specified

Shape

becomes the new
user clip.

**Parameters:** s

- the

Shape

to be intersected with the current

Clip

. If

s

is

null

,
this method clears the current

Clip

.

- getFontRenderContext

```java
public abstract
FontRenderContext
getFontRenderContext()
```

Get the rendering context of the

Font

within this

Graphics2D

context.
The

FontRenderContext

encapsulates application hints such as anti-aliasing and
fractional metrics, as well as target device specific information
such as dots-per-inch. This information should be provided by the
application when using objects that perform typographical
formatting, such as

Font

and

TextLayout

. This information should also be provided
by applications that perform their own layout and need accurate
measurements of various characteristics of glyphs such as advance
and line height when various rendering hints have been applied to
the text rendering.

**Returns:** a reference to an instance of FontRenderContext.
**Since:** 1.2

getComposite()
```

Returns the current

Composite

in the

Graphics2D

context.

**Returns:** the current

Graphics2D Composite

,
which defines a compositing style.
**See Also:** setComposite(java.awt.Composite)

setBackground

```java
public abstract void setBackground​(
Color
color)
```

Sets the background color for the

Graphics2D

context.
The background color is used for clearing a region.
When a

Graphics2D

is constructed for a

Component

, the background color is
inherited from the

Component

. Setting the background color
in the

Graphics2D

context only affects the subsequent

clearRect

calls and not the background color of the

Component

. To change the background
of the

Component

, use appropriate methods of
the

Component

.

**Parameters:** color

- the background color that is used in
subsequent calls to

clearRect
**See Also:** getBackground()

,

Graphics.clearRect(int, int, int, int)

clip

```java
public abstract void clip​(
Shape
s)
```

Intersects the current

Clip

with the interior of the
specified

Shape

and sets the

Clip

to the
resulting intersection. The specified

Shape

is
transformed with the current

Graphics2D

Transform

before being intersected with the current

Clip

. This method is used to make the current

Clip

smaller.
To make the

Clip

larger, use

setClip

.
The

user clip

modified by this method is independent of the
clipping associated with device bounds and visibility. If no clip has
previously been set, or if the clip has been cleared using

setClip

with a

null

argument, the specified

Shape

becomes the new
user clip.

**Parameters:** s

- the

Shape

to be intersected with the current

Clip

. If

s

is

null

,
this method clears the current

Clip

.

getFontRenderContext

```java
public abstract
FontRenderContext
getFontRenderContext()
```

Get the rendering context of the

Font

within this

Graphics2D

context.
The

FontRenderContext

encapsulates application hints such as anti-aliasing and
fractional metrics, as well as target device specific information
such as dots-per-inch. This information should be provided by the
application when using objects that perform typographical
formatting, such as

Font

and

TextLayout

. This information should also be provided
by applications that perform their own layout and need accurate
measurements of various characteristics of glyphs such as advance
and line height when various rendering hints have been applied to
the text rendering.

**Returns:** a reference to an instance of FontRenderContext.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** FontRenderContext

,

Font.createGlyphVector(java.awt.font.FontRenderContext, java.lang.String)

,
