# Class BaseRowSet

**Source:** `java.sql.rowset\javax\sql\rowset\BaseRowSet.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
BaseRowSet

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
,
Cloneable
```

An abstract class providing a

RowSet

object with its basic functionality.
The basic functions include having properties and sending event notifications,
which all JavaBeans™ components must implement.

1.0 Overview

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the core functionality
for all

RowSet

implementations,
and all standard implementations

may

use this class in combination with
one or more

RowSet

interfaces in order to provide a standard
vendor-specific implementation. To clarify, all implementations must implement
at least one of the

RowSet

interfaces (

JdbcRowSet

,

CachedRowSet

,

JoinRowSet

,

FilteredRowSet

,
or

WebRowSet

). This means that any implementation that extends
the

BaseRowSet

class must also implement one of the

RowSet

interfaces.

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the following:

- Properties

- Fields for storing current properties

Methods for getting and setting properties

Event notification

A complete set of setter methods

for setting the parameters in a

RowSet

object's command

Streams

- Fields for storing stream instances

Constants for indicating the type of a stream

2.0 Setting Properties

All rowsets maintain a set of properties, which will usually be set using
a tool. The number and kinds of properties a rowset has will vary,
depending on what the

RowSet

implementation does and how it gets
its data. For example,
rowsets that get their data from a

ResultSet

object need to
set the properties that are required for making a database connection.
If a

RowSet

object uses the

DriverManager

facility to make a
connection, it needs to set a property for the JDBC URL that identifies the
appropriate driver, and it needs to set the properties that give the
user name and password.
If, on the other hand, the rowset uses a

DataSource

object
to make the connection, which is the preferred method, it does not need to
set the property for the JDBC URL. Instead, it needs to set the property
for the logical name of the data source along with the properties for
the user name and password.

NOTE: In order to use a

DataSource

object for making a
connection, the

DataSource

object must have been registered
with a naming service that uses the Java Naming and Directory
Interface™ (JNDI) API. This registration
is usually done by a person acting in the capacity of a system administrator.

3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters

When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a command (a query)
that produces a

ResultSet

object. This query is the command that is set
for the

RowSet

object's command property. The rowset populates itself with data by reading the
data from the

ResultSet

object into itself. If the query
contains placeholders for values to be set, the

BaseRowSet

setter methods
are used to set these values. All setter methods allow these values to be set
to

null

if required.

The following code fragment illustrates how the

CachedRowSet

™
object

crs

might have its command property set. Note that if a
tool is used to set properties, this is the code that the tool would use.

```java
crs.setCommand("SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?");
```

In this example, the values for

CREDIT_LIMIT

and

REGION

are placeholder parameters, which are indicated with a
question mark (?). The first question mark is placeholder parameter number

1

, the second question mark is placeholder parameter number

2

, and so on. Any placeholder parameters must be set with
values before the query can be executed. To set these
placeholder parameters, the

BaseRowSet

class provides a set of setter
methods, similar to those provided by the

PreparedStatement

interface, for setting values of each data type. A

RowSet

object stores the
parameter values internally, and its

execute

method uses them internally
to set values for the placeholder parameters
before it sends the command to the DBMS to be executed.

The following code fragment demonstrates
setting the two parameters in the query from the previous example.

```java
crs.setInt(1, 5000);
crs.setString(2, "West");
```

If the

execute

method is called at this point, the query
sent to the DBMS will be:

```java
"SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'"
```

NOTE: Setting

Array

,

Clob

,

Blob

and

Ref

objects as a command parameter, stores these values as

SerialArray

,

SerialClob

,

SerialBlob

and

SerialRef

objects respectively.

4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes

NOTE: The

BaseRowSet

class provides two kinds of setter methods,
those that set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter
methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder parameters.

The placeholder parameters set with the

BaseRowSet

setter methods
are stored as objects in an internal

Hashtable

object.
Primitives are stored as their

Object

type. For example,

byte

is stored as

Byte

object, and

int

is stored as
an

Integer

object.
When the method

execute

is called, the values in the

Hashtable

object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder
parameters in the command.

A call to the method

getParams

returns the values stored in the

Hashtable

object as an array of

Object

instances.
An element in this array may be a simple

Object

instance or an
array (which is a type of

Object

). The particular setter method used
determines whether an element in this array is an

Object

or an array.

The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two parameters,
with the first parameter
indicating which placeholder parameter is to be set, and the second parameter
giving the value to be set. Methods such as

setInt

,

setString

,

setBoolean

, and

setLong

fall into
this category. After these methods have been called, a call to the method

getParams

will return an array with the values that have been set. Each
element in the array is an

Object

instance representing the
values that have been set. The order of these values in the array is determined by the

int

(the first parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the
array are the values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method.
In other words, the first element in the array is the value
to be set for the first placeholder parameter in the

RowSet

object's
command. The second element is the value to
be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.

Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the value to be set.
When the method

getParams

is called after one of these setter methods has
been used, the elements in the array will themselves be arrays to accommodate the
additional information. In this category, the method

setNull

is a special case
because one version takes only
two parameters (

setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)

). Nevertheless,
it requires
an array to contain the information that will be passed to the driver and DBMS. The first
element in this array is the value to be set, which is

null

, and the
second element is the

int

supplied for

sqlType

, which
indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to

null

. This information
is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to ensure that applications
are portable.
The other version is intended to be used when the value to be set to

null

is a user-defined type. It takes three parameters
(

setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName)

) and also
requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the driver and DBMS.
The first two elements in this array are the same as for the first version of

setNull

. The third element,

typeName

, gives the SQL name of
the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods, the number of the
placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by

getParams

. So, for example, if the parameter
supplied to

setNull

is

2

, the second element in the array
returned by

getParams

will be an array of two or three elements.

Some methods, such as

setObject

and

setDate

have versions
that take more than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information
to the driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods

setDate

,

setTime

, and

setTimestamp

can take a

Calendar

object as their third parameter. If the DBMS does not store time zone information,
the driver uses the

Calendar

object to construct the

Date

,

Time

, or

Timestamp

object being set. As is true with other
methods that provide additional information, the element in the array returned
by

getParams

is an array instead of a simple

Object

instance.

The methods

setAsciiStream

,

setBinaryStream

,

setCharacterStream

, and

setUnicodeStream

(which is
deprecated, so applications should use

getCharacterStream

instead)
take three parameters, so for them, the element in the array returned by

getParams

is also an array. What is different about these setter
methods is that in addition to the information provided by parameters, the array contains
one of the

BaseRowSet

constants indicating the type of stream being set.

NOTE: The method

getParams

is called internally by

RowSet

implementations extending this class; it is not normally called by an
application programmer directly.

5.0 Event Notification

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the event notification
mechanism for rowsets. It contains the field

listeners

, methods for adding and removing listeners, and
methods for notifying listeners of changes.

A listener is an object that has implemented the

RowSetListener

interface.
If it has been added to a

RowSet

object's list of listeners, it will be notified
when an event occurs on that

RowSet

object. Each listener's
implementation of the

RowSetListener

methods defines what that object
will do when it is notified that an event has occurred.

There are three possible events for a

RowSet

object:

- the cursor moves

an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)

the contents of the entire

RowSet

object are changed

The

BaseRowSet

method used for the notification indicates the
type of event that has occurred. For example, the method

notifyRowChanged

indicates that a row has been updated,
deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification methods creates a

RowSetEvent

object, which is supplied to the listener in order to
identify the

RowSet

object on which the event occurred.
What the listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how it was
implemented.

6.0 Default Behavior

A default

BaseRowSet

object is initialized with many starting values.

The following is true of a default

RowSet

instance that extends
the

BaseRowSet

class:

- Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes
made by others.

Is updatable.

Does not show rows that have been deleted.

Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to
execute the

RowSet

object's command.

Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.

Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This
limit applies only to columns that hold values of the
following types:

BINARY

,

VARBINARY

,

LONGVARBINARY

,

CHAR

,

VARCHAR

,
and

LONGVARCHAR

.

Will not see uncommitted data (make "dirty" reads).

Has escape processing turned on.

Has its connection's type map set to

null

.

Has an empty

Vector

object for storing the values set
for the placeholder parameters in the

RowSet

object's command.

If other values are desired, an application must set the property values
explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number
of rows for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

to 500.

```java
crs.setMaxRows(500);
```

Methods implemented in extensions of this

BaseRowSet

class

must

throw an

SQLException

object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if the
extending class overrides and reimplements any

BaseRowSet

method and encounters
connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method

may

in addition throw an

SQLException

object for that reason.

Constructs a new

BaseRowSet

object initialized with
a default

Vector

object for its

listeners

field. The other default values with which it is initialized are listed
in Section 6.0 of the class comment for this class.

---

### Method Details

#### protected void initParams()

Performs the necessary internal configurations and initializations
to allow any JDBC

RowSet

implementation to start using
the standard facilities provided by a

BaseRowSet

instance. This method

should

be called after the

RowSet

object
has been instantiated to correctly initialize all parameters. This method

should

never be called by an application, but is called from with
a

RowSet

implementation extending this class.

---

#### public void addRowSetListener​(
RowSetListener
listener)

The listener will be notified whenever an event occurs on this

RowSet

object.

A listener might, for example, be a table or graph that needs to
be updated in order to accurately reflect the current state of
the

RowSet

object.

Note

: if the

RowSetListener

object is

null

, this method silently discards the

null

value and does not add a null reference to the set of listeners.

Note

: if the listener is already set, and the new

RowSetListener

instance is added to the set of listeners already registered to receive
event notifications from this

RowSet

.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- an object that has implemented the

javax.sql.RowSetListener

interface and wants to be notified
of any events that occur on this

RowSet

object; May be
null.

**See Also:**
- removeRowSetListener(javax.sql.RowSetListener)

---

#### public void removeRowSetListener​(
RowSetListener
listener)

Removes the designated object from this

RowSet

object's list of listeners.
If the given argument is not a registered listener, this method
does nothing.

Note

: if the

RowSetListener

object is

null

, this method silently discards the

null

value.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- a

RowSetListener

object that is on the list
of listeners for this

RowSet

object

**See Also:**
- addRowSetListener(javax.sql.RowSetListener)

---

#### protected void notifyCursorMoved()
throws
SQLException

Notifies all of the listeners registered with this

RowSet

object that its cursor has moved.

When an application calls a method to move the cursor,
that method moves the cursor and then calls this method
internally. An application

should

never invoke
this method directly.

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if the class extending the

BaseRowSet

abstract class does not implement the

RowSet

interface or
one of it's sub-interfaces.

---

#### protected void notifyRowChanged()
throws
SQLException

Notifies all of the listeners registered with this

RowSet

object that
one of its rows has changed.

When an application calls a method that changes a row, such as
the

CachedRowSet

methods

insertRow

,

updateRow

, or

deleteRow

,
that method calls

notifyRowChanged

internally. An application

should

never invoke
this method directly.

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if the class extending the

BaseRowSet

abstract class does not implement the

RowSet

interface or
one of it's sub-interfaces.

---

#### protected void notifyRowSetChanged()
throws
SQLException

Notifies all of the listeners registered with this

RowSet

object that its entire contents have changed.

When an application calls methods that change the entire contents
of the

RowSet

object, such as the

CachedRowSet

methods

execute

,

populate

,

restoreOriginal

,
or

release

, that method calls

notifyRowSetChanged

internally (either directly or indirectly). An application

should

never invoke this method directly.

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if the class extending the

BaseRowSet

abstract class does not implement the

RowSet

interface or
one of it's sub-interfaces.

---

#### public
String
getCommand()

Retrieves the SQL query that is the command for this

RowSet

object. The command property contains the query that
will be executed to populate this

RowSet

object.

The SQL query returned by this method is used by

RowSet

methods
such as

execute

and

populate

, which may be implemented
by any class that extends the

BaseRowSet

abstract class and
implements one or more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

The command is used by the

RowSet

object's
reader to obtain a

ResultSet

object. The reader then
reads the data from the

ResultSet

object and uses it to
to populate this

RowSet

object.

The default value for the

command

property is

null

.

**Returns:**
- the

String

that is the value for this

RowSet

object's

command

property;
may be

null

**See Also:**
- setCommand(java.lang.String)

---

#### public void setCommand​(
String
cmd)
throws
SQLException

Sets this

RowSet

object's

command

property to
the given

String

object and clears the parameters, if any,
that were set for the previous command.

The

command

property may not be needed if the

RowSet

object gets its data from a source that does not support commands,
such as a spreadsheet or other tabular file.
Thus, this property is optional and may be

null

.

**Parameters:**
- cmd

- a

String

object containing an SQL query
that will be set as this

RowSet

object's command
property; may be

null

but may not be an empty string

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an empty string is provided as the command value

**See Also:**
- getCommand()

---

#### public
String
getUrl()
throws
SQLException

Retrieves the JDBC URL that this

RowSet

object's

javax.sql.Reader

object uses to make a connection
with a relational database using a JDBC technology-enabled driver.

The

Url

property will be

null

if the underlying data
source is a non-SQL data source, such as a spreadsheet or an XML
data source.

**Returns:**
- a

String

object that contains the JDBC URL
used to establish the connection for this

RowSet

object; may be

null

(default value) if not set

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an error occurs retrieving the URL value

**See Also:**
- setUrl(java.lang.String)

---

#### public void setUrl​(
String
url)
throws
SQLException

Sets the Url property for this

RowSet

object
to the given

String

object and sets the dataSource name
property to

null

. The Url property is a
JDBC URL that is used when
the connection is created using a JDBC technology-enabled driver
("JDBC driver") and the

DriverManager

.
The correct JDBC URL for the specific driver to be used can be found
in the driver documentation. Although there are guidelines for how
a JDBC URL is formed,
a driver vendor can specify any

String

object except
one with a length of

0

(an empty string).

Setting the Url property is optional if connections are established using
a

DataSource

object instead of the

DriverManager

.
The driver will use either the URL property or the
dataSourceName property to create a connection, whichever was
specified most recently. If an application uses a JDBC URL, it
must load a JDBC driver that accepts the JDBC URL before it uses the

RowSet

object to connect to a database. The

RowSet

object will use the URL internally to create a database connection in order
to read or write data.

**Parameters:**
- url

- a

String

object that contains the JDBC URL
that will be used to establish the connection to a database for this

RowSet

object; may be

null

but must not
be an empty string

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an error occurs setting the Url property or the
parameter supplied is a string with a length of

0

(an
empty string)

**See Also:**
- getUrl()

---

#### public
String
getDataSourceName()

Returns the logical name that when supplied to a naming service
that uses the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API, will
retrieve a

javax.sql.DataSource

object. This

DataSource

object can be used to establish a connection
to the data source that it represents.

Users should set either the url or the data source name property.
The driver will use the property set most recently to establish a
connection.

**Returns:**
- a

String

object that identifies the

DataSource

object to be used for making a
connection; if no logical name has been set,

null

is returned.

**See Also:**
- setDataSourceName(java.lang.String)

---

#### public void setDataSourceName​(
String
name)
throws
SQLException

Sets the

DataSource

name property for this

RowSet

object to the given logical name and sets this

RowSet

object's
Url property to

null

. The name must have been bound to a

DataSource

object in a JNDI naming service so that an
application can do a lookup using that name to retrieve the

DataSource

object bound to it. The

DataSource

object can then be used to establish a connection to the data source it
represents.

Users should set either the Url property or the dataSourceName property.
If both properties are set, the driver will use the property set most recently.

**Parameters:**
- name

- a

String

object with the name that can be supplied
to a naming service based on JNDI technology to retrieve the

DataSource

object that can be used to get a connection;
may be

null

but must not be an empty string

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an empty string is provided as the

DataSource

name

**See Also:**
- getDataSourceName()

---

#### public
String
getUsername()

Returns the user name used to create a database connection. Because it
is not serialized, the username property is set at runtime before
calling the method

execute

.

**Returns:**
- the

String

object containing the user name that
is supplied to the data source to create a connection; may be

null

(default value) if not set

**See Also:**
- setUsername(java.lang.String)

---

#### public void setUsername​(
String
name)

Sets the username property for this

RowSet

object
to the given user name. Because it
is not serialized, the username property is set at run time before
calling the method

execute

.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the

String

object containing the user name that
is supplied to the data source to create a connection. It may be null.

**See Also:**
- getUsername()

---

#### public
String
getPassword()

Returns the password used to create a database connection for this

RowSet

object. Because the password property is not
serialized, it is set at run time before calling the method

execute

. The default value is

null

**Returns:**
- the

String

object that represents the password
that must be supplied to the database to create a connection

**See Also:**
- setPassword(java.lang.String)

---

#### public void setPassword​(
String
pass)

Sets the password used to create a database connection for this

RowSet

object to the given

String

object. Because the password property is not
serialized, it is set at run time before calling the method

execute

.

#### public
Map
<
String
,​
Class
<?>> getTypeMap()

Retrieves the type map associated with the

Connection

object for this

RowSet

object.

Drivers that support the JDBC 3.0 API will create

Connection

objects with an associated type map.
This type map, which is initially empty, can contain one or more
fully-qualified SQL names and

Class

objects indicating
the class to which the named SQL value will be mapped. The type mapping
specified in the connection's type map is used for custom type mapping
when no other type map supersedes it.

If a type map is explicitly supplied to a method that can perform
custom mapping, that type map supersedes the connection's type map.

**Returns:**
- the

java.util.Map

object that is the type map
for this

RowSet

object's connection

---

#### public void setTypeMap​(
Map
<
String
,​
Class
<?>> map)

Installs the given

java.util.Map

object as the type map
associated with the

Connection

object for this

RowSet

object. The custom mapping indicated in
this type map will be used unless a different type map is explicitly
supplied to a method, in which case the type map supplied will be used.

**Parameters:**
- map

- a

java.util.Map

object that contains the
mapping from SQL type names for user defined types (UDT) to classes in
the Java programming language. Each entry in the

Map

object consists of the fully qualified SQL name of a UDT and the

Class

object for the

SQLData

implementation
of that UDT. May be

null

.

---

#### public void setEscapeProcessing​(boolean enable)
throws
SQLException

Sets to the given

boolean

whether or not the driver will
scan for escape syntax and do escape substitution before sending SQL
statements to the database. The default is for the driver to do escape
processing.

Note: Since

PreparedStatement

objects have usually been
parsed prior to making this call, disabling escape processing for
prepared statements will likely have no effect.

**Parameters:**
- enable

-

true

to enable escape processing;

false

to disable it

time-out or if the query time-out value is less than 0

---

#### public boolean getShowDeleted()
throws
SQLException

Retrieves a

boolean

indicating whether rows marked
for deletion appear in the set of current rows.
The default value is

false

.

Note: Allowing deleted rows to remain visible complicates the behavior
of some of the methods. However, most

RowSet

object users
can simply ignore this extra detail because only sophisticated
applications will likely want to take advantage of this feature.

**Returns:**
- true

if deleted rows are visible;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an error occurs determining if deleted rows
are visible or not

**See Also:**
- setShowDeleted(boolean)

#### public void setFetchDirection​(int direction)
throws
SQLException

Gives the driver a performance hint as to the direction in
which the rows in this

RowSet

object will be
processed. The driver may ignore this hint.

A

RowSet

object inherits the default properties of the

ResultSet

object from which it got its data. That

ResultSet

object's default fetch direction is set by
the

Statement

object that created it.

This method applies to a

RowSet

object only while it is
connected to a database using a JDBC driver.

A

RowSet

object may use this method at any time to change
its setting for the fetch direction.

**Parameters:**
- direction

- one of

ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD

,

ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE

, or

ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if (1) the

RowSet

type is

TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY

and the given fetch direction is not

FETCH_FORWARD

or (2) the given fetch direction is not
one of the following:
ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD,
ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE, or
ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN

**See Also:**
- getFetchDirection()

---

#### public int getFetchDirection()
throws
SQLException

Retrieves this

RowSet

object's current setting for the
fetch direction. The default type is

ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD

**Returns:**
- one of

ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD

,

ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE

, or

ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an error occurs in determining the
current fetch direction for fetching rows

**See Also:**
- setFetchDirection(int)

---

#### public void setFetchSize​(int rows)
throws
SQLException

Sets the fetch size for this

RowSet

object to the given number of
rows. The fetch size gives a JDBC technology-enabled driver ("JDBC driver")
a hint as to the
number of rows that should be fetched from the database when more rows
are needed for this

RowSet

object. If the fetch size specified
is zero, the driver ignores the value and is free to make its own best guess
as to what the fetch size should be.

A

RowSet

object inherits the default properties of the

ResultSet

object from which it got its data. That

ResultSet

object's default fetch size is set by
the

Statement

object that created it.

This method applies to a

RowSet

object only while it is
connected to a database using a JDBC driver.
For connected

RowSet

implementations such as

JdbcRowSet

, this method has a direct and immediate effect
on the underlying JDBC driver.

A

RowSet

object may use this method at any time to change
its setting for the fetch size.

For

RowSet

implementations such as

CachedRowSet

, which operate in a disconnected environment,
the

SyncProvider

object being used
may leverage the fetch size to poll the data source and
retrieve a number of rows that do not exceed the fetch size and that may
form a subset of the actual rows returned by the original query. This is
an implementation variance determined by the specific

SyncProvider

object employed by the disconnected

RowSet

object.

**Parameters:**
- rows

- the number of rows to fetch;

0

to let the
driver decide what the best fetch size is; must not be less
than

0

or more than the maximum number of rows
allowed for this

RowSet

object (the number returned
by a call to the method

getMaxRows()

)

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if the specified fetch size is less than

0

or more than the limit for the maximum number of rows

**See Also:**
- getFetchSize()

---

#### public int getFetchSize()
throws
SQLException

Returns the fetch size for this

RowSet

object. The default
value is zero.

**Returns:**
- the number of rows suggested as the fetch size when this

RowSet

object
needs more rows from the database

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an error occurs determining the number of rows in the
current fetch size

**See Also:**
- setFetchSize(int)

---

#### public int getConcurrency()
throws
SQLException

Returns the concurrency for this

RowSet

object.
The default is

CONCUR_UPDATABLE

for both connected and
disconnected

RowSet

objects.

An application can call the method

setConcurrency

at any time
to change a

RowSet

object's concurrency.

**Returns:**
- the concurrency type for this

RowSet

object, which must be one of the following:

ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY

or

ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an error occurs getting the concurrency
of this

RowSet

object

**See Also:**
- setConcurrency(int)

,

isReadOnly()

---

#### public void setNull​(int parameterIndex,
int sqlType)
throws
SQLException

Sets the designated parameter to SQL

NULL

.
Note that the parameter's SQL type must be specified using one of the
type codes defined in

java.sql.Types

. This SQL type is
specified in the second parameter.

Note that the second parameter tells the DBMS the data type of the value being
set to

NULL

. Some DBMSs require this information, so it is required
in order to make code more portable.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setNull

has been called will return an

Object

array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is

null

.
The second element is the value set for

sqlType

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to

null

, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:**
- parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
- sqlType

- an

int

that is one of the SQL type codes
defined in the class

Types

. If a non-standard

sqlType

is supplied, this method will not throw a

SQLException

. This allows implicit support for
non-standard SQL types.

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or the given
parameter index is out of bounds

**See Also:**
- getParams()

---

#### public void setNull​(int parameterIndex,
int sqlType,

String
typeName)
throws
SQLException

Sets the designated parameter to SQL

NULL

.

Although this version of the method

setNull

is intended
for user-defined
and

REF

parameters, this method may be used to set a null
parameter for any JDBC type. The following are user-defined types:

STRUCT

,

DISTINCT

, and

JAVA_OBJECT

,
and named array types.

Note:

To be portable, applications must give the
SQL type code and the fully qualified SQL type name when specifying
a

NULL

user-defined or

REF

parameter.
In the case of a user-defined type, the name is the type name of
the parameter itself. For a

REF

parameter, the name is
the type name of the referenced type. If a JDBC technology-enabled
driver does not need the type code or type name information,
it may ignore it.

If the parameter does not have a user-defined or

REF

type,
the given

typeName

parameter is ignored.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setNull

has been called will return an

Object

array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is

null

.
The second element is the value set for

sqlType

, and the third
element is the value set for

typeName

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to

null

, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:**
- parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
- sqlType

- a value from

java.sql.Types
- typeName

- the fully qualified name of an SQL user-defined type,
which is ignored if the parameter is not a user-defined
type or

REF

value

#### public void setObject​(int parameterIndex,

Object
x)
throws
SQLException

Sets the designated parameter to an

Object

in the Java
programming language. The second parameter must be an

Object

type. For integral values, the

java.lang

equivalent
objects should be used. For example, use the class

Integer

for an

int

.

The JDBC specification defines a standard mapping from
Java

Object

types to SQL types. The driver will
use this standard mapping to convert the given object
to its corresponding SQL type before sending it to the database.
If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing

SQLData

), the driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write the object to the SQL
data stream.

If, on the other hand, the object is of a class
implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

Struct

, or

Array

,
the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the
corresponding SQL type.

This method throws an exception if there
is an ambiguity, for example, if the object is of a class
implementing more than one interface.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-specific
abstract data types.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

After this method has been called, a call to the
method

getParams

will return an object array of the current command parameters, which will
include the

Object

set for placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

.
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is element number

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:**
- parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

#### public void clearParameters()
throws
SQLException

Clears all of the current parameter values in this

RowSet

object's internal representation of the parameters to be set in
this

RowSet

object's command when it is executed.

In general, parameter values remain in force for repeated use in
this

RowSet

object's command. Setting a parameter value with the
setter methods automatically clears the value of the
designated parameter and replaces it with the new specified value.

This method is called internally by the

setCommand

method to clear all of the parameters set for the previous command.

Furthermore, this method differs from the

initParams

method in that it maintains the schema of the

RowSet

object.

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an error occurs clearing the parameters

---

#### public
Object
[] getParams()
throws
SQLException

Retrieves an array containing the parameter values (both Objects and
primitives) that have been set for this

RowSet

object's command and throws an

SQLException

object
if all parameters have not been set. Before the command is sent to the
DBMS to be executed, these parameters will be substituted
for placeholder parameters in the

PreparedStatement

object
that is the command for a

RowSet

implementation extending
the

BaseRowSet

class.

Each element in the array that is returned is an

Object

instance
that contains the values of the parameters supplied to a setter method.
The order of the elements is determined by the value supplied for

parameterIndex

. If the setter method takes only the parameter index
and the value to be set (possibly null), the array element will contain the value to be set
(which will be expressed as an

Object

). If there are additional
parameters, the array element will itself be an array containing the value to be set
plus any additional parameter values supplied to the setter method. If the method
sets a stream, the array element includes the type of stream being supplied to the
method. These additional parameters are for the use of the driver or the DBMS and may or
may not be used.

NOTE: Stored parameter values of types

Array

,

Blob

,

Clob

and

Ref

are returned as

SerialArray

,

SerialBlob

,

SerialClob

and

SerialRef

respectively.

**Returns:**
- an array of

Object

instances that includes the
parameter values that may be set in this

RowSet

object's
command; an empty array if no parameters have been set

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if an error occurs retrieving the object array of
parameters of this

RowSet

object or if not all parameters have
been set

setNull

should
be used for user-defined types and REF type parameters. Examples
of user-defined types include: STRUCT, DISTINCT, JAVA_OBJECT, and
named array types.

Note:

To be portable, applications must give the
SQL type code and the fully-qualified SQL type name when specifying
a NULL user-defined or REF parameter. In the case of a user-defined type
the name is the type name of the parameter itself. For a REF
parameter, the name is the type name of the referenced type. If
a JDBC driver does not need the type code or type name information,
it may ignore it.

Although it is intended for user-defined and Ref parameters,
this method may be used to set a null parameter of any JDBC type.
If the parameter does not have a user-defined or REF type, the given
typeName is ignored.

**Parameters:**
- parameterName

- the name of the parameter

throws
SQLException

Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given object. The second
argument must be an object type; for integral values, the

java.lang

equivalent objects should be used.

The given Java object will be converted to the given targetSqlType
before being sent to the database.

If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing the
interface

SQLData

),
the JDBC driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write it
to the SQL data stream.
If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

NClob

,

Struct

,

java.net.URL

,
or

Array

, the driver should pass it to the database as a
value of the corresponding SQL type.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-
specific abstract data types.

**Parameters:**
- parameterName

- the name of the parameter
- x

- the object containing the input parameter value
- targetSqlType

- the SQL type (as defined in java.sql.Types) to be
sent to the database. The scale argument may further qualify this type.
- scale

- for java.sql.Types.DECIMAL or java.sql.Types.NUMERIC types,
this is the number of digits after the decimal point. For all other

#### public void setObject​(
String
parameterName,

Object
x)
throws
SQLException

Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given object.
The second parameter must be of type

Object

; therefore, the

java.lang

equivalent objects should be used for built-in types.

The JDBC specification specifies a standard mapping from
Java

Object

types to SQL types. The given argument
will be converted to the corresponding SQL type before being
sent to the database.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-
specific abstract data types, by using a driver-specific Java
type.

If the object is of a class implementing the interface

SQLData

,
the JDBC driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write it to the SQL data stream.
If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

NClob

,

Struct

,

java.net.URL

,
or

### Additional Sections

#### Class BaseRowSet

java.lang.Object

- javax.sql.rowset.BaseRowSet

javax.sql.rowset.BaseRowSet

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

,

Cloneable

```java
public abstract class
BaseRowSet

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
,
Cloneable
```

An abstract class providing a

RowSet

object with its basic functionality.
The basic functions include having properties and sending event notifications,
which all JavaBeans™ components must implement.

1.0 Overview

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the core functionality
for all

RowSet

implementations,
and all standard implementations

may

use this class in combination with
one or more

RowSet

interfaces in order to provide a standard
vendor-specific implementation. To clarify, all implementations must implement
at least one of the

RowSet

interfaces (

JdbcRowSet

,

CachedRowSet

,

JoinRowSet

,

FilteredRowSet

,
or

WebRowSet

). This means that any implementation that extends
the

BaseRowSet

class must also implement one of the

RowSet

interfaces.

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the following:

- Properties

- Fields for storing current properties

Methods for getting and setting properties

Event notification

A complete set of setter methods

for setting the parameters in a

RowSet

object's command

Streams

- Fields for storing stream instances

Constants for indicating the type of a stream

2.0 Setting Properties

All rowsets maintain a set of properties, which will usually be set using
a tool. The number and kinds of properties a rowset has will vary,
depending on what the

RowSet

implementation does and how it gets
its data. For example,
rowsets that get their data from a

ResultSet

object need to
set the properties that are required for making a database connection.
If a

RowSet

object uses the

DriverManager

facility to make a
connection, it needs to set a property for the JDBC URL that identifies the
appropriate driver, and it needs to set the properties that give the
user name and password.
If, on the other hand, the rowset uses a

DataSource

object
to make the connection, which is the preferred method, it does not need to
set the property for the JDBC URL. Instead, it needs to set the property
for the logical name of the data source along with the properties for
the user name and password.

NOTE: In order to use a

DataSource

object for making a
connection, the

DataSource

object must have been registered
with a naming service that uses the Java Naming and Directory
Interface™ (JNDI) API. This registration
is usually done by a person acting in the capacity of a system administrator.

3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters

When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a command (a query)
that produces a

ResultSet

object. This query is the command that is set
for the

RowSet

object's command property. The rowset populates itself with data by reading the
data from the

ResultSet

object into itself. If the query
contains placeholders for values to be set, the

BaseRowSet

setter methods
are used to set these values. All setter methods allow these values to be set
to

null

if required.

The following code fragment illustrates how the

CachedRowSet

™
object

crs

might have its command property set. Note that if a
tool is used to set properties, this is the code that the tool would use.

```java
crs.setCommand("SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?");
```

In this example, the values for

CREDIT_LIMIT

and

REGION

are placeholder parameters, which are indicated with a
question mark (?). The first question mark is placeholder parameter number

1

, the second question mark is placeholder parameter number

2

, and so on. Any placeholder parameters must be set with
values before the query can be executed. To set these
placeholder parameters, the

BaseRowSet

class provides a set of setter
methods, similar to those provided by the

PreparedStatement

interface, for setting values of each data type. A

RowSet

object stores the
parameter values internally, and its

execute

method uses them internally
to set values for the placeholder parameters
before it sends the command to the DBMS to be executed.

The following code fragment demonstrates
setting the two parameters in the query from the previous example.

```java
crs.setInt(1, 5000);
crs.setString(2, "West");
```

If the

execute

method is called at this point, the query
sent to the DBMS will be:

```java
"SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'"
```

NOTE: Setting

Array

,

Clob

,

Blob

and

Ref

objects as a command parameter, stores these values as

SerialArray

,

SerialClob

,

SerialBlob

and

SerialRef

objects respectively.

4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes

NOTE: The

BaseRowSet

class provides two kinds of setter methods,
those that set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter
methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder parameters.

The placeholder parameters set with the

BaseRowSet

setter methods
are stored as objects in an internal

Hashtable

object.
Primitives are stored as their

Object

type. For example,

byte

is stored as

Byte

object, and

int

is stored as
an

Integer

object.
When the method

execute

is called, the values in the

Hashtable

object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder
parameters in the command.

A call to the method

getParams

returns the values stored in the

Hashtable

object as an array of

Object

instances.
An element in this array may be a simple

Object

instance or an
array (which is a type of

Object

). The particular setter method used
determines whether an element in this array is an

Object

or an array.

The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two parameters,
with the first parameter
indicating which placeholder parameter is to be set, and the second parameter
giving the value to be set. Methods such as

setInt

,

setString

,

setBoolean

, and

setLong

fall into
this category. After these methods have been called, a call to the method

getParams

will return an array with the values that have been set. Each
element in the array is an

Object

instance representing the
values that have been set. The order of these values in the array is determined by the

int

(the first parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the
array are the values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method.
In other words, the first element in the array is the value
to be set for the first placeholder parameter in the

RowSet

object's
command. The second element is the value to
be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.

Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the value to be set.
When the method

getParams

is called after one of these setter methods has
been used, the elements in the array will themselves be arrays to accommodate the
additional information. In this category, the method

setNull

is a special case
because one version takes only
two parameters (

setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)

). Nevertheless,
it requires
an array to contain the information that will be passed to the driver and DBMS. The first
element in this array is the value to be set, which is

null

, and the
second element is the

int

supplied for

sqlType

, which
indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to

null

. This information
is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to ensure that applications
are portable.
The other version is intended to be used when the value to be set to

null

is a user-defined type. It takes three parameters
(

setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName)

) and also
requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the driver and DBMS.
The first two elements in this array are the same as for the first version of

setNull

. The third element,

typeName

, gives the SQL name of
the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods, the number of the
placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by

getParams

. So, for example, if the parameter
supplied to

setNull

is

2

, the second element in the array
returned by

getParams

will be an array of two or three elements.

Some methods, such as

setObject

and

setDate

have versions
that take more than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information
to the driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods

setDate

,

setTime

, and

setTimestamp

can take a

Calendar

object as their third parameter. If the DBMS does not store time zone information,
the driver uses the

Calendar

object to construct the

Date

,

Time

, or

Timestamp

object being set. As is true with other
methods that provide additional information, the element in the array returned
by

getParams

is an array instead of a simple

Object

instance.

The methods

setAsciiStream

,

setBinaryStream

,

setCharacterStream

, and

setUnicodeStream

(which is
deprecated, so applications should use

getCharacterStream

instead)
take three parameters, so for them, the element in the array returned by

getParams

is also an array. What is different about these setter
methods is that in addition to the information provided by parameters, the array contains
one of the

BaseRowSet

constants indicating the type of stream being set.

NOTE: The method

getParams

is called internally by

RowSet

implementations extending this class; it is not normally called by an
application programmer directly.

5.0 Event Notification

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the event notification
mechanism for rowsets. It contains the field

listeners

, methods for adding and removing listeners, and
methods for notifying listeners of changes.

A listener is an object that has implemented the

RowSetListener

interface.
If it has been added to a

RowSet

object's list of listeners, it will be notified
when an event occurs on that

RowSet

object. Each listener's
implementation of the

RowSetListener

methods defines what that object
will do when it is notified that an event has occurred.

There are three possible events for a

RowSet

object:

- the cursor moves

an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)

the contents of the entire

RowSet

object are changed

The

BaseRowSet

method used for the notification indicates the
type of event that has occurred. For example, the method

notifyRowChanged

indicates that a row has been updated,
deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification methods creates a

RowSetEvent

object, which is supplied to the listener in order to
identify the

RowSet

object on which the event occurred.
What the listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how it was
implemented.

6.0 Default Behavior

A default

BaseRowSet

object is initialized with many starting values.

The following is true of a default

RowSet

instance that extends
the

BaseRowSet

class:

- Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes
made by others.

Is updatable.

Does not show rows that have been deleted.

Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to
execute the

RowSet

object's command.

Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.

Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This
limit applies only to columns that hold values of the
following types:

BINARY

,

VARBINARY

,

LONGVARBINARY

,

CHAR

,

VARCHAR

,
and

LONGVARCHAR

.

Will not see uncommitted data (make "dirty" reads).

Has escape processing turned on.

Has its connection's type map set to

null

.

Has an empty

Vector

object for storing the values set
for the placeholder parameters in the

RowSet

object's command.

If other values are desired, an application must set the property values
explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number
of rows for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

to 500.

```java
crs.setMaxRows(500);
```

Methods implemented in extensions of this

BaseRowSet

class

must

throw an

SQLException

object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if the
extending class overrides and reimplements any

BaseRowSet

method and encounters
connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method

may

in addition throw an

SQLException

object for that reason.

The

2.0 Setting Properties

All rowsets maintain a set of properties, which will usually be set using
a tool. The number and kinds of properties a rowset has will vary,
depending on what the

RowSet

implementation does and how it gets
its data. For example,
rowsets that get their data from a

ResultSet

object need to
set the properties that are required for making a database connection.
If a

RowSet

object uses the

DriverManager

facility to make a
connection, it needs to set a property for the JDBC URL that identifies the
appropriate driver, and it needs to set the properties that give the
user name and password.
If, on the other hand, the rowset uses a

DataSource

object
to make the connection, which is the preferred method, it does not need to
set the property for the JDBC URL. Instead, it needs to set the property
for the logical name of the data source along with the properties for
the user name and password.

NOTE: In order to use a

DataSource

object for making a
connection, the

DataSource

object must have been registered
with a naming service that uses the Java Naming and Directory
Interface™ (JNDI) API. This registration
is usually done by a person acting in the capacity of a system administrator.

3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters

When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a command (a query)
that produces a

ResultSet

object. This query is the command that is set
for the

RowSet

object's command property. The rowset populates itself with data by reading the
data from the

ResultSet

object into itself. If the query
contains placeholders for values to be set, the

BaseRowSet

setter methods
are used to set these values. All setter methods allow these values to be set
to

null

if required.

The following code fragment illustrates how the

CachedRowSet

™
object

crs

might have its command property set. Note that if a
tool is used to set properties, this is the code that the tool would use.

```java
crs.setCommand("SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?");
```

In this example, the values for

CREDIT_LIMIT

and

REGION

are placeholder parameters, which are indicated with a
question mark (?). The first question mark is placeholder parameter number

1

, the second question mark is placeholder parameter number

2

, and so on. Any placeholder parameters must be set with
values before the query can be executed. To set these
placeholder parameters, the

BaseRowSet

class provides a set of setter
methods, similar to those provided by the

PreparedStatement

interface, for setting values of each data type. A

RowSet

object stores the
parameter values internally, and its

execute

method uses them internally
to set values for the placeholder parameters
before it sends the command to the DBMS to be executed.

The following code fragment demonstrates
setting the two parameters in the query from the previous example.

```java
crs.setInt(1, 5000);
crs.setString(2, "West");
```

If the

execute

method is called at this point, the query
sent to the DBMS will be:

```java
"SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'"
```

NOTE: Setting

Array

,

Clob

,

Blob

and

Ref

objects as a command parameter, stores these values as

SerialArray

,

SerialClob

,

SerialBlob

and

SerialRef

objects respectively.

4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes

NOTE: The

BaseRowSet

class provides two kinds of setter methods,
those that set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter
methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder parameters.

The placeholder parameters set with the

BaseRowSet

setter methods
are stored as objects in an internal

Hashtable

object.
Primitives are stored as their

Object

type. For example,

byte

is stored as

Byte

object, and

int

is stored as
an

Integer

object.
When the method

execute

is called, the values in the

Hashtable

object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder
parameters in the command.

A call to the method

getParams

returns the values stored in the

Hashtable

object as an array of

Object

instances.
An element in this array may be a simple

Object

instance or an
array (which is a type of

Object

). The particular setter method used
determines whether an element in this array is an

Object

or an array.

The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two parameters,
with the first parameter
indicating which placeholder parameter is to be set, and the second parameter
giving the value to be set. Methods such as

setInt

,

setString

,

setBoolean

, and

setLong

fall into
this category. After these methods have been called, a call to the method

getParams

will return an array with the values that have been set. Each
element in the array is an

Object

instance representing the
values that have been set. The order of these values in the array is determined by the

int

(the first parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the
array are the values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method.
In other words, the first element in the array is the value
to be set for the first placeholder parameter in the

RowSet

object's
command. The second element is the value to
be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.

Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the value to be set.
When the method

getParams

is called after one of these setter methods has
been used, the elements in the array will themselves be arrays to accommodate the
additional information. In this category, the method

setNull

is a special case
because one version takes only
two parameters (

setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)

). Nevertheless,
it requires
an array to contain the information that will be passed to the driver and DBMS. The first
element in this array is the value to be set, which is

null

, and the
second element is the

int

supplied for

sqlType

, which
indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to

null

. This information
is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to ensure that applications
are portable.
The other version is intended to be used when the value to be set to

null

is a user-defined type. It takes three parameters
(

setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName)

) and also
requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the driver and DBMS.
The first two elements in this array are the same as for the first version of

setNull

. The third element,

typeName

, gives the SQL name of
the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods, the number of the
placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by

getParams

. So, for example, if the parameter
supplied to

setNull

is

2

, the second element in the array
returned by

getParams

will be an array of two or three elements.

Some methods, such as

setObject

and

setDate

have versions
that take more than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information
to the driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods

setDate

,

setTime

, and

setTimestamp

can take a

Calendar

object as their third parameter. If the DBMS does not store time zone information,
the driver uses the

Calendar

object to construct the

Date

,

Time

, or

Timestamp

object being set. As is true with other
methods that provide additional information, the element in the array returned
by

getParams

is an array instead of a simple

Object

instance.

The methods

setAsciiStream

,

setBinaryStream

,

setCharacterStream

, and

setUnicodeStream

(which is
deprecated, so applications should use

getCharacterStream

instead)
take three parameters, so for them, the element in the array returned by

getParams

is also an array. What is different about these setter
methods is that in addition to the information provided by parameters, the array contains
one of the

BaseRowSet

constants indicating the type of stream being set.

NOTE: The method

getParams

is called internally by

RowSet

implementations extending this class; it is not normally called by an
application programmer directly.

5.0 Event Notification

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the event notification
mechanism for rowsets. It contains the field

listeners

, methods for adding and removing listeners, and
methods for notifying listeners of changes.

A listener is an object that has implemented the

RowSetListener

interface.
If it has been added to a

RowSet

object's list of listeners, it will be notified
when an event occurs on that

RowSet

object. Each listener's
implementation of the

RowSetListener

methods defines what that object
will do when it is notified that an event has occurred.

There are three possible events for a

RowSet

object:

- the cursor moves

an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)

the contents of the entire

RowSet

object are changed

The

BaseRowSet

method used for the notification indicates the
type of event that has occurred. For example, the method

notifyRowChanged

indicates that a row has been updated,
deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification methods creates a

RowSetEvent

object, which is supplied to the listener in order to
identify the

RowSet

object on which the event occurred.
What the listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how it was
implemented.

6.0 Default Behavior

A default

BaseRowSet

object is initialized with many starting values.

The following is true of a default

RowSet

instance that extends
the

BaseRowSet

class:

- Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes
made by others.

Is updatable.

Does not show rows that have been deleted.

Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to
execute the

RowSet

object's command.

Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.

Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This
limit applies only to columns that hold values of the
following types:

BINARY

,

VARBINARY

,

LONGVARBINARY

,

CHAR

,

VARCHAR

,
and

LONGVARCHAR

.

Will not see uncommitted data (make "dirty" reads).

Has escape processing turned on.

Has its connection's type map set to

null

.

Has an empty

Vector

object for storing the values set
for the placeholder parameters in the

RowSet

object's command.

If other values are desired, an application must set the property values
explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number
of rows for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

to 500.

```java
crs.setMaxRows(500);
```

Methods implemented in extensions of this

BaseRowSet

class

must

throw an

SQLException

object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if the
extending class overrides and reimplements any

BaseRowSet

method and encounters
connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method

may

in addition throw an

SQLException

object for that reason.

#### 1.0 Overview

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the following:

- Properties

- Fields for storing current properties

Methods for getting and setting properties

Event notification

A complete set of setter methods

for setting the parameters in a

RowSet

object's command

Streams

- Fields for storing stream instances

Constants for indicating the type of a stream

2.0 Setting Properties

All rowsets maintain a set of properties, which will usually be set using
a tool. The number and kinds of properties a rowset has will vary,
depending on what the

RowSet

implementation does and how it gets
its data. For example,
rowsets that get their data from a

ResultSet

object need to
set the properties that are required for making a database connection.
If a

RowSet

object uses the

DriverManager

facility to make a
connection, it needs to set a property for the JDBC URL that identifies the
appropriate driver, and it needs to set the properties that give the
user name and password.
If, on the other hand, the rowset uses a

DataSource

object
to make the connection, which is the preferred method, it does not need to
set the property for the JDBC URL. Instead, it needs to set the property
for the logical name of the data source along with the properties for
the user name and password.

NOTE: In order to use a

DataSource

object for making a
connection, the

DataSource

object must have been registered
with a naming service that uses the Java Naming and Directory
Interface™ (JNDI) API. This registration
is usually done by a person acting in the capacity of a system administrator.

3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters

When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a command (a query)
that produces a

ResultSet

object. This query is the command that is set
for the

RowSet

object's command property. The rowset populates itself with data by reading the
data from the

ResultSet

object into itself. If the query
contains placeholders for values to be set, the

BaseRowSet

setter methods
are used to set these values. All setter methods allow these values to be set
to

null

if required.

The following code fragment illustrates how the

CachedRowSet

™
object

crs

might have its command property set. Note that if a
tool is used to set properties, this is the code that the tool would use.

```java
crs.setCommand("SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?");
```

In this example, the values for

CREDIT_LIMIT

and

REGION

are placeholder parameters, which are indicated with a
question mark (?). The first question mark is placeholder parameter number

1

, the second question mark is placeholder parameter number

2

, and so on. Any placeholder parameters must be set with
values before the query can be executed. To set these
placeholder parameters, the

BaseRowSet

class provides a set of setter
methods, similar to those provided by the

PreparedStatement

interface, for setting values of each data type. A

RowSet

object stores the
parameter values internally, and its

execute

method uses them internally
to set values for the placeholder parameters
before it sends the command to the DBMS to be executed.

The following code fragment demonstrates
setting the two parameters in the query from the previous example.

```java
crs.setInt(1, 5000);
crs.setString(2, "West");
```

If the

execute

method is called at this point, the query
sent to the DBMS will be:

```java
"SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'"
```

NOTE: Setting

Array

,

Clob

,

Blob

and

Ref

objects as a command parameter, stores these values as

SerialArray

,

SerialClob

,

SerialBlob

and

SerialRef

objects respectively.

4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes

NOTE: The

BaseRowSet

class provides two kinds of setter methods,
those that set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter
methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder parameters.

The placeholder parameters set with the

BaseRowSet

setter methods
are stored as objects in an internal

Hashtable

object.
Primitives are stored as their

Object

type. For example,

byte

is stored as

Byte

object, and

int

is stored as
an

Integer

object.
When the method

execute

is called, the values in the

Hashtable

object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder
parameters in the command.

A call to the method

getParams

returns the values stored in the

Hashtable

object as an array of

Object

instances.
An element in this array may be a simple

Object

instance or an
array (which is a type of

Object

). The particular setter method used
determines whether an element in this array is an

Object

or an array.

The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two parameters,
with the first parameter
indicating which placeholder parameter is to be set, and the second parameter
giving the value to be set. Methods such as

setInt

,

setString

,

setBoolean

, and

setLong

fall into
this category. After these methods have been called, a call to the method

getParams

will return an array with the values that have been set. Each
element in the array is an

Object

instance representing the
values that have been set. The order of these values in the array is determined by the

int

(the first parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the
array are the values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method.
In other words, the first element in the array is the value
to be set for the first placeholder parameter in the

RowSet

object's
command. The second element is the value to
be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.

Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the value to be set.
When the method

getParams

is called after one of these setter methods has
been used, the elements in the array will themselves be arrays to accommodate the
additional information. In this category, the method

setNull

is a special case
because one version takes only
two parameters (

setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)

). Nevertheless,
it requires
an array to contain the information that will be passed to the driver and DBMS. The first
element in this array is the value to be set, which is

null

, and the
second element is the

int

supplied for

sqlType

, which
indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to

null

. This information
is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to ensure that applications
are portable.
The other version is intended to be used when the value to be set to

null

is a user-defined type. It takes three parameters
(

setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName)

) and also
requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the driver and DBMS.
The first two elements in this array are the same as for the first version of

setNull

. The third element,

typeName

, gives the SQL name of
the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods, the number of the
placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by

getParams

. So, for example, if the parameter
supplied to

setNull

is

2

, the second element in the array
returned by

getParams

will be an array of two or three elements.

Some methods, such as

setObject

and

setDate

have versions
that take more than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information
to the driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods

setDate

,

setTime

, and

setTimestamp

can take a

Calendar

object as their third parameter. If the DBMS does not store time zone information,
the driver uses the

Calendar

object to construct the

Date

,

Time

, or

Timestamp

object being set. As is true with other
methods that provide additional information, the element in the array returned
by

getParams

is an array instead of a simple

Object

instance.

The methods

setAsciiStream

,

setBinaryStream

,

setCharacterStream

, and

setUnicodeStream

(which is
deprecated, so applications should use

getCharacterStream

instead)
take three parameters, so for them, the element in the array returned by

getParams

is also an array. What is different about these setter
methods is that in addition to the information provided by parameters, the array contains
one of the

BaseRowSet

constants indicating the type of stream being set.

NOTE: The method

getParams

is called internally by

RowSet

implementations extending this class; it is not normally called by an
application programmer directly.

5.0 Event Notification

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the event notification
mechanism for rowsets. It contains the field

listeners

, methods for adding and removing listeners, and
methods for notifying listeners of changes.

A listener is an object that has implemented the

RowSetListener

interface.
If it has been added to a

RowSet

object's list of listeners, it will be notified
when an event occurs on that

RowSet

object. Each listener's
implementation of the

RowSetListener

methods defines what that object
will do when it is notified that an event has occurred.

There are three possible events for a

RowSet

object:

- the cursor moves

an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)

the contents of the entire

RowSet

object are changed

The

BaseRowSet

method used for the notification indicates the
type of event that has occurred. For example, the method

notifyRowChanged

indicates that a row has been updated,
deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification methods creates a

RowSetEvent

object, which is supplied to the listener in order to
identify the

RowSet

object on which the event occurred.
What the listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how it was
implemented.

6.0 Default Behavior

A default

BaseRowSet

object is initialized with many starting values.

The following is true of a default

RowSet

instance that extends
the

BaseRowSet

class:

- Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes

Is updatable.

Does not show rows that have been deleted.

Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to
execute the

RowSet

object's command.

Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.

Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This
limit applies only to columns that hold values of the
following types:

BINARY

,

VARBINARY

LONGVARBINARY

,

CHAR

,

,
and

LONGVARCHAR

.

Will not see uncommitted data (make "dirty" reads).

Has escape processing turned on.

Has its connection's type map set to

null

.

Has an empty

Vector

object for storing the values set
for the placeholder parameters in the

RowSet

object's command.

If other values are desired, an application must set the property values
explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number
of rows for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

to 500.

```java
crs.setMaxRows(500);
```

Methods implemented in extensions of this

BaseRowSet

class

must

throw an

SQLException

object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if the
extending class overrides and reimplements any

BaseRowSet

method and encounters
connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method

may

in addition throw an

SQLException

object for that reason.

3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters

When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a command (a query)
that produces a

ResultSet

object. This query is the command that is set
for the

RowSet

object's command property. The rowset populates itself with data by reading the

two parameters (

setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)

). Nevertheless,
it requires
an array to contain the information that will be passed to the driver and DBMS. The first
element in this array is the value to be set, which is

null

, and the
second element is the

int

supplied for

sqlType

, which
indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to

null

. This information
is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to ensure that applications
are portable.
The other version is intended to be used when the value to be set to

null

is a user-defined type. It takes three parameters
(

setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName)

) and also
requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the driver and DBMS.
The first two elements in this array are the same as for the first version of

setNull

. The third element,

typeName

, gives the SQL name of
the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods, the number of the
placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by

getParams

. So, for example, if the parameter
supplied to

setNull

is

2

, the second element in the array
returned by

getParams

will be an array of two or three elements.

Some methods, such as

setObject

and

setDate

have versions
that take more than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information
to the driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods

setDate

,

setTime

, and

setTimestamp

can take a

Calendar

object as their third parameter. If the DBMS does not store time zone information,
the driver uses the

Calendar

object to construct the

Date

,

Time

, or

Timestamp

object being set. As is true with other
methods that provide additional information, the element in the array returned
by

getParams

is an array instead of a simple

Object

instance.

The methods

setAsciiStream

,

setBinaryStream

,

setCharacterStream

, and

setUnicodeStream

(which is
deprecated, so applications should use

getCharacterStream

instead)
take three parameters, so for them, the element in the array returned by

getParams

is also an array. What is different about these setter
methods is that in addition to the information provided by parameters, the array contains
one of the

BaseRowSet

constants indicating the type of stream being set.

NOTE: The method

getParams

is called internally by

RowSet

implementations extending this class; it is not normally called by an
application programmer directly.

5.0 Event Notification

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the event notification
mechanism for rowsets. It contains the field

listeners

, methods for adding and removing listeners, and
methods for notifying listeners of changes.

A listener is an object that has implemented the

RowSetListener

interface.
If it has been added to a

RowSet

object's list of listeners, it will be notified
when an event occurs on that

RowSet

object. Each listener's
implementation of the

RowSetListener

methods defines what that object
will do when it is notified that an event has occurred.

There are three possible events for a

RowSet

object:

- the cursor moves

an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)

the contents of the entire

RowSet

object are changed

The

BaseRowSet

method used for the notification indicates the
type of event that has occurred. For example, the method

notifyRowChanged

indicates that a row has been updated,
deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification methods creates a

RowSetEvent

object, which is supplied to the listener in order to
identify the

RowSet

object on which the event occurred.
What the listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how it was
implemented.

6.0 Default Behavior

A default

BaseRowSet

object is initialized with many starting values.

The following is true of a default

RowSet

instance that extends
the

BaseRowSet

class:

- Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes
made by others.

Is updatable.

Does not show rows that have been deleted.

Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to
execute the

RowSet

object's command.

Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.

Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This
limit applies only to columns that hold values of the
following types:

BINARY

,

VARBINARY

,

LONGVARBINARY

,

CHAR

,

VARCHAR

,
and

LONGVARCHAR

.

Will not see uncommitted data (make "dirty" reads).

Has escape processing turned on.

Has its connection's type map set to

null

.

Has an empty

Vector

object for storing the values set
for the placeholder parameters in the

RowSet

object's command.

If other values are desired, an application must set the property values
explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number
of rows for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

to 500.

```java
crs.setMaxRows(500);
```

Methods implemented in extensions of this

BaseRowSet

class

must

throw an

SQLException

object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if the
extending class overrides and reimplements any

BaseRowSet

method and encounters
connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method

may

in addition throw an

SQLException

object for that reason.

crs.setCommand("SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?");

In this example, the values for

CREDIT_LIMIT

and

REGION

are placeholder parameters, which are indicated with a
question mark (?). The first question mark is placeholder parameter number

1

, the second question mark is placeholder parameter number

2

, and so on. Any placeholder parameters must be set with
values before the query can be executed. To set these
placeholder parameters, the

BaseRowSet

class provides a set of setter
methods, similar to those provided by the

PreparedStatement

interface, for setting values of each data type. A

RowSet

object stores the
parameter values internally, and its

execute

method uses them internally
to set values for the placeholder parameters
before it sends the command to the DBMS to be executed.

The following code fragment demonstrates
setting the two parameters in the query from the previous example.

```java
crs.setInt(1, 5000);
crs.setString(2, "West");
```

If the

execute

method is called at this point, the query
sent to the DBMS will be:

```java
"SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'"
```

NOTE: Setting

Array

,

Clob

,

Blob

and

Ref

objects as a command parameter, stores these values as

SerialArray

,

SerialClob

,

SerialBlob

and

SerialRef

objects respectively.

4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes

NOTE: The

BaseRowSet

class provides two kinds of setter methods,
those that set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter
methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder parameters.

The placeholder parameters set with the

BaseRowSet

setter methods
are stored as objects in an internal

Hashtable

object.
Primitives are stored as their

Object

type. For example,

byte

is stored as

Byte

object, and

int

is stored as
an

Integer

object.
When the method

execute

is called, the values in the

Hashtable

object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder
parameters in the command.

A call to the method

getParams

returns the values stored in the

Hashtable

object as an array of

Object

instances.
An element in this array may be a simple

Object

instance or an
array (which is a type of

Object

). The particular setter method used
determines whether an element in this array is an

Object

or an array.

The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two parameters,
with the first parameter
indicating which placeholder parameter is to be set, and the second parameter
giving the value to be set. Methods such as

setInt

,

setString

,

setBoolean

, and

setLong

fall into
this category. After these methods have been called, a call to the method

getParams

will return an array with the values that have been set. Each
element in the array is an

Object

instance representing the
values that have been set. The order of these values in the array is determined by the

int

(the first parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the
array are the values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method.
In other words, the first element in the array is the value
to be set for the first placeholder parameter in the

RowSet

object's
command. The second element is the value to
be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.

Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the value to be set.
When the method

getParams

is called after one of these setter methods has
been used, the elements in the array will themselves be arrays to accommodate the
additional information. In this category, the method

setNull

is a special case
because one version takes only
two parameters (

setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)

). Nevertheless,
it requires
an array to contain the information that will be passed to the driver and DBMS. The first
element in this array is the value to be set, which is

null

, and the
second element is the

int

supplied for

sqlType

, which
indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to

null

. This information
is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to ensure that applications
are portable.
The other version is intended to be used when the value to be set to

null

is a user-defined type. It takes three parameters
(

setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName)

) and also
requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the driver and DBMS.
The first two elements in this array are the same as for the first version of

setNull

. The third element,

typeName

, gives the SQL name of
the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods, the number of the
placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by

getParams

. So, for example, if the parameter
supplied to

setNull

is

2

, the second element in the array
returned by

getParams

will be an array of two or three elements.

Some methods, such as

setObject

and

setDate

have versions
that take more than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information
to the driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods

setDate

,

setTime

, and

setTimestamp

can take a

Calendar

object as their third parameter. If the DBMS does not store time zone information,
the driver uses the

Calendar

object to construct the

Date

,

Time

, or

Timestamp

object being set. As is true with other
methods that provide additional information, the element in the array returned
by

getParams

is an array instead of a simple

Object

instance.

The methods

setAsciiStream

,

setBinaryStream

,

setCharacterStream

, and

setUnicodeStream

(which is
deprecated, so applications should use

getCharacterStream

instead)
take three parameters, so for them, the element in the array returned by

getParams

notifyRowChanged

indicates that a row has been updated,
deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification methods creates a

RowSetEvent

method is called at this point, the query
sent to the DBMS will be:

"SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
"WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'"
```

RowSet

object's command.

If other values are desired, an application must set the property values
explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number
of rows for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

to 500.

```java
crs.setMaxRows(500);
```

Methods implemented in extensions of this

BaseRowSet

class

must

throw an

SQLException

object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if the
extending class overrides and reimplements any

BaseRowSet

method and encounters
connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method

may

in addition throw an

SQLException

object for that reason.

A call to the method

getParams

returns the values stored in the

Hashtable

object as an array of

Object

instances.
An element in this array may be a simple

Object

instance or an
array (which is a type of

Object

). The particular setter method used
determines whether an element in this array is an

Object

or an array.

The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two parameters,
with the first parameter
indicating which placeholder parameter is to be set, and the second parameter
giving the value to be set. Methods such as

setInt

,

setString

,

setBoolean

, and

setLong

fall into
this category. After these methods have been called, a call to the method

getParams

will return an array with the values that have been set. Each
element in the array is an

Object

instance representing the
values that have been set. The order of these values in the array is determined by the

int

(the first parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the
array are the values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method.
In other words, the first element in the array is the value
to be set for the first placeholder parameter in the

RowSet

object's
command. The second element is the value to
be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.

Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the value to be set.
When the method

getParams

is called after one of these setter methods has
been used, the elements in the array will themselves be arrays to accommodate the
additional information. In this category, the method

setNull

is a special case
because one version takes only
two parameters (

setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)

). Nevertheless,
it requires
an array to contain the information that will be passed to the driver and DBMS. The first
element in this array is the value to be set, which is

null

, and the
second element is the

int

supplied for

sqlType

, which
indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to

null

. This information
is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to ensure that applications
are portable.
The other version is intended to be used when the value to be set to

null

is a user-defined type. It takes three parameters
(

setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName)

) and also
requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the driver and DBMS.
The first two elements in this array are the same as for the first version of

setNull

. The third element,

typeName

, gives the SQL name of
the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods, the number of the
placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by

getParams

. So, for example, if the parameter
supplied to

setNull

is

2

, the second element in the array
returned by

getParams

will be an array of two or three elements.

Some methods, such as

setObject

and

setDate

have versions
that take more than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information
to the driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods

setDate

,

setTime

, and

setTimestamp

can take a

Calendar

object as their third parameter. If the DBMS does not store time zone information,
the driver uses the

Calendar

object to construct the

Date

,

Time

, or

Timestamp

object being set. As is true with other
methods that provide additional information, the element in the array returned
by

getParams

is an array instead of a simple

Object

instance.

The methods

setAsciiStream

,

setBinaryStream

,

setCharacterStream

, and

setUnicodeStream

(which is
deprecated, so applications should use

getCharacterStream

instead)
take three parameters, so for them, the element in the array returned by

getParams

is also an array. What is different about these setter
methods is that in addition to the information provided by parameters, the array contains
one of the

BaseRowSet

constants indicating the type of stream being set.

NOTE: The method

getParams

is called internally by

RowSet

implementations extending this class; it is not normally called by an
application programmer directly.

5.0 Event Notification

The

BaseRowSet

class provides the event notification
mechanism for rowsets. It contains the field

listeners

, methods for adding and removing listeners, and
methods for notifying listeners of changes.

A listener is an object that has implemented the

RowSetListener

interface.
If it has been added to a

RowSet

object's list of listeners, it will be notified
when an event occurs on that

RowSet

object. Each listener's
implementation of the

RowSetListener

methods defines what that object
will do when it is notified that an event has occurred.

There are three possible events for a

RowSet

object:

- the cursor moves

an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)

the contents of the entire

RowSet

object are changed

The

BaseRowSet

method used for the notification indicates the
type of event that has occurred. For example, the method

notifyRowChanged

indicates that a row has been updated,
deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification methods creates a

RowSetEvent

object, which is supplied to the listener in order to
identify the

RowSet

object on which the event occurred.
What the listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how it was
implemented.

6.0 Default Behavior

A default

BaseRowSet

object is initialized with many starting values.

The following is true of a default

RowSet

instance that extends
the

BaseRowSet

class:

- Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes
made by others.

Is updatable.

Does not show rows that have been deleted.

Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to
execute the

RowSet

object's command.

Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.

Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This
limit applies only to columns that hold values of the
following types:

BINARY

,

VARBINARY

,

LONGVARBINARY

,

CHAR

,

VARCHAR

,
and

LONGVARCHAR

.

Will not see uncommitted data (make "dirty" reads).

Has escape processing turned on.

Has its connection's type map set to

null

.

Has an empty

Vector

object for storing the values set
for the placeholder parameters in the

RowSet

object's command.

If other values are desired, an application must set the property values
explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number
of rows for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

to 500.

```java
crs.setMaxRows(500);
```

Methods implemented in extensions of this

BaseRowSet

class

must

throw an

SQLException

object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if the
extending class overrides and reimplements any

BaseRowSet

method and encounters
connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method

may

in addition throw an

#### 5.0 Event Notification

A listener is an object that has implemented the

RowSetListener

interface.
If it has been added to a

RowSet

object's list of listeners, it will be notified
when an event occurs on that

RowSet

object. Each listener's
implementation of the

RowSetListener

methods defines what that object
will do when it is notified that an event has occurred.

There are three possible events for a

RowSet

object:

- the cursor moves

an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)

the contents of the entire

RowSet

object are changed

The

BaseRowSet

method used for the notification indicates the
type of event that has occurred. For example, the method

notifyRowChanged

indicates that a row has been updated,
deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification methods creates a

RowSetEvent

object, which is supplied to the listener in order to
identify the

RowSet

object on which the event occurred.
What the listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how it was
implemented.

6.0 Default Behavior

A default

BaseRowSet

object is initialized with many starting values.

The following is true of a default

RowSet

instance that extends
the

BaseRowSet

class:

- Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes
made by others.

Is updatable.

Does not show rows that have been deleted.

Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to
execute the

RowSet

object's command.

Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.

Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This
limit applies only to columns that hold values of the
following types:

BINARY

,

VARBINARY

,

LONGVARBINARY

,

CHAR

,

VARCHAR

,
and

LONGVARCHAR

.

Will not see uncommitted data (make "dirty" reads).

Has escape processing turned on.

Has its connection's type map set to

null

.

Has an empty

Vector

object for storing the values set
for the placeholder parameters in the

RowSet

object's command.

If other values are desired, an application must set the property values
explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number
of rows for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

to 500.

```java
crs.setMaxRows(500);
```

Methods implemented in extensions of this

BaseRowSet

object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if the

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- BaseRowSet

```java
public BaseRowSet()
```

Constructs a new

BaseRowSet

object initialized with
a default

Vector

object for its

listeners

field. The other default values with which it is initialized are listed
in Section 6.0 of the class comment for this class.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- initParams

```java
protected void initParams()
```

Performs the necessary internal configurations and initializations
to allow any JDBC

RowSet

implementation to start using
the standard facilities provided by a

BaseRowSet

instance. This method

should

be called after the

RowSet

object
has been instantiated to correctly initialize all parameters. This method

should

never be called by an application, but is called from with
a

RowSet

implementation extending this class.

- addRowSetListener

```java
public void addRowSetListener​(
RowSetListener
listener)
```

The listener will be notified whenever an event occurs on this

RowSet

object.

A listener might, for example, be a table or graph that needs to
be updated in order to accurately reflect the current state of
the

RowSet

object.

Note

: if the

RowSetListener

object is

null

, this method silently discards the

null

value and does not add a null reference to the set of listeners.

Note

: if the listener is already set, and the new

RowSetListener

instance is added to the set of listeners already registered to receive
event notifications from this

RowSet

.

**Parameters:** listener

- an object that has implemented the

javax.sql.RowSetListener

interface and wants to be notified
of any events that occur on this

RowSet

object; May be
null.
**See Also:** removeRowSetListener(javax.sql.RowSetListener)

- removeRowSetListener

```java
public void removeRowSetListener​(
RowSetListener
listener)
```

Removes the designated object from this

RowSet

object's list of listeners.
If the given argument is not a registered listener, this method
does nothing.

Note

: if the

RowSetListener

object is

null

, this method silently discards the

null

value.

**Parameters:** listener

- a

RowSetListener

object that is on the list
of listeners for this

RowSet

object
**See Also:** addRowSetListener(javax.sql.RowSetListener)

- notifyCursorMoved

```java
protected void notifyCursorMoved()
throws
SQLException
```

Notifies all of the listeners registered with this

RowSet

object that its cursor has moved.

When an application calls a method to move the cursor,
that method moves the cursor and then calls this method
internally. An application

should

never invoke
this method directly.

**Throws:** SQLException

- if the class extending the

BaseRowSet

abstract class does not implement the

RowSet

interface or
one of it's sub-interfaces.

- notifyRowChanged

```java
protected void notifyRowChanged()
throws
SQLException
```

Notifies all of the listeners registered with this

RowSet

object that
one of its rows has changed.

When an application calls a method that changes a row, such as
the

CachedRowSet

methods

insertRow

,

updateRow

, or

deleteRow

,
that method calls

notifyRowChanged

internally. An application

should

never invoke
this method directly.

**Throws:** SQLException

- if the class extending the

BaseRowSet

abstract class does not implement the

RowSet

interface or
one of it's sub-interfaces.

- notifyRowSetChanged

```java
protected void notifyRowSetChanged()
throws
SQLException
```

Notifies all of the listeners registered with this

RowSet

object that its entire contents have changed.

When an application calls methods that change the entire contents
of the

RowSet

object, such as the

CachedRowSet

methods

execute

,

populate

,

restoreOriginal

,
or

release

, that method calls

notifyRowSetChanged

internally (either directly or indirectly). An application

should

never invoke this method directly.

**Throws:** SQLException

- if the class extending the

BaseRowSet

abstract class does not implement the

RowSet

interface or
one of it's sub-interfaces.

- getCommand

```java
public
String
getCommand()
```

Retrieves the SQL query that is the command for this

RowSet

object. The command property contains the query that
will be executed to populate this

RowSet

object.

The SQL query returned by this method is used by

RowSet

methods
such as

execute

and

populate

, which may be implemented
by any class that extends the

BaseRowSet

abstract class and
implements one or more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

The command is used by the

RowSet

object's
reader to obtain a

ResultSet

object. The reader then
reads the data from the

ResultSet

object and uses it to
to populate this

RowSet

object.

The default value for the

command

property is

null

.

**Returns:** the

String

that is the value for this

RowSet

object's

command

property;
may be

null
**See Also:** setCommand(java.lang.String)

- setCommand

```java
public void setCommand​(
String
cmd)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets this

RowSet

object's

command

property to
the given

String

object and clears the parameters, if any,
that were set for the previous command.

The

command

property may not be needed if the

RowSet

object gets its data from a source that does not support commands,
such as a spreadsheet or other tabular file.
Thus, this property is optional and may be

null

.

**Parameters:** cmd

- a

String

object containing an SQL query
that will be set as this

RowSet

object's command
property; may be

null

but may not be an empty string
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an empty string is provided as the command value
**See Also:** getCommand()

- getUrl

```java
public
String
getUrl()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves the JDBC URL that this

RowSet

object's

javax.sql.Reader

object uses to make a connection
with a relational database using a JDBC technology-enabled driver.

The

Url

property will be

null

if the underlying data
source is a non-SQL data source, such as a spreadsheet or an XML
data source.

**Returns:** a

String

object that contains the JDBC URL
used to establish the connection for this

RowSet

object; may be

null

(default value) if not set
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs retrieving the URL value
**See Also:** setUrl(java.lang.String)

- setUrl

```java
public void setUrl​(
String
url)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the Url property for this

RowSet

object
to the given

String

object and sets the dataSource name
property to

null

. The Url property is a
JDBC URL that is used when
the connection is created using a JDBC technology-enabled driver
("JDBC driver") and the

DriverManager

.
The correct JDBC URL for the specific driver to be used can be found
in the driver documentation. Although there are guidelines for how
a JDBC URL is formed,
a driver vendor can specify any

String

object except
one with a length of

0

(an empty string).

Setting the Url property is optional if connections are established using
a

DataSource

object instead of the

DriverManager

.
The driver will use either the URL property or the
dataSourceName property to create a connection, whichever was
specified most recently. If an application uses a JDBC URL, it
must load a JDBC driver that accepts the JDBC URL before it uses the

RowSet

object to connect to a database. The

RowSet

object will use the URL internally to create a database connection in order
to read or write data.

**Parameters:** url

- a

String

object that contains the JDBC URL
that will be used to establish the connection to a database for this

RowSet

object; may be

null

but must not
be an empty string
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs setting the Url property or the
parameter supplied is a string with a length of

0

(an
empty string)
**See Also:** getUrl()

- getDataSourceName

```java
public
String
getDataSourceName()
```

Returns the logical name that when supplied to a naming service
that uses the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API, will
retrieve a

javax.sql.DataSource

object. This

DataSource

object can be used to establish a connection
to the data source that it represents.

Users should set either the url or the data source name property.
The driver will use the property set most recently to establish a
connection.

**Returns:** a

String

object that identifies the

DataSource

object to be used for making a
connection; if no logical name has been set,

null

is returned.
**See Also:** setDataSourceName(java.lang.String)

- setDataSourceName

```java
public void setDataSourceName​(
String
name)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the

DataSource

name property for this

RowSet

object to the given logical name and sets this

RowSet

object's
Url property to

null

. The name must have been bound to a

DataSource

object in a JNDI naming service so that an
application can do a lookup using that name to retrieve the

DataSource

object bound to it. The

DataSource

object can then be used to establish a connection to the data source it
represents.

Users should set either the Url property or the dataSourceName property.
If both properties are set, the driver will use the property set most recently.

**Parameters:** name

- a

String

object with the name that can be supplied
to a naming service based on JNDI technology to retrieve the

DataSource

object that can be used to get a connection;
may be

null

but must not be an empty string
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an empty string is provided as the

DataSource

name
**See Also:** getDataSourceName()

- getUsername

```java
public
String
getUsername()
```

is not serialized, the username property is set at runtime before
calling the method

execute

.

**Returns:** the

String

object containing the user name that
is supplied to the data source to create a connection; may be

null

(default value) if not set
**See Also:** setUsername(java.lang.String)

- setUsername

```java
public void setUsername​(
String
name)
```

Sets the username property for this

RowSet

object
to the given user name. Because it
is not serialized, the username property is set at run time before
calling the method

execute

.

**Parameters:** name

time-out or if the query time-out value is less than 0

- getShowDeleted

```java
public boolean getShowDeleted()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves a

boolean

indicating whether rows marked
for deletion appear in the set of current rows.
The default value is

false

.

Note: Allowing deleted rows to remain visible complicates the behavior
of some of the methods. However, most

RowSet

object users
can simply ignore this extra detail because only sophisticated
applications will likely want to take advantage of this feature.

**Returns:** true

if deleted rows are visible;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs determining if deleted rows
are visible or not
**See Also:** setShowDeleted(boolean)

- setShowDeleted

```java
public void setShowDeleted​(boolean value)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the property

showDeleted

to the given

boolean

value, which determines whether
rows marked for deletion appear in the set of current rows.

**Parameters:** value

-

true

if deleted rows should be shown;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs setting whether deleted
rows are visible or not
**See Also:** getShowDeleted()

- getEscapeProcessing

```java
public boolean getEscapeProcessing()
throws
SQLException
```

Ascertains whether escape processing is enabled for this

RowSet

object.

**Returns:** true

if escape processing is turned on;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs determining if escape
processing is enabled or not or if the internal escape
processing trigger has not been enabled

- setFetchDirection

```java
public void setFetchDirection​(int direction)
throws
SQLException
```

Gives the driver a performance hint as to the direction in
which the rows in this

RowSet

object will be
processed. The driver may ignore this hint.

A

RowSet

object inherits the default properties of the

ResultSet

object from which it got its data. That

ResultSet

object's default fetch direction is set by
the

Statement

object that created it.

This method applies to a

RowSet

object only while it is
connected to a database using a JDBC driver.

A

RowSet

object may use this method at any time to change
its setting for the fetch direction.

**Parameters:** direction

- one of

ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD

,

ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE

, or

ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN
**Throws:** SQLException

- if (1) the

RowSet

type is

TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY

and the given fetch direction is not

FETCH_FORWARD

or (2) the given fetch direction is not
one of the following:
ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD,
ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE, or
ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN
**See Also:** getFetchDirection()

- getFetchDirection

```java
public int getFetchDirection()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves this

RowSet

object's current setting for the
fetch direction. The default type is

ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD

**Returns:** one of

ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD

,

ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE

, or

ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs in determining the
current fetch direction for fetching rows
**See Also:** setFetchDirection(int)

- setFetchSize

```java
public void setFetchSize​(int rows)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the fetch size for this

RowSet

object to the given number of
rows. The fetch size gives a JDBC technology-enabled driver ("JDBC driver")
a hint as to the
number of rows that should be fetched from the database when more rows
are needed for this

RowSet

object. If the fetch size specified
is zero, the driver ignores the value and is free to make its own best guess
as to what the fetch size should be.

A

RowSet

object inherits the default properties of the

ResultSet

object from which it got its data. That

ResultSet

object's default fetch size is set by
the

Statement

object that created it.

This method applies to a

RowSet

object only while it is
connected to a database using a JDBC driver.
For connected

RowSet

implementations such as

JdbcRowSet

, this method has a direct and immediate effect
on the underlying JDBC driver.

A

RowSet

object may use this method at any time to change
its setting for the fetch size.

For

RowSet

implementations such as

CachedRowSet

, which operate in a disconnected environment,
the

SyncProvider

object being used
may leverage the fetch size to poll the data source and
retrieve a number of rows that do not exceed the fetch size and that may
form a subset of the actual rows returned by the original query. This is
an implementation variance determined by the specific

SyncProvider

object employed by the disconnected

RowSet

object.

**Parameters:** rows

- the number of rows to fetch;

0

to let the
driver decide what the best fetch size is; must not be less
than

0

or more than the maximum number of rows
allowed for this

RowSet

object (the number returned
by a call to the method

getMaxRows()

)
**Throws:** SQLException

- if the specified fetch size is less than

0

or more than the limit for the maximum number of rows
**See Also:** getFetchSize()

- getFetchSize

```java
public int getFetchSize()
throws
SQLException
```

Returns the fetch size for this

RowSet

object. The default
value is zero.

**Returns:** the number of rows suggested as the fetch size when this

RowSet

object
needs more rows from the database
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs determining the number of rows in the
current fetch size
**See Also:** setFetchSize(int)

- getConcurrency

```java
public int getConcurrency()
throws
SQLException
```

Returns the concurrency for this

RowSet

object.
The default is

CONCUR_UPDATABLE

for both connected and
disconnected

RowSet

objects.

An application can call the method

setConcurrency

at any time
to change a

RowSet

object's concurrency.

**Returns:** the concurrency type for this

RowSet

object, which must be one of the following:

ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY

or

ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs getting the concurrency
of this

RowSet

object
**See Also:** setConcurrency(int)

,

isReadOnly()

- setNull

```java
public void setNull​(int parameterIndex,
int sqlType)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to SQL

NULL

.
Note that the parameter's SQL type must be specified using one of the
type codes defined in

java.sql.Types

. This SQL type is
specified in the second parameter.

Note that the second parameter tells the DBMS the data type of the value being
set to

NULL

. Some DBMSs require this information, so it is required
in order to make code more portable.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setNull

has been called will return an

Object

array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is

null

.
The second element is the value set for

sqlType

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to

null

, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
**Parameters:** sqlType

- an

int

that is one of the SQL type codes
defined in the class

Types

. If a non-standard

sqlType

is supplied, this method will not throw a

SQLException

. This allows implicit support for
non-standard SQL types.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or the given
parameter index is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

- setNull

```java
public void setNull​(int parameterIndex,
int sqlType,

String
typeName)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to SQL

NULL

.

Although this version of the method

setNull

is intended
for user-defined
and

REF

parameters, this method may be used to set a null
parameter for any JDBC type. The following are user-defined types:

STRUCT

,

DISTINCT

, and

JAVA_OBJECT

,
and named array types.

Note:

To be portable, applications must give the
SQL type code and the fully qualified SQL type name when specifying
a

NULL

user-defined or

REF

parameter.
In the case of a user-defined type, the name is the type name of
the parameter itself. For a

REF

parameter, the name is
the type name of the referenced type. If a JDBC technology-enabled
driver does not need the type code or type name information,
it may ignore it.

If the parameter does not have a user-defined or

REF

type,
the given

typeName

parameter is ignored.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setNull

has been called will return an

Object

array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is

null

.
The second element is the value set for

sqlType

, and the third
element is the value set for

typeName

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to

null

, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

read and sent to the database is not equal to

length

.

When a very large ASCII value is input to a

LONGVARCHAR

parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a

java.io.InputStream

object. A JDBC technology-enabled
driver will read the data from the stream as needed until it reaches
end-of-file. The driver will do any necessary conversion from ASCII to
the database

CHAR

format.

Note:

This stream object can be either a standard
Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the
standard interface.

Note:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after

setAsciiStream

has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
have been set. The element in the array that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is the given

java.io.InputStream

object.
The second element is the value set for

length

.
The third element is an internal

BaseRowSet

constant
specifying that the stream passed to this method is an ASCII stream.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the input stream being set is the value for the second
placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is element number

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
**Parameters:** x

- the Java input stream that contains the ASCII parameter value
**Parameters:** length

- the number of bytes in the stream. This is the number of bytes
the driver will send to the DBMS; lengths of 0 or less are
are undefined but will cause an invalid length exception to be
thrown in the underlying JDBC driver.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs, the parameter index is out of bounds,
or when connected to a data source, the number of bytes the driver reads
and sends to the database is not equal to the number of bytes specified
in

length
**See Also:** getParams()

- setAsciiStream

```java
public void setAsciiStream​(int parameterIndex,

InputStream
x)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter in this

RowSet

object's command
to the given input stream.
When a very large ASCII value is input to a

LONGVARCHAR

parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a

java.io.InputStream

. Data will be read from the stream
as needed until end-of-file is reached. The JDBC driver will
do any necessary conversion from ASCII to the database char format.

Note:

This stream object can either be a standard
Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the
standard interface.

Note:

Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if
it might be more efficient to use a version of

setAsciiStream

which takes a length parameter.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the first parameter is 1, the second is 2, ...
**Parameters:** x

- the Java input stream that contains the ASCII parameter value
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or
this method is called on a closed

PreparedStatement
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not support this method
**Since:** 1.6

object, which will have the specified number of bytes.
The contents of the stream will be read and sent to the database.
This method throws an

SQLException

object if the number of bytes
read and sent to the database is not equal to

length

.

When a very large binary value is input to a

LONGVARBINARY

parameter, it may be more practical
to send it via a

java.io.InputStream

object.
A JDBC technology-enabled driver will read the data from the
stream as needed until it reaches end-of-file.

Note:

This stream object can be either a standard
Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the
standard interface.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

object, which will have the specified
number of bytes. The contents of the stream will be read and sent
to the database.
This method throws an

SQLException

if the number of bytes
read and sent to the database is not equal to

length

.

When a very large Unicode value is input to a

LONGVARCHAR

parameter, it may be more practical
to send it via a

java.io.InputStream

object.
A JDBC technology-enabled driver will read the data from the
stream as needed, until it reaches end-of-file.
The driver will do any necessary conversion from Unicode to the
database

CHAR

format.
The byte format of the Unicode stream must be Java UTF-8, as
defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification.

Note:

This stream object can be either a standard
Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the
standard interface.

This method is deprecated; the method

getCharacterStream

- setObject

```java
public void setObject​(int parameterIndex,

Object
x,
int targetSqlType,
int scale)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to an

Object

in the Java
programming language. The second parameter must be an

Object

type. For integral values, the

java.lang

equivalent
objects should be used. For example, use the class

Integer

for an

int

.

The driver converts this object to the specified
target SQL type before sending it to the database.
If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing

SQLData

), the driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write the object to the SQL
data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class
implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

Struct

, or

Array

,
the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the
corresponding SQL type.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-
specific abstract data types.

setObject

has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is the given

Object

instance, and the
second element is the value set for

targetSqlType

. The
third element is the value set for

scale

, which the driver will
ignore if the type of the object being set is not

java.sql.Types.NUMERIC

or

java.sql.Types.DECIMAL

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the object being set is the value for the second
placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is element number

parameterIndex

-1.

- the

Object

containing the input parameter value;
must be an

Object

type
**Parameters:** targetSqlType

- the SQL type (as defined in

java.sql.Types

)
to be sent to the database. The

scale

argument may
further qualify this type. If a non-standard

targetSqlType

is supplied, this method will not throw a

SQLException

.
This allows implicit support for non-standard SQL types.
**Parameters:** scale

- for the types

java.sql.Types.DECIMAL

and

java.sql.Types.NUMERIC

, this is the number
of digits after the decimal point. For all other types, this
value will be ignored.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs or the parameter index is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

- setObject

```java
public void setObject​(int parameterIndex,

Object
x,
int targetSqlType)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given

Object

value.
This method is like

setObject(int parameterIndex, Object x, int
targetSqlType, int scale)

except that it assumes a scale of zero.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the object being set is the value for the second
placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is element number

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the

Object

containing the input parameter value;
must be an

Object

type
**Parameters:** targetSqlType

- the SQL type (as defined in

java.sql.Types

)
to be sent to the database. If a non-standard

targetSqlType

is supplied, this method will not throw a

SQLException

.
This allows implicit support for non-standard SQL types.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs or the parameter index
is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

- setObject

```java
public void setObject​(int parameterIndex,

Object
x)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to an

Object

in the Java
programming language. The second parameter must be an

Object

type. For integral values, the

java.lang

equivalent
objects should be used. For example, use the class

Integer

for an

int

.

The JDBC specification defines a standard mapping from
Java

Object

types to SQL types. The driver will
use this standard mapping to convert the given object
to its corresponding SQL type before sending it to the database.
If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing

SQLData

), the driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write the object to the SQL
data stream.

If, on the other hand, the object is of a class
implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

Struct

, or

Array

,
the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the
corresponding SQL type.

This method throws an exception if there
is an ambiguity, for example, if the object is of a class
implementing more than one interface.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-specific
abstract data types.

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
**Parameters:** array

- an

Array

object representing an SQL

ARRAY

value; cannot be null. The

Array

object
passed to this method must return a non-null Object for all

getArray()

method calls. A null value will cause a

SQLException

to be thrown.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs; the parameter index is out of
bounds or the

ARRAY

is null
**See Also:** getParams()

- setDate

```java
public void setDate​(int parameterIndex,

Date
x,

Calendar
cal)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to the given

java.sql.Date

object.
When the DBMS does not store time zone information, the driver will use
the given

Calendar

object to construct the SQL

DATE

value to send to the database. With a

Calendar

object, the driver can calculate the date
taking into account a custom time zone. If no

Calendar

object is specified, the driver uses the time zone of the Virtual Machine
that is running the application.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setDate

has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is the given

java.sql.Date

object.
The second element is the value set for

cal

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the date being set is the value for the second
placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
**Parameters:** x

- a

java.sql.Date

object representing an SQL

DATE

value

x,

Calendar
cal)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to the given

java.sql.Time

object. The driver converts this
to an SQL

TIME

value when it sends it to the database.

When the DBMS does not store time zone information, the driver will use
the given

Calendar

object to construct the SQL

TIME

value to send to the database. With a

Calendar

object, the driver can calculate the date
taking into account a custom time zone. If no

Calendar

object is specified, the driver uses the time zone of the Virtual Machine
that is running the application.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setTime

has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is the given

java.sql.Time

object.
The second element is the value set for

cal

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,

- setTimestamp

```java
public void setTimestamp​(int parameterIndex,

Timestamp
x,

Calendar
cal)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to the given

java.sql.Timestamp

object. The driver converts this
to an SQL

TIMESTAMP

value when it sends it to the database.

When the DBMS does not store time zone information, the driver will use
the given

Calendar

object to construct the SQL

TIMESTAMP

value to send to the database. With a

Calendar

object, the driver can calculate the timestamp
taking into account a custom time zone. If no

Calendar

object is specified, the driver uses the time zone of the Virtual Machine
that is running the application.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setTimestamp

has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is the given

object the driver can use to
construct the timestamp
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs or the
parameter index is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

- clearParameters

```java
public void clearParameters()
throws
SQLException
```

Clears all of the current parameter values in this

RowSet

object's internal representation of the parameters to be set in
this

RowSet

object's command when it is executed.

In general, parameter values remain in force for repeated use in
this

RowSet

object's command. Setting a parameter value with the
setter methods automatically clears the value of the
designated parameter and replaces it with the new specified value.

This method is called internally by the

setCommand

method to clear all of the parameters set for the previous command.

Furthermore, this method differs from the

initParams

method in that it maintains the schema of the

RowSet

object.

**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs clearing the parameters

- getParams

```java
public
Object
[] getParams()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves an array containing the parameter values (both Objects and
primitives) that have been set for this

RowSet

object's command and throws an

SQLException

object
if all parameters have not been set. Before the command is sent to the
DBMS to be executed, these parameters will be substituted
for placeholder parameters in the

PreparedStatement

object
that is the command for a

RowSet

implementation extending
the

BaseRowSet

class.

Each element in the array that is returned is an

Object

instance
that contains the values of the parameters supplied to a setter method.
The order of the elements is determined by the value supplied for

parameterIndex

. If the setter method takes only the parameter index
and the value to be set (possibly null), the array element will contain the value to be set
(which will be expressed as an

Object

). If there are additional
parameters, the array element will itself be an array containing the value to be set
plus any additional parameter values supplied to the setter method. If the method
sets a stream, the array element includes the type of stream being supplied to the
method. These additional parameters are for the use of the driver or the DBMS and may or
may not be used.

NOTE: Stored parameter values of types

Array

,

Blob

,

Clob

and

Ref

are returned as

SerialArray

,

SerialBlob

,

SerialClob

and

SerialRef

respectively.

**Returns:** an array of

Object

instances that includes the
parameter values that may be set in this

RowSet

object's
command; an empty array if no parameters have been set
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs retrieving the object array of
parameters of this

RowSet

object or if not all parameters have
been set

- setNull

```java
public void setNull​(
String
parameterName,
int sqlType)
throws
SQLException
```

this method

- setNull

```java
public void setNull​(
String
parameterName,
int sqlType,

String
typeName)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to SQL

NULL

.
This version of the method

setNull

should
be used for user-defined types and REF type parameters. Examples
of user-defined types include: STRUCT, DISTINCT, JAVA_OBJECT, and
named array types.

Note:

To be portable, applications must give the
SQL type code and the fully-qualified SQL type name when specifying
a NULL user-defined or REF parameter. In the case of a user-defined type
the name is the type name of the parameter itself. For a REF
parameter, the name is the type name of the referenced type. If
a JDBC driver does not need the type code or type name information,
it may ignore it.

Although it is intended for user-defined and Ref parameters,
this method may be used to set a null parameter of any JDBC type.
If the parameter does not have a user-defined or REF type, the given
typeName is ignored.

**Parameters:** parameterName

- the name of the parameter
**Parameters:** sqlType

- a value from

java.sql.Types
**Parameters:** typeName

Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given object.
This method is like the method

setObject

above, except that it assumes a scale of zero.

**Parameters:** parameterName

- the name of the parameter
**Parameters:** x

- the object containing the input parameter value
**Parameters:** targetSqlType

- the SQL type (as defined in java.sql.Types) to be
sent to the database
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or
this method is called on a closed

CallableStatement
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if

targetSqlType

is
a

ARRAY

,

BLOB

,

CLOB

,

DATALINK

,

JAVA_OBJECT

,

NCHAR

,

NCLOB

,

NVARCHAR

,

LONGNVARCHAR

,

REF

,

ROWID

,

SQLXML

or

STRUCT

data type and the JDBC driver does not support
this data type
**See Also:** getParams()

- setObject

```java
public void setObject​(
String
parameterName,

Object
x)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given object.
The second parameter must be of type

Object

; therefore, the

java.lang

equivalent objects should be used for built-in types.

The JDBC specification specifies a standard mapping from
Java

Object

types to SQL types. The given argument
will be converted to the corresponding SQL type before being
sent to the database.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-
specific abstract data types, by using a driver-specific Java
type.

If the object is of a class implementing the interface

SQLData

,
the JDBC driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write it to the SQL data stream.
If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

NClob

,

Struct

,

java.net.URL

,
or

Array

, the driver should pass it to the database as a
value of the corresponding SQL type.

This method throws an exception if there is an ambiguity, for example, if the
object is of a class implementing more than one of the interfaces named above.

**Parameters:** parameterName

- the name of the parameter
**Parameters:** x

- the object containing the input parameter value
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs,
this method is called on a closed

CallableStatement

or if the given

Object

parameter is ambiguous
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not support
this method

PreparedStatement

is executed.
This method differs from the

setBinaryStream (int, InputStream, int)

method because it informs the driver that the parameter value should be
sent to the server as a

BLOB

. When the

setBinaryStream

method is used,
the driver may have to do extra work to determine whether the parameter
data should be sent to the server as a

LONGVARBINARY

or a

BLOB

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- index of the first parameter is 1,
the second is 2, ...
**Parameters:** inputStream

- An object that contains the data to set the parameter
value to.
**Parameters:** length

- the number of bytes in the parameter data.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs,
this method is called on a closed

PreparedStatement

,
if parameterIndex does not correspond
to a parameter marker in the SQL statement, if the length specified
is less than zero or if the number of bytes in the

InputStream

does not match the specified length.
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not support this method
**Since:** 1.6

- index of the first parameter is 1, the second is 2, ...
**Parameters:** reader

- An object that contains the data to set the parameter value to.
**Parameters:** length

- the number of characters in the parameter data.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if parameterIndex does not correspond to a parameter
marker in the SQL statement; if the length specified is less than zero;
if the driver does not support national character sets;
if the driver can detect that a data conversion
error could occur; if a database access error occurs or
this method is called on a closed

PreparedStatement
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not
support this method
**Since:** 1.6

- setNClob

```java
public void setNClob​(int parameterIndex,

NClob
value)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to a

java.sql.NClob

object. The driver converts this oa
SQL

NCLOB

value when it sends it to the database.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- of the first parameter is 1, the second is 2, ...
**Parameters:** value

- the parameter value
**Throws:** SQLException

- if the driver does not support national
character sets; if the driver can detect that a data conversion
error could occur ; or if a database access error occurs
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not
support this method
**Since:** 1.6

- setNClob

```java
public void setNClob​(int parameterIndex,

Reader
reader)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to a

Reader

object.
This method differs from the

setCharacterStream (int, Reader)

method
because it informs the driver that the parameter value should be sent to
the server as a

NCLOB

. When the

setCharacterStream

method is used, the
driver may have to do extra work to determine whether the parameter
data should be sent to the server as a

LONGNVARCHAR

or a

NCLOB

Note:

Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if
it might be more efficient to use a version of

setNClob

which takes a length parameter.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- index of the first parameter is 1, the second is 2, ...
**Parameters:** reader

- An object that contains the data to set the parameter value to.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if parameterIndex does not correspond to a parameter
marker in the SQL statement;
if the driver does not support national character sets;
if the driver can detect that a data conversion
error could occur; if a database access error occurs or
this method is called on a closed

PreparedStatement
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not support this method
**Since:** 1.6

- setURL

```java
public void setURL​(int parameterIndex,

URL
x)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to the given

java.net.URL

value.
The driver converts this to an SQL

DATALINK

value
when it sends it to the database.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the first parameter is 1, the second is 2, ...
**Parameters:** x

- the

java.net.URL

object to be set
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or
this method is called on a closed

PreparedStatement
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not support this method

#### BaseRowSet

public BaseRowSet()

Constructs a new

BaseRowSet

object initialized with
a default

Vector

object for its

listeners

field. The other default values with which it is initialized are listed
in Section 6.0 of the class comment for this class.

Method Detail

- initParams

```java
protected void initParams()
```

Performs the necessary internal configurations and initializations
to allow any JDBC

RowSet

implementation to start using
the standard facilities provided by a

BaseRowSet

instance. This method

should

be called after the

RowSet

object
has been instantiated to correctly initialize all parameters. This method

should

never be called by an application, but is called from with
a

RowSet

implementation extending this class.

- addRowSetListener

```java
public void addRowSetListener​(
RowSetListener
listener)
```

The listener will be notified whenever an event occurs on this

RowSet

object.

A listener might, for example, be a table or graph that needs to
be updated in order to accurately reflect the current state of
the

RowSet

object.

Note

: if the

RowSetListener

object is

null

, this method silently discards the

null

value and does not add a null reference to the set of listeners.

Note

: if the listener is already set, and the new

RowSetListener

instance is added to the set of listeners already registered to receive
event notifications from this

RowSet

.

**Parameters:** listener

- an object that has implemented the

javax.sql.RowSetListener

interface and wants to be notified
of any events that occur on this

RowSet

object; May be
null.
**See Also:** removeRowSetListener(javax.sql.RowSetListener)

- removeRowSetListener

```java
public void removeRowSetListener​(
RowSetListener
listener)
```

Removes the designated object from this

RowSet

object's list of listeners.
If the given argument is not a registered listener, this method
does nothing.

Note

: if the

RowSetListener

object is

null

, this method silently discards the

null

value.

**Parameters:** listener

- a

RowSetListener

object that is on the list
of listeners for this

RowSet

object
**See Also:** addRowSetListener(javax.sql.RowSetListener)

- notifyCursorMoved

```java
protected void notifyCursorMoved()
throws
SQLException
```

Notifies all of the listeners registered with this

RowSet

object that its cursor has moved.

When an application calls a method to move the cursor,
that method moves the cursor and then calls this method
internally. An application

should

never invoke
this method directly.

**Throws:** SQLException

- if the class extending the

BaseRowSet

abstract class does not implement the

RowSet

interface or
one of it's sub-interfaces.

- notifyRowChanged

```java
protected void notifyRowChanged()
throws
SQLException
```

Notifies all of the listeners registered with this

RowSet

object that
one of its rows has changed.

When an application calls a method that changes a row, such as
the

CachedRowSet

methods

insertRow

,

updateRow

, or

deleteRow

,
that method calls

notifyRowChanged

internally. An application

should

never invoke
this method directly.

**Throws:** SQLException

- if the class extending the

BaseRowSet

abstract class does not implement the

RowSet

interface or
one of it's sub-interfaces.

- notifyRowSetChanged

```java
protected void notifyRowSetChanged()
throws
SQLException
```

Notifies all of the listeners registered with this

RowSet

object that its entire contents have changed.

When an application calls methods that change the entire contents
of the

RowSet

object, such as the

CachedRowSet

methods

execute

,

populate

,

restoreOriginal

,
or

release

, that method calls

notifyRowSetChanged

internally (either directly or indirectly). An application

should

never invoke this method directly.

**Throws:** SQLException

- if the class extending the

BaseRowSet

abstract class does not implement the

RowSet

interface or
one of it's sub-interfaces.

- getCommand

```java
public
String
getCommand()
```

Retrieves the SQL query that is the command for this

RowSet

object. The command property contains the query that
will be executed to populate this

RowSet

object.

The SQL query returned by this method is used by

RowSet

methods
such as

execute

and

populate

, which may be implemented
by any class that extends the

BaseRowSet

abstract class and
implements one or more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

The command is used by the

RowSet

object's
reader to obtain a

ResultSet

object. The reader then
reads the data from the

ResultSet

object and uses it to
to populate this

RowSet

object.

The default value for the

command

property is

null

.

**Returns:** the

String

that is the value for this

RowSet

object's

command

property;
may be

null
**See Also:** setCommand(java.lang.String)

- setCommand

```java
public void setCommand​(
String
cmd)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets this

RowSet

object's

command

property to
the given

String

object and clears the parameters, if any,
that were set for the previous command.

The

command

property may not be needed if the

RowSet

object gets its data from a source that does not support commands,
such as a spreadsheet or other tabular file.
Thus, this property is optional and may be

null

.

**Parameters:** cmd

- a

String

object containing an SQL query
that will be set as this

RowSet

object's command
property; may be

null

but may not be an empty string
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an empty string is provided as the command value
**See Also:** getCommand()

- getUrl

```java
public
String
getUrl()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves the JDBC URL that this

RowSet

object's

javax.sql.Reader

object uses to make a connection
with a relational database using a JDBC technology-enabled driver.

The

Url

property will be

null

if the underlying data
source is a non-SQL data source, such as a spreadsheet or an XML
data source.

**Returns:** a

String

object that contains the JDBC URL
used to establish the connection for this

RowSet

object; may be

null

(default value) if not set
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs retrieving the URL value
**See Also:** setUrl(java.lang.String)

- setUrl

```java
public void setUrl​(
String
url)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the Url property for this

RowSet

object
to the given

String

object and sets the dataSource name
property to

null

. The Url property is a
JDBC URL that is used when
the connection is created using a JDBC technology-enabled driver
("JDBC driver") and the

DriverManager

.
The correct JDBC URL for the specific driver to be used can be found
in the driver documentation. Although there are guidelines for how
a JDBC URL is formed,
a driver vendor can specify any

String

object except
one with a length of

0

(an empty string).

Setting the Url property is optional if connections are established using
a

DataSource

object instead of the

DriverManager

.
The driver will use either the URL property or the
dataSourceName property to create a connection, whichever was
specified most recently. If an application uses a JDBC URL, it
must load a JDBC driver that accepts the JDBC URL before it uses the

RowSet

object to connect to a database. The

RowSet

object will use the URL internally to create a database connection in order
to read or write data.

**Parameters:** url

- a

String

object that contains the JDBC URL
that will be used to establish the connection to a database for this

RowSet

object; may be

null

but must not
be an empty string
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs setting the Url property or the
parameter supplied is a string with a length of

0

(an
empty string)
**See Also:** getUrl()

- getDataSourceName

```java
public
String
getDataSourceName()
```

Returns the logical name that when supplied to a naming service
that uses the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API, will
retrieve a

javax.sql.DataSource

object. This

DataSource

object can be used to establish a connection
to the data source that it represents.

Users should set either the url or the data source name property.
The driver will use the property set most recently to establish a
connection.

**Returns:** a

String

object that identifies the

DataSource

object to be used for making a
connection; if no logical name has been set,

null

is returned.
**See Also:** setDataSourceName(java.lang.String)

- setDataSourceName

```java
public void setDataSourceName​(
String
name)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the

DataSource

name property for this

RowSet

object to the given logical name and sets this

RowSet

object's
Url property to

null

. The name must have been bound to a

DataSource

object in a JNDI naming service so that an
application can do a lookup using that name to retrieve the

DataSource

object bound to it. The

DataSource

object can then be used to establish a connection to the data source it
represents.

Users should set either the Url property or the dataSourceName property.
If both properties are set, the driver will use the property set most recently.

**Parameters:** name

- a

String

object with the name that can be supplied
to a naming service based on JNDI technology to retrieve the

DataSource

object that can be used to get a connection;
may be

null

but must not be an empty string
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an empty string is provided as the

DataSource

name
**See Also:** getDataSourceName()

- getUsername

```java
public
String
getUsername()
```

Returns the user name used to create a database connection. Because it
is not serialized, the username property is set at runtime before
calling the method

execute

.

**Returns:** the

String

object containing the user name that
is supplied to the data source to create a connection; may be

null

(default value) if not set
**See Also:** setUsername(java.lang.String)

- setUsername

```java
public void setUsername​(
String
name)
```

Sets the username property for this

RowSet

object
to the given user name. Because it
is not serialized, the username property is set at run time before
calling the method

execute

.

**Parameters:** name

- the

String

object containing the user name that
is supplied to the data source to create a connection. It may be null.
**See Also:** getUsername()

- getPassword

```java
public
String
getPassword()
```

Returns the password used to create a database connection for this

RowSet

object. Because the password property is not
serialized, it is set at run time before calling the method

execute

. The default value is

null

**Returns:** the

String

object that represents the password
that must be supplied to the database to create a connection
**See Also:** setPassword(java.lang.String)

- setPassword

```java
public void setPassword​(
String
pass)
```

Sets the password used to create a database connection for this

RowSet

object to the given

String

object. Because the password property is not
serialized, it is set at run time before calling the method

execute

.

**Parameters:** pass

- the

String

object that represents the password
that is supplied to the database to create a connection. It may be
null.
**See Also:** getPassword()

- setType

```java
public void setType​(int type)

- getTypeMap

```java
public
Map
<
String
,​
Class
<?>> getTypeMap()
```

Retrieves the type map associated with the

Connection

object for this

RowSet

object.

Drivers that support the JDBC 3.0 API will create

Connection

objects with an associated type map.
This type map, which is initially empty, can contain one or more
fully-qualified SQL names and

Class

objects indicating
the class to which the named SQL value will be mapped. The type mapping
specified in the connection's type map is used for custom type mapping
when no other type map supersedes it.

If a type map is explicitly supplied to a method that can perform
custom mapping, that type map supersedes the connection's type map.

**Returns:** the

java.util.Map

object that is the type map
for this

RowSet

object's connection

- setTypeMap

```java
public void setTypeMap​(

this type map will be used unless a different type map is explicitly
supplied to a method, in which case the type map supplied will be used.

**Parameters:** map

- a

java.util.Map

object that contains the
mapping from SQL type names for user defined types (UDT) to classes in
the Java programming language. Each entry in the

Map

object consists of the fully qualified SQL name of a UDT and the

Class

object for the

SQLData

implementation
of that UDT. May be

null

.

- getMaxFieldSize

object.
This limit applies only to columns that hold values of the
following types:

BINARY

,

VARBINARY

,

LONGVARBINARY

,

CHAR

,

VARCHAR

,
and

LONGVARCHAR

. If the limit is exceeded, the excess
data is silently discarded.

**Returns:** an

int

indicating the current maximum column size
limit; zero means that there is no limit
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs internally determining the
maximum limit of the column size

- setMaxFieldSize

```java
public void setMaxFieldSize​(int max)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the maximum number of bytes that can be used for a column
value in this

Retrieves the maximum number of rows that this

RowSet

object may contain. If
this limit is exceeded, the excess rows are silently dropped.

**Returns:** an

int

indicating the current maximum number of
rows; zero means that there is no limit
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs internally determining the
maximum limit of rows that a

Rowset

object can contain

- setMaxRows

```java
public void setMaxRows​(int max)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the maximum number of rows that this

RowSet

object may contain to
the given number. If this limit is exceeded, the excess rows are
silently dropped.

**Parameters:** max

- an

int

indicating the current maximum number
of rows; zero means that there is no limit
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs internally setting the
maximum limit on the number of rows that a JDBC

RowSet

object
can contain; or if

max

is less than

0

; or
if

max

is less than the

fetchSize

of the

RowSet

- setEscapeProcessing

```java
public void setEscapeProcessing​(boolean enable)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets to the given

boolean

whether or not the driver will
scan for escape syntax and do escape substitution before sending SQL
statements to the database. The default is for the driver to do escape
processing.

Note: Since

PreparedStatement

objects have usually been
parsed prior to making this call, disabling escape processing for
prepared statements will likely have no effect.

**Parameters:** enable

-

true

to enable escape processing;

false

to disable it
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs setting the underlying JDBC
technology-enabled driver to process the escape syntax

- getQueryTimeout

```java
public int getQueryTimeout()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves the maximum number of seconds the driver will wait for a
query to execute. If the limit is exceeded, an

SQLException

is thrown.

**Returns:** the current query timeout limit in seconds; zero means that
there is no limit
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs in determining the query
time-out value

- setQueryTimeout

```java
public void setQueryTimeout​(int seconds)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets to the given number the maximum number of seconds the driver will
wait for a query to execute. If the limit is exceeded, an

SQLException

is thrown.

**Parameters:** seconds

- the new query time-out limit in seconds; zero means that
there is no limit; must not be less than zero
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs setting the query
time-out or if the query time-out value is less than 0

- getShowDeleted

```java
public boolean getShowDeleted()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves a

boolean

indicating whether rows marked
for deletion appear in the set of current rows.
The default value is

false

.

Note: Allowing deleted rows to remain visible complicates the behavior
of some of the methods. However, most

RowSet

object users
can simply ignore this extra detail because only sophisticated
applications will likely want to take advantage of this feature.

**Returns:** true

if deleted rows are visible;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs determining if deleted rows
are visible or not
**See Also:** setShowDeleted(boolean)

- setShowDeleted

```java
public void setShowDeleted​(boolean value)
throws
SQLException
```

- if an error occurs determining if escape
processing is enabled or not or if the internal escape
processing trigger has not been enabled

- setFetchDirection

```java
public void setFetchDirection​(int direction)
throws
SQLException
```

Gives the driver a performance hint as to the direction in
which the rows in this

RowSet

object will be
processed. The driver may ignore this hint.

A

RowSet

object inherits the default properties of the

ResultSet

object from which it got its data. That

ResultSet

object's default fetch direction is set by
the

Statement

object that created it.

This method applies to a

RowSet

object only while it is
connected to a database using a JDBC driver.

A

RowSet

object may use this method at any time to change
its setting for the fetch direction.

**Parameters:** direction

- one of

ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD

,

ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE

, or

ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN
**Throws:** SQLException

- if (1) the

RowSet

type is

TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY

and the given fetch direction is not

FETCH_FORWARD

or (2) the given fetch direction is not
one of the following:
ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD,
ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE, or
ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN
**See Also:** getFetchDirection()

- getFetchDirection

```java
public int getFetchDirection()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves this

RowSet

object's current setting for the
fetch direction. The default type is

ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD

**Returns:** one of

ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD

,

ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE

, or

ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs in determining the
current fetch direction for fetching rows
**See Also:** setFetchDirection(int)

- setFetchSize

```java
public void setFetchSize​(int rows)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the fetch size for this

RowSet

object to the given number of
rows. The fetch size gives a JDBC technology-enabled driver ("JDBC driver")
a hint as to the
number of rows that should be fetched from the database when more rows
are needed for this

RowSet

object. If the fetch size specified
is zero, the driver ignores the value and is free to make its own best guess
as to what the fetch size should be.

A

RowSet

object inherits the default properties of the

ResultSet

object from which it got its data. That

ResultSet

object's default fetch size is set by
the

Statement

object that created it.

This method applies to a

RowSet

object only while it is
connected to a database using a JDBC driver.
For connected

RowSet

implementations such as

JdbcRowSet

, this method has a direct and immediate effect
on the underlying JDBC driver.

A

RowSet

object may use this method at any time to change
its setting for the fetch size.

For

RowSet

implementations such as

CachedRowSet

, which operate in a disconnected environment,
the

SyncProvider

object being used
may leverage the fetch size to poll the data source and
retrieve a number of rows that do not exceed the fetch size and that may
form a subset of the actual rows returned by the original query. This is
an implementation variance determined by the specific

SyncProvider

object employed by the disconnected

RowSet

object.

**Parameters:** rows

- the number of rows to fetch;

0

to let the
driver decide what the best fetch size is; must not be less
than

0

or more than the maximum number of rows
allowed for this

RowSet

object (the number returned
by a call to the method

getMaxRows()

)
**Throws:** SQLException

- if the specified fetch size is less than

0

or more than the limit for the maximum number of rows
**See Also:** getFetchSize()

- getFetchSize

```java
public int getFetchSize()
throws
SQLException
```

Returns the fetch size for this

RowSet

object. The default
value is zero.

**Returns:** the number of rows suggested as the fetch size when this

RowSet

object
needs more rows from the database
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs determining the number of rows in the
current fetch size
**See Also:** setFetchSize(int)

- getConcurrency

```java
public int getConcurrency()
throws
SQLException
```

Returns the concurrency for this

RowSet

object.
The default is

CONCUR_UPDATABLE

for both connected and
disconnected

RowSet

objects.

An application can call the method

setConcurrency

at any time
to change a

RowSet

object's concurrency.

**Returns:** the concurrency type for this

RowSet

object, which must be one of the following:

ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY

or

ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs getting the concurrency
of this

RowSet

object
**See Also:** setConcurrency(int)

,

isReadOnly()

- setNull

```java
public void setNull​(int parameterIndex,
int sqlType)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to SQL

NULL

.
Note that the parameter's SQL type must be specified using one of the
type codes defined in

java.sql.Types

. This SQL type is
specified in the second parameter.

Note that the second parameter tells the DBMS the data type of the value being
set to

NULL

. Some DBMSs require this information, so it is required
in order to make code more portable.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setNull

has been called will return an

Object

array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is

null

.
The second element is the value set for

sqlType

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to

null

, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
**Parameters:** sqlType

- an

int

that is one of the SQL type codes
defined in the class

Types

. If a non-standard

sqlType

is supplied, this method will not throw a

SQLException

. This allows implicit support for
non-standard SQL types.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or the given
parameter index is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

- setNull

```java
public void setNull​(int parameterIndex,
int sqlType,

String
typeName)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to SQL

NULL

.

Although this version of the method

setNull

is intended
for user-defined
and

REF

parameters, this method may be used to set a null
parameter for any JDBC type. The following are user-defined types:

STRUCT

,

DISTINCT

, and

JAVA_OBJECT

,
and named array types.

Note:

To be portable, applications must give the
SQL type code and the fully qualified SQL type name when specifying
a

NULL

user-defined or

REF

parameter.
In the case of a user-defined type, the name is the type name of
the parameter itself. For a

REF

parameter, the name is
the type name of the referenced type. If a JDBC technology-enabled
driver does not need the type code or type name information,
it may ignore it.

If the parameter does not have a user-defined or

REF

type,
the given

typeName

parameter is ignored.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setNull

has been called will return an

Object

array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is

null

.
The second element is the value set for

sqlType

, and the third
element is the value set for

typeName

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to

null

, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setTimestamp

has been called will return an array with the value for parameter placeholder
number

parameterIndex

being the

Timestamp

object that was
supplied as the second parameter to this method.
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
**Parameters:** x

- a

java.sql.Timestamp

object
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs or the
parameter index is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

- setAsciiStream

```java
public void setAsciiStream​(int parameterIndex,

InputStream
x,
int length)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to the given

java.io.InputStream

object,
which will have the specified number of bytes.
The contents of the stream will be read and sent to the database.
This method throws an

SQLException

object if the number of bytes
read and sent to the database is not equal to

length

.

When a very large ASCII value is input to a

LONGVARCHAR

parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a

java.io.InputStream

object. A JDBC technology-enabled
driver will read the data from the stream as needed until it reaches
end-of-file. The driver will do any necessary conversion from ASCII to
the database

CHAR

format.

Note:

This stream object can be either a standard
Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the
standard interface.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

Note:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after

setAsciiStream

has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
have been set. The element in the array that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is the given

java.io.InputStream

object.
The second element is the value set for

length

.
The third element is an internal

BaseRowSet

constant
specifying that the stream passed to this method is an ASCII stream.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the input stream being set is the value for the second
placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is element number

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
**Parameters:** x

- the Java input stream that contains the ASCII parameter value
**Parameters:** length

- the number of bytes in the stream. This is the number of bytes
the driver will send to the DBMS; lengths of 0 or less are
are undefined but will cause an invalid length exception to be
thrown in the underlying JDBC driver.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs, the parameter index is out of bounds,
or when connected to a data source, the number of bytes the driver reads
and sends to the database is not equal to the number of bytes specified
in

length

as needed until end-of-file is reached. The JDBC driver will
do any necessary conversion from ASCII to the database char format.

Note:

This stream object can either be a standard
Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the
standard interface.

Note:

Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if
it might be more efficient to use a version of

setAsciiStream

which takes a length parameter.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the first parameter is 1, the second is 2, ...

format.
The byte format of the Unicode stream must be Java UTF-8, as
defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification.

Note:

This stream object can be either a standard
Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the
standard interface.

This method is deprecated; the method

getCharacterStream

should be used in its place.

- setObject

```java
public void setObject​(int parameterIndex,

Object
x,
int targetSqlType,
int scale)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to an

Object

in the Java
programming language. The second parameter must be an

Object

type. For integral values, the

java.lang

equivalent
objects should be used. For example, use the class

Integer

for an

int

.

The driver converts this object to the specified
target SQL type before sending it to the database.
If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing

SQLData

), the driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write the object to the SQL
data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class
implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

Struct

, or

Array

,
the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the
corresponding SQL type.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-
specific abstract data types.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setObject

has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is the given

Object

instance, and the
second element is the value set for

targetSqlType

. The
third element is the value set for

scale

, which the driver will
ignore if the type of the object being set is not

java.sql.Types.NUMERIC

or

java.sql.Types.DECIMAL

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the object being set is the value for the second
placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is element number

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

- the

Object

containing the input parameter value;
must be an

Object

type
**Parameters:** targetSqlType

- the SQL type (as defined in

java.sql.Types

)
to be sent to the database. The

scale

argument may
further qualify this type. If a non-standard

targetSqlType

is supplied, this method will not throw a

SQLException

.
This allows implicit support for non-standard SQL types.
**Parameters:** scale

- for the types

java.sql.Types.DECIMAL

and

java.sql.Types.NUMERIC

, this is the number
of digits after the decimal point. For all other types, this
value will be ignored.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs or the parameter index is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

- setObject

```java
public void setObject​(int parameterIndex,

Object
x,
int targetSqlType)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given

Object

value.
This method is like

setObject(int parameterIndex, Object x, int
targetSqlType, int scale)

except that it assumes a scale of zero.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the object being set is the value for the second
placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is element number

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater

- the

Object

containing the input parameter value;
must be an

Object

type
**Parameters:** targetSqlType

- the SQL type (as defined in

java.sql.Types

)
to be sent to the database. If a non-standard

targetSqlType

is supplied, this method will not throw a

SQLException

.
This allows implicit support for non-standard SQL types.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs or the parameter index
is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

- setObject

```java
public void setObject​(int parameterIndex,

Object
x)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to an

Object

in the Java
programming language. The second parameter must be an

Object

type. For integral values, the

java.lang

equivalent
objects should be used. For example, use the class

Integer

for an

int

.

The JDBC specification defines a standard mapping from
Java

Object

types to SQL types. The driver will
use this standard mapping to convert the given object
to its corresponding SQL type before sending it to the database.
If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing

SQLData

), the driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write the object to the SQL
data stream.

If, on the other hand, the object is of a class
implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

Struct

, or

Array

,
the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the
corresponding SQL type.

This method throws an exception if there
is an ambiguity, for example, if the object is of a class
implementing more than one interface.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-specific
abstract data types.

```

Sets the designated parameter to the given

java.sql.Date

object.
When the DBMS does not store time zone information, the driver will use
the given

Calendar

object to construct the SQL

DATE

value to send to the database. With a

Calendar

object, the driver can calculate the date
taking into account a custom time zone. If no

Calendar

object is specified, the driver uses the time zone of the Virtual Machine
that is running the application.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is the given

java.sql.Date

object.
The second element is the value set for

cal

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the date being set is the value for the second
placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to the given

java.sql.Timestamp

object. The driver converts this
to an SQL

TIMESTAMP

value when it sends it to the database.

When the DBMS does not store time zone information, the driver will use
the given

Calendar

object to construct the SQL

TIMESTAMP

value to send to the database. With a

Calendar

object, the driver can calculate the timestamp
taking into account a custom time zone. If no

Calendar

object is specified, the driver uses the time zone of the Virtual Machine
that is running the application.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setTimestamp

has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is the given

java.sql.Timestamp

object.
The second element is the value set for

cal

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the timestamp being set is the value for the second
placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.

java.sql.Timestamp

object
**Parameters:** cal

- the

java.util.Calendar

object the driver can use to
construct the timestamp
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs or the
parameter index is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

- clearParameters

```java
public void clearParameters()
throws
SQLException
```

Clears all of the current parameter values in this

RowSet

object's internal representation of the parameters to be set in
this

RowSet

object's command when it is executed.

In general, parameter values remain in force for repeated use in
this

RowSet

object's command. Setting a parameter value with the
setter methods automatically clears the value of the
designated parameter and replaces it with the new specified value.

This method is called internally by the

setCommand

method to clear all of the parameters set for the previous command.

Furthermore, this method differs from the

initParams

method in that it maintains the schema of the

RowSet

object.

**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs clearing the parameters

- getParams

```java
public
Object
[] getParams()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves an array containing the parameter values (both Objects and
primitives) that have been set for this

RowSet

object's command and throws an

SQLException

object
if all parameters have not been set. Before the command is sent to the
DBMS to be executed, these parameters will be substituted
for placeholder parameters in the

PreparedStatement

object
that is the command for a

RowSet

implementation extending
the

BaseRowSet

class.

Each element in the array that is returned is an

Object

instance
that contains the values of the parameters supplied to a setter method.
The order of the elements is determined by the value supplied for

parameterIndex

. If the setter method takes only the parameter index
and the value to be set (possibly null), the array element will contain the value to be set
(which will be expressed as an

Object

). If there are additional
parameters, the array element will itself be an array containing the value to be set
plus any additional parameter values supplied to the setter method. If the method
sets a stream, the array element includes the type of stream being supplied to the
method. These additional parameters are for the use of the driver or the DBMS and may or
may not be used.

NOTE: Stored parameter values of types

Array

,

Blob

,

Clob

and

Ref

are returned as

SerialArray

,

SerialBlob

,

SerialClob

and

SerialRef

respectively.

**Returns:** an array of

Object

instances that includes the
parameter values that may be set in this

RowSet

object's
command; an empty array if no parameters have been set
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs retrieving the object array of
parameters of this

RowSet

object or if not all parameters have
been set

setNull

should
be used for user-defined types and REF type parameters. Examples
of user-defined types include: STRUCT, DISTINCT, JAVA_OBJECT, and
named array types.

Note:

To be portable, applications must give the
SQL type code and the fully-qualified SQL type name when specifying
a NULL user-defined or REF parameter. In the case of a user-defined type
the name is the type name of the parameter itself. For a REF
parameter, the name is the type name of the referenced type. If
a JDBC driver does not need the type code or type name information,
it may ignore it.

Although it is intended for user-defined and Ref parameters,
this method may be used to set a null parameter of any JDBC type.
If the parameter does not have a user-defined or REF type, the given
typeName is ignored.

**Parameters:** parameterName

- the name of the parameter

- setObject

```java
public void setObject​(
String
parameterName,

Object
x,
int targetSqlType,
int scale)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given object. The second
argument must be an object type; for integral values, the

java.lang

equivalent objects should be used.

The given Java object will be converted to the given targetSqlType
before being sent to the database.

If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing the
interface

SQLData

),
the JDBC driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write it
to the SQL data stream.
If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

NClob

,

Struct

,

java.net.URL

,
or

Array

, the driver should pass it to the database as a
value of the corresponding SQL type.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-
specific abstract data types.

**Parameters:** parameterName

- the name of the parameter
**Parameters:** x

- the object containing the input parameter value
**Parameters:** targetSqlType

- the SQL type (as defined in java.sql.Types) to be
sent to the database. The scale argument may further qualify this type.
**Parameters:** scale

- for java.sql.Types.DECIMAL or java.sql.Types.NUMERIC types,
this is the number of digits after the decimal point. For all other
types, this value will be ignored.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or
this method is called on a closed

CallableStatement
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- setObject

```java
public void setObject​(
String
parameterName,

Object
x)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given object.
The second parameter must be of type

Object

; therefore, the

java.lang

equivalent objects should be used for built-in types.

The JDBC specification specifies a standard mapping from
Java

Object

types to SQL types. The given argument
will be converted to the corresponding SQL type before being
sent to the database.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-
specific abstract data types, by using a driver-specific Java
type.

If the object is of a class implementing the interface

SQLData

,
the JDBC driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write it to the SQL data stream.
If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

NClob

,

Struct

,

java.net.URL

,
or

Array

, the driver should pass it to the database as a
value of the corresponding SQL type.

This method throws an exception if there is an ambiguity, for example, if the
object is of a class implementing more than one of the interfaces named above.

**Parameters:** parameterName

- the name of the parameter
**Parameters:** x

- the object containing the input parameter value
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs,

setNull

```java
public void setNull​(int parameterIndex,
int sqlType)
throws
SQLException
```

Sets the designated parameter to SQL

NULL

.
Note that the parameter's SQL type must be specified using one of the
type codes defined in

java.sql.Types

. This SQL type is
specified in the second parameter.

Note that the second parameter tells the DBMS the data type of the value being
set to

NULL

. Some DBMSs require this information, so it is required
in order to make code more portable.

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this

RowSet

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

populate

method
as it is undefined in this class.

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setNull

has been called will return an

Object

array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is

null

.
The second element is the value set for

sqlType

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to

null

, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
**Parameters:** sqlType

- an

int

that is one of the SQL type codes
defined in the class

Types

. If a non-standard

sqlType

is supplied, this method will not throw a

SQLException

. This allows implicit support for
non-standard SQL types.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or the given
parameter index is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

```

Sets the designated parameter to an

Object

in the Java

.

The driver converts this object to the specified
target SQL type before sending it to the database.
If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing

SQLData

), the driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class
implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

,

Struct

, or

object's command when the method

execute

is called.
Methods such as

execute

and

populate

must be
provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
more of the standard JSR-114

RowSet

interfaces.

NOTE:

JdbcRowSet

does not require the

Calls made to the method

getParams

after this version of

setObject

has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values
set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
is the given

Object

instance, and the
second element is the value set for

targetSqlType

. The
third element is the value set for

scale

, which the driver will
ignore if the type of the object being set is not

java.sql.Types.NUMERIC

or

java.sql.Types.DECIMAL

.
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
returned by the method

getParams

,
with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
In other words, if the object being set is the value for the second
placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
the array returned by

getParams

.

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number

parameterIndex

is element number

parameterIndex

-1.

**Parameters:** parameterIndex

- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
in this

RowSet

object's command that is to be set.
The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

1

or greater
**Parameters:** x

- the

Object

containing the input parameter value;
must be an

Object

type
**Parameters:** targetSqlType

- the SQL type (as defined in

java.sql.Types

)
to be sent to the database. The

scale

argument may
further qualify this type. If a non-standard

targetSqlType

is supplied, this method will not throw a

SQLException

.
This allows implicit support for non-standard SQL types.
**Parameters:** scale

- for the types

java.sql.Types.DECIMAL

and

java.sql.Types.NUMERIC

, this is the number
of digits after the decimal point. For all other types, this
value will be ignored.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs or the parameter index is out of bounds
**See Also:** getParams()

#### setObject

public void setObject​(int parameterIndex,

Object

x,
int targetSqlType,
int scale)
throws

SQLException

Sets the designated parameter to an

Object

in the Java
programming language. The second parameter must be an

Object

type. For integral values, the

java.lang

equivalent
objects should be used. For example, use the class

Integer

for an

int

.

The driver converts this object to the specified
target SQL type before sending it to the database.
If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing

SQLData

), the driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write the object to the SQL
data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class
implementing

Ref

,

Blob

,

Clob

,

Struct

, or

Array

,
the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the
corresponding SQL type.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-
specific abstract data types.

x)
throws

SQLException

Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given object.
The second parameter must be of type

Object

; therefore, the

java.lang

equivalent objects should be used for built-in types.

The JDBC specification specifies a standard mapping from
Java

Object

types to SQL types. The given argument
will be converted to the corresponding SQL type before being
sent to the database.

Note that this method may be used to pass database-
specific abstract data types, by using a driver-specific Java
type.

If the object is of a class implementing the interface

SQLData

,
the JDBC driver should call the method

SQLData.writeSQL

to write it to the SQL data stream.
