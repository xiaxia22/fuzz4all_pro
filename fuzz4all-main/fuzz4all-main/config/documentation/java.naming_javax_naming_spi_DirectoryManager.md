# Class DirectoryManager

**Source:** `java.naming\javax\naming\spi\DirectoryManager.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
DirectoryManager

extends
NamingManager
```

This class contains methods for supporting

DirContext

implementations.

This class is an extension of

NamingManager

. It contains methods
for use by service providers for accessing object factories and
state factories, and for getting continuation contexts for
supporting federation.

DirectoryManager

is safe for concurrent access by multiple threads.

Except as otherwise noted,
a

Name

,

Attributes

, or environment parameter
passed to any method is owned by the caller.
The implementation will not modify the object or keep a reference
to it, although it may keep a reference to a clone or copy.

**Since:** 1.3

### Method Details

#### public static
DirContext
getContinuationDirContext​(
CannotProceedException
cpe)
throws
NamingException

Creates a context in which to continue a

DirContext

operation.
Operates just like

NamingManager.getContinuationContext()

,
only the continuation context returned is a

DirContext

.

**Parameters:**
- cpe

- The non-null exception that triggered this continuation.

**Returns:**
- A non-null

DirContext

object for continuing the operation.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If a naming exception occurred.

**See Also:**
- NamingManager.getContinuationContext(CannotProceedException)

---

#### public static
Object
getObjectInstance​(
Object
refInfo,

Name
name,

Context
nameCtx,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment,

Attributes
attrs)
throws
Exception

Creates an instance of an object for the specified object,
attributes, and environment.

This method is the same as

NamingManager.getObjectInstance

except for the following differences:

- It accepts an

Attributes

parameter that contains attributes
associated with the object. The

DirObjectFactory

might use these
attributes to save having to look them up from the directory.

The object factories tried must implement either

ObjectFactory

or

DirObjectFactory

.
If it implements

DirObjectFactory

,

DirObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()

is used, otherwise,

ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()

is used.

Service providers that implement the

DirContext

interface
should use this method, not

NamingManager.getObjectInstance()

.

**Parameters:**
- refInfo

- The possibly null object for which to create an object.
- name

- The name of this object relative to

nameCtx

.
Specifying a name is optional; if it is
omitted,

name

should be null.
- nameCtx

- The context relative to which the

name

parameter is specified. If null,

name

is
relative to the default initial context.
- environment

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the object factory and the object.
- attrs

- The possibly null attributes associated with refInfo.
This might not be the complete set of attributes for refInfo;
you might be able to read more attributes from the directory.

**Returns:**
- An object created using

refInfo

and

attrs

; or

refInfo

if an object cannot be created by
a factory.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If a naming exception was encountered
while attempting to get a URL context, or if one of the
factories accessed throws a NamingException.
- Exception

- If one of the factories accessed throws an
exception, or if an error was encountered while loading
and instantiating the factory and object classes.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.

DirObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()

#### public static
DirStateFactory.Result
getStateToBind​(
Object
obj,

Name
name,

Context
nameCtx,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment,

Attributes
attrs)
throws
NamingException

Retrieves the state of an object for binding when given the original
object and its attributes.

This method is like

NamingManager.getStateToBind

except
for the following differences:

- It accepts an

Attributes

parameter containing attributes
that were passed to the

DirContext.bind()

method.

It returns a non-null

DirStateFactory.Result

instance
containing the object to be bound, and the attributes to
accompany the binding. Either the object or the attributes may be null.

The state factories tried must each implement either

StateFactory

or

DirStateFactory

.
If it implements

DirStateFactory

, then

DirStateFactory.getStateToBind()

is called; otherwise,

StateFactory.getStateToBind()

is called.

Service providers that implement the

DirContext

interface
should use this method, not

NamingManager.getStateToBind()

.

See NamingManager.getStateToBind() for a description of how
the list of state factories to be tried is determined.

The object returned by this method is owned by the caller.
The implementation will not subsequently modify it.
It will contain either a new

Attributes

object that is
likewise owned by the caller, or a reference to the original

attrs

parameter.

**Parameters:**
- obj

- The non-null object for which to get state to bind.
- name

- The name of this object relative to

nameCtx

,
or null if no name is specified.
- nameCtx

- The context relative to which the

name

parameter is specified, or null if

name

is
relative to the default initial context.
- environment

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the state factory and
the object's state.
- attrs

- The possibly null Attributes that is to be bound with the
object.

**Returns:**
- A non-null DirStateFactory.Result containing
the object and attributes to be bound.
If no state factory returns a non-null answer, the result will contain
the object (

obj

) itself with the original attributes.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If a naming exception was encountered
while using the factories.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.

DirStateFactory.getStateToBind()

parameter that contains attributes
associated with the object. The

DirObjectFactory

might use these
attributes to save having to look them up from the directory.

The object factories tried must implement either

ObjectFactory

or

DirObjectFactory

.
If it implements

DirObjectFactory

,

DirObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()

is used, otherwise,

ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()

is used.

Service providers that implement the

DirContext

interface
should use this method, not

This method is the same as

NamingManager.getObjectInstance

- It accepts an

Attributes

parameter that contains attributes
associated with the object. The

DirObjectFactory

might use these
attributes to save having to look them up from the directory.

ObjectFactory

```

Retrieves the state of an object for binding when given the original
object and its attributes.

This method is like

NamingManager.getStateToBind

except
for the following differences:

- It accepts an

Attributes

parameter containing attributes
that were passed to the

DirContext.bind()

method.

It returns a non-null

DirStateFactory.Result

instance
containing the object to be bound, and the attributes to
accompany the binding. Either the object or the attributes may be null.

The state factories tried must each implement either

StateFactory

or

DirStateFactory

.
If it implements

DirStateFactory

, then

DirStateFactory.getStateToBind()

is called; otherwise,

StateFactory.getStateToBind()

is called.

Service providers that implement the

DirContext

interface
should use this method, not

NamingManager.getStateToBind()

.

See NamingManager.getStateToBind() for a description of how
the list of state factories to be tried is determined.

The object returned by this method is owned by the caller.
The implementation will not subsequently modify it.
It will contain either a new

Attributes

object that is
likewise owned by the caller, or a reference to the original

attrs

parameter.

**Parameters:** obj

- The non-null object for which to get state to bind.
**Parameters:** name

- The name of this object relative to

nameCtx

,
or null if no name is specified.
**Parameters:** nameCtx

- The context relative to which the

name

parameter is specified, or null if

name

is
relative to the default initial context.
**Parameters:** environment

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the state factory and
the object's state.
**Parameters:** attrs

- The possibly null Attributes that is to be bound with the
object.
**Returns:** A non-null DirStateFactory.Result containing
the object and attributes to be bound.
If no state factory returns a non-null answer, the result will contain
the object (

obj

) itself with the original attributes.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If a naming exception was encountered
while using the factories.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.

DirStateFactory.getStateToBind()
