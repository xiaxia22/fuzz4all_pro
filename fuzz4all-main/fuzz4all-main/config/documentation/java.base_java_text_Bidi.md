# Class Bidi

**Source:** `java.base\java\text\Bidi.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
Bidi

extends
Object
```

This class implements the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.

A Bidi object provides information on the bidirectional reordering of the text
used to create it. This is required, for example, to properly display Arabic
or Hebrew text. These languages are inherently mixed directional, as they order
numbers from left-to-right while ordering most other text from right-to-left.

Once created, a Bidi object can be queried to see if the text it represents is
all left-to-right or all right-to-left. Such objects are very lightweight and
this text is relatively easy to process.

If there are multiple runs of text, information about the runs can be accessed
by indexing to get the start, limit, and level of a run. The level represents
both the direction and the 'nesting level' of a directional run. Odd levels
are right-to-left, while even levels are left-to-right. So for example level
0 represents left-to-right text, while level 1 represents right-to-left text, and
level 2 represents left-to-right text embedded in a right-to-left run.

**Since:** 1.4

---

#### public static final int DIRECTION_DEFAULT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT

directional character in the text according to the Unicode
Bidirectional Algorithm. If no strong directional character is present,

---

#### public static final int DIRECTION_DEFAULT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT

### Constructor Details

#### public Bidi​(
String
paragraph,
int flags)

Create Bidi from the given paragraph of text and base direction.

**Parameters:**
- paragraph

- a paragraph of text
- flags

- a collection of flags that control the algorithm. The
algorithm understands the flags DIRECTION_LEFT_TO_RIGHT, DIRECTION_RIGHT_TO_LEFT,
DIRECTION_DEFAULT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT, and DIRECTION_DEFAULT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT.
Other values are reserved.

---

#### public Bidi​(
AttributedCharacterIterator
paragraph)

Create Bidi from the given paragraph of text.

The RUN_DIRECTION attribute in the text, if present, determines the base
direction (left-to-right or right-to-left). If not present, the base
direction is computes using the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm, defaulting to left-to-right
if there are no strong directional characters in the text. This attribute, if
present, must be applied to all the text in the paragraph.

The BIDI_EMBEDDING attribute in the text, if present, represents embedding level
information. Negative values from -1 to -62 indicate overrides at the absolute value
of the level. Positive values from 1 to 62 indicate embeddings. Where values are
zero or not defined, the base embedding level as determined by the base direction
is assumed.

The NUMERIC_SHAPING attribute in the text, if present, converts European digits to
other decimal digits before running the bidi algorithm. This attribute, if present,
must be applied to all the text in the paragraph.

**Parameters:**
- paragraph

- a paragraph of text with optional character and paragraph attribute information

**See Also:**
- TextAttribute.BIDI_EMBEDDING

,

TextAttribute.NUMERIC_SHAPING

,

TextAttribute.RUN_DIRECTION

---

#### public Bidi​(char[] text,
int textStart,
byte[] embeddings,
int embStart,
int paragraphLength,
int flags)

Create Bidi from the given text, embedding, and direction information.
The embeddings array may be null. If present, the values represent embedding level
information. Negative values from -1 to -61 indicate overrides at the absolute value
of the level. Positive values from 1 to 61 indicate embeddings. Where values are
zero, the base embedding level as determined by the base direction is assumed.

**Parameters:**
- text

- an array containing the paragraph of text to process.
- textStart

- the index into the text array of the start of the paragraph.
- embeddings

- an array containing embedding values for each character in the paragraph.
This can be null, in which case it is assumed that there is no external embedding information.
- embStart

- the index into the embedding array of the start of the paragraph.
- paragraphLength

- the length of the paragraph in the text and embeddings arrays.
- flags

- a collection of flags that control the algorithm. The
algorithm understands the flags DIRECTION_LEFT_TO_RIGHT, DIRECTION_RIGHT_TO_LEFT,
DIRECTION_DEFAULT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT, and DIRECTION_DEFAULT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT.
Other values are reserved.

### Method Details

#### public
Bidi
createLineBidi​(int lineStart,
int lineLimit)

Create a Bidi object representing the bidi information on a line of text within

entire paragraph fits on one line.

**Parameters:**
- lineStart

- the offset from the start of the paragraph to the start of the line.
- lineLimit

- the offset from the start of the paragraph to the limit of the line.

**Returns:**
- a

Bidi

object

---

#### public boolean isMixed()

Return true if the line is not left-to-right or right-to-left. This means it either has mixed runs of left-to-right
and right-to-left text, or the base direction differs from the direction of the only run of text.

**Returns:**
- true if the line is not left-to-right or right-to-left.

---

#### public boolean isLeftToRight()

Return true if the line is all left-to-right text and the base direction is left-to-right.

**Returns:**
- true if the line is all left-to-right text and the base direction is left-to-right

---

#### public boolean isRightToLeft()

Return true if the line is all right-to-left text, and the base direction is right-to-left.

**Returns:**
- true if the line is all right-to-left text, and the base direction is right-to-left

---

#### public int getLength()

Return the length of text in the line.

**Returns:**
- the length of text in the line

---

#### public boolean baseIsLeftToRight()

Return true if the base direction is left-to-right.

**Returns:**
- true if the base direction is left-to-right

---

#### public int getBaseLevel()

Return the base level (0 if left-to-right, 1 if right-to-left).

**Returns:**
- the base level

---

#### public int getLevelAt​(int offset)

Return the resolved level of the character at offset. If offset is
< 0 or ≥ the length of the line, return the base direction
level.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- the index of the character for which to return the level

**Returns:**
- the resolved level of the character at offset

---

#### public int getRunCount()

Return the number of level runs.

**Returns:**
- the number of level runs

getRunCount()

**Returns:**

---

#### public int getRunStart​(int run)

---

#### public int getRunLimit​(int run)

---

#### public static boolean requiresBidi​(char[] text,

the text will display left-to-right. Clients can then avoid constructing a Bidi object.
Text in the Arabic Presentation Forms area of Unicode is presumed to already be shaped
and ordered for display, and so will not cause this function to return true.

**Parameters:**
- text

- the text containing the characters to test
- start

- the start of the range of characters to test
- limit

- the limit of the range of characters to test

**Returns:**

This is a utility function to use when you have a collection of objects
representing runs of text in logical order, each run containing text
at a single level. The elements at

index

from

objectStart

up to

objectStart + count

in the objects array will be reordered into visual order assuming
each run of text has the level indicated by the corresponding element
in the levels array (at

index - objectStart + levelStart

Object

**Returns:**
- a string representation of the object.

each run of text has the level indicated by the corresponding element
in the levels array (at
