# Interface JoinRowSet

**Source:** `java.sql.rowset\javax\sql\rowset\JoinRowSet.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
JoinRowSet

extends
WebRowSet
```

The

JoinRowSet

interface provides a mechanism for combining related
data from different

RowSet

objects into one

JoinRowSet

object, which represents an SQL

JOIN

.
In other words, a

JoinRowSet

object acts as a
container for the data from

RowSet

objects that form an SQL

JOIN

relationship.

The

Joinable

interface provides the methods for setting,
retrieving, and unsetting a match column, the basis for
establishing an SQL

JOIN

relationship. The match column may
alternatively be set by supplying it to the appropriate version of the

JointRowSet

method

addRowSet

.

1.0 Overview

Disconnected

RowSet

objects (

CachedRowSet

objects
and implementations extending the

CachedRowSet

interface)
do not have a standard way to establish an SQL

JOIN

between

RowSet

objects without the expensive operation of
reconnecting to the data source. The

JoinRowSet

interface is specifically designed to address this need.

Any

RowSet

object
can be added to a

JoinRowSet

object to become
part of an SQL

JOIN

relationship. This means that both connected
and disconnected

RowSet

objects can be part of a

JOIN

.

RowSet

objects operating in a connected environment
(

JdbcRowSet

objects) are
encouraged to use the database to which they are already
connected to establish SQL

JOIN

relationships between
tables directly. However, it is possible for a

JdbcRowSet

object to be added to a

JoinRowSet

object
if necessary.

Any number of

RowSet

objects can be added to an
instance of

JoinRowSet

provided that they
can be related in an SQL

JOIN

.
By definition, the SQL

JOIN

statement is used to
combine the data contained in two or more relational database tables based
upon a common attribute. The

Joinable

interface provides the methods
for establishing a common attribute, which is done by setting a

match column

. The match column commonly coincides with
the primary key, but there is
no requirement that the match column be the same as the primary key.
By establishing and then enforcing column matches,
a

JoinRowSet

object establishes

JOIN

relationships
between

RowSet

objects without the assistance of an available
relational database.

The type of

JOIN

to be established is determined by setting
one of the

JoinRowSet

constants using the method

setJoinType

. The following SQL

JOIN

types can be set:

- CROSS_JOIN

FULL_JOIN

INNER_JOIN

- the default if no

JOIN

type has been set

LEFT_OUTER_JOIN

RIGHT_OUTER_JOIN

Note that if no type is set, the

JOIN

will automatically be an
inner join. The comments for the fields in the

JoinRowSet

interface explain these

JOIN

types, which are
standard SQL

JOIN

types.

2.0 Using a

JoinRowSet

Object for Creating a

JOIN

When a

JoinRowSet

object is created, it is empty.
The first

RowSet

object to be added becomes the basis for the

JOIN

relationship.
Applications must determine which column in each of the

RowSet

objects to be added to the

JoinRowSet

object
should be the match column. All of the

RowSet

objects must contain a match column, and the values in
each match column must be ones that can be compared to values in the other match
columns. The columns do not have to have the same name, though they often do,
and they do not have to store the exact same data type as long as the data types
can be compared.

A match column can be set in two ways:

- By calling the

Joinable

method

setMatchColumn

This is the only method that can set the match column before a

RowSet

object is added to a

JoinRowSet

object. The

RowSet

object
must have implemented the

Joinable

interface in order to use the method

setMatchColumn

. Once the match column value
has been set, this method can be used to reset the match column at any time.

By calling one of the versions of the

JoinRowSet

method

addRowSet

that takes a column name or number (or an array of
column names or numbers)

Four of the five

addRowSet

methods take a match column as a parameter.
These four methods set or reset the match column at the time a

RowSet

object is being added to a

JoinRowSet

object.

3.0 Sample Usage

The following code fragment adds two

CachedRowSet

objects to a

JoinRowSet

object. Note that in this example,
no SQL

JOIN

type is set, so the default

JOIN

type,
which is

INNER_JOIN

, is established.

In the following code fragment, the table

EMPLOYEES

, whose match
column is set to the first column (

EMP_ID

), is added to the

JoinRowSet

object

jrs

. Then
the table

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

, whose match column is likewise
the

EMP_ID

column, is added. When this second
table is added to

jrs

, only the rows in

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

whose

EMP_ID

value matches an

EMP_ID

value in the

EMPLOYEES

table are added.
In this case, everyone in the bonus plan is an employee, so all of the rows
in the table

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

are added to the

JoinRowSet

object. In this example, both

CachedRowSet

objects being added
have implemented the

Joinable

interface and can therefore call
the

Joinable

method

setMatchColumn

.

```java
JoinRowSet jrs = new JoinRowSetImpl();

ResultSet rs1 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES");
CachedRowSet empl = new CachedRowSetImpl();
empl.populate(rs1);
empl.setMatchColumn(1);
jrs.addRowSet(empl);

ResultSet rs2 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM ESSP_BONUS_PLAN");
CachedRowSet bonus = new CachedRowSetImpl();
bonus.populate(rs2);
bonus.setMatchColumn(1); // EMP_ID is the first column
jrs.addRowSet(bonus);
```

At this point,

jrs

is an inside JOIN of the two

RowSet

objects
based on their

EMP_ID

columns. The application can now browse the
combined data as if it were browsing one single

RowSet

object.
Because

jrs

is itself a

RowSet

object, an application can
navigate or modify it using

RowSet

methods.

```java
jrs.first();
int employeeID = jrs.getInt(1);
String employeeName = jrs.getString(2);
```

Note that because the SQL

JOIN

must be enforced when an application
adds a second or subsequent

RowSet

object, there
may be an initial degradation in performance while the

JOIN

is
being performed.

The following code fragment adds an additional

CachedRowSet

object.
In this case, the match column (

EMP_ID

) is set when the

CachedRowSet

object is added to the

JoinRowSet

object.

```java
ResultSet rs3 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM 401K_CONTRIB");
CachedRowSet fourO1k = new CachedRowSetImpl();
four01k.populate(rs3);
jrs.addRowSet(four01k, 1);
```

The

JoinRowSet

object

jrs

now contains values from all three
tables. The data in each row in

four01k

in which the value for the

EMP_ID

column matches a value for the

EMP_ID

column
in

jrs

has been added to

jrs

.

4.0

JoinRowSet

Methods

The

JoinRowSet

interface supplies several methods for adding

RowSet

objects and for getting information about the

JoinRowSet

object.

- Methods for adding one or more

RowSet

objects

These methods allow an application to add one

RowSet

object
at a time or to add multiple

RowSet

objects at one time. In
either case, the methods may specify the match column for each

RowSet

object being added.

Methods for getting information

One method retrieves the

RowSet

objects in the

JoinRowSet

object, and another method retrieves the

RowSet

names. A third method retrieves either the SQL

WHERE

clause used behind the scenes to form the

JOIN

or a text description of what the

WHERE

clause does.

Methods related to the type of

JOIN

One method sets the

JOIN

type, and five methods find out whether
the

JoinRowSet

object supports a given type.

A method to make a separate copy of the

JoinRowSet

object

This method creates a copy that can be persisted to the data source.

The first

RowSet

Applications must determine which column in each of the

RowSet

objects to be added to the

JoinRowSet

each match column must be ones that can be compared to values in the other match
columns. The columns do not have to have the same name, though they often do,
and they do not have to store the exact same data type as long as the data types

A match column can be set in two ways:

- By calling the

Joinable

setMatchColumn

This is the only method that can set the match column before a

RowSet

object is added to a

JoinRowSet

object. The

RowSet

object
must have implemented the

Joinable

interface in order to use the method

setMatchColumn

. Once the match column value
has been set, this method can be used to reset the match column at any time.

By calling one of the versions of the

JoinRowSet

method

addRowSet

that takes a column name or number (or an array of
column names or numbers)

Four of the five

addRowSet

methods take a match column as a parameter.
These four methods set or reset the match column at the time a

RowSet

JoinRowSet

object.

3.0 Sample Usage

The following code fragment adds two

CachedRowSet

objects to a

JoinRowSet

object. Note that in this example,
no SQL

JOIN

type is set, so the default

JOIN

type,
which is

INNER_JOIN

, is established.

In the following code fragment, the table

EMPLOYEES

, whose match
column is set to the first column (

EMP_ID

), is added to the

JoinRowSet

object

jrs

. Then
the table

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

, whose match column is likewise
the

EMP_ID

column, is added. When this second
table is added to

jrs

, only the rows in

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

whose

EMP_ID

value matches an

EMP_ID

value in the

EMPLOYEES

table are added.
In this case, everyone in the bonus plan is an employee, so all of the rows
in the table

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

are added to the

JoinRowSet

object. In this example, both

CachedRowSet

objects being added
have implemented the

Joinable

interface and can therefore call
the

Joinable

method

setMatchColumn

.

```java
JoinRowSet jrs = new JoinRowSetImpl();

ResultSet rs1 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES");
CachedRowSet empl = new CachedRowSetImpl();
empl.populate(rs1);
empl.setMatchColumn(1);
jrs.addRowSet(empl);

ResultSet rs2 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM ESSP_BONUS_PLAN");
CachedRowSet bonus = new CachedRowSetImpl();
bonus.populate(rs2);
bonus.setMatchColumn(1); // EMP_ID is the first column
jrs.addRowSet(bonus);
```

At this point,

jrs

is an inside JOIN of the two

RowSet

objects
based on their

EMP_ID

columns. The application can now browse the
combined data as if it were browsing one single

RowSet

object.
Because

jrs

is itself a

RowSet

navigate or modify it using

RowSet

```java
jrs.first();
int employeeID = jrs.getInt(1);
String employeeName = jrs.getString(2);
```

Note that because the SQL

JOIN

must be enforced when an application
adds a second or subsequent

RowSet

object, there
may be an initial degradation in performance while the

JOIN

is
being performed.

The following code fragment adds an additional

CachedRowSet

object.
In this case, the match column (

EMP_ID

) is set when the

CachedRowSet

object is added to the

JoinRowSet

object.

```java
ResultSet rs3 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM 401K_CONTRIB");
CachedRowSet fourO1k = new CachedRowSetImpl();
four01k.populate(rs3);
jrs.addRowSet(four01k, 1);
```

The

JoinRowSet

object

jrs

now contains values from all three
tables. The data in each row in

four01k

in which the value for the

EMP_ID

column matches a value for the

EMP_ID

column
in

jrs

has been added to

jrs

.

RowSet

objects

These methods allow an application to add one

RowSet

object
at a time or to add multiple

RowSet

objects at one time. In
either case, the methods may specify the match column for each

RowSet

object being added.

Methods for getting information

One method retrieves the

RowSet

objects in the

JoinRowSet

object, and another method retrieves the

RowSet

names. A third method retrieves either the SQL

WHERE

clause used behind the scenes to form the

JOIN

or a text description of what the

WHERE

clause does.

Methods related to the type of

JOIN

One method sets the

JOIN

type, and five methods find out whether
the

JoinRowSet

object supports a given type.

A method to make a separate copy of the

JoinRowSet

object

This method creates a copy that can be persisted to the data source.

**Since:** 1.5

public interface

JoinRowSet

extends

WebRowSet

The

JoinRowSet

interface provides a mechanism for combining related
data from different

RowSet

objects into one

JoinRowSet

object, which represents an SQL

JOIN

.
In other words, a

JoinRowSet

object acts as a
container for the data from

RowSet

objects that form an SQL

JOIN

relationship.

The

Joinable

interface provides the methods for setting,
retrieving, and unsetting a match column, the basis for
establishing an SQL

JOIN

relationship. The match column may
alternatively be set by supplying it to the appropriate version of the

JointRowSet

method

addRowSet

.

1.0 Overview

Disconnected

RowSet

objects (

CachedRowSet

objects
and implementations extending the

CachedRowSet

interface)
do not have a standard way to establish an SQL

JOIN

between

RowSet

objects without the expensive operation of
reconnecting to the data source. The

JoinRowSet

interface is specifically designed to address this need.

Any

RowSet

object
can be added to a

JoinRowSet

object to become
part of an SQL

JOIN

relationship. This means that both connected
and disconnected

RowSet

objects can be part of a

JOIN

.

RowSet

objects operating in a connected environment
(

JdbcRowSet

objects) are
encouraged to use the database to which they are already
connected to establish SQL

JOIN

relationships between
tables directly. However, it is possible for a

JdbcRowSet

object to be added to a

JoinRowSet

object
if necessary.

Any number of

RowSet

objects can be added to an
instance of

JoinRowSet

provided that they
can be related in an SQL

JOIN

.
By definition, the SQL

JOIN

statement is used to
combine the data contained in two or more relational database tables based
upon a common attribute. The

Joinable

interface provides the methods
for establishing a common attribute, which is done by setting a

match column

. The match column commonly coincides with
the primary key, but there is
no requirement that the match column be the same as the primary key.
By establishing and then enforcing column matches,
a

JoinRowSet

object establishes

JOIN

relationships
between

RowSet

objects without the assistance of an available
relational database.

The type of

JOIN

to be established is determined by setting
one of the

JoinRowSet

constants using the method

setJoinType

. The following SQL

JOIN

types can be set:

- CROSS_JOIN

FULL_JOIN

INNER_JOIN

- the default if no

JOIN

type has been set

LEFT_OUTER_JOIN

RIGHT_OUTER_JOIN

Note that if no type is set, the

JOIN

will automatically be an
inner join. The comments for the fields in the

JoinRowSet

interface explain these

JOIN

types, which are
standard SQL

JOIN

types.

2.0 Using a

JoinRowSet

Object for Creating a

JOIN

When a

JoinRowSet

object is created, it is empty.
The first

RowSet

object to be added becomes the basis for the

JOIN

relationship.
Applications must determine which column in each of the

RowSet

objects to be added to the

JoinRowSet

object
should be the match column. All of the

RowSet

objects must contain a match column, and the values in
each match column must be ones that can be compared to values in the other match
columns. The columns do not have to have the same name, though they often do,
and they do not have to store the exact same data type as long as the data types
can be compared.

A match column can be set in two ways:

- By calling the

Joinable

method

setMatchColumn

This is the only method that can set the match column before a

RowSet

object is added to a

JoinRowSet

object. The

RowSet

object
must have implemented the

Joinable

interface in order to use the method

setMatchColumn

. Once the match column value
has been set, this method can be used to reset the match column at any time.

By calling one of the versions of the

JoinRowSet

method

addRowSet

that takes a column name or number (or an array of
column names or numbers)

Four of the five

addRowSet

methods take a match column as a parameter.
These four methods set or reset the match column at the time a

RowSet

object is being added to a

JoinRowSet

object.

3.0 Sample Usage

The following code fragment adds two

CachedRowSet

objects to a

JoinRowSet

object. Note that in this example,
no SQL

JOIN

type is set, so the default

JOIN

type,
which is

INNER_JOIN

, is established.

In the following code fragment, the table

EMPLOYEES

, whose match
column is set to the first column (

EMP_ID

), is added to the

JoinRowSet

object

jrs

. Then
the table

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

, whose match column is likewise
the

EMP_ID

column, is added. When this second
table is added to

jrs

, only the rows in

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

whose

EMP_ID

value matches an

EMP_ID

value in the

EMPLOYEES

table are added.
In this case, everyone in the bonus plan is an employee, so all of the rows
in the table

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

are added to the

JoinRowSet

object. In this example, both

CachedRowSet

objects being added
have implemented the

Joinable

interface and can therefore call
the

Joinable

method

setMatchColumn

.

```java
JoinRowSet jrs = new JoinRowSetImpl();

ResultSet rs1 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES");
CachedRowSet empl = new CachedRowSetImpl();
empl.populate(rs1);
empl.setMatchColumn(1);
jrs.addRowSet(empl);

ResultSet rs2 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM ESSP_BONUS_PLAN");
CachedRowSet bonus = new CachedRowSetImpl();
bonus.populate(rs2);
bonus.setMatchColumn(1); // EMP_ID is the first column
jrs.addRowSet(bonus);
```

At this point,

jrs

is an inside JOIN of the two

RowSet

objects
based on their

EMP_ID

columns. The application can now browse the
combined data as if it were browsing one single

RowSet

object.
Because

jrs

is itself a

RowSet

object, an application can
navigate or modify it using

RowSet

methods.

```java
jrs.first();
int employeeID = jrs.getInt(1);
String employeeName = jrs.getString(2);
```

Note that because the SQL

JOIN

must be enforced when an application
adds a second or subsequent

RowSet

object, there
may be an initial degradation in performance while the

JOIN

is
being performed.

The following code fragment adds an additional

CachedRowSet

object.
In this case, the match column (

EMP_ID

) is set when the

CachedRowSet

object is added to the

JoinRowSet

object.

```java
ResultSet rs3 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM 401K_CONTRIB");
CachedRowSet fourO1k = new CachedRowSetImpl();
four01k.populate(rs3);
jrs.addRowSet(four01k, 1);
```

The

JoinRowSet

object

jrs

now contains values from all three
tables. The data in each row in

four01k

in which the value for the

EMP_ID

column matches a value for the

EMP_ID

column
in

jrs

has been added to

jrs

.

setMatchColumn

.

```java
JoinRowSet jrs = new JoinRowSetImpl();

ResultSet rs1 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES");
CachedRowSet empl = new CachedRowSetImpl();
empl.populate(rs1);
empl.setMatchColumn(1);
jrs.addRowSet(empl);

ResultSet rs2 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM ESSP_BONUS_PLAN");
CachedRowSet bonus = new CachedRowSetImpl();
bonus.populate(rs2);
bonus.setMatchColumn(1); // EMP_ID is the first column
jrs.addRowSet(bonus);
```

At this point,

jrs

is an inside JOIN of the two

RowSet

objects
based on their

EMP_ID

columns. The application can now browse the
combined data as if it were browsing one single

RowSet

object.
Because

jrs

is itself a

RowSet

object, an application can
navigate or modify it using

RowSet

methods.

```java
jrs.first();
int employeeID = jrs.getInt(1);
String employeeName = jrs.getString(2);
```

Note that because the SQL

JOIN

must be enforced when an application
adds a second or subsequent

RowSet

object, there
may be an initial degradation in performance while the

JOIN

is
being performed.

The following code fragment adds an additional

CachedRowSet

object.
In this case, the match column (

EMP_ID

) is set when the

CachedRowSet

object is added to the

JoinRowSet

object.

```java
ResultSet rs3 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM 401K_CONTRIB");
CachedRowSet fourO1k = new CachedRowSetImpl();
four01k.populate(rs3);
jrs.addRowSet(four01k, 1);
```

The

JoinRowSet

object

jrs

now contains values from all three
tables. The data in each row in

four01k

in which the value for the

EMP_ID

column matches a value for the

EMP_ID

column
in

jrs

has been added to

jrs

.

JoinRowSet

Methods

The

JoinRowSet

interface supplies several methods for adding

RowSet

objects and for getting information about the

JoinRowSet

object.

- Methods for adding one or more

RowSet

objects

These methods allow an application to add one

RowSet

object
at a time or to add multiple

RowSet

objects at one time. In
either case, the methods may specify the match column for each

RowSet

object being added.

Methods for getting information

One method retrieves the

RowSet

objects in the

JoinRowSet

object, and another method retrieves the

RowSet

names. A third method retrieves either the SQL

WHERE

clause used behind the scenes to form the

JOIN

or a text description of what the

WHERE

clause does.

Methods related to the type of

JOIN

One method sets the

JOIN

type, and five methods find out whether
the

JoinRowSet

object supports a given type.

A method to make a separate copy of the

JoinRowSet

object

This method creates a copy that can be persisted to the data source.

The type of

JOIN

to be established is determined by setting
one of the

JoinRowSet

constants using the method

setJoinType

. The following SQL

JOIN

types can be set:

- CROSS_JOIN

FULL_JOIN

INNER_JOIN

- the default if no

JOIN

type has been set

LEFT_OUTER_JOIN

RIGHT_OUTER_JOIN

Note that if no type is set, the

JOIN

will automatically be an
inner join. The comments for the fields in the

JoinRowSet

interface explain these

JOIN

types, which are
standard SQL

JOIN

types.

2.0 Using a

JoinRowSet

Object for Creating a

JOIN

When a

JoinRowSet

object is created, it is empty.
The first

RowSet

object to be added becomes the basis for the

JOIN

relationship.
Applications must determine which column in each of the

RowSet

objects to be added to the

JoinRowSet

object
should be the match column. All of the

RowSet

objects must contain a match column, and the values in
each match column must be ones that can be compared to values in the other match
columns. The columns do not have to have the same name, though they often do,
and they do not have to store the exact same data type as long as the data types
can be compared.

A match column can be set in two ways:

- By calling the

Joinable

method

setMatchColumn

This is the only method that can set the match column before a

RowSet

object is added to a

JoinRowSet

object. The

RowSet

object
must have implemented the

Joinable

interface in order to use the method

setMatchColumn

. Once the match column value
has been set, this method can be used to reset the match column at any time.

By calling one of the versions of the

JoinRowSet

method

addRowSet

that takes a column name or number (or an array of
column names or numbers)

Four of the five

addRowSet

methods take a match column as a parameter.
These four methods set or reset the match column at the time a

RowSet

object is being added to a

JoinRowSet

object.

3.0 Sample Usage

The following code fragment adds two

CachedRowSet

objects to a

JoinRowSet

object. Note that in this example,
no SQL

JOIN

type is set, so the default

JOIN

type,
which is

INNER_JOIN

, is established.

In the following code fragment, the table

EMPLOYEES

, whose match
column is set to the first column (

EMP_ID

), is added to the

JoinRowSet

object

jrs

. Then
the table

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

, whose match column is likewise
the

EMP_ID

column, is added. When this second
table is added to

jrs

, only the rows in

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

whose

EMP_ID

value matches an

EMP_ID

value in the

EMPLOYEES

table are added.
In this case, everyone in the bonus plan is an employee, so all of the rows
in the table

ESSP_BONUS_PLAN

are added to the

JoinRowSet

object. In this example, both

CachedRowSet

objects being added
have implemented the

Joinable

interface and can therefore call
the

Joinable

method

setMatchColumn

.

```java
JoinRowSet jrs = new JoinRowSetImpl();

ResultSet rs1 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES");
CachedRowSet empl = new CachedRowSetImpl();
empl.populate(rs1);
empl.setMatchColumn(1);
jrs.addRowSet(empl);

ResultSet rs2 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM ESSP_BONUS_PLAN");
CachedRowSet bonus = new CachedRowSetImpl();
bonus.populate(rs2);
bonus.setMatchColumn(1); // EMP_ID is the first column
jrs.addRowSet(bonus);
```

At this point,

jrs

is an inside JOIN of the two

RowSet

objects
based on their

EMP_ID

columns. The application can now browse the
combined data as if it were browsing one single

RowSet

object.
Because

jrs

is itself a

RowSet

object, an application can
navigate or modify it using

RowSet

methods.

```java
jrs.first();
int employeeID = jrs.getInt(1);
String employeeName = jrs.getString(2);
```

Note that because the SQL

JOIN

must be enforced when an application
adds a second or subsequent

RowSet

object, there
may be an initial degradation in performance while the

JOIN

is
being performed.

The following code fragment adds an additional

CachedRowSet

object.
In this case, the match column (

EMP_ID

) is set when the

CachedRowSet

object is added to the

JoinRowSet

object.

```java
ResultSet rs3 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM 401K_CONTRIB");
CachedRowSet fourO1k = new CachedRowSetImpl();
four01k.populate(rs3);
jrs.addRowSet(four01k, 1);
```

The

JoinRowSet

object

jrs

now contains values from all three
tables. The data in each row in

four01k

in which the value for the

EMP_ID

column matches a value for the

EMP_ID

column
in

jrs

has been added to

jrs

.

object.

```java
ResultSet rs3 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM 401K_CONTRIB");
CachedRowSet fourO1k = new CachedRowSetImpl();
four01k.populate(rs3);
jrs.addRowSet(four01k, 1);
```

The

JoinRowSet

object

jrs

now contains values from all three
tables. The data in each row in

four01k

in which the value for the

EMP_ID

column matches a value for the

EMP_ID

column
in

jrs

has been added to

jrs

.

4.0

JoinRowSet

Methods

The

JoinRowSet

interface supplies several methods for adding

RowSet

objects and for getting information about the

JoinRowSet

object.

- Methods for adding one or more

RowSet

objects

These methods allow an application to add one

RowSet

object
at a time or to add multiple

RowSet

objects at one time. In
either case, the methods may specify the match column for each

RowSet

object being added.

Methods for getting information

One method retrieves the

RowSet

objects in the

JoinRowSet

object, and another method retrieves the

RowSet

names. A third method retrieves either the SQL

WHERE

clause used behind the scenes to form the

JOIN

or a text description of what the

WHERE

clause does.

Methods related to the type of

JOIN

One method sets the

JOIN

type, and five methods find out whether
the

JoinRowSet

object supports a given type.

A method to make a separate copy of the

JoinRowSet

object

This method creates a copy that can be persisted to the data source.

ResultSet rs3 = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM 401K_CONTRIB");
CachedRowSet fourO1k = new CachedRowSetImpl();
four01k.populate(rs3);
jrs.addRowSet(four01k, 1);

object being added violates the active

JOIN

- getRowSets

```java
Collection
<?> getRowSets()
throws
SQLException
```

Returns a

Collection

object containing the

RowSet

objects that have been added to this

JoinRowSet

object.
This should return the 'n' number of RowSet contained
within the

JOIN

and maintain any updates that have occurred while in
this union.

**Returns:** a

Collection

object consisting of the

RowSet

objects added to this

JoinRowSet

object
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs generating the

Collection

object to be returned

- getRowSetNames

```java
String
[] getRowSetNames()
throws
SQLException
```

Returns a

String

array containing the names of the

RowSet

objects added to this

JoinRowSet

object.

**Returns:** a

String

array of the names of the

RowSet

objects in this

JoinRowSet

object
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs retrieving the names of
the

RowSet

objects
**See Also:** CachedRowSet.setTableName(java.lang.String)

- toCachedRowSet

```java
CachedRowSet
toCachedRowSet()
throws
SQLException
```

Creates a new

CachedRowSet

object containing the
data in this

JoinRowSet

object, which can be saved
to a data source using the

SyncProvider

object for
the

CachedRowSet

object.

If any updates or modifications have been applied to the JoinRowSet
the CachedRowSet returned by the method will not be able to persist
it's changes back to the originating rows and tables in the
in the datasource. The CachedRowSet instance returned should not
contain modification data and it should clear all properties of
it's originating SQL statement. An application should reset the
SQL statement using the

RowSet.setCommand

method.

In order to allow changes to be persisted back to the datasource
to the originating tables, the

acceptChanges

method
should be used and called on a JoinRowSet object instance. Implementations
can leverage the internal data and update tracking in their
implementations to interact with the SyncProvider to persist any
changes.

**Returns:** a CachedRowSet containing the contents of the JoinRowSet
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs assembling the CachedRowSet
object
**See Also:** RowSet

can leverage the internal data and update tracking in their
implementations to interact with the SyncProvider to persist any
changes.

If any updates or modifications have been applied to the JoinRowSet
the CachedRowSet returned by the method will not be able to persist
it's changes back to the originating rows and tables in the
in the datasource. The CachedRowSet instance returned should not
contain modification data and it should clear all properties of
it's originating SQL statement. An application should reset the
SQL statement using the

RowSet.setCommand

method.

In order to allow changes to be persisted back to the datasource
to the originating tables, the

acceptChanges

method
should be used and called on a JoinRowSet object instance. Implementations
can leverage the internal data and update tracking in their
implementations to interact with the SyncProvider to persist any
changes.

setJoinType

```java
void setJoinType​(int joinType)
throws
SQLException
```

Allow the application to adjust the type of

JOIN

imposed
on tables contained within the JoinRowSet object instance.
Implementations should throw a SQLException if they do
not support a given

JOIN

type.

**Parameters:** joinType

- the standard JoinRowSet.XXX static field definition
of a SQL

JOIN

to re-configure a JoinRowSet instance on
the fly.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an unsupported

JOIN

type is set
**See Also:** getJoinType()

---

#### setJoinType

void setJoinType​(int joinType)
throws

SQLException

Allow the application to adjust the type of

JOIN

imposed
on tables contained within the JoinRowSet object instance.
Implementations should throw a SQLException if they do
not support a given

JOIN

type.

getWhereClause

```java
String
getWhereClause()
throws
SQLException
```

Return a SQL-like description of the WHERE clause being used
in a JoinRowSet object. An implementation can describe
the WHERE clause of the SQL

JOIN

by supplying a SQL
strings description of

JOIN

or provide a textual
description to assist applications using a

JoinRowSet

**Returns:** whereClause a textual or SQL description of the logical
WHERE clause used in the JoinRowSet instance
**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs in generating a representation
of the WHERE clause.

getJoinType

```java
int getJoinType()
throws
SQLException
```

Returns a

int

describing the set SQL

JOIN

type
governing this JoinRowSet instance. The returned type will be one of
standard JoinRowSet types:

CROSS_JOIN

,

INNER_JOIN

,

,

RIGHT_OUTER_JOIN

or

FULL_JOIN

.

**Returns:** joinType one of the standard JoinRowSet static field
definitions of a SQL

JOIN

.

JoinRowSet.INNER_JOIN

is returned as the default

JOIN

type is no type has been
explicitly set.
**Throws:** SQLException
