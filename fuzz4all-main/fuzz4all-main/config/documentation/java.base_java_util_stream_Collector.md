# Interface Collector<T,​A,​R>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\stream\Collector.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Collector<T,​A,​R>
```

A

mutable reduction operation

that
accumulates input elements into a mutable result container, optionally transforming
the accumulated result into a final representation after all input elements
have been processed. Reduction operations can be performed either sequentially
or in parallel.

Examples of mutable reduction operations include:
accumulating elements into a

Collection

; concatenating
strings using a

StringBuilder

; computing summary information about
elements such as sum, min, max, or average; computing "pivot table" summaries
such as "maximum valued transaction by seller", etc. The class

Collectors

provides implementations of many common mutable reductions.

A

Collector

is specified by four functions that work together to
accumulate entries into a mutable result container, and optionally perform
a final transform on the result. They are:

- creation of a new result container (

supplier()

)
- incorporating a new data element into a result container (

accumulator()

)
- combining two result containers into one (

combiner()

)
- performing an optional final transform on the container (

finisher()

)

Collectors also have a set of characteristics, such as

Collector.Characteristics.CONCURRENT

, that provide hints that can be used by a
reduction implementation to provide better performance.

A sequential implementation of a reduction using a collector would
create a single result container using the supplier function, and invoke the
accumulator function once for each input element. A parallel implementation
would partition the input, create a result container for each partition,
accumulate the contents of each partition into a subresult for that partition,
and then use the combiner function to merge the subresults into a combined
result.

To ensure that sequential and parallel executions produce equivalent
results, the collector functions must satisfy an

identity

and an

associativity

constraints.

The identity constraint says that for any partially accumulated result,
combining it with an empty result container must produce an equivalent
result. That is, for a partially accumulated result

a

that is the
result of any series of accumulator and combiner invocations,

a

must
be equivalent to

combiner.apply(a, supplier.get())

.

The associativity constraint says that splitting the computation must
produce an equivalent result. That is, for any input elements

t1

and

t2

, the results

r1

and

r2

in the computation
below must be equivalent:

```java
A a1 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a1, t1);
accumulator.accept(a1, t2);
R r1 = finisher.apply(a1); // result without splitting

A a2 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a2, t1);
A a3 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a3, t2);
R r2 = finisher.apply(combiner.apply(a2, a3)); // result with splitting
```

For collectors that do not have the

UNORDERED

characteristic,
two accumulated results

a1

and

a2

are equivalent if

finisher.apply(a1).equals(finisher.apply(a2))

. For unordered
collectors, equivalence is relaxed to allow for non-equality related to
differences in order. (For example, an unordered collector that accumulated
elements to a

List

would consider two lists equivalent if they
contained the same elements, ignoring order.)

Libraries that implement reduction based on

Collector

, such as

Stream.collect(Collector)

, must adhere to the following constraints:

- The first argument passed to the accumulator function, both
arguments passed to the combiner function, and the argument passed to the
finisher function must be the result of a previous invocation of the
result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions.
- The implementation should not do anything with the result of any of
the result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions other than to
pass them again to the accumulator, combiner, or finisher functions,
or return them to the caller of the reduction operation.
- If a result is passed to the combiner or finisher
function, and the same object is not returned from that function, it is
never used again.
- Once a result is passed to the combiner or finisher function, it
is never passed to the accumulator function again.
- For non-concurrent collectors, any result returned from the result
supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions must be serially
thread-confined. This enables collection to occur in parallel without
the

Collector

needing to implement any additional synchronization.
The reduction implementation must manage that the input is properly
partitioned, that partitions are processed in isolation, and combining
happens only after accumulation is complete.
- For concurrent collectors, an implementation is free to (but not
required to) implement reduction concurrently. A concurrent reduction
is one where the accumulator function is called concurrently from
multiple threads, using the same concurrently-modifiable result container,
rather than keeping the result isolated during accumulation.
A concurrent reduction should only be applied if the collector has the

Collector.Characteristics.UNORDERED

characteristics or if the
originating data is unordered.

In addition to the predefined implementations in

Collectors

, the
static factory methods

of(Supplier, BiConsumer, BinaryOperator, Characteristics...)

can be used to construct collectors. For example, you could create a collector
that accumulates widgets into a

TreeSet

with:

```java
Collector<Widget, ?, TreeSet<Widget>> intoSet =
Collector.of(TreeSet::new, TreeSet::add,
(left, right) -> { left.addAll(right); return left; });
```

(This behavior is also implemented by the predefined collector

Collectors.toCollection(Supplier)

).

**Type Parameters:** A

- the mutable accumulation type of the reduction operation (often

A

mutable reduction operation

that
accumulates input elements into a mutable result container, optionally transforming
the accumulated result into a final representation after all input elements
have been processed. Reduction operations can be performed either sequentially
or in parallel.

Examples of mutable reduction operations include:

Collectors also have a set of characteristics, such as

Collector.Characteristics.CONCURRENT

, that provide hints that can be used by a

A sequential implementation of a reduction using a collector would

would partition the input, create a result container for each partition,
accumulate the contents of each partition into a subresult for that partition,
and then use the combiner function to merge the subresults into a combined

To ensure that sequential and parallel executions produce equivalent
results, the collector functions must satisfy an

identity

and an

associativity

constraints.

The identity constraint says that for any partially accumulated result,
combining it with an empty result container must produce an equivalent
result. That is, for a partially accumulated result

a

that is the
result of any series of accumulator and combiner invocations,

a

must
be equivalent to

combiner.apply(a, supplier.get())

.

The associativity constraint says that splitting the computation must
produce an equivalent result. That is, for any input elements

t1

and

t2

, the results

r1

and

r2

in the computation
below must be equivalent:

```java
A a1 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a1, t1);
accumulator.accept(a1, t2);
R r1 = finisher.apply(a1); // result without splitting

A a2 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a2, t1);
A a3 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a3, t2);
R r2 = finisher.apply(combiner.apply(a2, a3)); // result with splitting
```

For collectors that do not have the

UNORDERED

characteristic,
two accumulated results

a1

and

a2

are equivalent if

finisher.apply(a1).equals(finisher.apply(a2))

. For unordered
collectors, equivalence is relaxed to allow for non-equality related to
differences in order. (For example, an unordered collector that accumulated
elements to a

List

would consider two lists equivalent if they
contained the same elements, ignoring order.)

Libraries that implement reduction based on

Collector

, such as

Stream.collect(Collector)

, must adhere to the following constraints:

- The first argument passed to the accumulator function, both
arguments passed to the combiner function, and the argument passed to the
finisher function must be the result of a previous invocation of the
result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions.
- The implementation should not do anything with the result of any of
the result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions other than to
pass them again to the accumulator, combiner, or finisher functions,
or return them to the caller of the reduction operation.
- If a result is passed to the combiner or finisher
function, and the same object is not returned from that function, it is
never used again.
- Once a result is passed to the combiner or finisher function, it
is never passed to the accumulator function again.
- For non-concurrent collectors, any result returned from the result
supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions must be serially
thread-confined. This enables collection to occur in parallel without
the

Collector

needing to implement any additional synchronization.
The reduction implementation must manage that the input is properly

happens only after accumulation is complete.
- For concurrent collectors, an implementation is free to (but not
required to) implement reduction concurrently. A concurrent reduction
is one where the accumulator function is called concurrently from
multiple threads, using the same concurrently-modifiable result container,
rather than keeping the result isolated during accumulation.
A concurrent reduction should only be applied if the collector has the

Collector.Characteristics.UNORDERED

characteristics or if the
originating data is unordered.

In addition to the predefined implementations in

Collectors

, the
static factory methods

of(Supplier, BiConsumer, BinaryOperator, Characteristics...)

can be used to construct collectors. For example, you could create a collector
that accumulates widgets into a

TreeSet

with:

```java
Collector<Widget, ?, TreeSet<Widget>> intoSet =
Collector.of(TreeSet::new, TreeSet::add,
(left, right) -> { left.addAll(right); return left; });
```

(This behavior is also implemented by the predefined collector

Collectors.toCollection(Supplier)

).

**API Note:** Performing a reduction operation with a

Collector

should produce a
result equivalent to:

```java
R container = collector.supplier().get();
for (T t : data)
collector.accumulator().accept(container, t);
return collector.finisher().apply(container);
```

However, the library is free to partition the input, perform the reduction
on the partitions, and then use the combiner function to combine the partial
results to achieve a parallel reduction. (Depending on the specific reduction
operation, this may perform better or worse, depending on the relative cost
of the accumulator and combiner functions.)

Collectors are designed to be

composed

; many of the methods
in

Collectors

are functions that take a collector and produce
a new collector. For example, given the following collector that computes
the sum of the salaries of a stream of employees:

```java
Collector<Employee, ?, Integer> summingSalaries
= Collectors.summingInt(Employee::getSalary))
```

If we wanted to create a collector to tabulate the sum of salaries by
department, we could reuse the "sum of salaries" logic using

Collectors.groupingBy(Function, Collector)

:

```java
Collector<Employee, ?, Map<Department, Integer>> summingSalariesByDept
= Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment, summingSalaries);
```

```

(This behavior is also implemented by the predefined collector

Collectors.toCollection(Supplier)

).

creation of a new result container (

supplier()

)

incorporating a new data element into a result container (

accumulator()

)

combining two result containers into one (

combiner()

)

performing an optional final transform on the container (

finisher()

)

Collectors also have a set of characteristics, such as

Collector.Characteristics.CONCURRENT

, that provide hints that can be used by a
reduction implementation to provide better performance.

A sequential implementation of a reduction using a collector would
create a single result container using the supplier function, and invoke the
accumulator function once for each input element. A parallel implementation
would partition the input, create a result container for each partition,
accumulate the contents of each partition into a subresult for that partition,
and then use the combiner function to merge the subresults into a combined
result.

To ensure that sequential and parallel executions produce equivalent
results, the collector functions must satisfy an

identity

and an

associativity

constraints.

The identity constraint says that for any partially accumulated result,
combining it with an empty result container must produce an equivalent
result. That is, for a partially accumulated result

a

that is the
result of any series of accumulator and combiner invocations,

a

must
be equivalent to

combiner.apply(a, supplier.get())

.

The associativity constraint says that splitting the computation must
produce an equivalent result. That is, for any input elements

t1

and

t2

, the results

r1

and

r2

in the computation
below must be equivalent:

```java
A a1 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a1, t1);
accumulator.accept(a1, t2);
R r1 = finisher.apply(a1); // result without splitting

A a2 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a2, t1);
A a3 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a3, t2);
R r2 = finisher.apply(combiner.apply(a2, a3)); // result with splitting
```

For collectors that do not have the

UNORDERED

characteristic,
two accumulated results

a1

and

a2

are equivalent if

finisher.apply(a1).equals(finisher.apply(a2))

. For unordered
collectors, equivalence is relaxed to allow for non-equality related to
differences in order. (For example, an unordered collector that accumulated
elements to a

List

would consider two lists equivalent if they
contained the same elements, ignoring order.)

Libraries that implement reduction based on

Collector

, such as

Stream.collect(Collector)

, must adhere to the following constraints:

- The first argument passed to the accumulator function, both
arguments passed to the combiner function, and the argument passed to the
finisher function must be the result of a previous invocation of the
result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions.
- The implementation should not do anything with the result of any of
the result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions other than to
pass them again to the accumulator, combiner, or finisher functions,
or return them to the caller of the reduction operation.
- If a result is passed to the combiner or finisher
function, and the same object is not returned from that function, it is
never used again.
- Once a result is passed to the combiner or finisher function, it
is never passed to the accumulator function again.
- For non-concurrent collectors, any result returned from the result
supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions must be serially
thread-confined. This enables collection to occur in parallel without
the

Collector

needing to implement any additional synchronization.
The reduction implementation must manage that the input is properly
partitioned, that partitions are processed in isolation, and combining
happens only after accumulation is complete.
- For concurrent collectors, an implementation is free to (but not
required to) implement reduction concurrently. A concurrent reduction
is one where the accumulator function is called concurrently from
multiple threads, using the same concurrently-modifiable result container,
rather than keeping the result isolated during accumulation.
A concurrent reduction should only be applied if the collector has the

Collector.Characteristics.UNORDERED

characteristics or if the
originating data is unordered.

In addition to the predefined implementations in

Collectors

, the
static factory methods

of(Supplier, BiConsumer, BinaryOperator, Characteristics...)

can be used to construct collectors. For example, you could create a collector
that accumulates widgets into a

TreeSet

with:

```java
Collector<Widget, ?, TreeSet<Widget>> intoSet =
Collector.of(TreeSet::new, TreeSet::add,
(left, right) -> { left.addAll(right); return left; });
```

(This behavior is also implemented by the predefined collector

Collectors.toCollection(Supplier)

).

A sequential implementation of a reduction using a collector would
create a single result container using the supplier function, and invoke the
accumulator function once for each input element. A parallel implementation
would partition the input, create a result container for each partition,
accumulate the contents of each partition into a subresult for that partition,
and then use the combiner function to merge the subresults into a combined
result.

To ensure that sequential and parallel executions produce equivalent
results, the collector functions must satisfy an

identity

and an

associativity

constraints.

The identity constraint says that for any partially accumulated result,
combining it with an empty result container must produce an equivalent
result. That is, for a partially accumulated result

a

that is the
result of any series of accumulator and combiner invocations,

a

must
be equivalent to

combiner.apply(a, supplier.get())

.

The associativity constraint says that splitting the computation must
produce an equivalent result. That is, for any input elements

t1

and

t2

, the results

r1

and

r2

in the computation
below must be equivalent:

```java
A a1 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a1, t1);
accumulator.accept(a1, t2);
R r1 = finisher.apply(a1); // result without splitting

A a2 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a2, t1);
A a3 = supplier.get();
accumulator.accept(a3, t2);
R r2 = finisher.apply(combiner.apply(a2, a3)); // result with splitting
```

For collectors that do not have the

UNORDERED

characteristic,
two accumulated results

a1

and

a2

are equivalent if

finisher.apply(a1).equals(finisher.apply(a2))

. For unordered

- The implementation should not do anything with the result of any of
the result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions other than to
pass them again to the accumulator, combiner, or finisher functions,
or return them to the caller of the reduction operation.
- If a result is passed to the combiner or finisher
function, and the same object is not returned from that function, it is
never used again.
- Once a result is passed to the combiner or finisher function, it
is never passed to the accumulator function again.

R container = collector.supplier().get();
for (T t : data)
collector.accumulator().accept(container, t);
return collector.finisher().apply(container);

However, the library is free to partition the input, perform the reduction
on the partitions, and then use the combiner function to combine the partial
results to achieve a parallel reduction. (Depending on the specific reduction
operation, this may perform better or worse, depending on the relative cost
of the accumulator and combiner functions.)

Collectors are designed to be

in

Collectors

are functions that take a collector and produce
a new collector. For example, given the following collector that computes
the sum of the salaries of a stream of employees:

```java
Collector<Employee, ?, Integer> summingSalaries
= Collectors.summingInt(Employee::getSalary))
```

If we wanted to create a collector to tabulate the sum of salaries by
department, we could reuse the "sum of salaries" logic using

Collectors.groupingBy(Function, Collector)
