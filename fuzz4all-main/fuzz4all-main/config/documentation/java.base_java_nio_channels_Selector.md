# Class Selector

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\channels\Selector.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Selector

extends
Object

implements
Closeable
```

A multiplexor of

SelectableChannel

objects.

A selector may be created by invoking the

open

method of
this class, which will use the system's default

selector provider

to
create a new selector. A selector may also be created by invoking the

openSelector

method of a custom selector provider. A selector remains open until it is
closed via its

close

method.

A selectable channel's registration with a selector is represented by a

SelectionKey

object. A selector maintains three sets of selection
keys:

- The

key set

contains the keys representing the current
channel registrations of this selector. This set is returned by the

keys

method.
- The

selected-key set

is the set of keys such that each
key's channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the operations
identified in the key's interest set during a prior selection operation
that adds keys or updates keys in the set.
This set is returned by the

selectedKeys

method.
The selected-key set is always a subset of the key set.
- The

cancelled-key

set is the set of keys that have been
cancelled but whose channels have not yet been deregistered. This set is
not directly accessible. The cancelled-key set is always a subset of the
key set.

All three sets are empty in a newly-created selector.

A key is added to a selector's key set as a side effect of registering a
channel via the channel's

register

method. Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during
selection operations. The key set itself is not directly modifiable.

A key is added to its selector's cancelled-key set when it is cancelled,
whether by closing its channel or by invoking its

cancel

method. Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered
during the next selection operation, at which time the key will be removed
from all of the selector's key sets.

Keys are added to the selected-key set by selection
operations. A key may be removed directly from the selected-key set by
invoking the set's

remove

method or by invoking the

remove

method
of an

iterator

obtained from the set.
All keys may be removed from the selected-key set by invoking the set's

clear

method. Keys may not be added directly
to the selected-key set.

Selection

A selection operation queries the underlying operating system for an
update as to the readiness of each registered channel to perform any of the
operations identified by its key's interest set. There are two forms of
selection operation:

- The

select()

,

select(long)

, and

selectNow()

methods add the keys of channels ready to perform an operation to the
selected-key set, or update the ready-operation set of keys already in the
selected-key set.
- The

select(Consumer)

,

select(Consumer, long)

, and

selectNow(Consumer)

methods perform an

action

on the key
of each channel that is ready to perform an operation. These methods do
not add to the selected-key set.

Selection operations that add to the selected-key set

During each selection operation, keys may be added to and removed from a
selector's selected-key set and may be removed from its key and
cancelled-key sets. Selection is performed by the

select()

,

select(long)

, and

selectNow()

methods, and involves three steps:

- Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered. This step leaves
the cancelled-key set empty.
- The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
operation began. For a channel that is ready for at least one such
operation, one of the following two actions is performed:

- If the channel's key is not already in the selected-key set then
it is added to that set and its ready-operation set is modified to
identify exactly those operations for which the channel is now reported
to be ready. Any readiness information previously recorded in the ready
set is discarded.
- Otherwise the channel's key is already in the selected-key set,
so its ready-operation set is modified to identify any new operations
for which the channel is reported to be ready. Any readiness
information previously recorded in the ready set is preserved; in other
words, the ready set returned by the underlying system is
bitwise-disjoined into the key's current ready set.

If all of the keys in the key set at the start of this step have empty
interest sets then neither the selected-key set nor any of the keys'
ready-operation sets will be updated.

If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
in progress then they are processed as in step (1).

Whether or not a selection operation blocks to wait for one or more
channels to become ready, and if so for how long, is the only essential
difference between the three selection methods.

Selection operations that perform an action on selected keys

During each selection operation, keys may be removed from the selector's
key, selected-key, and cancelled-key sets. Selection is performed by the

select(Consumer)

,

select(Consumer,long)

, and

selectNow(Consumer)

methods, and involves three steps:

- Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered. This step leaves
the cancelled-key set empty.
- The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
operation began.

For a channel that is ready for at least one such operation, the
ready-operation set of the channel's key is set to identify exactly the
operations for which the channel is ready and the

action

specified
to the

select

method is invoked to consume the channel's key. Any
readiness information previously recorded in the ready set is discarded
prior to invoking the

action

.

Alternatively, where a channel is ready for more than one operation,
the

action

may be invoked more than once with the channel's key and
ready-operation set modified to a subset of the operations for which the
channel is ready. Where the

action

is invoked more than once for
the same key then its ready-operation set never contains operation bits
that were contained in the set at previous calls to the

action

in the same selection operation.
- If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
in progress then they are processed as in step (1).

Concurrency

A Selector and its key set are safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads. Its selected-key set and cancelled-key set, however, are not.

The selection operations synchronize on the selector itself, on the
selected-key set, in that order. They also synchronize on the cancelled-key
set during steps (1) and (3) above.

Changes made to the interest sets of a selector's keys while a
selection operation is in progress have no effect upon that operation; they
will be seen by the next selection operation.

Keys may be cancelled and channels may be closed at any time. Hence the
presence of a key in one or more of a selector's key sets does not imply
that the key is valid or that its channel is open. Application code should
be careful to synchronize and check these conditions as necessary if there
is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.

A thread blocked in a selection operation may be interrupted by some
other thread in one of three ways:

- By invoking the selector's

wakeup

method,
- By invoking the selector's

close

method, or
- By invoking the blocked thread's

interrupt

method, in which case its
interrupt status will be set and the selector's

wakeup

method will be invoked.

The

close

method synchronizes on the selector and its
selected-key set in the same order as in a selection operation.

A Selector's key set is safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
Retrieval operations from the key set do not generally block and so may
overlap with new registrations that add to the set, or with the cancellation
steps of selection operations that remove keys from the set. Iterators and
spliterators return elements reflecting the state of the set at some point at
or since the creation of the iterator/spliterator. They do not throw

ConcurrentModificationException

.

A selector's selected-key set is not, in general, safe for use by
multiple concurrent threads. If such a thread might modify the set directly
then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set itself. The
iterators returned by the set's

iterator

methods are

fail-fast:

If the set is modified after the iterator is
created, in any way except by invoking the iterator's own

remove

method, then a

ConcurrentModificationException

will be thrown.

operations.

This method performs a non-blocking

selection
operation

. If no channels have become selectable since the previous
selection operation then this method immediately returns zero.

---

#### public abstract int select​(long timeout)
throws
IOException

Selects a set of keys whose corresponding channels are ready for I/O
operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It returns only after at least one channel is selected,
this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, the current
thread is interrupted, or the given timeout period expires, whichever
comes first.

This method does not offer real-time guarantees: It schedules the
timeout as if by invoking the

Object.wait(long)

method.

- timeout

- If positive, block for up to

timeout

milliseconds, more or less, while waiting for a
channel to become ready; if zero, block indefinitely;
must not be negative

---

#### public abstract int select()
throws
IOException

Selects a set of keys whose corresponding channels are ready for I/O
operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It returns only after at least one channel is selected,
this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, or the current
thread is interrupted, whichever comes first.

**Returns:**
- The number of keys, possibly zero,
whose ready-operation sets were updated

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed

---

#### public int select​(
Consumer
<
SelectionKey
> action,
long timeout)
throws
IOException

Selects and performs an action on the keys whose corresponding channels
are ready for I/O operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It wakes up from querying the operating system only when
at least one channel is selected, this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, the current thread is interrupted, or the given
timeout period expires, whichever comes first.

The specified

action

's

accept

method is invoked with the key for each channel that is ready to perform
an operation identified by its key's interest set. The

accept

method may be invoked more than once for the same key but with the
ready-operation set containing a subset of the operations for which the
channel is ready (as described above). The

accept

method is
invoked while synchronized on the selector and its selected-key set.
Great care must be taken to avoid deadlocking with other threads that
also synchronize on these objects. Selection operations are not reentrant
in general and consequently the

action

should take great care not
to attempt a selection operation on the same selector. The behavior when
attempting a reentrant selection operation is implementation specific and
therefore not specified. If the

action

closes the selector then

ClosedSelectorException

is thrown when the action completes.
The

action

is not prohibited from closing channels registered with
the selector, nor prohibited from cancelling keys or changing a key's
interest set. If a channel is selected but its key is cancelled or its
interest set changed before the

action

is performed on the key
then it is implementation specific as to whether the

action

is
invoked (it may be invoked with an

invalid

key). Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller.

This method does not offer real-time guarantees: It schedules the
timeout as if by invoking the

Object.wait(long)

method.

**Parameters:**
- action

- The action to perform
- timeout

- If positive, block for up to

timeout

milliseconds, more or less, while waiting for a
channel to become ready; if zero, block indefinitely;
must not be negative

**Returns:**
- The number of unique keys consumed, possibly zero

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed or is closed by the action
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the value of the timeout argument is negative

**Since:**
- 11

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation removes all keys from the
selected-key set, invokes

select(long)

with the
given timeout and then performs the action for each key added to the
selected-key set. The default implementation does not detect the action
performing a reentrant selection operation. The selected-key set may
or may not be empty on completion of the default implementation.

---

#### public int select​(
Consumer
<
SelectionKey
> action)
throws
IOException

Selects and performs an action on the keys whose corresponding channels
are ready for I/O operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It wakes up from querying the operating system only when
at least one channel is selected, this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, or the current thread is interrupted, whichever comes
first.

This method is equivalent to invoking the 2-arg

select

method with a timeout of

0

to block indefinitely.

**Parameters:**
- action

- The action to perform

**Returns:**
- The number of unique keys consumed, possibly zero

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed or is closed by the action

**Since:**
- 11

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation invokes the 2-arg

select

method with a timeout of

0

.

---

#### public int selectNow​(
Consumer
<
SelectionKey
> action)
throws
IOException

Selects and performs an action on the keys whose corresponding channels
are ready for I/O operations.

This method performs a non-blocking

selection
operation

.

Invoking this method clears the effect of any previous invocations
of the

wakeup

method.

**Parameters:**
- action

- The action to perform

**Returns:**
- The number of unique keys consumed, possibly zero

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed or is closed by the action

**Since:**
- 11

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation removes all keys from the
selected-key set, invokes

selectNow()

and then
performs the action for each key added to the selected-key set. The
default implementation does not detect the action performing a reentrant
selection operation. The selected-key set may or may not be empty on
completion of the default implementation.

---

#### public abstract
Selector
wakeup()

Causes the first selection operation that has not yet returned to return
immediately.

If another thread is currently blocked in a selection operation then
that invocation will return immediately. If no selection operation is
currently in progress then the next invocation of a selection operation
will return immediately unless

selectNow()

or

selectNow(Consumer)

is invoked in the meantime. In any case the value
returned by that invocation may be non-zero. Subsequent selection
operations will block as usual unless this method is invoked again in the
meantime.

Invoking this method more than once between two successive selection
operations has the same effect as invoking it just once.

**Returns:**
- This selector

---

#### public abstract void close()
throws
IOException

Closes this selector.

If a thread is currently blocked in one of this selector's selection
methods then it is interrupted as if by invoking the selector's

wakeup

method.

Any uncancelled keys still associated with this selector are
invalidated, their channels are deregistered, and any other resources
associated with this selector are released.

If this selector is already closed then invoking this method has no
effect.

After a selector is closed, any further attempt to use it, except by
invoking this method or the

wakeup

method, will cause a

ClosedSelectorException

to be thrown.

**Specified by:**
- close

in interface

AutoCloseable
- close

in interface

Closeable

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

A multiplexor of

SelectableChannel

objects.

A selector may be created by invoking the

open

method of
this class, which will use the system's default

selector provider

to
create a new selector. A selector may also be created by invoking the

openSelector

method of a custom selector provider. A selector remains open until it is
closed via its

close

method.

A selectable channel's registration with a selector is represented by a

SelectionKey

object. A selector maintains three sets of selection
keys:

- The

key set

contains the keys representing the current
channel registrations of this selector. This set is returned by the

keys

method.
- The

selected-key set

is the set of keys such that each
key's channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the operations
identified in the key's interest set during a prior selection operation
that adds keys or updates keys in the set.
This set is returned by the

selectedKeys

method.
The selected-key set is always a subset of the key set.
- The

cancelled-key

set is the set of keys that have been
cancelled but whose channels have not yet been deregistered. This set is
not directly accessible. The cancelled-key set is always a subset of the
key set.

All three sets are empty in a newly-created selector.

A key is added to a selector's key set as a side effect of registering a
channel via the channel's

register

method. Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during
selection operations. The key set itself is not directly modifiable.

A key is added to its selector's cancelled-key set when it is cancelled,
whether by closing its channel or by invoking its

cancel

method. Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered
during the next selection operation, at which time the key will be removed
from all of the selector's key sets.

Keys are added to the selected-key set by selection
operations. A key may be removed directly from the selected-key set by
invoking the set's

remove

method or by invoking the

remove

method
of an

iterator

obtained from the set.
All keys may be removed from the selected-key set by invoking the set's

clear

method. Keys may not be added directly
to the selected-key set.

Selection

A selection operation queries the underlying operating system for an
update as to the readiness of each registered channel to perform any of the
operations identified by its key's interest set. There are two forms of
selection operation:

- The

select()

,

select(long)

, and

selectNow()

methods add the keys of channels ready to perform an operation to the
selected-key set, or update the ready-operation set of keys already in the
selected-key set.
- The

select(Consumer)

,

select(Consumer, long)

, and

selectNow(Consumer)

methods perform an

action

on the key
of each channel that is ready to perform an operation. These methods do
not add to the selected-key set.

Selection operations that add to the selected-key set

During each selection operation, keys may be added to and removed from a
selector's selected-key set and may be removed from its key and
cancelled-key sets. Selection is performed by the

select()

,

select(long)

, and

selectNow()

methods, and involves three steps:

- Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered. This step leaves
the cancelled-key set empty.
- The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
operation began. For a channel that is ready for at least one such
operation, one of the following two actions is performed:

- If the channel's key is not already in the selected-key set then
it is added to that set and its ready-operation set is modified to
identify exactly those operations for which the channel is now reported
to be ready. Any readiness information previously recorded in the ready
set is discarded.
- Otherwise the channel's key is already in the selected-key set,
so its ready-operation set is modified to identify any new operations
for which the channel is reported to be ready. Any readiness
information previously recorded in the ready set is preserved; in other
words, the ready set returned by the underlying system is
bitwise-disjoined into the key's current ready set.

If all of the keys in the key set at the start of this step have empty
interest sets then neither the selected-key set nor any of the keys'
ready-operation sets will be updated.

If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
in progress then they are processed as in step (1).

Whether or not a selection operation blocks to wait for one or more
channels to become ready, and if so for how long, is the only essential
difference between the three selection methods.

Selection operations that perform an action on selected keys

During each selection operation, keys may be removed from the selector's
key, selected-key, and cancelled-key sets. Selection is performed by the

select(Consumer)

,

select(Consumer,long)

, and

selectNow(Consumer)

methods, and involves three steps:

- Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered. This step leaves
the cancelled-key set empty.
- The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
operation began.

For a channel that is ready for at least one such operation, the
ready-operation set of the channel's key is set to identify exactly the
operations for which the channel is ready and the

action

specified
to the

select

method is invoked to consume the channel's key. Any
readiness information previously recorded in the ready set is discarded
prior to invoking the

action

.

Alternatively, where a channel is ready for more than one operation,
the

action

may be invoked more than once with the channel's key and
ready-operation set modified to a subset of the operations for which the
channel is ready. Where the

action

is invoked more than once for
the same key then its ready-operation set never contains operation bits
that were contained in the set at previous calls to the

action

in the same selection operation.
- If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
in progress then they are processed as in step (1).

Concurrency

A Selector and its key set are safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads. Its selected-key set and cancelled-key set, however, are not.

The selection operations synchronize on the selector itself, on the
selected-key set, in that order. They also synchronize on the cancelled-key
set during steps (1) and (3) above.

Changes made to the interest sets of a selector's keys while a
selection operation is in progress have no effect upon that operation; they
will be seen by the next selection operation.

Keys may be cancelled and channels may be closed at any time. Hence the
presence of a key in one or more of a selector's key sets does not imply
that the key is valid or that its channel is open. Application code should
be careful to synchronize and check these conditions as necessary if there
is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.

A thread blocked in a selection operation may be interrupted by some
other thread in one of three ways:

- By invoking the selector's

wakeup

method,
- By invoking the selector's

close

method, or
- By invoking the blocked thread's

interrupt

method, in which case its
interrupt status will be set and the selector's

wakeup

method will be invoked.

The

close

method synchronizes on the selector and its
selected-key set in the same order as in a selection operation.

A Selector's key set is safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
Retrieval operations from the key set do not generally block and so may
overlap with new registrations that add to the set, or with the cancellation
steps of selection operations that remove keys from the set. Iterators and
spliterators return elements reflecting the state of the set at some point at
or since the creation of the iterator/spliterator. They do not throw

ConcurrentModificationException

.

A selector's selected-key set is not, in general, safe for use by
multiple concurrent threads. If such a thread might modify the set directly
then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set itself. The
iterators returned by the set's

iterator

methods are

fail-fast:

If the set is modified after the iterator is
created, in any way except by invoking the iterator's own

remove

method, then a

ConcurrentModificationException

will be thrown.

Selector

extends

implements

Closeable

A multiplexor of

SelectableChannel

objects.

A selector may be created by invoking the

open

method of
this class, which will use the system's default

selector provider

to
create a new selector. A selector may also be created by invoking the

openSelector

method of a custom selector provider. A selector remains open until it is
closed via its

close

method.

A selectable channel's registration with a selector is represented by a

SelectionKey

object. A selector maintains three sets of selection
keys:

- The

key set

contains the keys representing the current
channel registrations of this selector. This set is returned by the

keys

method.
- The

selected-key set

is the set of keys such that each
key's channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the operations
identified in the key's interest set during a prior selection operation
that adds keys or updates keys in the set.
This set is returned by the

selectedKeys

method.
The selected-key set is always a subset of the key set.
- The

cancelled-key

set is the set of keys that have been
cancelled but whose channels have not yet been deregistered. This set is
not directly accessible. The cancelled-key set is always a subset of the
key set.

All three sets are empty in a newly-created selector.

A key is added to a selector's key set as a side effect of registering a
channel via the channel's

register

method. Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during
selection operations. The key set itself is not directly modifiable.

A key is added to its selector's cancelled-key set when it is cancelled,
whether by closing its channel or by invoking its

cancel

method. Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered
during the next selection operation, at which time the key will be removed
from all of the selector's key sets.

Keys are added to the selected-key set by selection
operations. A key may be removed directly from the selected-key set by
invoking the set's

remove

method or by invoking the

remove

method
of an

iterator

obtained from the set.
All keys may be removed from the selected-key set by invoking the set's

clear

method. Keys may not be added directly
to the selected-key set.

Selection

A selection operation queries the underlying operating system for an
update as to the readiness of each registered channel to perform any of the
operations identified by its key's interest set. There are two forms of
selection operation:

- The

select()

,

select(long)

, and

selectNow()

methods add the keys of channels ready to perform an operation to the
selected-key set, or update the ready-operation set of keys already in the
selected-key set.
- The

select(Consumer)

,

select(Consumer, long)

, and

selectNow(Consumer)

methods perform an

action

on the key
of each channel that is ready to perform an operation. These methods do
not add to the selected-key set.

Selection operations that add to the selected-key set

During each selection operation, keys may be added to and removed from a
selector's selected-key set and may be removed from its key and
cancelled-key sets. Selection is performed by the

select()

,

select(long)

, and

selectNow()

methods, and involves three steps:

- Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered. This step leaves
the cancelled-key set empty.
- The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
operation began. For a channel that is ready for at least one such
operation, one of the following two actions is performed:

- If the channel's key is not already in the selected-key set then
it is added to that set and its ready-operation set is modified to
identify exactly those operations for which the channel is now reported
to be ready. Any readiness information previously recorded in the ready
set is discarded.
- Otherwise the channel's key is already in the selected-key set,
so its ready-operation set is modified to identify any new operations
for which the channel is reported to be ready. Any readiness
information previously recorded in the ready set is preserved; in other
words, the ready set returned by the underlying system is
bitwise-disjoined into the key's current ready set.

If all of the keys in the key set at the start of this step have empty
interest sets then neither the selected-key set nor any of the keys'
ready-operation sets will be updated.

If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
in progress then they are processed as in step (1).

Whether or not a selection operation blocks to wait for one or more
channels to become ready, and if so for how long, is the only essential
difference between the three selection methods.

Selection operations that perform an action on selected keys

During each selection operation, keys may be removed from the selector's
key, selected-key, and cancelled-key sets. Selection is performed by the

select(Consumer)

,

select(Consumer,long)

, and

selectNow(Consumer)

methods, and involves three steps:

- Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered. This step leaves
the cancelled-key set empty.
- The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
operation began.

For a channel that is ready for at least one such operation, the
ready-operation set of the channel's key is set to identify exactly the
operations for which the channel is ready and the

action

specified
to the

select

method is invoked to consume the channel's key. Any
readiness information previously recorded in the ready set is discarded
prior to invoking the

action

.

Alternatively, where a channel is ready for more than one operation,
the

action

may be invoked more than once with the channel's key and
ready-operation set modified to a subset of the operations for which the
channel is ready. Where the

action

is invoked more than once for
the same key then its ready-operation set never contains operation bits
that were contained in the set at previous calls to the

action

in the same selection operation.
- If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
in progress then they are processed as in step (1).

Concurrency

A Selector and its key set are safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads. Its selected-key set and cancelled-key set, however, are not.

The selection operations synchronize on the selector itself, on the
selected-key set, in that order. They also synchronize on the cancelled-key
set during steps (1) and (3) above.

Changes made to the interest sets of a selector's keys while a
selection operation is in progress have no effect upon that operation; they
will be seen by the next selection operation.

Keys may be cancelled and channels may be closed at any time. Hence the
presence of a key in one or more of a selector's key sets does not imply
that the key is valid or that its channel is open. Application code should
be careful to synchronize and check these conditions as necessary if there
is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.

A thread blocked in a selection operation may be interrupted by some
other thread in one of three ways:

- By invoking the selector's

wakeup

method,
- By invoking the selector's

close

method, or
- By invoking the blocked thread's

interrupt

method, in which case its
interrupt status will be set and the selector's

wakeup

method will be invoked.

The

close

method synchronizes on the selector and its
selected-key set in the same order as in a selection operation.

A Selector's key set is safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
Retrieval operations from the key set do not generally block and so may
overlap with new registrations that add to the set, or with the cancellation
steps of selection operations that remove keys from the set. Iterators and
spliterators return elements reflecting the state of the set at some point at
or since the creation of the iterator/spliterator. They do not throw

ConcurrentModificationException

.

A selector's selected-key set is not, in general, safe for use by
multiple concurrent threads. If such a thread might modify the set directly
then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set itself. The
iterators returned by the set's

iterator

methods are

fail-fast:

If the set is modified after the iterator is
created, in any way except by invoking the iterator's own

remove

method, then a

ConcurrentModificationException

will be thrown.

A selector may be created by invoking the

open

method of
this class, which will use the system's default

selector provider

to
create a new selector. A selector may also be created by invoking the

openSelector

method of a custom selector provider. A selector remains open until it is
closed via its

close

method.

A selectable channel's registration with a selector is represented by a

SelectionKey

object. A selector maintains three sets of selection
keys:

- The

key set

contains the keys representing the current
channel registrations of this selector. This set is returned by the

keys

method.
- The

selected-key set

is the set of keys such that each
key's channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the operations
identified in the key's interest set during a prior selection operation
that adds keys or updates keys in the set.
This set is returned by the

selectedKeys

method.
The selected-key set is always a subset of the key set.
- The

cancelled-key

set is the set of keys that have been
cancelled but whose channels have not yet been deregistered. This set is
not directly accessible. The cancelled-key set is always a subset of the
key set.

All three sets are empty in a newly-created selector.

A key is added to a selector's key set as a side effect of registering a
channel via the channel's

register

method. Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during
selection operations. The key set itself is not directly modifiable.

A key is added to its selector's cancelled-key set when it is cancelled,
whether by closing its channel or by invoking its

cancel

method. Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered
during the next selection operation, at which time the key will be removed
from all of the selector's key sets.

Keys are added to the selected-key set by selection
operations. A key may be removed directly from the selected-key set by
invoking the set's

remove

method or by invoking the

remove

method
of an

iterator

obtained from the set.
All keys may be removed from the selected-key set by invoking the set's

clear

method. Keys may not be added directly
to the selected-key set.

Selection

A selection operation queries the underlying operating system for an
update as to the readiness of each registered channel to perform any of the
operations identified by its key's interest set. There are two forms of
selection operation:

- The

select()

,

select(long)

, and

selectNow()

methods add the keys of channels ready to perform an operation to the
selected-key set, or update the ready-operation set of keys already in the
selected-key set.
- The

select(Consumer)

,

select(Consumer, long)

, and

selectNow(Consumer)

methods perform an

action

on the key
of each channel that is ready to perform an operation. These methods do
not add to the selected-key set.

Selection operations that add to the selected-key set

During each selection operation, keys may be added to and removed from a
selector's selected-key set and may be removed from its key and
cancelled-key sets. Selection is performed by the

select()

,

select(long)

, and

selectNow()

methods, and involves three steps:

- Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered. This step leaves
the cancelled-key set empty.
- The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
operation began. For a channel that is ready for at least one such
operation, one of the following two actions is performed:

- If the channel's key is not already in the selected-key set then
it is added to that set and its ready-operation set is modified to
identify exactly those operations for which the channel is now reported
to be ready. Any readiness information previously recorded in the ready
set is discarded.
- Otherwise the channel's key is already in the selected-key set,
so its ready-operation set is modified to identify any new operations
for which the channel is reported to be ready. Any readiness
information previously recorded in the ready set is preserved; in other
words, the ready set returned by the underlying system is
bitwise-disjoined into the key's current ready set.

If all of the keys in the key set at the start of this step have empty
interest sets then neither the selected-key set nor any of the keys'
ready-operation sets will be updated.

If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
in progress then they are processed as in step (1).

Whether or not a selection operation blocks to wait for one or more
channels to become ready, and if so for how long, is the only essential
difference between the three selection methods.

Selection operations that perform an action on selected keys

During each selection operation, keys may be removed from the selector's
key, selected-key, and cancelled-key sets. Selection is performed by the

the cancelled-key set empty.
- The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection

For a channel that is ready for at least one such operation, the
ready-operation set of the channel's key is set to identify exactly the
operations for which the channel is ready and the

action

specified
to the

select

method is invoked to consume the channel's key. Any
readiness information previously recorded in the ready set is discarded
prior to invoking the

action

.

Alternatively, where a channel is ready for more than one operation,
the

action

may be invoked more than once with the channel's key and
ready-operation set modified to a subset of the operations for which the
channel is ready. Where the

action

is invoked more than once for
the same key then its ready-operation set never contains operation bits
that were contained in the set at previous calls to the

A Selector and its key set are safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads. Its selected-key set and cancelled-key set, however, are not.

The selection operations synchronize on the selector itself, on the
selected-key set, in that order. They also synchronize on the cancelled-key
set during steps (1) and (3) above.

selection operation is in progress have no effect upon that operation; they
will be seen by the next selection operation.

Keys may be cancelled and channels may be closed at any time. Hence the
presence of a key in one or more of a selector's key sets does not imply
that the key is valid or that its channel is open. Application code should
be careful to synchronize and check these conditions as necessary if there
is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.

A thread blocked in a selection operation may be interrupted by some
other thread in one of three ways:

- By invoking the selector's

wakeup

method,
- By invoking the selector's

close

method, or
- By invoking the blocked thread's

interrupt

method, in which case its
interrupt status will be set and the selector's

wakeup

method will be invoked.

The

close

method synchronizes on the selector and its
selected-key set in the same order as in a selection operation.

A Selector's key set is safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
Retrieval operations from the key set do not generally block and so may

during the next selection operation, at which time the key will be removed
from all of the selector's key sets.

then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set itself. The
iterators returned by the set's

iterator

methods are

fail-fast:

If the set is modified after the iterator is
created, in any way except by invoking the iterator's own

remove

method, then a

ConcurrentModificationException

will be thrown.

A key is added to a selector's key set as a side effect of registering a
channel via the channel's

register

method. Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during
selection operations. The key set itself is not directly modifiable.

A key is added to its selector's cancelled-key set when it is cancelled,
whether by closing its channel or by invoking its

cancel

method. Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered
during the next selection operation, at which time the key will be removed
from all of the selector's key sets.

Keys are added to the selected-key set by selection
operations. A key may be removed directly from the selected-key set by
invoking the set's

remove

method or by invoking the

remove

method
of an

iterator

obtained from the set.
All keys may be removed from the selected-key set by invoking the set's

clear

method. Keys may not be added directly
to the selected-key set.

Selection

A selection operation queries the underlying operating system for an
update as to the readiness of each registered channel to perform any of the
operations identified by its key's interest set. There are two forms of
selection operation:

- The

select()

,

select(long)

, and

selectNow()

methods add the keys of channels ready to perform an operation to the
selected-key set, or update the ready-operation set of keys already in the
selected-key set.
- The

select(Consumer)

,

select(Consumer, long)

, and

selectNow(Consumer)

methods perform an

action

on the key
of each channel that is ready to perform an operation. These methods do
not add to the selected-key set.

Selection operations that add to the selected-key set

During each selection operation, keys may be added to and removed from a
selector's selected-key set and may be removed from its key and
cancelled-key sets. Selection is performed by the

select()

,

select(long)

, and

selectNow()

methods, and involves three steps:

- Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered. This step leaves
the cancelled-key set empty.
- The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
operation began. For a channel that is ready for at least one such
operation, one of the following two actions is performed:

- If the channel's key is not already in the selected-key set then
it is added to that set and its ready-operation set is modified to
identify exactly those operations for which the channel is now reported
to be ready. Any readiness information previously recorded in the ready
set is discarded.
- Otherwise the channel's key is already in the selected-key set,
so its ready-operation set is modified to identify any new operations
for which the channel is reported to be ready. Any readiness
information previously recorded in the ready set is preserved; in other
words, the ready set returned by the underlying system is
bitwise-disjoined into the key's current ready set.

If all of the keys in the key set at the start of this step have empty
interest sets then neither the selected-key set nor any of the keys'
ready-operation sets will be updated.

If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
in progress then they are processed as in step (1).

Whether or not a selection operation blocks to wait for one or more
channels to become ready, and if so for how long, is the only essential
difference between the three selection methods.

Selection operations that perform an action on selected keys

During each selection operation, keys may be removed from the selector's
key, selected-key, and cancelled-key sets. Selection is performed by the

select(Consumer)

,

select(Consumer,long)

, and

selectNow(Consumer)

methods, and involves three steps:

- Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered. This step leaves
the cancelled-key set empty.
- The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
operation began.

For a channel that is ready for at least one such operation, the
ready-operation set of the channel's key is set to identify exactly the
operations for which the channel is ready and the

action

specified
to the

select

method is invoked to consume the channel's key. Any
readiness information previously recorded in the ready set is discarded
prior to invoking the

action

.

Alternatively, where a channel is ready for more than one operation,
the

action

may be invoked more than once with the channel's key and
ready-operation set modified to a subset of the operations for which the
channel is ready. Where the

action

is invoked more than once for
the same key then its ready-operation set never contains operation bits
that were contained in the set at previous calls to the

action

in the same selection operation.
- If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
in progress then they are processed as in step (1).

Concurrency

A Selector and its key set are safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads. Its selected-key set and cancelled-key set, however, are not.

The selection operations synchronize on the selector itself, on the
selected-key set, in that order. They also synchronize on the cancelled-key
set during steps (1) and (3) above.

Changes made to the interest sets of a selector's keys while a
selection operation is in progress have no effect upon that operation; they
will be seen by the next selection operation.

Keys may be cancelled and channels may be closed at any time. Hence the
presence of a key in one or more of a selector's key sets does not imply
that the key is valid or that its channel is open. Application code should
be careful to synchronize and check these conditions as necessary if there
is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.

A thread blocked in a selection operation may be interrupted by some
other thread in one of three ways:

- By invoking the selector's

wakeup

method,
- By invoking the selector's

close

method, or
- By invoking the blocked thread's

interrupt

method, in which case its
interrupt status will be set and the selector's

wakeup

method will be invoked.

The

close

method synchronizes on the selector and its
selected-key set in the same order as in a selection operation.

A Selector's key set is safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
Retrieval operations from the key set do not generally block and so may
overlap with new registrations that add to the set, or with the cancellation
steps of selection operations that remove keys from the set. Iterators and
spliterators return elements reflecting the state of the set at some point at
or since the creation of the iterator/spliterator. They do not throw

ConcurrentModificationException

.

is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.

A thread blocked in a selection operation may be interrupted by some
other thread in one of three ways:

- By invoking the selector's

wakeup

method,
- By invoking the selector's

close

method, or
- By invoking the blocked thread's

interrupt

method, in which case its
interrupt status will be set and the selector's

wakeup

method will be invoked.

The

close

method synchronizes on the selector and its
selected-key set in the same order as in a selection operation.

A Selector's key set is safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
Retrieval operations from the key set do not generally block and so may
overlap with new registrations that add to the set, or with the cancellation
steps of selection operations that remove keys from the set. Iterators and
spliterators return elements reflecting the state of the set at some point at
or since the creation of the iterator/spliterator. They do not throw

ConcurrentModificationException

.

A selector's selected-key set is not, in general, safe for use by
multiple concurrent threads. If such a thread might modify the set directly
then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set itself. The
iterators returned by the set's

iterator

methods are

fail-fast:

If the set is modified after the iterator is
created, in any way except by invoking the iterator's own

remove

method, then a

ConcurrentModificationException

will be thrown.

The selection operations synchronize on the selector itself, on the
selected-key set, in that order. They also synchronize on the cancelled-key
set during steps (1) and (3) above.

Changes made to the interest sets of a selector's keys while a
selection operation is in progress have no effect upon that operation; they
will be seen by the next selection operation.

Keys may be cancelled and channels may be closed at any time. Hence the
presence of a key in one or more of a selector's key sets does not imply
that the key is valid or that its channel is open. Application code should
be careful to synchronize and check these conditions as necessary if there
is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.

A thread blocked in a selection operation may be interrupted by some
other thread in one of three ways:

```java
protected Selector()
```

Initializes a new instance of this class.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- open

```java
public static
Selector
open()
throws
IOException
```

Opens a selector.

The new selector is created by invoking the

openSelector

method
of the system-wide default

SelectorProvider

object.

**Returns:** A new selector
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

- isOpen

```java
public abstract boolean isOpen()
```

Tells whether or not this selector is open.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this selector is open

- provider

```java
public abstract
SelectorProvider
provider()
```

Returns the provider that created this channel.

**Returns:** The provider that created this channel

- keys

```java
public abstract
Set
<
SelectionKey
> keys()
```

Returns this selector's key set.

The key set is not directly modifiable. A key is removed only after
it has been cancelled and its channel has been deregistered. Any
attempt to modify the key set will cause an

UnsupportedOperationException

to be thrown.

The set is

safe

for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

**Returns:** This selector's key set
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed

- selectedKeys

```java
public abstract
Set
<
SelectionKey
> selectedKeys()
```

Returns this selector's selected-key set.

Keys may be removed from, but not directly added to, the
selected-key set. Any attempt to add an object to the key set will
cause an

UnsupportedOperationException

to be thrown.

The selected-key set is

not thread-safe

.

**Returns:** This selector's selected-key set
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed

- selectNow

```java
public abstract int selectNow()
throws
IOException
```

Selects a set of keys whose corresponding channels are ready for I/O
operations.

This method performs a non-blocking

selection
operation

. If no channels have become selectable since the previous
selection operation then this method immediately returns zero.

Invoking this method clears the effect of any previous invocations
of the

wakeup

method.

**Returns:** The number of keys, possibly zero, whose ready-operation sets
were updated by the selection operation
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed

- select

```java
public abstract int select​(long timeout)
throws
IOException
```

Selects a set of keys whose corresponding channels are ready for I/O
operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It returns only after at least one channel is selected,
this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, the current
thread is interrupted, or the given timeout period expires, whichever
comes first.

This method does not offer real-time guarantees: It schedules the
timeout as if by invoking the

Object.wait(long)

method.

**Parameters:** timeout

- If positive, block for up to

timeout

milliseconds, more or less, while waiting for a
channel to become ready; if zero, block indefinitely;
must not be negative
**Returns:** The number of keys, possibly zero,
whose ready-operation sets were updated
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the value of the timeout argument is negative

- select

```java
public abstract int select()
throws
IOException
```

Selects a set of keys whose corresponding channels are ready for I/O
operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It returns only after at least one channel is selected,
this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, or the current
thread is interrupted, whichever comes first.

**Returns:** The number of keys, possibly zero,
whose ready-operation sets were updated
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed

- select

```java
public int select​(
Consumer
<
SelectionKey
> action,
long timeout)
throws
IOException
```

Selects and performs an action on the keys whose corresponding channels
are ready for I/O operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It wakes up from querying the operating system only when
at least one channel is selected, this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, the current thread is interrupted, or the given
timeout period expires, whichever comes first.

The specified

action

's

accept

method is invoked with the key for each channel that is ready to perform
an operation identified by its key's interest set. The

accept

method may be invoked more than once for the same key but with the
ready-operation set containing a subset of the operations for which the
channel is ready (as described above). The

accept

method is
invoked while synchronized on the selector and its selected-key set.
Great care must be taken to avoid deadlocking with other threads that
also synchronize on these objects. Selection operations are not reentrant
in general and consequently the

action

should take great care not
to attempt a selection operation on the same selector. The behavior when
attempting a reentrant selection operation is implementation specific and
therefore not specified. If the

action

closes the selector then

ClosedSelectorException

is thrown when the action completes.
The

action

is not prohibited from closing channels registered with
the selector, nor prohibited from cancelling keys or changing a key's
interest set. If a channel is selected but its key is cancelled or its
interest set changed before the

action

is performed on the key
then it is implementation specific as to whether the

action

is
invoked (it may be invoked with an

invalid

key). Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller.

This method does not offer real-time guarantees: It schedules the
timeout as if by invoking the

Object.wait(long)

method.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation removes all keys from the
selected-key set, invokes

select(long)

with the
given timeout and then performs the action for each key added to the
selected-key set. The default implementation does not detect the action
performing a reentrant selection operation. The selected-key set may
or may not be empty on completion of the default implementation.
**Parameters:** action

- The action to perform
**Parameters:** timeout

- If positive, block for up to

timeout

milliseconds, more or less, while waiting for a
channel to become ready; if zero, block indefinitely;
must not be negative
**Returns:** The number of unique keys consumed, possibly zero
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed or is closed by the action
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the value of the timeout argument is negative
**Since:** 11

- select

```java
public int select​(
Consumer
<
SelectionKey
> action)
throws
IOException
```

Selects and performs an action on the keys whose corresponding channels
are ready for I/O operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It wakes up from querying the operating system only when
at least one channel is selected, this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, or the current thread is interrupted, whichever comes
first.

This method is equivalent to invoking the 2-arg

select

method with a timeout of

0

to block indefinitely.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation invokes the 2-arg

select

method with a timeout of

0

.
**Parameters:** action

- The action to perform
**Returns:** The number of unique keys consumed, possibly zero
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed or is closed by the action
**Since:** 11

- selectNow

```java
public int selectNow​(
Consumer
<
SelectionKey
> action)
throws
IOException
```

Selects and performs an action on the keys whose corresponding channels
are ready for I/O operations.

This method performs a non-blocking

selection
operation

.

Invoking this method clears the effect of any previous invocations
of the

wakeup

method.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation removes all keys from the
selected-key set, invokes

selectNow()

and then
performs the action for each key added to the selected-key set. The
default implementation does not detect the action performing a reentrant
selection operation. The selected-key set may or may not be empty on
completion of the default implementation.
**Parameters:** action

- The action to perform
**Returns:** The number of unique keys consumed, possibly zero
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed or is closed by the action
**Since:** 11

- wakeup

```java
public abstract
Selector
wakeup()
```

Causes the first selection operation that has not yet returned to return
immediately.

If another thread is currently blocked in a selection operation then
that invocation will return immediately. If no selection operation is
currently in progress then the next invocation of a selection operation
will return immediately unless

selectNow()

or

selectNow(Consumer)

is invoked in the meantime. In any case the value
returned by that invocation may be non-zero. Subsequent selection
operations will block as usual unless this method is invoked again in the
meantime.

Invoking this method more than once between two successive selection
operations has the same effect as invoking it just once.

**Returns:** This selector

- close

```java
public abstract void close()
throws
IOException
```

Closes this selector.

If a thread is currently blocked in one of this selector's selection
methods then it is interrupted as if by invoking the selector's

wakeup

method.

Any uncancelled keys still associated with this selector are
invalidated, their channels are deregistered, and any other resources
associated with this selector are released.

If this selector is already closed then invoking this method has no
effect.

After a selector is closed, any further attempt to use it, except by
invoking this method or the

wakeup

method, will cause a

ClosedSelectorException

to be thrown.

Selects a set of keys whose corresponding channels are ready for I/O
operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It returns only after at least one channel is selected,
this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, or the current
thread is interrupted, whichever comes first.

**Returns:** The number of keys, possibly zero,
whose ready-operation sets were updated
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed

- select

```java
public int select​(
Consumer
<
SelectionKey
> action,
long timeout)
throws
IOException
```

Selects and performs an action on the keys whose corresponding channels
are ready for I/O operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It wakes up from querying the operating system only when
at least one channel is selected, this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, the current thread is interrupted, or the given
timeout period expires, whichever comes first.

The specified

action

's

accept

method is invoked with the key for each channel that is ready to perform
an operation identified by its key's interest set. The

accept

method may be invoked more than once for the same key but with the
ready-operation set containing a subset of the operations for which the
channel is ready (as described above). The

accept

method is
invoked while synchronized on the selector and its selected-key set.
Great care must be taken to avoid deadlocking with other threads that
also synchronize on these objects. Selection operations are not reentrant
in general and consequently the

action

should take great care not
to attempt a selection operation on the same selector. The behavior when
attempting a reentrant selection operation is implementation specific and
therefore not specified. If the

action

closes the selector then

ClosedSelectorException

is thrown when the action completes.
The

action

is not prohibited from closing channels registered with
the selector, nor prohibited from cancelling keys or changing a key's
interest set. If a channel is selected but its key is cancelled or its
interest set changed before the

action

is performed on the key
then it is implementation specific as to whether the

action

is
invoked (it may be invoked with an

invalid

key). Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller.

This method does not offer real-time guarantees: It schedules the
timeout as if by invoking the

Object.wait(long)

method.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation removes all keys from the
selected-key set, invokes

select(long)

with the
given timeout and then performs the action for each key added to the
selected-key set. The default implementation does not detect the action
performing a reentrant selection operation. The selected-key set may
or may not be empty on completion of the default implementation.
**Parameters:** action

- The action to perform
**Parameters:** timeout

- If positive, block for up to

timeout

milliseconds, more or less, while waiting for a
channel to become ready; if zero, block indefinitely;
must not be negative
**Returns:** The number of unique keys consumed, possibly zero
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed or is closed by the action
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the value of the timeout argument is negative

```

Selects and performs an action on the keys whose corresponding channels
are ready for I/O operations.

This method performs a blocking

selection
operation

. It wakes up from querying the operating system only when
at least one channel is selected, this selector's

wakeup

method is invoked, or the current thread is interrupted, whichever comes
first.

This method is equivalent to invoking the 2-arg

select

method with a timeout of

0

to block indefinitely.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation invokes the 2-arg

select

method with a timeout of

0

.
**Parameters:** action

- The action to perform
**Returns:** The number of unique keys consumed, possibly zero
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed or is closed by the action
**Since:** 11

- selectNow

```java
public int selectNow​(

```

Selects and performs an action on the keys whose corresponding channels
are ready for I/O operations.

This method performs a non-blocking

selection
operation

.

Invoking this method clears the effect of any previous invocations
of the

wakeup

method.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation removes all keys from the
selected-key set, invokes

selectNow()

and then
performs the action for each key added to the selected-key set. The
default implementation does not detect the action performing a reentrant
selection operation. The selected-key set may or may not be empty on
completion of the default implementation.
**Parameters:** action

- The action to perform
**Returns:** The number of unique keys consumed, possibly zero
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** ClosedSelectorException

- If this selector is closed or is closed by the action
**Since:** 11

- wakeup

```java
public abstract
Selector
wakeup()
```

Causes the first selection operation that has not yet returned to return
immediately.

If another thread is currently blocked in a selection operation then
that invocation will return immediately. If no selection operation is
currently in progress then the next invocation of a selection operation
will return immediately unless

selectNow()

or

selectNow(Consumer)

is invoked in the meantime. In any case the value
returned by that invocation may be non-zero. Subsequent selection
operations will block as usual unless this method is invoked again in the
meantime.

Invoking this method more than once between two successive selection
operations has the same effect as invoking it just once.

**Returns:** This selector

- close

```java
public abstract void close()
throws
IOException
```

Closes this selector.

If a thread is currently blocked in one of this selector's selection
methods then it is interrupted as if by invoking the selector's

wakeup

method.

Any uncancelled keys still associated with this selector are
invalidated, their channels are deregistered, and any other resources
associated with this selector are released.

If this selector is already closed then invoking this method has no
effect.

After a selector is closed, any further attempt to use it, except by
invoking this method or the

wakeup

method, will cause a

ClosedSelectorException

to be thrown.
