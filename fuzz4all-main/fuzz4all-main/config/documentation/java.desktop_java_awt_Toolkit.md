# Class Toolkit

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\Toolkit.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Toolkit

extends
Object
```

This class is the abstract superclass of all actual
implementations of the Abstract Window Toolkit. Subclasses of
the

Toolkit

class are used to bind the various components
to particular native toolkit implementations.

Many GUI events may be delivered to user
asynchronously, if the opposite is not specified explicitly.
As well as
many GUI operations may be performed asynchronously.
This fact means that if the state of a component is set, and then
the state immediately queried, the returned value may not yet
reflect the requested change. This behavior includes, but is not
limited to:

- Scrolling to a specified position.

For example, calling

ScrollPane.setScrollPosition

and then

getScrollPosition

may return an incorrect
value if the original request has not yet been processed.

Moving the focus from one component to another.

For more information, see

Timing
Focus Transfers

, a section in

The Swing
Tutorial

.

Making a top-level container visible.

Calling

setVisible(true)

on a

Window

,

Frame

or

Dialog

may occur
asynchronously.

Setting the size or location of a top-level container.

Calls to

setSize

,

setBounds

or

setLocation

on a

Window

,

Frame

or

Dialog

are forwarded
to the underlying window management system and may be
ignored or modified. See

Window

for
more information.

Most applications should not call any of the methods in this
class directly. The methods defined by

Toolkit

are
the "glue" that joins the platform-independent classes in the

java.awt

package with their counterparts in

java.awt.peer

. Some methods defined by

Toolkit

query the native operating system directly.

#### protected void loadSystemColors​(int[] systemColors)
throws
HeadlessException

Fills in the integer array that is supplied as an argument
with the current system color values.

**Parameters:**
- systemColors

- an integer array.

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

#### public void setDynamicLayout​(boolean dynamic)
throws
HeadlessException

Controls whether the layout of Containers is validated dynamically
during resizing, or statically, after resizing is complete.
Use

isDynamicLayoutActive()

to detect if this feature enabled
in this program and is supported by this operating system
and/or window manager.
Note that this feature is supported not on all platforms, and
conversely, that this feature cannot be turned off on some platforms.
On these platforms where dynamic layout during resizing is not supported
(or is always supported), setting this property has no effect.
Note that this feature can be set or unset as a property of the
operating system or window manager on some platforms. On such
platforms, the dynamic resize property must be set at the operating
system or window manager level before this method can take effect.
This method does not change support or settings of the underlying
operating system or
window manager. The OS/WM support can be
queried using getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported") method.

**Parameters:**
- dynamic

- If true, Containers should re-layout their
components as the Container is being resized. If false,
the layout will be validated after resizing is completed.

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true

**See Also:**
- isDynamicLayoutSet()

#### protected boolean isDynamicLayoutSet()
throws
HeadlessException

Returns whether the layout of Containers is validated dynamically
during resizing, or statically, after resizing is complete.
Note: this method returns the value that was set programmatically;
it does not reflect support at the level of the operating system
or window manager for dynamic layout on resizing, or the current
operating system or window manager settings. The OS/WM support can
be queried using getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported").

**Returns:**
- true if validation of Containers is done dynamically,
false if validation is done after resizing is finished.

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true

**See Also:**
- setDynamicLayout(boolean dynamic)

#### public boolean isDynamicLayoutActive()
throws
HeadlessException

Returns whether dynamic layout of Containers on resize is currently
enabled on the underlying operating system and/or window manager. If the
platform supports it,

setDynamicLayout(boolean)

may be used to
programmatically enable or disable platform dynamic layout. Regardless of
whether that toggling is supported, or whether

true

or

false

is specified as an argument, or has never been called at all, this
method will return the active current platform behavior and which will be
followed by the JDK in determining layout policy during resizing.

If dynamic layout is currently inactive then Containers re-layout their
components when resizing is completed. As a result the

Component.validate()

method will be invoked only once per resize.
If dynamic layout is currently active then Containers re-layout their
components on every native resize event and the

validate()

method
will be invoked each time. The OS/WM support can be queried using the
getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported") method. This property
will reflect the platform capability but is not sufficient to tell if it
is presently enabled.

**Returns:**
- true if dynamic layout of Containers on resize is currently
active, false otherwise.

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if the GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless() method
returns true

ColorModel
getColorModel()
throws
HeadlessException

Determines the color model of this toolkit's screen.

ColorModel

is an abstract class that
encapsulates the ability to translate between the
pixel values of an image and its red, green, blue,
and alpha components.

This toolkit method is called by the

getColorModel

method
of the

Component

class.

**Returns:**
- the color model of this toolkit's screen.

**Throws:**

#### @Deprecated

public abstract
String
[] getFontList()

Returns the names of the available fonts in this toolkit.

For 1.1, the following font names are deprecated (the replacement
name follows):

- TimesRoman (use Serif)

Helvetica (use SansSerif)

Courier (use Monospaced)

The ZapfDingbats fontname is also deprecated in 1.1 but the characters
are defined in Unicode starting at 0x2700, and as of 1.1 Java supports
those characters.

**Returns:**
- the names of the available fonts in this toolkit.

**See Also:**
- GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames()

---

#### @Deprecated

public abstract
FontMetrics
getFontMetrics​(
Font
font)

Gets the screen device metrics for rendering of the font.

**Parameters:**
- font

- a font

**Returns:**
- the screen metrics of the specified font in this toolkit

**See Also:**
- LineMetrics

,

Font.getLineMetrics(java.lang.String, java.awt.font.FontRenderContext)

#### public abstract void sync()

Synchronizes this toolkit's graphics state. Some window systems
may do buffering of graphics events.

This method ensures that the display is up-to-date. It is useful
for animation.

---

#### public static
Toolkit
getDefaultToolkit()

Gets the default toolkit.

If a system property named

"java.awt.headless"

is set
to

true

then the headless implementation
of

Toolkit

is used,
otherwise the default platform-specific implementation of

Toolkit

is used.

If this Toolkit is not a headless implementation and if they exist, service
providers of

AccessibilityProvider

will be loaded
if specified by the system property

javax.accessibility.assistive_technologies

.

An example of setting this property is to invoke Java with

-Djavax.accessibility.assistive_technologies=MyServiceProvider

.
In addition to MyServiceProvider other service providers can be specified
using a comma separated list. Service providers are loaded after the AWT
toolkit is created. All errors are handled via an AWTError exception.

The names specified in the assistive_technologies property are used to query
each service provider implementation. If the requested name matches the

name

of the service provider, the

AccessibilityProvider.activate()

method will be invoked to activate the
matching service provider.

**Returns:**
- the default toolkit.

**Throws:**
- AWTError

- if a toolkit could not be found, or
if one could not be accessed or instantiated.

**See Also:**
- ServiceLoader

,

AccessibilityProvider

**Implementation Requirements:**
- If assistive technology service providers are not specified with a system
property this implementation will look in a properties file located as follows:

- ${user.home}/.accessibility.properties

${java.home}/conf/accessibility.properties

Only the first of these files to be located will be consulted. The requested
service providers are specified by setting the

assistive_technologies=

property. A single provider or a comma separated list of providers can be
specified.

#### public abstract
Image
getImage​(
String
filename)

Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified file,
whose format can be either GIF, JPEG or PNG.
The underlying toolkit attempts to resolve multiple requests
with the same filename to the same returned Image.

Since the mechanism required to facilitate this sharing of

Image

objects may continue to hold onto images
that are no longer in use for an indefinite period of time,
developers are encouraged to implement their own caching of
images by using the

createImage

variant wherever available.
If the image data contained in the specified file changes,
the

Image

object returned from this method may
still contain stale information which was loaded from the
file after a prior call.
Previously loaded image data can be manually discarded by
calling the

flush

method on the
returned

Image

.

This method first checks if there is a security manager installed.
If so, the method calls the security manager's

checkRead

method with the file specified to ensure
that the access to the image is allowed.

**Parameters:**
- filename

- the name of a file containing pixel data
in a recognized file format.

**Returns:**
- an image which gets its pixel data from
the specified file.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its
checkRead method doesn't allow the operation.

**See Also:**
- createImage(java.lang.String)

---

#### public abstract
Image
getImage​(
URL
url)

Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified URL.
The pixel data referenced by the specified URL must be in one
of the following formats: GIF, JPEG or PNG.
The underlying toolkit attempts to resolve multiple requests
with the same URL to the same returned Image.

Since the mechanism required to facilitate this sharing of

Image

objects may continue to hold onto images
that are no longer in use for an indefinite period of time,
developers are encouraged to implement their own caching of
images by using the

createImage

variant wherever available.
If the image data stored at the specified URL changes,
the

Image

object returned from this method may
still contain stale information which was fetched from the
URL after a prior call.
Previously loaded image data can be manually discarded by
calling the

flush

method on the
returned

Image

.

This method first checks if there is a security manager installed.
If so, the method calls the security manager's

checkPermission

method with the corresponding
permission to ensure that the access to the image is allowed.
If the connection to the specified URL requires
either

URLPermission

or

SocketPermission

,
then

URLPermission

is used for security checks.

**Parameters:**
- url

- the URL to use in fetching the pixel data.

**Returns:**
- an image which gets its pixel data from
the specified URL.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its
checkPermission method doesn't allow
the operation.

**See Also:**
- createImage(java.net.URL)

---

#### public abstract
Image
createImage​(
String
filename)

Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified file.
The returned Image is a new object which will not be shared
with any other caller of this method or its getImage variant.

This method first checks if there is a security manager installed.
If so, the method calls the security manager's

checkRead

method with the specified file to ensure
that the image creation is allowed.

**Parameters:**
- filename

- the name of a file containing pixel data
in a recognized file format.

**Returns:**
- an image which gets its pixel data from
the specified file.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its
checkRead method doesn't allow the operation.

createImage​(
URL
url)

Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified URL.
The returned Image is a new object which will not be shared
with any other caller of this method or its getImage variant.

This method first checks if there is a security manager installed.
If so, the method calls the security manager's

checkPermission

method with the corresponding
permission to ensure that the image creation is allowed.
If the connection to the specified URL requires
either

URLPermission

or

SocketPermission

,
then

URLPermission

is used for security checks.

**Parameters:**
- url

- the URL to use in fetching the pixel data.

**Returns:**
- an image which gets its pixel data from
the specified URL.

#### public abstract boolean prepareImage​(
Image
image,
int width,
int height,

ImageObserver
observer)

Prepares an image for rendering.

If the values of the width and height arguments are both

-1

, this method prepares the image for rendering
on the default screen; otherwise, this method prepares an image
for rendering on the default screen at the specified width and height.

The image data is downloaded asynchronously in another thread,
and an appropriately scaled screen representation of the image is
generated.

This method is called by components

prepareImage

methods.

Information on the flags returned by this method can be found
with the definition of the

ImageObserver

interface.

**Parameters:**
- image

- the image for which to prepare a
screen representation.
- width

- the width of the desired screen
representation, or

-1

.
- height

- the height of the desired screen
representation, or

-1

.
- observer

- the

ImageObserver

object to be notified as the
image is being prepared.

**Returns:**
- true

if the image has already been
fully prepared;

false

otherwise.

#### public abstract int checkImage​(
Image
image,
int width,
int height,

ImageObserver
observer)

Indicates the construction status of a specified image that is
being prepared for display.

If the values of the width and height arguments are both

-1

, this method returns the construction status of
a screen representation of the specified image in this toolkit.
Otherwise, this method returns the construction status of a
scaled representation of the image at the specified width
and height.

This method does not cause the image to begin loading.
An application must call

prepareImage

to force
the loading of an image.

This method is called by the component's

checkImage

methods.

Information on the flags returned by this method can be found
with the definition of the

ImageObserver

interface.

**Parameters:**
- image

- the image whose status is being checked.
- width

- the width of the scaled version whose status is
being checked, or

-1

.

#### public
Image
createImage​(byte[] imagedata)

Creates an image which decodes the image stored in the specified
byte array.

The data must be in some image format, such as GIF or JPEG,
that is supported by this toolkit.

**Parameters:**
- imagedata

- an array of bytes, representing
image data in a supported image format.

**Returns:**
- an image.

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### public abstract
Image
createImage​(byte[] imagedata,
int imageoffset,
int imagelength)

Creates an image which decodes the image stored in the specified
byte array, and at the specified offset and length.
The data must be in some image format, such as GIF or JPEG,
that is supported by this toolkit.

**Parameters:**
- imagedata

- an array of bytes, representing
image data in a supported image format.

#### public abstract
PrintJob
getPrintJob​(
Frame
frame,

String
jobtitle,

Properties
props)

Gets a

PrintJob

object which is the result of initiating
a print operation on the toolkit's platform.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPrintJobAccess

method to
ensure initiation of a print operation is allowed. If the default
implementation of

checkPrintJobAccess

is used (that is,
that method is not overriden), then this results in a call to the
security manager's

checkPermission

method with a

RuntimePermission("queuePrintJob")

permission.

**Parameters:**
- frame

- the parent of the print dialog. May not be null.
- jobtitle

- the title of the PrintJob. A null title is equivalent
to "".
- props

- a Properties object containing zero or more properties.
Properties are not standardized and are not consistent across
implementations. Because of this, PrintJobs which require job
and page control should use the version of this function which
takes JobAttributes and PageAttributes objects. This object
may be updated to reflect the user's job choices on exit. May
be null.

**Returns:**
- a

PrintJob

object, or

null

if the
user cancelled the print job.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if frame is null
- SecurityException

- if this thread is not allowed to initiate a
print job request

#### public
PrintJob
getPrintJob​(
Frame
frame,

String
jobtitle,

JobAttributes
jobAttributes,

PageAttributes
pageAttributes)

Gets a

PrintJob

object which is the result of initiating
a print operation on the toolkit's platform.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPrintJobAccess

method to
ensure initiation of a print operation is allowed. If the default
implementation of

checkPrintJobAccess

is used (that is,
that method is not overriden), then this results in a call to the
security manager's

checkPermission

method with a

RuntimePermission("queuePrintJob")

permission.

**Parameters:**
- frame

- the parent of the print dialog. May not be null.
- jobtitle

- the title of the PrintJob. A null title is equivalent
to "".
- jobAttributes

- a set of job attributes which will control the
PrintJob. The attributes will be updated to reflect the user's
choices as outlined in the JobAttributes documentation. May be
null.
- pageAttributes

- a set of page attributes which will control the
PrintJob. The attributes will be applied to every page in the
job. The attributes will be updated to reflect the user's
choices as outlined in the PageAttributes documentation. May be
null.

**Returns:**
- a

PrintJob

object, or

null

if the
user cancelled the print job.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if frame is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if pageAttributes specifies differing
cross feed and feed resolutions. Also if this thread has
access to the file system and jobAttributes specifies
print to file, and the specified destination file exists but
is a directory rather than a regular file, does not exist but
cannot be created, or cannot be opened for any other reason.
However in the case of print to file, if a dialog is also
requested to be displayed then the user will be given an
opportunity to select a file and proceed with printing.
The dialog will ensure that the selected output file
is valid before returning from this method.
- SecurityException

- if this thread is not allowed to initiate a
print job request, or if jobAttributes specifies print to file,
and this thread is not allowed to access the file system

#### public abstract
Clipboard
getSystemClipboard()
throws
HeadlessException

Gets the singleton instance of the system Clipboard which interfaces
with clipboard facilities provided by the native platform. This
clipboard enables data transfer between Java programs and native
applications which use native clipboard facilities.

In addition to any and all default formats text returned by the system
Clipboard's

getTransferData()

method is available in the
following flavors:

- DataFlavor.stringFlavor
- DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor (

deprecated

)

As with

java.awt.datatransfer.StringSelection

, if the
requested flavor is

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

, or an
equivalent flavor, a Reader is returned.

Note:

The behavior of
the system Clipboard's

getTransferData()

method for

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

, and equivalent DataFlavors, is
inconsistent with the definition of

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

.
Because of this, support for

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

, and equivalent flavors, is

deprecated

.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPermission

method to check

AWTPermission("accessClipboard")

.

**Returns:**
- the system Clipboard

#### public
Clipboard
getSystemSelection()
throws
HeadlessException

Gets the singleton instance of the system selection as a

Clipboard

object. This allows an application to read and
modify the current, system-wide selection.

An application is responsible for updating the system selection whenever
the user selects text, using either the mouse or the keyboard.
Typically, this is implemented by installing a

FocusListener

on all

Component

s which support
text selection, and, between

FOCUS_GAINED

and

FOCUS_LOST

events delivered to that

Component

,
updating the system selection

Clipboard

when the selection
changes inside the

Component

. Properly updating the system
selection ensures that a Java application will interact correctly with
native applications and other Java applications running simultaneously
on the system. Note that

java.awt.TextComponent

and

javax.swing.text.JTextComponent

already adhere to this
policy. When using these classes, and their subclasses, developers need
not write any additional code.

Some platforms do not support a system selection

Clipboard

.
On those platforms, this method will return

null

. In such a
case, an application is absolved from its responsibility to update the
system selection

Clipboard

as described above.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPermission

method to check

AWTPermission("accessClipboard")

.

**Returns:**
- the system selection as a

Clipboard

, or

null

if the native platform does not support a
system selection

Clipboard

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

VK_NUM_LOCK

,

VK_SCROLL_LOCK

, and

VK_KANA_LOCK

.

**Parameters:**
- keyCode

- the key code

**Returns:**
- true

if the given key is currently in its "on" state;
otherwise

false

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

keyCode

is not one of the valid key codes
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the host system doesn't
allow getting the state of this key programmatically, or if the keyboard
doesn't have this key

---

#### public void setLockingKeyState​(int keyCode,
boolean on)
throws
UnsupportedOperationException

Sets the state of the given locking key on the keyboard.
Valid key codes are

VK_CAPS_LOCK

,

VK_NUM_LOCK

,

VK_SCROLL_LOCK

, and

VK_KANA_LOCK

.

Depending on the platform, setting the state of a locking key may
involve event processing and therefore may not be immediately
observable through getLockingKeyState.

**Parameters:**
- keyCode

- the key code
- on

- the state of the key

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

keyCode

is not one of the valid key codes
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the host system doesn't
allow setting the state of this key programmatically, or if the keyboard
doesn't have this key
- HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true

**See Also:**

given a native component (eg the direct parent may be lightweight).

**Parameters:**
- c

- the component to fetch the container for

**Returns:**
- the native container object for the component

---

#### public
Cursor
createCustomCursor​(
Image
cursor,

Point
hotSpot,

String
name)
throws
IndexOutOfBoundsException
,

HeadlessException

Creates a new custom cursor object.
If the image to display is invalid, the cursor will be hidden (made
completely transparent), and the hotspot will be set to (0, 0).

Note that multi-frame images are invalid and may cause this
method to hang.

**Parameters:**
- cursor

- the image to display when the cursor is activated
- hotSpot

- the X and Y of the large cursor's hot spot; the
hotSpot values must be less than the Dimension returned by

getBestCursorSize
- name

- a localized description of the cursor, for Java Accessibility use

**Returns:**
- the cursor created

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the hotSpot values are outside
the bounds of the cursor
- HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true

**See Also:**
- GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public
Dimension
getBestCursorSize​(int preferredWidth,
int preferredHeight)
throws
HeadlessException

Returns the supported cursor dimension which is closest to the desired
sizes. Systems which only support a single cursor size will return that
size regardless of the desired sizes. Systems which don't support custom
cursors will return a dimension of 0, 0.

Note: if an image is used whose dimensions don't match a supported size
(as returned by this method), the Toolkit implementation will attempt to
resize the image to a supported size.
Since converting low-resolution images is difficult,
no guarantees are made as to the quality of a cursor image which isn't a
supported size. It is therefore recommended that this method
be called and an appropriate image used so no image conversion is made.

**Parameters:**
- preferredWidth

- the preferred cursor width the component would like
to use.
- preferredHeight

- the preferred cursor height the component would like
to use.

**Returns:**
- the closest matching supported cursor size, or a dimension of 0,0 if
the Toolkit implementation doesn't support custom cursors.

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true

**See Also:**
- GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public int getMaximumCursorColors()
throws
HeadlessException

Returns the maximum number of colors the Toolkit supports in a custom cursor
palette.

Note: if an image is used which has more colors in its palette than
the supported maximum, the Toolkit implementation will attempt to flatten the
palette to the maximum. Since converting low-resolution images is difficult,
no guarantees are made as to the quality of a cursor image which has more
colors than the system supports. It is therefore recommended that this method
be called and an appropriate image used so no image conversion is made.

**Returns:**
- the maximum number of colors, or zero if custom cursors are not
supported by this Toolkit implementation.

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true

**See Also:**
- GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean isFrameStateSupported​(int state)
throws
HeadlessException

Returns whether Toolkit supports this state for

Frame

s. This method tells whether the

UI
concept

of, say, maximization or iconification is
supported. It will always return false for "compound" states
like

Frame.ICONIFIED|Frame.MAXIMIZED_VERT

.
In other words, the rule of thumb is that only queries with a
single frame state constant as an argument are meaningful.

Note that supporting a given concept is a platform-
dependent feature. Due to native limitations the Toolkit
object may report a particular state as supported, however at
the same time the Toolkit object will be unable to apply the
state to a given frame. This circumstance has two following
consequences:

- Only the return value of

false

for the present
method actually indicates that the given state is not
supported. If the method returns

true

the given state
may still be unsupported and/or unavailable for a particular
frame.

The developer should consider examining the value of the

WindowEvent.getNewState()

method of the

WindowEvent

received through the

WindowStateListener

, rather than assuming
that the state given to the

setExtendedState()

method
will be definitely applied. For more information see the
documentation for the

Frame.setExtendedState(int)

method.

**Parameters:**
- state

- one of named frame state constants.

**Returns:**
- true

is this frame state is supported by
this Toolkit implementation,

false

otherwise.

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true

.

- Window.addWindowStateListener(java.awt.event.WindowStateListener)

**Since:**

#### public static
String
getProperty​(
String
key,

String
defaultValue)

Gets a property with the specified key and default.
This method returns defaultValue if the property is not found.

**Parameters:**
- key

- the key
- defaultValue

- the default value

**Returns:**
- the value of the property or the default value
if the property was not found

---

#### public final
EventQueue
getSystemEventQueue()

Get the application's or applet's EventQueue instance.
Depending on the Toolkit implementation, different EventQueues
may be returned for different applets. Applets should
therefore not assume that the EventQueue instance returned
by this method will be shared by other applets or the system.

If there is a security manager then its

checkPermission

method
is called to check

AWTPermission("accessEventQueue")

.

**Returns:**
- the

EventQueue

object

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager is set and it denies access to
the

EventQueue

**See Also:**
- AWTPermission

---

#### protected abstract
EventQueue
getSystemEventQueueImpl()

Gets the application's or applet's

EventQueue

instance, without checking access. For security reasons,
this can only be called from a

Toolkit

subclass.

**Returns:**
- the

EventQueue

object

---

Class
<T> abstractRecognizerClass,

DragSource
ds,

Component
c,
int srcActions,

DragGestureListener
dgl)

Many GUI events may be delivered to user
asynchronously, if the opposite is not specified explicitly.
As well as

This fact means that if the state of a component is set, and then
the state immediately queried, the returned value may not yet
reflect the requested change. This behavior includes, but is not

- Scrolling to a specified position.

For example, calling

- loadSystemColors

```java
protected void loadSystemColors​(int[] systemColors)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Fills in the integer array that is supplied as an argument
with the current system color values.

**Parameters:** systemColors

- an integer array.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- setDynamicLayout

```java
public void setDynamicLayout​(boolean dynamic)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Controls whether the layout of Containers is validated dynamically
during resizing, or statically, after resizing is complete.
Use

isDynamicLayoutActive()

to detect if this feature enabled
in this program and is supported by this operating system
and/or window manager.
Note that this feature is supported not on all platforms, and
conversely, that this feature cannot be turned off on some platforms.
On these platforms where dynamic layout during resizing is not supported
(or is always supported), setting this property has no effect.
Note that this feature can be set or unset as a property of the
operating system or window manager on some platforms. On such
platforms, the dynamic resize property must be set at the operating
system or window manager level before this method can take effect.
This method does not change support or settings of the underlying
operating system or
window manager. The OS/WM support can be
queried using getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported") method.

**Parameters:** dynamic

- If true, Containers should re-layout their
components as the Container is being resized. If false,
the layout will be validated after resizing is completed.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** isDynamicLayoutSet()

,

isDynamicLayoutActive()

,

getDesktopProperty(String propertyName)

,

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- isDynamicLayoutSet

```java
protected boolean isDynamicLayoutSet()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns whether the layout of Containers is validated dynamically
during resizing, or statically, after resizing is complete.
Note: this method returns the value that was set programmatically;
it does not reflect support at the level of the operating system
or window manager for dynamic layout on resizing, or the current
operating system or window manager settings. The OS/WM support can
be queried using getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported").

**Returns:** true if validation of Containers is done dynamically,
false if validation is done after resizing is finished.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setDynamicLayout(boolean dynamic)

,

isDynamicLayoutActive()

,

getDesktopProperty(String propertyName)

,

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- isDynamicLayoutActive

```java
public boolean isDynamicLayoutActive()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns whether dynamic layout of Containers on resize is currently
enabled on the underlying operating system and/or window manager. If the
platform supports it,

setDynamicLayout(boolean)

may be used to
programmatically enable or disable platform dynamic layout. Regardless of
whether that toggling is supported, or whether

true

or

false

is specified as an argument, or has never been called at all, this
method will return the active current platform behavior and which will be
followed by the JDK in determining layout policy during resizing.

If dynamic layout is currently inactive then Containers re-layout their
components when resizing is completed. As a result the

Component.validate()

method will be invoked only once per resize.
If dynamic layout is currently active then Containers re-layout their
components on every native resize event and the

validate()

method
will be invoked each time. The OS/WM support can be queried using the
getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported") method. This property
will reflect the platform capability but is not sufficient to tell if it
is presently enabled.

**Returns:** true if dynamic layout of Containers on resize is currently
active, false otherwise.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if the GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless() method
returns true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setDynamicLayout(boolean dynamic)

,

isDynamicLayoutSet()

,

getDesktopProperty(String propertyName)

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- getScreenSize

```java
public abstract

```

Gets the size of the screen. On systems with multiple displays, the
primary display is used. Multi-screen aware display dimensions are
available from

GraphicsConfiguration

and

GraphicsDevice

.

**Returns:** the size of this toolkit's screen, in pixels.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**See Also:** GraphicsConfiguration.getBounds()

,

GraphicsDevice.getDisplayMode()

,

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- getScreenResolution

```java
public abstract int getScreenResolution()
throws

```

Gets the insets of the screen.

**Parameters:** gc

- a

GraphicsConfiguration
**Returns:** the insets of this toolkit's screen, in pixels.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- getColorModel

```java
public abstract
ColorModel
getColorModel()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Determines the color model of this toolkit's screen.

ColorModel

is an abstract class that
encapsulates the ability to translate between the
pixel values of an image and its red, green, blue,
and alpha components.

This toolkit method is called by the

getColorModel

method
of the

Returns the names of the available fonts in this toolkit.

For 1.1, the following font names are deprecated (the replacement
name follows):

- TimesRoman (use Serif)

Helvetica (use SansSerif)

Courier (use Monospaced)

The ZapfDingbats fontname is also deprecated in 1.1 but the characters
are defined in Unicode starting at 0x2700, and as of 1.1 Java supports
those characters.

**Returns:** the names of the available fonts in this toolkit.

GraphicsEnvironment.getScreenDevices()

- sync

```java
public abstract void sync()
```

Synchronizes this toolkit's graphics state. Some window systems
may do buffering of graphics events.

This method ensures that the display is up-to-date. It is useful
for animation.

- getDefaultToolkit

```java
public static
Toolkit
getDefaultToolkit()
```

Gets the default toolkit.

If a system property named

"java.awt.headless"

is set
to

true

then the headless implementation
of

Toolkit

is used,
otherwise the default platform-specific implementation of

Toolkit

is used.

If this Toolkit is not a headless implementation and if they exist, service
providers of

AccessibilityProvider

will be loaded
if specified by the system property

javax.accessibility.assistive_technologies

.

An example of setting this property is to invoke Java with

-Djavax.accessibility.assistive_technologies=MyServiceProvider

.
In addition to MyServiceProvider other service providers can be specified
using a comma separated list. Service providers are loaded after the AWT
toolkit is created. All errors are handled via an AWTError exception.

The names specified in the assistive_technologies property are used to query
each service provider implementation. If the requested name matches the

name

of the service provider, the

AccessibilityProvider.activate()

method will be invoked to activate the
matching service provider.

**Implementation Requirements:** If assistive technology service providers are not specified with a system
property this implementation will look in a properties file located as follows:

- ${user.home}/.accessibility.properties

${java.home}/conf/accessibility.properties

Only the first of these files to be located will be consulted. The requested
service providers are specified by setting the

assistive_technologies=

property. A single provider or a comma separated list of providers can be
specified.
**Returns:** the default toolkit.
**Throws:** AWTError

- if a toolkit could not be found, or
if one could not be accessed or instantiated.
**See Also:** ServiceLoader

whose format can be either GIF, JPEG or PNG.
The underlying toolkit attempts to resolve multiple requests
with the same filename to the same returned Image.

Since the mechanism required to facilitate this sharing of

Image

objects may continue to hold onto images
that are no longer in use for an indefinite period of time,
developers are encouraged to implement their own caching of
images by using the

createImage

variant wherever available.
If the image data contained in the specified file changes,
the

Image

object returned from this method may
still contain stale information which was loaded from the
file after a prior call.
Previously loaded image data can be manually discarded by
calling the

flush

method on the
returned

Image

.

This method first checks if there is a security manager installed.
If so, the method calls the security manager's

checkRead

method with the file specified to ensure
that the access to the image is allowed.

**Parameters:** filename

- the name of a file containing pixel data
in a recognized file format.
**Returns:** an image which gets its pixel data from
the specified file.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its
checkRead method doesn't allow the operation.
**See Also:** createImage(java.lang.String)

- getImage

```java
public abstract
Image
getImage​(
URL
url)
```

Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified URL.
The pixel data referenced by the specified URL must be in one
of the following formats: GIF, JPEG or PNG.
The underlying toolkit attempts to resolve multiple requests
with the same URL to the same returned Image.

Since the mechanism required to facilitate this sharing of

Image

objects may continue to hold onto images
that are no longer in use for an indefinite period of time,
developers are encouraged to implement their own caching of
images by using the

createImage

variant wherever available.
If the image data stored at the specified URL changes,
the

Image

object returned from this method may
still contain stale information which was fetched from the
URL after a prior call.
Previously loaded image data can be manually discarded by
calling the

flush

method on the
returned

Image

.

This method first checks if there is a security manager installed.
If so, the method calls the security manager's

checkPermission

- prepareImage

```java
public abstract boolean prepareImage​(
Image
image,
int width,
int height,

ImageObserver
observer)
```

Prepares an image for rendering.

If the values of the width and height arguments are both

-1

, this method prepares the image for rendering
on the default screen; otherwise, this method prepares an image
for rendering on the default screen at the specified width and height.

The image data is downloaded asynchronously in another thread,
and an appropriately scaled screen representation of the image is
generated.

This method is called by components

prepareImage

methods.

Information on the flags returned by this method can be found
with the definition of the

ImageObserver

interface.

**Parameters:** image

- the image for which to prepare a
screen representation.
**Parameters:** width

- the width of the desired screen
representation, or

- getPrintJob

```java
public abstract
PrintJob
getPrintJob​(
Frame
frame,

String
jobtitle,

Properties
props)
```

Gets a

PrintJob

object which is the result of initiating
a print operation on the toolkit's platform.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPrintJobAccess

method to
ensure initiation of a print operation is allowed. If the default
implementation of

checkPrintJobAccess

is used (that is,
that method is not overriden), then this results in a call to the
security manager's

checkPermission

method with a

RuntimePermission("queuePrintJob")

permission.

**Parameters:** frame

- the parent of the print dialog. May not be null.
**Parameters:** jobtitle

- the title of the PrintJob. A null title is equivalent
to "".
**Parameters:** props

- a Properties object containing zero or more properties.
Properties are not standardized and are not consistent across
implementations. Because of this, PrintJobs which require job
and page control should use the version of this function which
takes JobAttributes and PageAttributes objects. This object
may be updated to reflect the user's job choices on exit. May
be null.
**Returns:** a

PrintJob

object, or

null

if the
user cancelled the print job.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if frame is null
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if this thread is not allowed to initiate a
print job request

jobAttributes,

PageAttributes
pageAttributes)
```

Gets a

PrintJob

object which is the result of initiating
a print operation on the toolkit's platform.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPrintJobAccess

method to
ensure initiation of a print operation is allowed. If the default
implementation of

checkPrintJobAccess

is used (that is,
that method is not overriden), then this results in a call to the
security manager's

checkPermission

method with a

RuntimePermission("queuePrintJob")

permission.

**Parameters:** frame

- the parent of the print dialog. May not be null.
**Parameters:** jobtitle

- the title of the PrintJob. A null title is equivalent
to "".
**Parameters:** jobAttributes

- a set of job attributes which will control the
PrintJob. The attributes will be updated to reflect the user's
choices as outlined in the JobAttributes documentation. May be
null.
**Parameters:** pageAttributes

- a set of page attributes which will control the
PrintJob. The attributes will be applied to every page in the
job. The attributes will be updated to reflect the user's
choices as outlined in the PageAttributes documentation. May be
null.
**Returns:** a

PrintJob

object, or

null

if the
user cancelled the print job.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if frame is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if pageAttributes specifies differing
cross feed and feed resolutions. Also if this thread has
access to the file system and jobAttributes specifies
print to file, and the specified destination file exists but
is a directory rather than a regular file, does not exist but
cannot be created, or cannot be opened for any other reason.
However in the case of print to file, if a dialog is also
requested to be displayed then the user will be given an
opportunity to select a file and proceed with printing.
The dialog will ensure that the selected output file
is valid before returning from this method.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if this thread is not allowed to initiate a
print job request, or if jobAttributes specifies print to file,
and this thread is not allowed to access the file system

- getSystemClipboard

```java
public abstract
Clipboard
getSystemClipboard()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Gets the singleton instance of the system Clipboard which interfaces
with clipboard facilities provided by the native platform. This
clipboard enables data transfer between Java programs and native
applications which use native clipboard facilities.

In addition to any and all default formats text returned by the system
Clipboard's

getTransferData()

method is available in the
following flavors:

- DataFlavor.stringFlavor
- DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor (

deprecated

)

As with

java.awt.datatransfer.StringSelection

, if the
requested flavor is

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

, or an
equivalent flavor, a Reader is returned.

Note:

The behavior of
the system Clipboard's

getTransferData()

method for

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

, and equivalent DataFlavors, is
inconsistent with the definition of

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

.
Because of this, support for

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

, and equivalent flavors, is

deprecated

.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPermission

method to check

AWTPermission("accessClipboard")

.

**Returns:** the system Clipboard

- getSystemSelection

```java
public
Clipboard
getSystemSelection()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Gets the singleton instance of the system selection as a

Clipboard

object. This allows an application to read and
modify the current, system-wide selection.

An application is responsible for updating the system selection whenever
the user selects text, using either the mouse or the keyboard.
Typically, this is implemented by installing a

FocusListener

on all

Component

s which support
text selection, and, between

FOCUS_GAINED

and

FOCUS_LOST

events delivered to that

Component

,
updating the system selection

Clipboard

when the selection
changes inside the

Component

. Properly updating the system
selection ensures that a Java application will interact correctly with
native applications and other Java applications running simultaneously
on the system. Note that

java.awt.TextComponent

and

javax.swing.text.JTextComponent

already adhere to this
policy. When using these classes, and their subclasses, developers need
not write any additional code.

Some platforms do not support a system selection

Clipboard

.
On those platforms, this method will return

null

. In such a
case, an application is absolved from its responsibility to update the
system selection

Clipboard

as described above.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPermission

method to check

AWTPermission("accessClipboard")

.

**Returns:** the system selection as a

Clipboard

VK_CAPS_LOCK

,

VK_NUM_LOCK

,

VK_SCROLL_LOCK

, and

VK_KANA_LOCK

.

**Parameters:** keyCode

- the key code
**Returns:** true

if the given key is currently in its "on" state;
otherwise

false
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

keyCode

is not one of the valid key codes
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the host system doesn't
allow getting the state of this key programmatically, or if the keyboard
doesn't have this key
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- setLockingKeyState

```java
public void setLockingKeyState​(int keyCode,
boolean on)
throws
UnsupportedOperationException
```

Sets the state of the given locking key on the keyboard.
Valid key codes are

VK_CAPS_LOCK

,

VK_NUM_LOCK

,

VK_SCROLL_LOCK

, and

VK_KANA_LOCK

.

Depending on the platform, setting the state of a locking key may
involve event processing and therefore may not be immediately
observable through getLockingKeyState.

**Parameters:** keyCode

- the key code
**Parameters:** on

- the state of the key
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

keyCode

is not one of the valid key codes
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the host system doesn't

- getNativeContainer

```java
protected static
Container
getNativeContainer​(
Component
c)
```

Give native peers the ability to query the native container
given a native component (eg the direct parent may be lightweight).

**Parameters:** c

- the component to fetch the container for
**Returns:** the native container object for the component

- createCustomCursor

```java
public
Cursor
createCustomCursor​(
Image
cursor,

Point
hotSpot,

String
name)
throws
IndexOutOfBoundsException
,

HeadlessException
```

Creates a new custom cursor object.
If the image to display is invalid, the cursor will be hidden (made
completely transparent), and the hotspot will be set to (0, 0).

Note that multi-frame images are invalid and may cause this
method to hang.

**Parameters:** cursor

- the image to display when the cursor is activated
**Parameters:** hotSpot

- the X and Y of the large cursor's hot spot; the
hotSpot values must be less than the Dimension returned by

getBestCursorSize
**Parameters:** name

- a localized description of the cursor, for Java Accessibility use
**Returns:** the cursor created
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the hotSpot values are outside
the bounds of the cursor
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- getBestCursorSize

```java
public
Dimension
getBestCursorSize​(int preferredWidth,
int preferredHeight)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns the supported cursor dimension which is closest to the desired
sizes. Systems which only support a single cursor size will return that
size regardless of the desired sizes. Systems which don't support custom
cursors will return a dimension of 0, 0.

Note: if an image is used whose dimensions don't match a supported size
(as returned by this method), the Toolkit implementation will attempt to
resize the image to a supported size.
Since converting low-resolution images is difficult,
no guarantees are made as to the quality of a cursor image which isn't a
supported size. It is therefore recommended that this method
be called and an appropriate image used so no image conversion is made.

**Parameters:** preferredWidth

- the preferred cursor width the component would like
to use.
**Parameters:** preferredHeight

- the preferred cursor height the component would like
to use.
**Returns:** the closest matching supported cursor size, or a dimension of 0,0 if
the Toolkit implementation doesn't support custom cursors.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- getMaximumCursorColors

```java
public int getMaximumCursorColors()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns the maximum number of colors the Toolkit supports in a custom cursor
palette.

Note: if an image is used which has more colors in its palette than
the supported maximum, the Toolkit implementation will attempt to flatten the
palette to the maximum. Since converting low-resolution images is difficult,
no guarantees are made as to the quality of a cursor image which has more
colors than the system supports. It is therefore recommended that this method
be called and an appropriate image used so no image conversion is made.

**Returns:** the maximum number of colors, or zero if custom cursors are not
supported by this Toolkit implementation.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- isFrameStateSupported

```java
public boolean isFrameStateSupported​(int state)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns whether Toolkit supports this state for

Frame

s. This method tells whether the

UI
concept

of, say, maximization or iconification is
supported. It will always return false for "compound" states
like

Frame.ICONIFIED|Frame.MAXIMIZED_VERT

.
In other words, the rule of thumb is that only queries with a
single frame state constant as an argument are meaningful.

Note that supporting a given concept is a platform-
dependent feature. Due to native limitations the Toolkit
object may report a particular state as supported, however at
the same time the Toolkit object will be unable to apply the
state to a given frame. This circumstance has two following
consequences:

- Only the return value of

false

for the present
method actually indicates that the given state is not
supported. If the method returns

true

the given state
may still be unsupported and/or unavailable for a particular
frame.

The developer should consider examining the value of the

WindowEvent.getNewState()

method of the

WindowEvent

received through the

WindowStateListener

, rather than assuming
that the state given to the

setExtendedState()

method
will be definitely applied. For more information see the
documentation for the

Frame.setExtendedState(int)

method.

**Parameters:** state

- one of named frame state constants.
**Returns:** true

is this frame state is supported by
this Toolkit implementation,

false

otherwise.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true

.
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** Window.addWindowStateListener(java.awt.event.WindowStateListener)

- getProperty

```java
public static
String
getProperty​(
String
key,

String
defaultValue)
```

Gets a property with the specified key and default.
This method returns defaultValue if the property is not found.

**Parameters:** key

- the key
**Parameters:** defaultValue

- the default value
**Returns:** the value of the property or the default value
if the property was not found

- getSystemEventQueue

```java
public final
EventQueue
getSystemEventQueue()
```

Get the application's or applet's EventQueue instance.
Depending on the Toolkit implementation, different EventQueues
may be returned for different applets. Applets should
therefore not assume that the EventQueue instance returned
by this method will be shared by other applets or the system.

If there is a security manager then its

checkPermission

method
is called to check

AWTPermission("accessEventQueue")

.

**Returns:** the

EventQueue

object
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is set and it denies access to
the

EventQueue
**See Also:** AWTPermission

- getSystemEventQueueImpl

```java
protected abstract
EventQueue
getSystemEventQueueImpl()
```

Gets the application's or applet's

EventQueue

instance, without checking access. For security reasons,
this can only be called from a

Toolkit

subclass.

**Returns:** the

EventQueue

object

- createDragGestureRecognizer

```java
public <T extends
DragGestureRecognizer
> T createDragGestureRecognizer​(
Class
<T> abstractRecognizerClass,

c,
int srcActions,

DragGestureListener
dgl)
```

Creates a concrete, platform dependent, subclass of the abstract
DragGestureRecognizer class requested, and associates it with the
DragSource, Component and DragGestureListener specified.

subclasses should override this to provide their own implementation

**Type Parameters:** T

Method Detail

- loadSystemColors

```java
protected void loadSystemColors​(int[] systemColors)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Fills in the integer array that is supplied as an argument
with the current system color values.

**Parameters:** systemColors

- an integer array.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- setDynamicLayout

```java
public void setDynamicLayout​(boolean dynamic)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Controls whether the layout of Containers is validated dynamically
during resizing, or statically, after resizing is complete.
Use

isDynamicLayoutActive()

to detect if this feature enabled
in this program and is supported by this operating system
and/or window manager.
Note that this feature is supported not on all platforms, and
conversely, that this feature cannot be turned off on some platforms.
On these platforms where dynamic layout during resizing is not supported
(or is always supported), setting this property has no effect.
Note that this feature can be set or unset as a property of the
operating system or window manager on some platforms. On such
platforms, the dynamic resize property must be set at the operating
system or window manager level before this method can take effect.
This method does not change support or settings of the underlying
operating system or
window manager. The OS/WM support can be
queried using getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported") method.

**Parameters:** dynamic

- If true, Containers should re-layout their
components as the Container is being resized. If false,
the layout will be validated after resizing is completed.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** isDynamicLayoutSet()

,

isDynamicLayoutActive()

,

getDesktopProperty(String propertyName)

,

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- isDynamicLayoutSet

```java
protected boolean isDynamicLayoutSet()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns whether the layout of Containers is validated dynamically
during resizing, or statically, after resizing is complete.
Note: this method returns the value that was set programmatically;
it does not reflect support at the level of the operating system
or window manager for dynamic layout on resizing, or the current
operating system or window manager settings. The OS/WM support can
be queried using getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported").

**Returns:** true if validation of Containers is done dynamically,
false if validation is done after resizing is finished.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setDynamicLayout(boolean dynamic)

,

isDynamicLayoutActive()

,

getDesktopProperty(String propertyName)

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- isDynamicLayoutActive

```java
public boolean isDynamicLayoutActive()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns whether dynamic layout of Containers on resize is currently
enabled on the underlying operating system and/or window manager. If the
platform supports it,

setDynamicLayout(boolean)

may be used to
programmatically enable or disable platform dynamic layout. Regardless of
whether that toggling is supported, or whether

true

or

false

is specified as an argument, or has never been called at all, this
method will return the active current platform behavior and which will be
followed by the JDK in determining layout policy during resizing.

If dynamic layout is currently inactive then Containers re-layout their
components when resizing is completed. As a result the

Component.validate()

method will be invoked only once per resize.
If dynamic layout is currently active then Containers re-layout their
components on every native resize event and the

validate()

method
will be invoked each time. The OS/WM support can be queried using the
getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported") method. This property
will reflect the platform capability but is not sufficient to tell if it
is presently enabled.

**Returns:** true if dynamic layout of Containers on resize is currently
active, false otherwise.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- sync

```java
public abstract void sync()
```

Synchronizes this toolkit's graphics state. Some window systems
may do buffering of graphics events.

This method ensures that the display is up-to-date. It is useful
for animation.

- getDefaultToolkit

```java
public static
Toolkit
getDefaultToolkit()
```

Gets the default toolkit.

If a system property named

"java.awt.headless"

is set
to

true

then the headless implementation
of

Toolkit

is used,
otherwise the default platform-specific implementation of

Toolkit

is used.

If this Toolkit is not a headless implementation and if they exist, service
providers of

AccessibilityProvider

will be loaded
if specified by the system property

javax.accessibility.assistive_technologies

.

An example of setting this property is to invoke Java with

-Djavax.accessibility.assistive_technologies=MyServiceProvider

.
In addition to MyServiceProvider other service providers can be specified
using a comma separated list. Service providers are loaded after the AWT
toolkit is created. All errors are handled via an AWTError exception.

The names specified in the assistive_technologies property are used to query
each service provider implementation. If the requested name matches the

name

of the service provider, the

AccessibilityProvider.activate()

method will be invoked to activate the
matching service provider.

**Implementation Requirements:** If assistive technology service providers are not specified with a system
property this implementation will look in a properties file located as follows:

- ${user.home}/.accessibility.properties

${java.home}/conf/accessibility.properties

Only the first of these files to be located will be consulted. The requested
service providers are specified by setting the

assistive_technologies=

property. A single provider or a comma separated list of providers can be
specified.
**Returns:** the default toolkit.
**Throws:** AWTError

- if a toolkit could not be found, or
if one could not be accessed or instantiated.

- getImage

```java
public abstract
Image
getImage​(
String
filename)
```

Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified file,
whose format can be either GIF, JPEG or PNG.
The underlying toolkit attempts to resolve multiple requests
with the same filename to the same returned Image.

Since the mechanism required to facilitate this sharing of

Image

objects may continue to hold onto images
that are no longer in use for an indefinite period of time,
developers are encouraged to implement their own caching of
images by using the

createImage

variant wherever available.
If the image data contained in the specified file changes,
the

Image

object returned from this method may
still contain stale information which was loaded from the
file after a prior call.
Previously loaded image data can be manually discarded by
calling the

flush

method on the
returned

Image

.

This method first checks if there is a security manager installed.
If so, the method calls the security manager's

checkRead

method with the file specified to ensure
that the access to the image is allowed.

**Parameters:** filename

- the name of a file containing pixel data
in a recognized file format.
**Returns:** an image which gets its pixel data from
the specified file.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its
checkRead method doesn't allow the operation.
**See Also:** createImage(java.lang.String)

public abstract
Image
getImage​(
URL
url)
```

Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified URL.
The pixel data referenced by the specified URL must be in one
of the following formats: GIF, JPEG or PNG.
The underlying toolkit attempts to resolve multiple requests
with the same URL to the same returned Image.

Since the mechanism required to facilitate this sharing of

Image

objects may continue to hold onto images
that are no longer in use for an indefinite period of time,
developers are encouraged to implement their own caching of
images by using the

createImage

variant wherever available.
If the image data stored at the specified URL changes,
the

Image

object returned from this method may
still contain stale information which was fetched from the
URL after a prior call.
Previously loaded image data can be manually discarded by
calling the

flush

checkPrintJobAccess

is used (that is,
that method is not overriden), then this results in a call to the
security manager's

checkPermission

method with a

RuntimePermission("queuePrintJob")

permission.

**Parameters:** frame

- the parent of the print dialog. May not be null.
**Parameters:** jobtitle

- the title of the PrintJob. A null title is equivalent
to "".
**Parameters:** props

- a Properties object containing zero or more properties.
Properties are not standardized and are not consistent across
implementations. Because of this, PrintJobs which require job
and page control should use the version of this function which
takes JobAttributes and PageAttributes objects. This object
may be updated to reflect the user's job choices on exit. May
be null.
**Returns:** a

PrintJob

object, or

null

if the
user cancelled the print job.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if frame is null
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if this thread is not allowed to initiate a
print job request

RuntimePermission

- getPrintJob

```java
public
PrintJob
getPrintJob​(
Frame
frame,

String
jobtitle,

JobAttributes
jobAttributes,

PageAttributes
pageAttributes)
```

Gets a

PrintJob

object which is the result of initiating
a print operation on the toolkit's platform.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPrintJobAccess

method to
ensure initiation of a print operation is allowed. If the default
implementation of

checkPrintJobAccess

is used (that is,
that method is not overriden), then this results in a call to the
security manager's

checkPermission

method with a

RuntimePermission("queuePrintJob")

permission.

**Parameters:** frame

- the parent of the print dialog. May not be null.
**Parameters:** jobtitle

- the title of the PrintJob. A null title is equivalent
to "".
**Parameters:** jobAttributes

- a set of job attributes which will control the
PrintJob. The attributes will be updated to reflect the user's
choices as outlined in the JobAttributes documentation. May be
null.
**Parameters:** pageAttributes

- a set of page attributes which will control the
PrintJob. The attributes will be applied to every page in the
job. The attributes will be updated to reflect the user's
choices as outlined in the PageAttributes documentation. May be
null.
**Returns:** a

PrintJob

object, or

null

if the
user cancelled the print job.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if frame is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if pageAttributes specifies differing
cross feed and feed resolutions. Also if this thread has
access to the file system and jobAttributes specifies
print to file, and the specified destination file exists but
is a directory rather than a regular file, does not exist but
cannot be created, or cannot be opened for any other reason.
However in the case of print to file, if a dialog is also
requested to be displayed then the user will be given an
opportunity to select a file and proceed with printing.
The dialog will ensure that the selected output file
is valid before returning from this method.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if this thread is not allowed to initiate a
print job request, or if jobAttributes specifies print to file,
and this thread is not allowed to access the file system

- getSystemClipboard

```java
public abstract
Clipboard
getSystemClipboard()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Gets the singleton instance of the system Clipboard which interfaces
with clipboard facilities provided by the native platform. This
clipboard enables data transfer between Java programs and native
applications which use native clipboard facilities.

In addition to any and all default formats text returned by the system
Clipboard's

getTransferData()

method is available in the
following flavors:

- DataFlavor.stringFlavor
- DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor (

deprecated

)

As with

java.awt.datatransfer.StringSelection

, if the
requested flavor is

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

, or an
equivalent flavor, a Reader is returned.

Note:

The behavior of
the system Clipboard's

getTransferData()

method for

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

, and equivalent DataFlavors, is
inconsistent with the definition of

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

.
Because of this, support for

DataFlavor.plainTextFlavor

, and equivalent flavors, is

deprecated

.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPermission

method to check

AWTPermission("accessClipboard")

.

**Returns:** the system Clipboard

- getSystemSelection

```java
public
Clipboard
getSystemSelection()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Gets the singleton instance of the system selection as a

Clipboard

object. This allows an application to read and
modify the current, system-wide selection.

An application is responsible for updating the system selection whenever
the user selects text, using either the mouse or the keyboard.
Typically, this is implemented by installing a

FocusListener

on all

Component

s which support
text selection, and, between

FOCUS_GAINED

and

FOCUS_LOST

events delivered to that

Component

,
updating the system selection

Clipboard

when the selection
changes inside the

Component

. Properly updating the system
selection ensures that a Java application will interact correctly with
native applications and other Java applications running simultaneously
on the system. Note that

java.awt.TextComponent

and

javax.swing.text.JTextComponent

already adhere to this
policy. When using these classes, and their subclasses, developers need
not write any additional code.

Some platforms do not support a system selection

Clipboard

.
On those platforms, this method will return

null

. In such a
case, an application is absolved from its responsibility to update the
system selection

Clipboard

as described above.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPermission

method to check

AWTPermission("accessClipboard")

.

**Returns:** the system selection as a

Returns whether the given locking key on the keyboard is currently in
its "on" state.
Valid key codes are

VK_CAPS_LOCK

,

VK_NUM_LOCK

,

VK_SCROLL_LOCK

, and

VK_KANA_LOCK

.

**Parameters:** keyCode

- the key code
**Returns:** true

if the given key is currently in its "on" state;
otherwise

false
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

keyCode

is not one of the valid key codes
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the host system doesn't
allow getting the state of this key programmatically, or if the keyboard
doesn't have this key
**Throws:** HeadlessException

returns true
**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- setLockingKeyState

```java
public void setLockingKeyState​(int keyCode,
boolean on)
throws
UnsupportedOperationException
```

Sets the state of the given locking key on the keyboard.
Valid key codes are

VK_CAPS_LOCK

,

VK_NUM_LOCK

,

VK_SCROLL_LOCK

, and

VK_KANA_LOCK

.

Depending on the platform, setting the state of a locking key may
involve event processing and therefore may not be immediately
observable through getLockingKeyState.

**Parameters:** keyCode

- the key code
**Parameters:** on

- the state of the key
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

keyCode

is not one of the valid key codes
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- getNativeContainer

```java
protected static
Container
getNativeContainer​(
Component
c)
```

Give native peers the ability to query the native container
given a native component (eg the direct parent may be lightweight).

**Parameters:** c

- the component to fetch the container for
**Returns:** the native container object for the component

- createCustomCursor

```java
public
Cursor
createCustomCursor​(
Image
cursor,

Point
hotSpot,

String
name)
throws
IndexOutOfBoundsException
,

HeadlessException
```

Creates a new custom cursor object.
If the image to display is invalid, the cursor will be hidden (made
completely transparent), and the hotspot will be set to (0, 0).

Note that multi-frame images are invalid and may cause this
method to hang.

**Parameters:** cursor

- the image to display when the cursor is activated
**Parameters:** hotSpot

- the X and Y of the large cursor's hot spot; the
hotSpot values must be less than the Dimension returned by

getBestCursorSize
**Parameters:** name

- a localized description of the cursor, for Java Accessibility use
**Returns:** the cursor created
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the hotSpot values are outside
the bounds of the cursor
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- getBestCursorSize

```java
public
Dimension
getBestCursorSize​(int preferredWidth,
int preferredHeight)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns the supported cursor dimension which is closest to the desired
sizes. Systems which only support a single cursor size will return that
size regardless of the desired sizes. Systems which don't support custom
cursors will return a dimension of 0, 0.

Note: if an image is used whose dimensions don't match a supported size
(as returned by this method), the Toolkit implementation will attempt to
resize the image to a supported size.
Since converting low-resolution images is difficult,
no guarantees are made as to the quality of a cursor image which isn't a
supported size. It is therefore recommended that this method
be called and an appropriate image used so no image conversion is made.

**Parameters:** preferredWidth

- the preferred cursor width the component would like
to use.
**Parameters:** preferredHeight

- the preferred cursor height the component would like
to use.
**Returns:** the closest matching supported cursor size, or a dimension of 0,0 if
the Toolkit implementation doesn't support custom cursors.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- getMaximumCursorColors

```java
public int getMaximumCursorColors()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns the maximum number of colors the Toolkit supports in a custom cursor
palette.

Note: if an image is used which has more colors in its palette than
the supported maximum, the Toolkit implementation will attempt to flatten the
palette to the maximum. Since converting low-resolution images is difficult,
no guarantees are made as to the quality of a cursor image which has more
colors than the system supports. It is therefore recommended that this method
be called and an appropriate image used so no image conversion is made.

**Returns:** the maximum number of colors, or zero if custom cursors are not
supported by this Toolkit implementation.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

- isFrameStateSupported

```java
public boolean isFrameStateSupported​(int state)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns whether Toolkit supports this state for

Frame

s. This method tells whether the

UI
concept

of, say, maximization or iconification is
supported. It will always return false for "compound" states
like

Frame.ICONIFIED|Frame.MAXIMIZED_VERT

.
In other words, the rule of thumb is that only queries with a
single frame state constant as an argument are meaningful.

Note that supporting a given concept is a platform-
dependent feature. Due to native limitations the Toolkit
object may report a particular state as supported, however at
the same time the Toolkit object will be unable to apply the
state to a given frame. This circumstance has two following
consequences:

- Only the return value of

false

for the present
method actually indicates that the given state is not
supported. If the method returns

true

the given state
may still be unsupported and/or unavailable for a particular
frame.

The developer should consider examining the value of the

WindowEvent.getNewState()

method of the

WindowEvent

received through the

WindowStateListener

, rather than assuming
that the state given to the

setExtendedState()

method
will be definitely applied. For more information see the
documentation for the

Frame.setExtendedState(int)

method.

**Parameters:** state

- one of named frame state constants.
**Returns:** true

is this frame state is supported by
this Toolkit implementation,

false

otherwise.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true

.

**See Also:** Window.addWindowStateListener(java.awt.event.WindowStateListener)

- getProperty

```java
public static
String
getProperty​(
String
key,

String
defaultValue)
```

Gets a property with the specified key and default.
This method returns defaultValue if the property is not found.

**Parameters:** key

- the key
**Parameters:** defaultValue

- the default value
**Returns:** the value of the property or the default value
if the property was not found

- getSystemEventQueue

```java
public final
EventQueue
getSystemEventQueue()
```

Get the application's or applet's EventQueue instance.
Depending on the Toolkit implementation, different EventQueues
may be returned for different applets. Applets should
therefore not assume that the EventQueue instance returned
by this method will be shared by other applets or the system.

If there is a security manager then its

checkPermission

method
is called to check

AWTPermission("accessEventQueue")

.

**Returns:** the

EventQueue

object
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is set and it denies access to
the

EventQueue
**See Also:** AWTPermission

- getSystemEventQueueImpl

```java
protected abstract
EventQueue
getSystemEventQueueImpl()
```

Gets the application's or applet's

EventQueue

instance, without checking access. For security reasons,
this can only be called from a

Toolkit

subclass.

**Returns:** the

EventQueue

object

- createDragGestureRecognizer

```java
public <T extends
DragGestureRecognizer
> T createDragGestureRecognizer​(
Class
<T> abstractRecognizerClass,

DragSource
ds,

c,
int srcActions,

DragGestureListener
dgl)
```

Creates a concrete, platform dependent, subclass of the abstract
DragGestureRecognizer class requested, and associates it with the
DragSource, Component and DragGestureListener specified.

subclasses should override this to provide their own implementation

**Type Parameters:** T

setDynamicLayout

```java
public void setDynamicLayout​(boolean dynamic)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Controls whether the layout of Containers is validated dynamically
during resizing, or statically, after resizing is complete.
Use

isDynamicLayoutActive()

to detect if this feature enabled
in this program and is supported by this operating system
and/or window manager.
Note that this feature is supported not on all platforms, and
conversely, that this feature cannot be turned off on some platforms.
On these platforms where dynamic layout during resizing is not supported
(or is always supported), setting this property has no effect.
Note that this feature can be set or unset as a property of the
operating system or window manager on some platforms. On such
platforms, the dynamic resize property must be set at the operating
system or window manager level before this method can take effect.
This method does not change support or settings of the underlying
operating system or
window manager. The OS/WM support can be
queried using getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported") method.

**Parameters:** dynamic

- If true, Containers should re-layout their
components as the Container is being resized. If false,
the layout will be validated after resizing is completed.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns true

isDynamicLayoutSet

```java
protected boolean isDynamicLayoutSet()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns whether the layout of Containers is validated dynamically
during resizing, or statically, after resizing is complete.
Note: this method returns the value that was set programmatically;
it does not reflect support at the level of the operating system
or window manager for dynamic layout on resizing, or the current
operating system or window manager settings. The OS/WM support can
be queried using getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported").

**Returns:** true if validation of Containers is done dynamically,
false if validation is done after resizing is finished.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

isDynamicLayoutActive

```java
public boolean isDynamicLayoutActive()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns whether dynamic layout of Containers on resize is currently
enabled on the underlying operating system and/or window manager. If the
platform supports it,

setDynamicLayout(boolean)

may be used to
programmatically enable or disable platform dynamic layout. Regardless of
whether that toggling is supported, or whether

true

or

false

is specified as an argument, or has never been called at all, this
method will return the active current platform behavior and which will be
followed by the JDK in determining layout policy during resizing.

If dynamic layout is currently inactive then Containers re-layout their
components when resizing is completed. As a result the

Component.validate()

method will be invoked only once per resize.
If dynamic layout is currently active then Containers re-layout their
components on every native resize event and the

validate()

method
will be invoked each time. The OS/WM support can be queried using the
getDesktopProperty("awt.dynamicLayoutSupported") method. This property
will reflect the platform capability but is not sufficient to tell if it
is presently enabled.

**Returns:** true if dynamic layout of Containers on resize is currently
active, false otherwise.

Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified file,
whose format can be either GIF, JPEG or PNG.
The underlying toolkit attempts to resolve multiple requests
with the same filename to the same returned Image.

Since the mechanism required to facilitate this sharing of

Image

objects may continue to hold onto images
that are no longer in use for an indefinite period of time,
developers are encouraged to implement their own caching of
images by using the

createImage

variant wherever available.
If the image data contained in the specified file changes,
the

Image

object returned from this method may
still contain stale information which was loaded from the
file after a prior call.
Previously loaded image data can be manually discarded by
calling the

flush

method on the
returned

Image

.

This method first checks if there is a security manager installed.
If so, the method calls the security manager's

checkRead

method with the file specified to ensure
that the access to the image is allowed.

**Parameters:** filename

- the name of a file containing pixel data
in a recognized file format.
**Returns:** an image which gets its pixel data from

PrintJob
getPrintJob​(
Frame
frame,

String
jobtitle,

Properties
props)
```

Gets a

PrintJob

object which is the result of initiating
a print operation on the toolkit's platform.

Each actual implementation of this method should first check if there
is a security manager installed. If there is, the method should call
the security manager's

checkPrintJobAccess

method to
ensure initiation of a print operation is allowed. If the default
implementation of

checkPrintJobAccess

is used (that is,
that method is not overriden), then this results in a call to the
security manager's

checkPermission

method with a

RuntimePermission("queuePrintJob")

permission.

**Parameters:** frame

- the parent of the print dialog. May not be null.
**Parameters:** jobtitle

- the title of the PrintJob. A null title is equivalent
to "".
**Parameters:** props

- a Properties object containing zero or more properties.
Properties are not standardized and are not consistent across
implementations. Because of this, PrintJobs which require job
and page control should use the version of this function which
takes JobAttributes and PageAttributes objects. This object
may be updated to reflect the user's job choices on exit. May
be null.
**Returns:** a

PrintJob

object, or

null

if the
user cancelled the print job.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

```

Creates a new custom cursor object.
If the image to display is invalid, the cursor will be hidden (made
completely transparent), and the hotspot will be set to (0, 0).

Note that multi-frame images are invalid and may cause this
method to hang.

**Parameters:** cursor

- the image to display when the cursor is activated
**Parameters:** hotSpot

- the X and Y of the large cursor's hot spot; the
hotSpot values must be less than the Dimension returned by

getBestCursorSize

```java
public
Dimension
getBestCursorSize​(int preferredWidth,
int preferredHeight)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns the supported cursor dimension which is closest to the desired
sizes. Systems which only support a single cursor size will return that
size regardless of the desired sizes. Systems which don't support custom
cursors will return a dimension of 0, 0.

Note: if an image is used whose dimensions don't match a supported size
(as returned by this method), the Toolkit implementation will attempt to
resize the image to a supported size.
Since converting low-resolution images is difficult,
no guarantees are made as to the quality of a cursor image which isn't a
supported size. It is therefore recommended that this method
be called and an appropriate image used so no image conversion is made.

**Parameters:** preferredWidth

- the preferred cursor width the component would like
to use.
**Parameters:** preferredHeight

- the preferred cursor height the component would like
to use.
**Returns:** the closest matching supported cursor size, or a dimension of 0,0 if
the Toolkit implementation doesn't support custom cursors.

isFrameStateSupported

```java
public boolean isFrameStateSupported​(int state)
throws
HeadlessException
```

Returns whether Toolkit supports this state for

Frame

s. This method tells whether the

UI
concept

of, say, maximization or iconification is
supported. It will always return false for "compound" states
like

Frame.ICONIFIED|Frame.MAXIMIZED_VERT

.
In other words, the rule of thumb is that only queries with a
single frame state constant as an argument are meaningful.

Note that supporting a given concept is a platform-
dependent feature. Due to native limitations the Toolkit
object may report a particular state as supported, however at
the same time the Toolkit object will be unable to apply the
state to a given frame. This circumstance has two following
consequences:

- Only the return value of

false

for the present
method actually indicates that the given state is not
supported. If the method returns

true

the given state
may still be unsupported and/or unavailable for a particular
frame.

The developer should consider examining the value of the

WindowEvent.getNewState()

method of the

WindowEvent

received through the

WindowStateListener

, rather than assuming
that the state given to the

setExtendedState()

method
will be definitely applied. For more information see the
documentation for the

Frame.setExtendedState(int)

method.

**Parameters:** state

- one of named frame state constants.
**Returns:** true

is this frame state is supported by
this Toolkit implementation,

false

otherwise.
**Throws:** HeadlessException

#### getAWTEventListeners

public

AWTEventListener

[] getAWTEventListeners()

Returns an array of all the

AWTEventListener

s
registered on this toolkit.
If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with an

AWTPermission("listenToAllAWTEvents")

permission.
This may result in a SecurityException.
Listeners can be returned
within

AWTEventListenerProxy

objects, which also contain
the event mask for the given listener.
Note that listener objects
added multiple times appear only once in the returned array.

getAWTEventListeners

```java
public
AWTEventListener
[] getAWTEventListeners​(long eventMask)
```

Returns an array of all the

AWTEventListener

s
registered on this toolkit which listen to all of the event
types specified in the

eventMask

argument.
If there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with an

AWTPermission("listenToAllAWTEvents")

areExtraMouseButtonsEnabled

```java
public boolean areExtraMouseButtonsEnabled()
throws
HeadlessException
```

Reports whether events from extra mouse buttons are allowed to be processed and posted into

EventQueue

.

To change the returned value it is necessary to set the

sun.awt.enableExtraMouseButtons

property before the

Toolkit

class initialization. This setting could be done on the application
startup by the following command:

```java
java -Dsun.awt.enableExtraMouseButtons=false Application
```

Alternatively, the property could be set in the application by using the following code:

```java
System.setProperty("sun.awt.enableExtraMouseButtons", "true");
```

before the

Toolkit

class initialization.
If not set by the time of the

Toolkit

class initialization, this property will be
initialized with

true

.
Changing this value after the

Toolkit

class initialization will have no effect.

**Returns:** true

if events from extra mouse buttons are allowed to be processed and posted;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless() returns true
