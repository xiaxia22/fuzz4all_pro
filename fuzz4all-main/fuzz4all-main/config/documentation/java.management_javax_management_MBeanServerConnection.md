IOException

Instantiates and registers an MBean in the MBean server. The
MBean server will use its

Default Loader
Repository

to load the class of the MBean. An object name is
associated with the MBean. If the object name given is null, the
MBean must provide its own name by implementing the

MBeanRegistration

interface
and returning the name from the

preRegister

method.

This method is equivalent to

createMBean(className, name, (Object[]) null, (String[])
null)

.

**Parameters:**
- className

- The class name of the MBean to be instantiated.
- name

- The object name of the MBean. May be null.

**Returns:**
- An

ObjectInstance

, containing the

ObjectName

and the Java class name of the newly
instantiated MBean. If the contained

ObjectName

is

n

, the contained Java class name is

getMBeanInfo(n)

query)
throws
IOException

Gets MBeans controlled by the MBean server. This method allows
any of the following to be obtained: All MBeans, a set of
MBeans specified by pattern matching on the

ObjectName

and/or a Query expression, a specific
MBean. When the object name is null or no domain and key
properties are specified, all objects are to be selected (and
filtered if a query is specified). It returns the set of

ObjectInstance

objects (containing the

ObjectName

and the Java Class name) for the

method enables any of the following to be obtained: The names
of all MBeans, the names of a set of MBeans specified by
pattern matching on the

ObjectName

and/or a Query
expression, a specific MBean name (equivalent to testing
whether an MBean is registered). When the object name is null
or no domain and key properties are specified, all objects are
selected (and filtered if a query is specified). It returns the
set of ObjectNames for the MBeans selected.

#### AttributeList
getAttributes​(
ObjectName
name,

String
[] attributes)
throws
InstanceNotFoundException
,

ReflectionException
,

IOException

Retrieves the values of several attributes of a named MBean. The MBean
is identified by its object name.

If one or more attributes cannot be retrieved for some reason, they
will be omitted from the returned

AttributeList

. The caller
should check that the list is the same size as the

attributes

array. To discover what problem prevented a given attribute from being
retrieved, call

getAttribute

for that attribute.

Here is an example of calling this method and checking that it
succeeded in retrieving all the requested attributes:

```java
String[] attrNames = ...;
AttributeList list = mbeanServerConnection.getAttributes(objectName, attrNames);
if (list.size() == attrNames.length)
System.out.println("All attributes were retrieved successfully");
else {

List<String>
missing = new
ArrayList<String>
(
Arrays.asList
(attrNames));
for (Attribute a : list.asList())
missing.remove(a.getName());
System.out.println("Did not retrieve: " + missing);
}
```

**Parameters:**
- name

- The object name of the MBean from which the
attributes are retrieved.

#### AttributeList
setAttributes​(
ObjectName
name,

AttributeList
attributes)
throws
InstanceNotFoundException
,

ReflectionException
,

IOException

Sets the values of several attributes of a named MBean. The MBean is
identified by its object name.

If one or more attributes cannot be set for some reason, they will be
omitted from the returned

AttributeList

. The caller should check
that the input

AttributeList

is the same size as the output one.
To discover what problem prevented a given attribute from being retrieved,
it will usually be possible to call

setAttribute

for that attribute, although this is not guaranteed to work. (For
example, the values of two attributes may have been rejected because
they were inconsistent with each other. Setting one of them alone might
be allowed.)

Here is an example of calling this method and checking that it
succeeded in setting all the requested attributes:

```java
AttributeList inputAttrs = ...;
AttributeList outputAttrs = mbeanServerConnection.setAttributes(
objectName, inputAttrs);
if (inputAttrs.size() == outputAttrs.size())
System.out.println("All attributes were set successfully");
else {

List<String>
missing = new
ArrayList<String>
();
for (Attribute a : inputAttrs.asList())
missing.add(a.getName());
for (Attribute a : outputAttrs.asList())
missing.remove(a.getName());
System.out.println("Did not set: " + missing);
}
```

**Parameters:**
- name

- The object name of the MBean within which the
attributes are to be set.
- attributes

- A list of attributes: The identification of
the attributes to be set and the values they are to be set to.

**Returns:**
- The list of attributes that were set, with their new
values.

**Throws:**
- InstanceNotFoundException

- The MBean specified is not
registered in the MBean server.
- ReflectionException

- An exception occurred when
trying to invoke the getAttributes method of a Dynamic MBean.
- RuntimeOperationsException

- Wraps a

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException

: The object
name in parameter is null or attributes in parameter is null.
- IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

#### Object
invoke​(
ObjectName
name,

String
operationName,

Object
[] params,

String
[] signature)
throws
InstanceNotFoundException
,

MBeanException
,

ReflectionException
,

IOException

Invokes an operation on an MBean.

Because of the need for a

signature

to differentiate
possibly-overloaded operations, it is much simpler to invoke operations
through an

MBean proxy

where possible. For example, suppose you have a
Standard MBean interface like this:

```java
public interface FooMBean {
public int countMatches(String[] patterns, boolean ignoreCase);
}
```

The

countMatches

operation can be invoked as follows:

```java
String[] myPatterns = ...;
int count = (Integer) mbeanServerConnection.invoke(
objectName,
"countMatches",
new Object[] {myPatterns, true},
new String[] {String[].class.getName(), boolean.class.getName()});
```

Alternatively, it can be invoked through a proxy as follows:

```java
String[] myPatterns = ...;
FooMBean fooProxy = JMX.newMBeanProxy(
mbeanServerConnection, objectName, FooMBean.class);
int count = fooProxy.countMatches(myPatterns, true);
```

**Parameters:**
- name

- The object name of the MBean on which the method is
to be invoked.
- operationName

- The name of the operation to be invoked.
- params

- An array containing the parameters to be set when
the operation is invoked
- signature

- An array containing the signature of the
operation, an array of class names in the format returned by

Class.getName()

. The class objects will be loaded using the same
class loader as the one used for loading the MBean on which the
operation was invoked.

**Returns:**
- The object returned by the operation, which represents
the result of invoking the operation on the MBean specified.

**Throws:**
- InstanceNotFoundException

- The MBean specified is not
registered in the MBean server.
- MBeanException

- Wraps an exception thrown by the
MBean's invoked method.
- ReflectionException

- Wraps a

java.lang.Exception

thrown while trying to invoke
the method.
- IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

that is registered with the given name at the time this method
is called. Even if it is subsequently unregistered, it will
continue to receive notifications.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the MBean on which the listener should
be added.
- listener

- The object name of the listener which will
handle the notifications emitted by the registered MBean.

```

Instantiates and registers an MBean in the MBean server. The
MBean server will use its

Default Loader
Repository

to load the class of the MBean. An object name is
associated with the MBean. If the object name given is null, the
MBean must provide its own name by implementing the

MBeanRegistration

interface
and returning the name from the

preRegister

method.

This method is equivalent to

createMBean(className, name, (Object[]) null, (String[])
null)

.

**Parameters:** className

- The class name of the MBean to be instantiated.
**Parameters:** name

- The object name of the MBean. May be null.
**Returns:** An

ObjectInstance

, containing the

```

Retrieves the values of several attributes of a named MBean. The MBean
is identified by its object name.

If one or more attributes cannot be retrieved for some reason, they
will be omitted from the returned

AttributeList

. The caller
should check that the list is the same size as the

attributes

array. To discover what problem prevented a given attribute from being
retrieved, call

getAttribute

for that attribute.

Here is an example of calling this method and checking that it
succeeded in retrieving all the requested attributes:

```java
String[] attrNames = ...;
AttributeList list = mbeanServerConnection.getAttributes(objectName, attrNames);
if (list.size() == attrNames.length)
System.out.println("All attributes were retrieved successfully");
else {

- setAttributes

```java
AttributeList
setAttributes​(
ObjectName
name,

AttributeList
attributes)
throws
InstanceNotFoundException
,

ReflectionException
,

IOException
```

Sets the values of several attributes of a named MBean. The MBean is
identified by its object name.

If one or more attributes cannot be set for some reason, they will be
omitted from the returned

AttributeList

. The caller should check
that the input

AttributeList

is the same size as the output one.
To discover what problem prevented a given attribute from being retrieved,
it will usually be possible to call

setAttribute

for that attribute, although this is not guaranteed to work. (For
example, the values of two attributes may have been rejected because
they were inconsistent with each other. Setting one of them alone might
be allowed.)

Here is an example of calling this method and checking that it
succeeded in setting all the requested attributes:

```java
AttributeList inputAttrs = ...;
AttributeList outputAttrs = mbeanServerConnection.setAttributes(
objectName, inputAttrs);
if (inputAttrs.size() == outputAttrs.size())
System.out.println("All attributes were set successfully");
else {

List<String>
missing = new
ArrayList<String>
();
for (Attribute a : inputAttrs.asList())
missing.add(a.getName());
for (Attribute a : outputAttrs.asList())
missing.remove(a.getName());
System.out.println("Did not set: " + missing);
}
```

**Parameters:** name

- The object name of the MBean within which the
attributes are to be set.
**Parameters:** attributes

- A list of attributes: The identification of
the attributes to be set and the values they are to be set to.
**Returns:** The list of attributes that were set, with their new
values.
**Throws:** InstanceNotFoundException

- The MBean specified is not
registered in the MBean server.
**Throws:** ReflectionException

- An exception occurred when
trying to invoke the getAttributes method of a Dynamic MBean.
**Throws:** RuntimeOperationsException

- Wraps a

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException

: The object
name in parameter is null or attributes in parameter is null.
**Throws:** IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

operationName,

Object
[] params,

String
[] signature)
throws
InstanceNotFoundException
,

MBeanException
,

ReflectionException
,

IOException
```

Invokes an operation on an MBean.

Because of the need for a

signature

to differentiate
possibly-overloaded operations, it is much simpler to invoke operations
through an

MBean proxy

where possible. For example, suppose you have a
Standard MBean interface like this:

```java
public interface FooMBean {
public int countMatches(String[] patterns, boolean ignoreCase);
}
```

The

countMatches

operation can be invoked as follows:

```java
String[] myPatterns = ...;
int count = (Integer) mbeanServerConnection.invoke(
objectName,
"countMatches",
new Object[] {myPatterns, true},
new String[] {String[].class.getName(), boolean.class.getName()});
```

Alternatively, it can be invoked through a proxy as follows:

```java
String[] myPatterns = ...;
FooMBean fooProxy = JMX.newMBeanProxy(
mbeanServerConnection, objectName, FooMBean.class);
int count = fooProxy.countMatches(myPatterns, true);
```

**Parameters:** name

- The object name of the MBean on which the method is
to be invoked.
**Parameters:** operationName

- The name of the operation to be invoked.
**Parameters:** params

- An array containing the parameters to be set when
the operation is invoked
**Parameters:** signature

- An array containing the signature of the
operation, an array of class names in the format returned by

Class.getName()

. The class objects will be loaded using the same
class loader as the one used for loading the MBean on which the
operation was invoked.
**Returns:** The object returned by the operation, which represents
the result of invoking the operation on the MBean specified.
**Throws:** InstanceNotFoundException

- The MBean specified is not
registered in the MBean server.
**Throws:** MBeanException

- Wraps an exception thrown by the
MBean's invoked method.
**Throws:** ReflectionException

- Wraps a

java.lang.Exception

thrown while trying to invoke
the method.
**Throws:** IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

- getDefaultDomain

```java
String
getDefaultDomain()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the default domain used for naming the MBean.
The default domain name is used as the domain part in the ObjectName
of MBeans if no domain is specified by the user.

**Returns:** the default domain.
**Throws:** IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

- getDomains

```java
String
[] getDomains()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the list of domains in which any MBean is currently
registered. A string is in the returned array if and only if
there is at least one MBean registered with an ObjectName whose

getDomain()

is equal to that
string. The order of strings within the returned array is
not defined.

**Returns:** the list of domains.
**Throws:** IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

listener,

NotificationFilter
filter,

Object
handback)
throws
InstanceNotFoundException
,

IOException
```

Adds a listener to a registered MBean.

A notification emitted by an MBean will be forwarded by the
MBeanServer to the listener. If the source of the notification
is a reference to an MBean object, the MBean server will
replace it by that MBean's ObjectName. Otherwise the source is
unchanged.

The listener object that receives notifications is the one
that is registered with the given name at the time this method
is called. Even if it is subsequently unregistered, it will
continue to receive notifications.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the MBean on which the listener should
be added.
**Parameters:** listener

- The object name of the listener which will
handle the notifications emitted by the registered MBean.

Gets MBeans controlled by the MBean server. This method allows
any of the following to be obtained: All MBeans, a set of
MBeans specified by pattern matching on the

ObjectName

and/or a Query expression, a specific
MBean. When the object name is null or no domain and key
properties are specified, all objects are to be selected (and

method enables any of the following to be obtained: The names
of all MBeans, the names of a set of MBeans specified by
pattern matching on the

ObjectName

and/or a Query
expression, a specific MBean name (equivalent to testing
whether an MBean is registered). When the object name is null
or no domain and key properties are specified, all objects are
selected (and filtered if a query is specified). It returns the

```

Retrieves the values of several attributes of a named MBean. The MBean
is identified by its object name.

If one or more attributes cannot be retrieved for some reason, they
will be omitted from the returned

AttributeList

. The caller
should check that the list is the same size as the

attributes

array. To discover what problem prevented a given attribute from being
retrieved, call

getAttribute

for that attribute.

Here is an example of calling this method and checking that it
succeeded in retrieving all the requested attributes:

```java
String[] attrNames = ...;
AttributeList list = mbeanServerConnection.getAttributes(objectName, attrNames);
if (list.size() == attrNames.length)
System.out.println("All attributes were retrieved successfully");
else {

List<String>
missing = new
ArrayList<String>
(
Arrays.asList
(attrNames));
for (Attribute a : list.asList())

- setAttributes

```java
AttributeList
setAttributes​(
ObjectName
name,

AttributeList
attributes)
throws
InstanceNotFoundException
,

ReflectionException
,

IOException
```

Sets the values of several attributes of a named MBean. The MBean is
identified by its object name.

If one or more attributes cannot be set for some reason, they will be
omitted from the returned

AttributeList

. The caller should check
that the input

AttributeList

is the same size as the output one.
To discover what problem prevented a given attribute from being retrieved,
it will usually be possible to call

setAttribute

for that attribute, although this is not guaranteed to work. (For
example, the values of two attributes may have been rejected because
they were inconsistent with each other. Setting one of them alone might
be allowed.)

Here is an example of calling this method and checking that it
succeeded in setting all the requested attributes:

```java
AttributeList inputAttrs = ...;
AttributeList outputAttrs = mbeanServerConnection.setAttributes(
objectName, inputAttrs);
if (inputAttrs.size() == outputAttrs.size())
System.out.println("All attributes were set successfully");
else {

List<String>
missing = new
ArrayList<String>
();
for (Attribute a : inputAttrs.asList())
missing.add(a.getName());
for (Attribute a : outputAttrs.asList())
missing.remove(a.getName());
System.out.println("Did not set: " + missing);
}
```

**Parameters:** name

- The object name of the MBean within which the
attributes are to be set.
**Parameters:** attributes

- A list of attributes: The identification of
the attributes to be set and the values they are to be set to.
**Returns:** The list of attributes that were set, with their new
values.
**Throws:** InstanceNotFoundException

- The MBean specified is not
registered in the MBean server.
**Throws:** ReflectionException

- An exception occurred when
trying to invoke the getAttributes method of a Dynamic MBean.
**Throws:** RuntimeOperationsException

- Wraps a

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException

: The object
name in parameter is null or attributes in parameter is null.
**Throws:** IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

name,

String
operationName,

Object
[] params,

String
[] signature)
throws
InstanceNotFoundException
,

MBeanException
,

ReflectionException
,

IOException
```

Invokes an operation on an MBean.

Because of the need for a

signature

to differentiate
possibly-overloaded operations, it is much simpler to invoke operations
through an

MBean proxy

where possible. For example, suppose you have a
Standard MBean interface like this:

```java
public interface FooMBean {
public int countMatches(String[] patterns, boolean ignoreCase);
}
```

The

countMatches

operation can be invoked as follows:

```java
String[] myPatterns = ...;
int count = (Integer) mbeanServerConnection.invoke(
objectName,
"countMatches",
new Object[] {myPatterns, true},
new String[] {String[].class.getName(), boolean.class.getName()});
```

Alternatively, it can be invoked through a proxy as follows:

```java
String[] myPatterns = ...;
FooMBean fooProxy = JMX.newMBeanProxy(
mbeanServerConnection, objectName, FooMBean.class);
int count = fooProxy.countMatches(myPatterns, true);
```

**Parameters:** name

- The object name of the MBean on which the method is
to be invoked.
**Parameters:** operationName

- The name of the operation to be invoked.
**Parameters:** params

- An array containing the parameters to be set when
the operation is invoked
**Parameters:** signature

- An array containing the signature of the
operation, an array of class names in the format returned by

Class.getName()

. The class objects will be loaded using the same
class loader as the one used for loading the MBean on which the
operation was invoked.
**Returns:** The object returned by the operation, which represents
the result of invoking the operation on the MBean specified.
**Throws:** InstanceNotFoundException

- The MBean specified is not
registered in the MBean server.
**Throws:** MBeanException

- Wraps an exception thrown by the
MBean's invoked method.
**Throws:** ReflectionException

- Wraps a

java.lang.Exception

thrown while trying to invoke
the method.
**Throws:** IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

- getDefaultDomain

```java
String
getDefaultDomain()
throws
IOException
```

The default domain name is used as the domain part in the ObjectName
of MBeans if no domain is specified by the user.

**Returns:** the default domain.
**Throws:** IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

- getDomains

```java
String
[] getDomains()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the list of domains in which any MBean is currently
registered. A string is in the returned array if and only if
there is at least one MBean registered with an ObjectName whose

getDomain()

is equal to that
string. The order of strings within the returned array is
not defined.

**Returns:** the list of domains.
**Throws:** IOException

- A communication problem occurred when
talking to the MBean server.

Adds a listener to a registered MBean.

A notification emitted by an MBean will be forwarded by the
MBeanServer to the listener. If the source of the notification
is a reference to an MBean object, the MBean server will
replace it by that MBean's ObjectName. Otherwise the source is
unchanged.

The listener object that receives notifications is the one
that is registered with the given name at the time this method
is called. Even if it is subsequently unregistered, it will
continue to receive notifications.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the MBean on which the listener should
be added.
**Parameters:** listener

- The object name of the listener which will
handle the notifications emitted by the registered MBean.
**Parameters:** filter

- The filter object. If filter is null, no
filtering will be performed before handling notifications.

```

Invokes an operation on an MBean.

Because of the need for a

signature

to differentiate
possibly-overloaded operations, it is much simpler to invoke operations
through an

MBean proxy

where possible. For example, suppose you have a
Standard MBean interface like this:

```java
public interface FooMBean {
public int countMatches(String[] patterns, boolean ignoreCase);
}
```

The

countMatches

operation can be invoked as follows:

```java
String[] myPatterns = ...;
int count = (Integer) mbeanServerConnection.invoke(
objectName,
"countMatches",
new Object[] {myPatterns, true},
new String[] {String[].class.getName(), boolean.class.getName()});
```

Alternatively, it can be invoked through a proxy as follows:

```java
String[] myPatterns = ...;
FooMBean fooProxy = JMX.newMBeanProxy(
mbeanServerConnection, objectName, FooMBean.class);
int count = fooProxy.countMatches(myPatterns, true);
```

**Parameters:** name

- The object name of the MBean on which the method is
to be invoked.
**Parameters:** operationName

- The name of the operation to be invoked.
**Parameters:** params

- An array containing the parameters to be set when
the operation is invoked
**Parameters:** signature

- An array containing the signature of the
operation, an array of class names in the format returned by

Class.getName()

. The class objects will be loaded using the same
class loader as the one used for loading the MBean on which the
operation was invoked.
**Returns:** The object returned by the operation, which represents
the result of invoking the operation on the MBean specified.
**Throws:** InstanceNotFoundException

- The MBean specified is not
registered in the MBean server.
**Throws:** MBeanException

- Wraps an exception thrown by the
MBean's invoked method.
**Throws:** ReflectionException

- Wraps a
