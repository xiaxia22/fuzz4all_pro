# Interface JMXAuthenticator

**Source:** `java.management\javax\management\remote\JMXAuthenticator.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
JMXAuthenticator
```

Interface to define how remote credentials are converted into a
JAAS Subject. This interface is used by the RMI Connector Server,
and can be used by other connector servers.

The user-defined authenticator instance is passed to the
connector server in the environment map as the value of the
attribute

JMXConnectorServer.AUTHENTICATOR

. For connector
servers that use only this authentication system, if this attribute
is not present or its value is

null

then no user
authentication will be performed and full access to the methods
exported by the

MBeanServerConnection

object will be
allowed.

If authentication is successful then an authenticated

subject

filled in with its associated

principals

is returned. Authorization checks
will be then performed based on the given set of principals.

**Since:** 1.5
