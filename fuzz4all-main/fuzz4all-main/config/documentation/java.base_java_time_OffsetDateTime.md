# Class OffsetDateTime

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\OffsetDateTime.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
OffsetDateTime

extends
Object

implements
Temporal
,
TemporalAdjuster
,
Comparable
<
OffsetDateTime
>,
Serializable
```

A date-time with an offset from UTC/Greenwich in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
such as

2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00

.

OffsetDateTime

is an immutable representation of a date-time with an offset.
This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
as well as the offset from UTC/Greenwich. For example, the value
"2nd October 2007 at 13:45:30.123456789 +02:00" can be stored in an

OffsetDateTime

.

OffsetDateTime

,

ZonedDateTime

and

Instant

all store an instant
on the time-line to nanosecond precision.

Instant

is the simplest, simply representing the instant.

OffsetDateTime

adds to the instant the offset from UTC/Greenwich, which allows
the local date-time to be obtained.

ZonedDateTime

adds full time-zone rules.

It is intended that

ZonedDateTime

or

Instant

is used to model data
in simpler applications. This class may be used when modeling date-time concepts in
more detail, or when communicating to a database or in a network protocol.

This is a

value-based

class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
(

==

), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of

OffsetDateTime

may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
The

equals

method should be used for comparisons.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

### Field Details

#### public static final
OffsetDateTime
MIN

The minimum supported

OffsetDateTime

, '-999999999-01-01T00:00:00+18:00'.
This is the local date-time of midnight at the start of the minimum date
in the maximum offset (larger offsets are earlier on the time-line).
This combines

LocalDateTime.MIN

and

ZoneOffset.MAX

.
This could be used by an application as a "far past" date-time.

---

#### public static final
OffsetDateTime
MAX

The maximum supported

OffsetDateTime

, '+999999999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999-18:00'.
This is the local date-time just before midnight at the end of the maximum date
in the minimum offset (larger negative offsets are later on the time-line).
This combines

LocalDateTime.MAX

and

ZoneOffset.MIN

.
This could be used by an application as a "far future" date-time.

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### public static
Comparator
<
OffsetDateTime
> timeLineOrder()

Gets a comparator that compares two

OffsetDateTime

instances
based solely on the instant.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

in that it
only compares the underlying instant.

**Returns:**
- a comparator that compares in time-line order

**See Also:**
- isAfter(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

,

isBefore(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

,

isEqual(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

---

#### public static
OffsetDateTime
now()

Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current date-time.
The offset will be calculated from the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Returns:**
- the current date-time using the system clock, not null

---

#### public static
OffsetDateTime
now​(
ZoneId
zone)

Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current date-time.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
The offset will be calculated from the specified time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the zone ID to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the current date-time using the system clock, not null

---

#### public static
OffsetDateTime
now​(
Clock
clock)

Obtains the current date-time from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current date-time.
The offset will be calculated from the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

**Parameters:**
- clock

- the clock to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the current date-time, not null

---

#### public static
OffsetDateTime
of​(
LocalDate
date,

LocalTime
time,

ZoneOffset
offset)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from a date, time and offset.

This creates an offset date-time with the specified local date, time and offset.

**Parameters:**
- date

- the local date, not null
- time

- the local time, not null
- offset

- the zone offset, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset date-time, not null

---

#### public static
OffsetDateTime
of​(
LocalDateTime
dateTime,

ZoneOffset
offset)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from a date-time and offset.

This creates an offset date-time with the specified local date-time and offset.

**Parameters:**
- dateTime

- the local date-time, not null
- offset

- the zone offset, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset date-time, not null

---

#### public static
OffsetDateTime
of​(int year,
int month,
int dayOfMonth,
int hour,
int minute,
int second,
int nanoOfSecond,

ZoneOffset
offset)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from a year, month, day,
hour, minute, second, nanosecond and offset.

This creates an offset date-time with the seven specified fields.

This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.

LocalDateTime

has five additional convenience variants of the
equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.

**Parameters:**
- year

- the year to represent, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR
- month

- the month-of-year to represent, from 1 (January) to 12 (December)
- dayOfMonth

- the day-of-month to represent, from 1 to 31
- hour

- the hour-of-day to represent, from 0 to 23
- minute

- the minute-of-hour to represent, from 0 to 59
- second

- the second-of-minute to represent, from 0 to 59
- nanoOfSecond

- the nano-of-second to represent, from 0 to 999,999,999
- offset

- the zone offset, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the value of any field is out of range, or
if the day-of-month is invalid for the month-year

---

#### public static
OffsetDateTime
ofInstant​(
Instant
instant,

ZoneId
zone)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from an

Instant

and zone ID.

This creates an offset date-time with the same instant as that specified.
Finding the offset from UTC/Greenwich is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant.

**Parameters:**
- instant

- the instant to create the date-time from, not null
- zone

- the time-zone, which may be an offset, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported range

---

#### public static
OffsetDateTime
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains an offset date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

OffsetDateTime

.

The conversion will first obtain a

ZoneOffset

from the temporal object.
It will then try to obtain a

LocalDateTime

, falling back to an

Instant

if necessary.
The result will be the combination of

ZoneOffset

with either
with

LocalDateTime

or

Instant

.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

OffsetDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to an

OffsetDateTime

---

#### public static
OffsetDateTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from a text string
such as

2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00

.

The string must represent a valid date-time and is parsed using

DateTimeFormatter.ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME

.

**Parameters:**
- text

- the text to parse such as "2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00", not null

**Returns:**
- the parsed offset date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

---

#### public static
OffsetDateTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text,

DateTimeFormatter
formatter)

OffsetDateTime

from a text string using a specific formatter.

The text is parsed using the formatter, returning a date-time.

**Parameters:**
- text

- the text to parse, not null
- formatter

- the formatter to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the parsed offset date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

This date-time is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return
appropriate range instances.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

---

#### public
OffsetDateTime
withOffsetSameLocal​(
ZoneOffset
offset)

Returns a copy of this

OffsetDateTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result has the same local date-time.

This method returns an object with the same

LocalDateTime

and the specified

ZoneOffset

.
No calculation is needed or performed.
For example, if this time represents

2007-12-03T10:30+02:00

---

#### public
OffsetDateTime
withOffsetSameInstant​(
ZoneOffset
offset)

Returns a copy of this

OffsetDateTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result is at the same instant.

This method returns an object with the specified

ZoneOffset

and a

LocalDateTime

adjusted by the difference between the two offsets.
This will result in the old and new objects representing the same instant.
This is useful for finding the local time in a different offset.
For example, if this time represents

2007-12-03T10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

2007-12-03T11:30+03:00

.

**Returns:**
- the year, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR

---

#### public int getMonthValue()

Gets the month-of-year field from 1 to 12.

This method returns the month as an

int

from 1 to 12.
Application code is frequently clearer if the enum

Month

is used by calling

getMonth()

.

**Returns:**
- the month-of-year, from 1 to 12

**See Also:**
- getMonth()

---

#### public
Month
getMonth()

Gets the month-of-year field using the

Month

enum.

This method returns the enum

Month

for the month.
This avoids confusion as to what

int

values mean.
If you need access to the primitive

int

value then the enum
provides the

int value

.

**Returns:**
- the month-of-year, not null

**See Also:**
- getMonthValue()

---

#### public int getDayOfMonth()

Gets the day-of-month field.

This method returns the primitive

int

value for the day-of-month.

---

#### public
DayOfWeek
getDayOfWeek()

Gets the day-of-week field, which is an enum

DayOfWeek

.

This method returns the enum

DayOfWeek

for the day-of-week.
This avoids confusion as to what

int

values mean.
If you need access to the primitive

int

value then the enum
provides the

int value

.

Additional information can be obtained from the

DayOfWeek

.
This includes textual names of the values.

**Returns:**
- the day-of-week, not null

---

#### public
LocalTime
toLocalTime()

Gets the

LocalTime

part of this date-time.

This returns a

LocalTime

with the same hour, minute, second and
nanosecond as this date-time.

**Returns:**
- the time part of this date-time, not null

---

#### public
OffsetDateTime
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)

Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
Key date-time classes also implement the

TemporalAdjuster

interface,
such as

Month

and

MonthDay

.
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:

```java
import static java.time.Month.*;
import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

result = offsetDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
```

The classes

LocalDate

,

LocalTime

and

ZoneOffset

implement

TemporalAdjuster

, thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:

```java
result = offsetDateTime.with(date);
result = offsetDateTime.with(time);
result = offsetDateTime.with(offset);
```

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

method on the
specified adjuster passing

this

as the argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null

**Returns:**
- an

OffsetDateTime

based on

this

with the adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the adjustment cannot be made
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### public
OffsetDateTime
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

INSTANT_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
The offset and nano-of-second are unchanged.
If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The

OFFSET_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified offset.
The local date-time is unaltered. If the new offset value is outside the valid range
then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalDateTime

.
In this case, the offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to set in the result, not null
- newValue

- the new value of the field in the result

**Returns:**

OffsetDateTime

based on

this

with the specified field set, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

, based on this one, with the amount
in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoUnit

then the addition is implemented by

LocalDateTime.plus(long, TemporalUnit)

.
The offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged in the result.

If the field is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
whether and how to perform the addition.

---

#### public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

OffsetDateTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date-time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
using

startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

OffsetDateTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the offset differs between the two date-times, the specified
end date-time is normalized to have the same offset as this date-time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two date-times.
For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

,

DAYS

,

WEEKS

,

MONTHS

,

YEARS

,

DECADES

,

CENTURIES

,

MILLENNIA

and

ERAS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- until

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- endExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which is converted to an

OffsetDateTime

, not null
- unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null

**Returns:**
- the amount of time between this date-time and the end date-time

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to an

OffsetDateTime
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### public
ZonedDateTime
atZoneSameInstant​(
ZoneId
zone)

Combines this date-time with a time-zone to create a

ZonedDateTime

ensuring that the result has the same instant.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time and the specified time-zone.
This conversion will ignore the visible local date-time and use the underlying instant instead.
This avoids any problems with local time-line gaps or overlaps.
The result might have different values for fields such as hour, minute an even day.

To attempt to retain the values of the fields, use

atZoneSimilarLocal(ZoneId)

.
To use the offset as the zone ID, use

toZonedDateTime()

.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the zoned date-time formed from this date-time, not null

---

#### public
ZonedDateTime
atZoneSimilarLocal​(
ZoneId
zone)

Combines this date-time with a time-zone to create a

ZonedDateTime

trying to keep the same local date and time.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time and the specified time-zone.
Where possible, the result will have the same local date-time as this object.

Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every time on the
local time-line exists. If the local date-time is in a gap or overlap according to
the rules then a resolver is used to determine the resultant local time and offset.
This method uses

ZonedDateTime.ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)

to retain the offset from this instance if possible.

Finer control over gaps and overlaps is available in two ways.
If you simply want to use the later offset at overlaps then call

ZonedDateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

immediately after this method.

To create a zoned date-time at the same instant irrespective of the local time-line,
use

atZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

.
To use the offset as the zone ID, use

toZonedDateTime()

.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the zoned date-time formed from this date and the earliest valid time for the zone, not null

---

#### public
OffsetTime
toOffsetTime()

Converts this date-time to an

OffsetTime

.

This returns an offset time with the same local time and offset.

**Returns:**
- an OffsetTime representing the time and offset, not null

---

#### public
ZonedDateTime
toZonedDateTime()

Converts this date-time to a

ZonedDateTime

using the offset as the zone ID.

This creates the simplest possible

ZonedDateTime

using the offset
as the zone ID.

To control the time-zone used, see

atZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

and

atZoneSimilarLocal(ZoneId)

.

**Returns:**
- a zoned date-time representing the same local date-time and offset, not null

---

#### public
Instant
toInstant()

Converts this date-time to an

Instant

.

This returns an

Instant

representing the same point on the
time-line as this date-time.

**Returns:**
- an

Instant

representing the same instant, not null

---

#### public long toEpochSecond()

Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This allows this date-time to be converted to a value of the

epoch-seconds

field. This is primarily
intended for low-level conversions rather than general application usage.

**Returns:**
- the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

---

#### public int compareTo​(
OffsetDateTime
other)

Compares this date-time to another date-time.

The comparison is based on the instant then on the local date-time.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2008-12-03T10:30+01:00
- 2008-12-03T11:00+01:00
- 2008-12-03T12:00+02:00
- 2008-12-03T11:30+01:00
- 2008-12-03T12:00+01:00
- 2008-12-03T12:30+01:00

Values #2 and #3 represent the same instant on the time-line.
When two values represent the same instant, the local date-time is compared
to distinguish them. This step is needed to make the ordering
consistent with

equals()

.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

OffsetDateTime

>

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

---

#### public boolean isAfter​(
OffsetDateTime
other)

Checks if the instant of this date-time is after that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it
only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().isAfter(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this is after the instant of the specified date-time

---

#### public boolean isBefore​(
OffsetDateTime
other)

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

in that it
only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().isBefore(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this is before the instant of the specified date-time

---

#### public boolean isEqual​(
OffsetDateTime
other)

Checks if the instant of this date-time is equal to that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().equals(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if the instant equals the instant of the specified date-time

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Checks if this date-time is equal to another date-time.

The comparison is based on the local date-time and the offset.
To compare for the same instant on the time-line, use

isEqual(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

.
Only objects of type

OffsetDateTime

are compared, other types return false.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if this is equal to the other date-time

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### public int hashCode()

A hash code for this date-time.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a suitable hash code

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public
String
toString()

Outputs this date-time as a

String

, such as

2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00

.

The output will be one of the following ISO-8601 formats:

- uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mmXXXXX
- uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXXXX
- uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXXXX
- uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSXXXXX
- uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSSSSXXXXX

The format used will be the shortest that outputs the full value of
the time where the omitted parts are implied to be zero.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this date-time, not null

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- MIN

```java
public static final
OffsetDateTime
MIN
```

The minimum supported

OffsetDateTime

, '-999999999-01-01T00:00:00+18:00'.
This is the local date-time of midnight at the start of the minimum date
in the maximum offset (larger offsets are earlier on the time-line).
This combines

LocalDateTime.MIN

and

ZoneOffset.MAX

.
This could be used by an application as a "far past" date-time.

- MAX

```java
public static final
OffsetDateTime
MAX
```

The maximum supported

OffsetDateTime

, '+999999999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999-18:00'.
This is the local date-time just before midnight at the end of the maximum date
in the minimum offset (larger negative offsets are later on the time-line).
This combines

LocalDateTime.MAX

and

ZoneOffset.MIN

.
This could be used by an application as a "far future" date-time.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- timeLineOrder

```java
public static
Comparator
<
OffsetDateTime
> timeLineOrder()

offset)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from a year, month, day,
hour, minute, second, nanosecond and offset.

This creates an offset date-time with the seven specified fields.

This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.

LocalDateTime

has five additional convenience variants of the
equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.

**Parameters:** year

- the year to represent, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR
**Parameters:** month

- the month-of-year to represent, from 1 (January) to 12 (December)

- ofInstant

```java
public static
OffsetDateTime
ofInstant​(
Instant
instant,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from an

Instant

and zone ID.

This creates an offset date-time with the same instant as that specified.
Finding the offset from UTC/Greenwich is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant.

**Parameters:** instant

- the instant to create the date-time from, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, which may be an offset, not null
**Returns:** the offset date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported range

- from

```java
public static
OffsetDateTime
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains an offset date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

OffsetDateTime

.

The conversion will first obtain a

ZoneOffset

from the temporal object.
It will then try to obtain a

LocalDateTime

, falling back to an

Instant

if necessary.
The result will be the combination of

ZoneOffset

with either
with

LocalDateTime

or

Instant

.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

OffsetDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the offset date-time, not null

ZoneOffset

.
No calculation is needed or performed.
For example, if this time represents

2007-12-03T10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

2007-12-03T10:30+03:00

OffsetDateTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result is at the same instant.

This method returns an object with the specified

ZoneOffset

and a

LocalDateTime

adjusted by the difference between the two offsets.
This will result in the old and new objects representing the same instant.
This is useful for finding the local time in a different offset.
For example, if this time represents

2007-12-03T10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

2007-12-03T11:30+03:00

getDayOfWeek()
```

Gets the day-of-week field, which is an enum

DayOfWeek

.

This method returns the enum

DayOfWeek

for the day-of-week.
This avoids confusion as to what

int

values mean.
If you need access to the primitive

int

value then the enum
provides the

int value

.

Additional information can be obtained from the

DayOfWeek

.
This includes textual names of the values.

**Returns:** the day-of-week, not null

- toLocalTime

```java
public
LocalTime
toLocalTime()
```

Gets the

LocalTime

part of this date-time.

This returns a

LocalTime

with the same hour, minute, second and
nanosecond as this date-time.

**Returns:** the time part of this date-time, not null

- getHour

```java
public int getHour()
```

Gets the hour-of-day field.

**Returns:** the hour-of-day, from 0 to 23

- getMinute

```java
public int getMinute()
```

Gets the minute-of-hour field.

**Returns:** the minute-of-hour, from 0 to 59

- getSecond

```java
public int getSecond()
```

Gets the second-of-minute field.

**Returns:** the second-of-minute, from 0 to 59

- getNano

```java
public int getNano()
```

Gets the nano-of-second field.

**Returns:** the nano-of-second, from 0 to 999,999,999

- with

```java
public
OffsetDateTime
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
Key date-time classes also implement the

TemporalAdjuster

interface,
such as

Month

and

MonthDay

.
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:

```java
import static java.time.Month.*;
import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

result = offsetDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
```

The classes

LocalDate

,

LocalTime

and

ZoneOffset

implement

TemporalAdjuster

, thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:

```java
result = offsetDateTime.with(date);
result = offsetDateTime.with(time);
result = offsetDateTime.with(offset);
```

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

method on the
specified adjuster passing

this

as the argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an

OffsetDateTime

based on

this

with the adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the adjustment cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
public
OffsetDateTime
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

INSTANT_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
The offset and nano-of-second are unchanged.
If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The

OFFSET_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified offset.
The local date-time is unaltered. If the new offset value is outside the valid range
then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalDateTime

.
In this case, the offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

any other type implementing the

TemporalAmount

interface.

The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling

TemporalAmount.addTo(Temporal)

. The amount implementation is free
to implement the addition in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

. Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully added.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

, based on this one, with the amount
in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoUnit

then the addition is implemented by

LocalDateTime.plus(long, TemporalUnit)

.
The offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged in the result.

If the field is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
whether and how to perform the addition.

- plusYears

```java
public
OffsetDateTime
plusYears​(long years)
```

Returns a copy of this

OffsetDateTime

with the specified number of years added.

This method adds the specified amount to the years field in three steps:

- Add the input years to the year field
- Check if the resulting date would be invalid
- Adjust the day-of-month to the last valid day if necessary

For example, 2008-02-29 (leap year) plus one year would result in the
invalid date 2009-02-29 (standard year). Instead of returning an invalid
result, the last valid day of the month, 2009-02-28, is selected instead.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

```

Queries this date-time using the specified query.

This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- adjustInto

```java
public
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)
```

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same offset, date
and time as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the offset, date and time changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

three times, passing

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

,

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

and

ChronoField.OFFSET_SECONDS

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisOffsetDateTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisOffsetDateTime);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

OffsetDateTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date-time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
using

startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

OffsetDateTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the offset differs between the two date-times, the specified
end date-time is normalized to have the same offset as this date-time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two date-times.
For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

,

DAYS

,

WEEKS

,

MONTHS

,

YEARS

,

DECADES

,

CENTURIES

,

MILLENNIA

and

ERAS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** until

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** endExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which is converted to an

OffsetDateTime

, not null
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null
**Returns:** the amount of time between this date-time and the end date-time
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to an

OffsetDateTime
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- format

```java
public
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Formats this date-time using the specified formatter.

This date-time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the formatted date-time string, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

- atZoneSameInstant

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
atZoneSameInstant​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Combines this date-time with a time-zone to create a

ZonedDateTime

ensuring that the result has the same instant.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time and the specified time-zone.
This conversion will ignore the visible local date-time and use the underlying instant instead.
This avoids any problems with local time-line gaps or overlaps.
The result might have different values for fields such as hour, minute an even day.

To attempt to retain the values of the fields, use

atZoneSimilarLocal(ZoneId)

.
To use the offset as the zone ID, use

toZonedDateTime()

.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to use, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time formed from this date-time, not null

- atZoneSimilarLocal

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
atZoneSimilarLocal​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Combines this date-time with a time-zone to create a

ZonedDateTime

trying to keep the same local date and time.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time and the specified time-zone.
Where possible, the result will have the same local date-time as this object.

Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every time on the
local time-line exists. If the local date-time is in a gap or overlap according to
the rules then a resolver is used to determine the resultant local time and offset.
This method uses

ZonedDateTime.ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)

to retain the offset from this instance if possible.

Finer control over gaps and overlaps is available in two ways.
If you simply want to use the later offset at overlaps then call

ZonedDateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

immediately after this method.

To create a zoned date-time at the same instant irrespective of the local time-line,
use

atZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

.
To use the offset as the zone ID, use

toZonedDateTime()

.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to use, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time formed from this date and the earliest valid time for the zone, not null

- toOffsetTime

```java
public
OffsetTime
toOffsetTime()
```

Converts this date-time to an

OffsetTime

.

This returns an offset time with the same local time and offset.

**Returns:** an OffsetTime representing the time and offset, not null

- toZonedDateTime

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
toZonedDateTime()
```

Converts this date-time to a

ZonedDateTime

using the offset as the zone ID.

This creates the simplest possible

ZonedDateTime

using the offset
as the zone ID.

To control the time-zone used, see

atZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

and

atZoneSimilarLocal(ZoneId)

.

**Returns:** a zoned date-time representing the same local date-time and offset, not null

- toInstant

```java
public
Instant
toInstant()
```

Converts this date-time to an

Instant

.

This returns an

Instant

representing the same point on the
time-line as this date-time.

**Returns:** an

Instant

representing the same instant, not null

- toEpochSecond

```java
public long toEpochSecond()
```

Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This allows this date-time to be converted to a value of the

epoch-seconds

field. This is primarily
intended for low-level conversions rather than general application usage.

**Returns:** the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
OffsetDateTime
other)
```

Compares this date-time to another date-time.

The comparison is based on the instant then on the local date-time.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2008-12-03T10:30+01:00
- 2008-12-03T11:00+01:00
- 2008-12-03T12:00+02:00
- 2008-12-03T11:30+01:00
- 2008-12-03T12:00+01:00
- 2008-12-03T12:30+01:00

Values #2 and #3 represent the same instant on the time-line.
When two values represent the same instant, the local date-time is compared
to distinguish them. This step is needed to make the ordering
consistent with

equals()

.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

OffsetDateTime

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

- isAfter

```java
public boolean isAfter​(
OffsetDateTime
other)
```

Checks if the instant of this date-time is after that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it
only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().isAfter(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is after the instant of the specified date-time

- isBefore

public boolean isBefore​(
OffsetDateTime
other)
```

Checks if the instant of this date-time is before that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

in that it
only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().isBefore(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is before the instant of the specified date-time

- isEqual

```java
public boolean isEqual​(
OffsetDateTime
other)
```

Checks if the instant of this date-time is equal to that of the specified date-time.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().equals(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if the instant equals the instant of the specified date-time

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Checks if this date-time is equal to another date-time.

The comparison is based on the local date-time and the offset.
To compare for the same instant on the time-line, use

isEqual(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

.
Only objects of type

OffsetDateTime

are compared, other types return false.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the object to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if this is equal to the other date-time
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** a suitable hash code
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Outputs this date-time as a

String

, such as

2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00

.

The output will be one of the following ISO-8601 formats:

- uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mmXXXXX
- uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXXXX
- uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXXXX
- uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSXXXXX
- uuuu-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSSSSXXXXX

The format used will be the shortest that outputs the full value of
the time where the omitted parts are implied to be zero.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of this date-time, not null

,

isEqual(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

- now

```java
public static
OffsetDateTime
now()
```

Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current date-time.
The offset will be calculated from the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

```java
public static
OffsetDateTime
now​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current date-time.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
The offset will be calculated from the specified time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:** zone

- the zone ID to use, not null

```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from a year, month, day,
hour, minute, second, nanosecond and offset.

This creates an offset date-time with the seven specified fields.

This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.

LocalDateTime

has five additional convenience variants of the
equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.

**Parameters:** year

- the year to represent, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR

ofInstant​(
Instant
instant,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from an

Instant

and zone ID.

This creates an offset date-time with the same instant as that specified.
Finding the offset from UTC/Greenwich is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant.

**Parameters:** instant

- the instant to create the date-time from, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, which may be an offset, not null
**Returns:** the offset date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the result exceeds the supported range

- from

```java
public static
OffsetDateTime
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetDateTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains an offset date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

OffsetDateTime

.

The conversion will first obtain a

ZoneOffset

from the temporal object.
It will then try to obtain a

LocalDateTime

, falling back to an

Instant

if necessary.
The result will be the combination of

ZoneOffset

with either
with

LocalDateTime

or

Instant

.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

OffsetDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

**Returns:** the zone offset, not null

- withOffsetSameLocal

```java
public
OffsetDateTime
withOffsetSameLocal​(
ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Returns a copy of this

OffsetDateTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result has the same local date-time.

This method returns an object with the same

LocalDateTime

and the specified

ZoneOffset

.
No calculation is needed or performed.
For example, if this time represents

2007-12-03T10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

2007-12-03T10:30+03:00

.

To take into account the difference between the offsets, and adjust the time fields,
use

withOffsetSameInstant(java.time.ZoneOffset)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset to change to, not null
**Returns:** an

OffsetDateTime

based on this date-time with the requested offset, not null

- withOffsetSameInstant

```java
public
OffsetDateTime
withOffsetSameInstant​(
ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Returns a copy of this

OffsetDateTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result is at the same instant.

This method returns an object with the specified

ZoneOffset

and a

LocalDateTime

adjusted by the difference between the two offsets.
This will result in the old and new objects representing the same instant.
This is useful for finding the local time in a different offset.
For example, if this time represents

2007-12-03T10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

2007-12-03T11:30+03:00

.

To change the offset without adjusting the local time use

- with

```java
public
OffsetDateTime
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
Key date-time classes also implement the

TemporalAdjuster

interface,
such as

Month

and

MonthDay

.
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:

```java
import static java.time.Month.*;
import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

result = offsetDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
```

The classes

LocalDate

,

LocalTime

and

ZoneOffset

implement

TemporalAdjuster

, thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:

```java
result = offsetDateTime.with(date);
result = offsetDateTime.with(time);
result = offsetDateTime.with(offset);
```

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

method on the
specified adjuster passing

this

as the argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an

OffsetDateTime

based on

this

with the adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the adjustment cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
public
OffsetDateTime
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

INSTANT_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
The offset and nano-of-second are unchanged.
If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The

OFFSET_SECONDS

field will return a date-time with the specified offset.
The local date-time is unaltered. If the new offset value is outside the valid range
then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalDateTime

.
In this case, the offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

- if the result exceeds the supported date range

- query

```java
public <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this date-time using the specified query.

This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

- adjustInto

```java
public
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)
```

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same offset, date
and time as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the offset, date and time changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

three times, passing

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

,

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

and

ChronoField.OFFSET_SECONDS

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisOffsetDateTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisOffsetDateTime);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

OffsetDateTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date-time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
using

startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

OffsetDateTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the offset differs between the two date-times, the specified
end date-time is normalized to have the same offset as this date-time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two date-times.
For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

,

DAYS

,

WEEKS

,

MONTHS

,

YEARS

,

DECADES

,

CENTURIES

,

MILLENNIA

and

ERAS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** until

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** endExclusive

- the end date, exclusive, which is converted to an

OffsetDateTime

, not null
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null
**Returns:** the amount of time between this date-time and the end date-time
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to an

OffsetDateTime
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- format

```java
public
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Formats this date-time using the specified formatter.

This date-time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the formatted date-time string, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

- atZoneSameInstant

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
atZoneSameInstant​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Combines this date-time with a time-zone to create a

ZonedDateTime

ensuring that the result has the same instant.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time and the specified time-zone.
This conversion will ignore the visible local date-time and use the underlying instant instead.
This avoids any problems with local time-line gaps or overlaps.
The result might have different values for fields such as hour, minute an even day.

To attempt to retain the values of the fields, use

atZoneSimilarLocal(ZoneId)

.
To use the offset as the zone ID, use

toZonedDateTime()

.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to use, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time formed from this date-time, not null

- atZoneSimilarLocal

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
atZoneSimilarLocal​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Combines this date-time with a time-zone to create a

ZonedDateTime

trying to keep the same local date and time.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time and the specified time-zone.
Where possible, the result will have the same local date-time as this object.

Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every time on the
local time-line exists. If the local date-time is in a gap or overlap according to
the rules then a resolver is used to determine the resultant local time and offset.
This method uses

ZonedDateTime.ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)

to retain the offset from this instance if possible.

Finer control over gaps and overlaps is available in two ways.
If you simply want to use the later offset at overlaps then call

ZonedDateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

immediately after this method.

To create a zoned date-time at the same instant irrespective of the local time-line,
use

atZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

.
To use the offset as the zone ID, use

toZonedDateTime()

.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to use, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time formed from this date and the earliest valid time for the zone, not null

- toOffsetTime

```java
public
OffsetTime
toOffsetTime()
```

Converts this date-time to an

OffsetTime

.

This returns an offset time with the same local time and offset.

**Returns:** an OffsetTime representing the time and offset, not null

- toZonedDateTime

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
toZonedDateTime()
```

Converts this date-time to a

ZonedDateTime

using the offset as the zone ID.

This creates the simplest possible

ZonedDateTime

using the offset
as the zone ID.

To control the time-zone used, see

atZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

and

atZoneSimilarLocal(ZoneId)

.

**Returns:** a zoned date-time representing the same local date-time and offset, not null

- toInstant

```java
public
Instant
toInstant()
```

Converts this date-time to an

Instant

.

This returns an

Instant

representing the same point on the
time-line as this date-time.

**Returns:** an

Instant

representing the same instant, not null

- toEpochSecond

```java
public long toEpochSecond()
```

Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This allows this date-time to be converted to a value of the

epoch-seconds

field. This is primarily
intended for low-level conversions rather than general application usage.

**Returns:** the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
OffsetDateTime
other)
```

Compares this date-time to another date-time.

The comparison is based on the instant then on the local date-time.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2008-12-03T10:30+01:00
- 2008-12-03T11:00+01:00
- 2008-12-03T12:00+02:00
- 2008-12-03T11:30+01:00
- 2008-12-03T12:00+01:00
- 2008-12-03T12:30+01:00

Values #2 and #3 represent the same instant on the time-line.
When two values represent the same instant, the local date-time is compared
to distinguish them. This step is needed to make the ordering
consistent with

equals()

.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

OffsetDateTime

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

- isAfter

```java
public boolean isAfter​(
OffsetDateTime
other)
```

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it
only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().isAfter(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is after the instant of the specified date-time

- isBefore

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using

dateTime1.toInstant().equals(dateTime2.toInstant());

.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if the instant equals the instant of the specified date-time

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Checks if this date-time is equal to another date-time.

The comparison is based on the local date-time and the offset.
To compare for the same instant on the time-line, use

isEqual(java.time.OffsetDateTime)

.
Only objects of type

OffsetDateTime

are compared, other types return false.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the object to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if this is equal to the other date-time
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
Key date-time classes also implement the

TemporalAdjuster

interface,
such as

Month

and

MonthDay

.
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:

```java
import static java.time.Month.*;
import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

result = offsetDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
```

The classes

LocalDate

implement

TemporalAdjuster

, thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:

```java
result = offsetDateTime.with(date);
result = offsetDateTime.with(time);
result = offsetDateTime.with(offset);
```

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

method on the
specified adjuster passing

this

as the argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** with

until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

OffsetDateTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified date-time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
using

startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

OffsetDateTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the offset differs between the two date-times, the specified
end date-time is normalized to have the same offset as this date-time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two date-times.
For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.

The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent

ZonedDateTime

trying to keep the same local date and time.

This returns a

ZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time and the specified time-zone.
Where possible, the result will have the same local date-time as this object.

Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every time on the
local time-line exists. If the local date-time is in a gap or overlap according to
the rules then a resolver is used to determine the resultant local time and offset.
This method uses

ZonedDateTime.ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)

to retain the offset from this instance if possible.

Finer control over gaps and overlaps is available in two ways.
If you simply want to use the later offset at overlaps then call

ZonedDateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

immediately after this method.

To create a zoned date-time at the same instant irrespective of the local time-line,
use

atZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)

.
To use the offset as the zone ID, use
