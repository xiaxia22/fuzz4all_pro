# Class AbstractPreferences

**Source:** `java.prefs\java\util\prefs\AbstractPreferences.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
AbstractPreferences

extends
Preferences
```

This class provides a skeletal implementation of the

Preferences

class, greatly easing the task of implementing it.

This class is for

Preferences

implementers only.
Normal users of the

Preferences

facility should have no need to
consult this documentation. The

Preferences

documentation
should suffice.

Implementors must override the nine abstract service-provider interface
(SPI) methods:

getSpi(String)

,

putSpi(String,String)

,

removeSpi(String)

,

childSpi(String)

,

removeNodeSpi()

,

keysSpi()

,

childrenNamesSpi()

,

syncSpi()

and

flushSpi()

. All of the concrete methods specify
precisely how they are implemented atop these SPI methods. The implementor
may, at his discretion, override one or more of the concrete methods if the
default implementation is unsatisfactory for any reason, such as
performance.

The SPI methods fall into three groups concerning exception
behavior. The

getSpi

method should never throw exceptions, but it
doesn't really matter, as any exception thrown by this method will be
intercepted by

get(String,String)

, which will return the specified
default value to the caller. The

removeNodeSpi, keysSpi,
childrenNamesSpi, syncSpi

and

flushSpi

methods are specified
to throw

BackingStoreException

, and the implementation is required
to throw this checked exception if it is unable to perform the operation.
The exception propagates outward, causing the corresponding API method
to fail.

The remaining SPI methods

putSpi(String,String)

,

removeSpi(String)

and

childSpi(String)

have more complicated
exception behavior. They are not specified to throw

BackingStoreException

, as they can generally obey their contracts
even if the backing store is unavailable. This is true because they return
no information and their effects are not required to become permanent until
a subsequent call to

Preferences.flush()

or

Preferences.sync()

. Generally speaking, these SPI methods should not
throw exceptions. In some implementations, there may be circumstances
under which these calls cannot even enqueue the requested operation for
later processing. Even under these circumstances it is generally better to
simply ignore the invocation and return, rather than throwing an
exception. Under these circumstances, however, subsequently invoking

flush()

or

sync

would not imply that all previous
operations had successfully been made permanent.

There is one circumstance under which

putSpi, removeSpi and
childSpi

should

throw an exception: if the caller lacks
sufficient privileges on the underlying operating system to perform the
requested operation. This will, for instance, occur on most systems
if a non-privileged user attempts to modify system preferences.
(The required privileges will vary from implementation to
implementation. On some implementations, they are the right to modify the
contents of some directory in the file system; on others they are the right
to modify contents of some key in a registry.) Under any of these
circumstances, it would generally be undesirable to let the program
continue executing as if these operations would become permanent at a later
time. While implementations are not required to throw an exception under
these circumstances, they are encouraged to do so. A

SecurityException

would be appropriate.

Most of the SPI methods require the implementation to read or write
information at a preferences node. The implementor should beware of the
fact that another VM may have concurrently deleted this node from the
backing store. It is the implementation's responsibility to recreate the
node if it has been deleted.

Implementation note: In Sun's default

Preferences

implementations, the user's identity is inherited from the underlying
operating system and does not change for the lifetime of the virtual
machine. It is recognized that server-side

Preferences

implementations may have the user identity change from request to request,
implicitly passed to

Preferences

methods via the use of a
static

ThreadLocal

instance. Authors of such implementations are

strongly

encouraged to determine the user at the time preferences
are accessed (for example by the

get(String,String)

or

put(String,String)

method) rather than permanently associating a user
with each

Preferences

instance. The latter behavior conflicts
with normal

Preferences

usage and would lead to great confusion.

### Field Details

#### protected boolean newNode

This field should be

true

if this node did not exist in the
backing store prior to the creation of this object. The field
is initialized to false, but may be set to true by a subclass
constructor (and should not be modified thereafter). This field
indicates whether a node change event should be fired when
creation is complete.

---

#### protected final
Object
lock

An object whose monitor is used to lock this node. This object
is used in preference to the node itself to reduce the likelihood of
intentional or unintentional denial of service due to a locked node.
To avoid deadlock, a node is

never

locked by a thread that
holds a lock on a descendant of that node.

---

### Constructor Details

#### protected AbstractPreferences​(
AbstractPreferences
parent,

String
name)

Creates a preference node with the specified parent and the specified
name relative to its parent.

**Parameters:**
- parent

- the parent of this preference node, or null if this
is the root.
- name

- the name of this preference node, relative to its parent,
or

""

if this is the root.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

name

contains a slash
(

'/'

), or

parent

is

null

and
name isn't

""

.

keysSpi()

.

**Specified by:**
- keys

in class

Preferences

**Returns:**
- an array of the keys that have an associated value in this

---

#### public
String
[] childrenNames()
throws
BackingStoreException

Implements the

children

method as per the specification in

Preferences.childrenNames()

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, checks that
the node has not been removed, constructs a

TreeSet

initialized
to the names of children already cached (the children in this node's
"child-cache"), invokes

childrenNamesSpi()

, and adds all of the
returned child-names into the set. The elements of the tree set are
dumped into a

String

array using the

toArray

method,
and this array is returned.

**Specified by:**
- childrenNames

in class

Preferences

**Returns:**
- the names of the children of this preference node.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

**See Also:**
- cachedChildren()

---

#### protected final
AbstractPreferences
[] cachedChildren()

Returns all known unremoved children of this node.

**Returns:**
- all known unremoved children of this node.

---

#### public
Preferences
parent()

Implements the

parent

method as per the specification in

Preferences.parent()

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, checks that
the node has not been removed and returns the parent value that was
passed to this node's constructor.

**Specified by:**
- parent

in class

Preferences

**Returns:**
- the parent of this preference node.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

---

#### public
Preferences
node​(
String
path)

Implements the

node

method as per the specification in

Preferences.node(String)

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock and checks
that the node has not been removed. If

path

is

""

,
this node is returned; if

path

is

"/"

, this node's
root is returned. If the first character in

path

is
not

'/'

, the implementation breaks

path

into
tokens and recursively traverses the path from this node to the
named node, "consuming" a name and a slash from

path

at
each step of the traversal. At each step, the current node is locked
and the node's child-cache is checked for the named node. If it is
not found, the name is checked to make sure its length does not
exceed

MAX_NAME_LENGTH

. Then the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked, and the result stored in this node's child-cache.
If the newly created

Preferences

object's

newNode

field is

true

and there are any node change listeners,
a notification event is enqueued for processing by the event dispatch
thread.

When there are no more tokens, the last value found in the
child-cache or returned by

childSpi

is returned by this
method. If during the traversal, two

"/"

tokens occur
consecutively, or the final token is

"/"

(rather than a name),
an appropriate

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

If the first character of

path

is

'/'

(indicating an absolute path name) this preference node's
lock is dropped prior to breaking

path

into tokens, and
this method recursively traverses the path starting from the root
(rather than starting from this node). The traversal is otherwise
identical to the one described for relative path names. Dropping
the lock on this node prior to commencing the traversal at the root
node is essential to avoid the possibility of deadlock, as per the

locking invariant

.

**Specified by:**
- node

in class

Preferences

**Parameters:**
- path

- the path name of the preference node to return.

**Returns:**
- the specified preference node.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

#### public boolean nodeExists​(
String
path)
throws
BackingStoreException

Implements the

nodeExists

method as per the specification in

removed with the

removeNode()

method and

pathname

is not the empty string (

""

).

---

#### public void removeNode()
throws
BackingStoreException

Implements the

removeNode()

method as per the specification in

Preferences.removeNode()

.

This implementation checks to see that this node is the root; if so,
it throws an appropriate exception. Then, it locks this node's parent,
and calls a recursive helper method that traverses the subtree rooted at
this node. The recursive method locks the node on which it was called,
checks that it has not already been removed, and then ensures that all
of its children are cached: The

childrenNamesSpi()

method is
invoked and each returned child name is checked for containment in the
child-cache. If a child is not already cached, the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked to create a

Preferences

instance for it, and this instance is put into the child-cache. Then
the helper method calls itself recursively on each node contained in its
child-cache. Next, it invokes

removeNodeSpi()

, marks itself
as removed, and removes itself from its parent's child-cache. Finally,
if there are any node change listeners, it enqueues a notification
event for processing by the event dispatch thread.

Note that the helper method is always invoked with all ancestors up
to the "closest non-removed ancestor" locked.

**Specified by:**
- removeNode

in class

Preferences

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has already
been removed with the

removeNode()

method.
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if this method is invoked on
the root node.
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

#### public
String
name()

Implements the

name

method as per the specification in

Preferences.name()

.

This implementation merely returns the name that was
passed to this node's constructor.

**Specified by:**
- name

in class

Preferences

**Returns:**
- this preference node's name, relative to its parent.

---

#### public
String
absolutePath()

Implements the

absolutePath

method as per the specification in

Preferences.absolutePath()

.

This implementation merely returns the absolute path name that
was computed at the time that this node was constructed (based on
the name that was passed to this node's constructor, and the names
that were passed to this node's ancestors' constructors).

**Specified by:**
- absolutePath

in class

Preferences

**Returns:**
- this preference node's absolute path name.

---

#### public boolean isUserNode()

Implements the

isUserNode

method as per the specification in

Preferences.isUserNode()

.

This implementation compares this node's root node (which is stored
in a private field) with the value returned by

Preferences.userRoot()

. If the two object references are
identical, this method returns true.

**Specified by:**
- isUserNode

in class

Preferences

**Returns:**
- true

if this preference node is in the user
preference tree,

false

if it's in the system
preference tree.

---

#### protected abstract void putSpi​(
String
key,

String
value)

Put the given key-value association into this preference node. It is
guaranteed that

key

and

value

are non-null and of
legal length. Also, it is guaranteed that this node has not been
removed. (The implementor needn't check for any of these things.)

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:**
- key

- the key
- value

- the value

---

#### protected abstract
String
getSpi​(
String
key)

Return the value associated with the specified key at this preference
node, or

null

if there is no association for this key, or the
association cannot be determined at this time. It is guaranteed that

key

is non-null. Also, it is guaranteed that this node has
not been removed. (The implementor needn't check for either of these
things.)

Generally speaking, this method should not throw an exception
under any circumstances. If, however, if it does throw an exception,
the exception will be intercepted and treated as a

null

return value.

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:**
- key

- the key

**Returns:**
- the value associated with the specified key at this preference
node, or

null

if there is no association for this
key, or the association cannot be determined at this time.

---

#### protected abstract void removeSpi​(
String
key)

Remove the association (if any) for the specified key at this
preference node. It is guaranteed that

key

is non-null.
Also, it is guaranteed that this node has not been removed.
(The implementor needn't check for either of these things.)

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:**
- key

- the key

---

#### protected abstract void removeNodeSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException

Removes this preference node, invalidating it and any preferences that
it contains. The named child will have no descendants at the time this
invocation is made (i.e., the

Preferences.removeNode()

method
invokes this method repeatedly in a bottom-up fashion, removing each of
a node's descendants before removing the node itself).

This method is invoked with the lock held on this node and its
parent (and all ancestors that are being removed as a
result of a single invocation to

Preferences.removeNode()

).

The removal of a node needn't become persistent until the

flush

method is invoked on this node (or an ancestor).

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

removeNode()

invocation.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

---

#### protected abstract
String
[] keysSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException

Returns all of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node. (The returned array will be of size zero if
this node has no preferences.) It is guaranteed that this node has not
been removed.

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

keys()

invocation.

**Returns:**
- an array of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

---

#### protected abstract
String
[] childrenNamesSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException

Returns the names of the children of this preference node. (The
returned array will be of size zero if this node has no children.)
This method need not return the names of any nodes already cached,
but may do so without harm.

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

childrenNames()

invocation.

**Returns:**
- an array containing the names of the children of this
preference node.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

---

#### protected
AbstractPreferences
getChild​(
String
nodeName)
throws
BackingStoreException

Returns the named child if it exists, or

null

if it does not.
It is guaranteed that

nodeName

is non-null, non-empty,
does not contain the slash character ('/'), and is no longer than

Preferences.MAX_NAME_LENGTH

characters. Also, it is guaranteed
that this node has not been removed. (The implementor needn't check
for any of these things if he chooses to override this method.)

Finally, it is guaranteed that the named node has not been returned
by a previous invocation of this method or

childSpi(java.lang.String)

after the
last time that it was removed. In other words, a cached value will
always be used in preference to invoking this method. (The implementor
needn't maintain his own cache of previously returned children if he
chooses to override this method.)

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, invokes

childrenNames()

to get an array of the names of this node's
children, and iterates over the array comparing the name of each child
with the specified node name. If a child node has the correct name,
the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked and the resulting
node is returned. If the iteration completes without finding the
specified name,

null

is returned.

**Parameters:**
- nodeName

- name of the child to be searched for.

**Returns:**
- the named child if it exists, or null if it does not.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

---

#### protected abstract
AbstractPreferences
childSpi​(
String
name)

Returns the named child of this preference node, creating it if it does
not already exist. It is guaranteed that

name

is non-null,
non-empty, does not contain the slash character ('/'), and is no longer
than

Preferences.MAX_NAME_LENGTH

characters. Also, it is guaranteed that
this node has not been removed. (The implementor needn't check for any
of these things.)

Finally, it is guaranteed that the named node has not been returned
by a previous invocation of this method or

getChild(String)

after the last time that it was removed. In other words, a cached
value will always be used in preference to invoking this method.
Subclasses need not maintain their own cache of previously returned
children.

The implementer must ensure that the returned node has not been
removed. If a like-named child of this node was previously removed, the
implementer must return a newly constructed

AbstractPreferences

node; once removed, an

AbstractPreferences

node
cannot be "resuscitated."

If this method causes a node to be created, this node is not
guaranteed to be persistent until the

flush

method is
invoked on this node or one of its ancestors (or descendants).

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the child node to return, relative to
this preference node.

**Returns:**
- The named child node.

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns the absolute path name of this preferences node.

**Specified by:**
- toString

in class

Preferences

**Returns:**
- a string representation of the object.

---

#### public void sync()
throws
BackingStoreException

Implements the

sync

method as per the specification in

Preferences.sync()

.

This implementation calls a recursive helper method that locks this
node, invokes syncSpi() on it, unlocks this node, and recursively
invokes this method on each "cached child." A cached child is a child
of this node that has been created in this VM and not subsequently
removed. In effect, this method does a depth first traversal of the
"cached subtree" rooted at this node, calling syncSpi() on each node in
the subTree while only that node is locked. Note that syncSpi() is
invoked top-down.

**Specified by:**
- sync

in class

Preferences

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
- IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

**See Also:**
- flush()

---

#### protected abstract void syncSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException

This method is invoked with this node locked. The contract of this
method is to synchronize any cached preferences stored at this node
with any stored in the backing store. (It is perfectly possible that
this node does not exist on the backing store, either because it has
been deleted by another VM, or because it has not yet been created.)
Note that this method should

not

synchronize the preferences in
any subnodes of this node. If the backing store naturally syncs an
entire subtree at once, the implementer is encouraged to override
sync(), rather than merely overriding this method.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

sync()

invocation.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

---

#### public void flush()
throws
BackingStoreException

Implements the

flush

method as per the specification in

Preferences.flush()

.

This implementation calls a recursive helper method that locks this
node, invokes flushSpi() on it, unlocks this node, and recursively
invokes this method on each "cached child." A cached child is a child
of this node that has been created in this VM and not subsequently
removed. In effect, this method does a depth first traversal of the
"cached subtree" rooted at this node, calling flushSpi() on each node in
the subTree while only that node is locked. Note that flushSpi() is
invoked top-down.

If this method is invoked on a node that has been removed with
the

removeNode()

method, flushSpi() is invoked on this node,
but not on others.

**Specified by:**
- flush

in class

Preferences

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

**See Also:**
- flush()

---

#### protected abstract void flushSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException

This method is invoked with this node locked. The contract of this
method is to force any cached changes in the contents of this
preference node to the backing store, guaranteeing their persistence.
(It is perfectly possible that this node does not exist on the backing
store, either because it has been deleted by another VM, or because it
has not yet been created.) Note that this method should

not

flush the preferences in any subnodes of this node. If the backing
store naturally flushes an entire subtree at once, the implementer is
encouraged to override flush(), rather than merely overriding this
method.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

flush()

invocation.

**Throws:**
- BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

---

#### protected boolean isRemoved()

Returns

true

iff this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method. This method
locks this node prior to returning the contents of the private
field used to track this state.

**Returns:**
- true

iff this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

---

#### public void exportNode​(
OutputStream
os)
throws
IOException
,

BackingStoreException

Implements the

exportNode

method as per the specification in

Preferences.exportNode(OutputStream)

.

**Specified by:**
- exportNode

in class

Preferences

**Parameters:**
- os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

IOException

.
- BackingStoreException

- if preference data cannot be read from
backing store.

**See Also:**
- Preferences.importPreferences(InputStream)

BackingStoreException

Implements the

exportSubtree

method as per the specification in

Preferences.exportSubtree(OutputStream)

.

**Specified by:**
- exportSubtree

in class

Preferences

**Parameters:**
- os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

IOException

.

```java
public abstract class
AbstractPreferences

extends
Preferences
```

This class provides a skeletal implementation of the

Preferences

class, greatly easing the task of implementing it.

This class is for

Preferences

implementers only.
Normal users of the

Preferences

facility should have no need to
consult this documentation. The

Preferences

documentation
should suffice.

Implementors must override the nine abstract service-provider interface
(SPI) methods:

getSpi(String)

,

putSpi(String,String)

,

removeSpi(String)

,

childSpi(String)

,

removeNodeSpi()

,

keysSpi()

,

childrenNamesSpi()

,

syncSpi()

and

flushSpi()

. All of the concrete methods specify
precisely how they are implemented atop these SPI methods. The implementor
may, at his discretion, override one or more of the concrete methods if the
default implementation is unsatisfactory for any reason, such as
performance.

The SPI methods fall into three groups concerning exception
behavior. The

getSpi

method should never throw exceptions, but it
doesn't really matter, as any exception thrown by this method will be
intercepted by

get(String,String)

, which will return the specified
default value to the caller. The

removeNodeSpi, keysSpi,
childrenNamesSpi, syncSpi

and

flushSpi

methods are specified
to throw

BackingStoreException

, and the implementation is required
to throw this checked exception if it is unable to perform the operation.
The exception propagates outward, causing the corresponding API method
to fail.

The remaining SPI methods

putSpi(String,String)

,

removeSpi(String)

and

childSpi(String)

have more complicated
exception behavior. They are not specified to throw

BackingStoreException

, as they can generally obey their contracts
even if the backing store is unavailable. This is true because they return
no information and their effects are not required to become permanent until
a subsequent call to

Preferences.flush()

or

Preferences.sync()

. Generally speaking, these SPI methods should not
throw exceptions. In some implementations, there may be circumstances
under which these calls cannot even enqueue the requested operation for
later processing. Even under these circumstances it is generally better to
simply ignore the invocation and return, rather than throwing an
exception. Under these circumstances, however, subsequently invoking

flush()

or

sync

would not imply that all previous
operations had successfully been made permanent.

There is one circumstance under which

putSpi, removeSpi and
childSpi

should

throw an exception: if the caller lacks
sufficient privileges on the underlying operating system to perform the
requested operation. This will, for instance, occur on most systems
if a non-privileged user attempts to modify system preferences.
(The required privileges will vary from implementation to
implementation. On some implementations, they are the right to modify the
contents of some directory in the file system; on others they are the right
to modify contents of some key in a registry.) Under any of these
circumstances, it would generally be undesirable to let the program
continue executing as if these operations would become permanent at a later
time. While implementations are not required to throw an exception under
these circumstances, they are encouraged to do so. A

SecurityException

would be appropriate.

Most of the SPI methods require the implementation to read or write
information at a preferences node. The implementor should beware of the
fact that another VM may have concurrently deleted this node from the
backing store. It is the implementation's responsibility to recreate the
node if it has been deleted.

Implementation note: In Sun's default

Preferences

implementations, the user's identity is inherited from the underlying
operating system and does not change for the lifetime of the virtual
machine. It is recognized that server-side

Preferences

implementations may have the user identity change from request to request,
implicitly passed to

Preferences

methods via the use of a
static

ThreadLocal

instance. Authors of such implementations are

strongly

encouraged to determine the user at the time preferences
are accessed (for example by the

get(String,String)

or

put(String,String)

method) rather than permanently associating a user
with each

Preferences

instance. The latter behavior conflicts
with normal

Preferences

usage and would lead to great confusion.

if a non-privileged user attempts to modify system preferences.
(The required privileges will vary from implementation to
implementation. On some implementations, they are the right to modify the
contents of some directory in the file system; on others they are the right
to modify contents of some key in a registry.) Under any of these
circumstances, it would generally be undesirable to let the program
continue executing as if these operations would become permanent at a later
time. While implementations are not required to throw an exception under
these circumstances, they are encouraged to do so. A

SecurityException

would be appropriate.

Most of the SPI methods require the implementation to read or write
information at a preferences node. The implementor should beware of the
fact that another VM may have concurrently deleted this node from the
backing store. It is the implementation's responsibility to recreate the
node if it has been deleted.

Implementation note: In Sun's default

Preferences

implementations, the user's identity is inherited from the underlying
operating system and does not change for the lifetime of the virtual
machine. It is recognized that server-side

Preferences

implementations may have the user identity change from request to request,
implicitly passed to

Preferences

methods via the use of a
static

ThreadLocal

instance. Authors of such implementations are

strongly

encouraged to determine the user at the time preferences
are accessed (for example by the

get(String,String)

or

put(String,String)

method) rather than permanently associating a user
with each

Preferences

instance. The latter behavior conflicts
with normal

Preferences

usage and would lead to great confusion.

The SPI methods fall into three groups concerning exception
behavior. The

getSpi

method should never throw exceptions, but it
doesn't really matter, as any exception thrown by this method will be
intercepted by

get(String,String)

, which will return the specified
default value to the caller. The

removeNodeSpi, keysSpi,
childrenNamesSpi, syncSpi

and

flushSpi

methods are specified
to throw

BackingStoreException

, and the implementation is required
to throw this checked exception if it is unable to perform the operation.
The exception propagates outward, causing the corresponding API method
to fail.

The remaining SPI methods

putSpi(String,String)

,

removeSpi(String)

and

childSpi(String)

have more complicated
exception behavior. They are not specified to throw

BackingStoreException

, as they can generally obey their contracts
even if the backing store is unavailable. This is true because they return
no information and their effects are not required to become permanent until
a subsequent call to

Preferences.flush()

or

Preferences.sync()

. Generally speaking, these SPI methods should not
throw exceptions. In some implementations, there may be circumstances
under which these calls cannot even enqueue the requested operation for
later processing. Even under these circumstances it is generally better to
simply ignore the invocation and return, rather than throwing an
exception. Under these circumstances, however, subsequently invoking

flush()

or

sync

would not imply that all previous
operations had successfully been made permanent.

There is one circumstance under which

putSpi, removeSpi and
childSpi

should

throw an exception: if the caller lacks
sufficient privileges on the underlying operating system to perform the
requested operation. This will, for instance, occur on most systems
if a non-privileged user attempts to modify system preferences.
(The required privileges will vary from implementation to
implementation. On some implementations, they are the right to modify the

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- newNode

```java
protected boolean newNode
```

This field should be

true

if this node did not exist in the
backing store prior to the creation of this object. The field
is initialized to false, but may be set to true by a subclass
constructor (and should not be modified thereafter). This field
indicates whether a node change event should be fired when
creation is complete.

- lock

```java
protected final
Object
lock
```

An object whose monitor is used to lock this node. This object
is used in preference to the node itself to reduce the likelihood of
intentional or unintentional denial of service due to a locked node.
To avoid deadlock, a node is

never

locked by a thread that
holds a lock on a descendant of that node.

- keys

```java
public
String
[] keys()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

keys

method as per the specification in

Preferences.keys()

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, checks that
the node has not been removed and invokes

keysSpi()

.

**Specified by:** keys

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** an array of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- childrenNames

```java
public
String
[] childrenNames()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

children

method as per the specification in

Preferences.childrenNames()

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, checks that
the node has not been removed, constructs a

TreeSet

initialized
to the names of children already cached (the children in this node's
"child-cache"), invokes

childrenNamesSpi()

, and adds all of the
returned child-names into the set. The elements of the tree set are
dumped into a

String

array using the

toArray

method,
and this array is returned.

**Specified by:** childrenNames

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** the names of the children of this preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** cachedChildren()

- cachedChildren

```java
protected final
AbstractPreferences
[] cachedChildren()
```

Returns all known unremoved children of this node.

**Returns:** all known unremoved children of this node.

- parent

```java
public
Preferences
parent()
```

Implements the

parent

method as per the specification in

Preferences.parent()

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, checks that
the node has not been removed and returns the parent value that was
passed to this node's constructor.

**Specified by:** parent

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** the parent of this preference node.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- node

```java
public
Preferences
node​(
String
path)
```

Implements the

node

method as per the specification in

Preferences.node(String)

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock and checks
that the node has not been removed. If

path

is

""

,
this node is returned; if

path

is

"/"

, this node's
root is returned. If the first character in

path

is
not

'/'

, the implementation breaks

path

into
tokens and recursively traverses the path from this node to the
named node, "consuming" a name and a slash from

path

at
each step of the traversal. At each step, the current node is locked
and the node's child-cache is checked for the named node. If it is
not found, the name is checked to make sure its length does not
exceed

MAX_NAME_LENGTH

. Then the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked, and the result stored in this node's child-cache.
If the newly created

Preferences

object's

newNode

field is

true

and there are any node change listeners,
a notification event is enqueued for processing by the event dispatch
thread.

When there are no more tokens, the last value found in the
child-cache or returned by

childSpi

is returned by this
method. If during the traversal, two

"/"

tokens occur
consecutively, or the final token is

"/"

(rather than a name),
an appropriate

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

If the first character of

path

is

'/'

(indicating an absolute path name) this preference node's
lock is dropped prior to breaking

path

into tokens, and
this method recursively traverses the path starting from the root
(rather than starting from this node). The traversal is otherwise
identical to the one described for relative path names. Dropping
the lock on this node prior to commencing the traversal at the root
node is essential to avoid the possibility of deadlock, as per the

locking invariant

.

**Specified by:** node

in class

Preferences
**Parameters:** path

- the path name of the preference node to return.
**Returns:** the specified preference node.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** Preferences.flush()

- nodeExists

```java
public boolean nodeExists​(
String
path)
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

nodeExists

method as per the specification in

Preferences.nodeExists(String)

.

This implementation is very similar to

node(String)

,
except that

getChild(String)

is used instead of

childSpi(String)

.

**Specified by:** nodeExists

in class

Preferences
**Parameters:** path

- the path name of the node whose existence is to be checked.
**Returns:** true if the specified node exists.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method and

pathname

is not the empty string (

""

).

- removeNode

```java
public void removeNode()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

removeNode()

method as per the specification in

Preferences.removeNode()

.

This implementation checks to see that this node is the root; if so,
it throws an appropriate exception. Then, it locks this node's parent,
and calls a recursive helper method that traverses the subtree rooted at
this node. The recursive method locks the node on which it was called,
checks that it has not already been removed, and then ensures that all
of its children are cached: The

childrenNamesSpi()

method is
invoked and each returned child name is checked for containment in the
child-cache. If a child is not already cached, the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked to create a

Preferences

instance for it, and this instance is put into the child-cache. Then
the helper method calls itself recursively on each node contained in its
child-cache. Next, it invokes

removeNodeSpi()

, marks itself
as removed, and removes itself from its parent's child-cache. Finally,
if there are any node change listeners, it enqueues a notification
event for processing by the event dispatch thread.

Note that the helper method is always invoked with all ancestors up
to the "closest non-removed ancestor" locked.

**Specified by:** removeNode

in class

Preferences
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has already
been removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this method is invoked on
the root node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- absolutePath

```java
public
String
absolutePath()
```

was computed at the time that this node was constructed (based on
the name that was passed to this node's constructor, and the names
that were passed to this node's ancestors' constructors).

public boolean isUserNode()
```

Implements the

isUserNode

method as per the specification in

Preferences.isUserNode()

.

This implementation compares this node's root node (which is stored
in a private field) with the value returned by

Preferences.userRoot()

. If the two object references are
identical, this method returns true.

**Specified by:** isUserNode

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** true

if this preference node is in the user
preference tree,

false

if it's in the system
preference tree.

- putSpi

```java
protected abstract void putSpi​(
String
key,

String
value)
```

Put the given key-value association into this preference node. It is
guaranteed that

key

and

value

are non-null and of
legal length. Also, it is guaranteed that this node has not been
removed. (The implementor needn't check for any of these things.)

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:** key

- the key
**Parameters:** value

- the value

- getSpi

```java
protected abstract
String
getSpi​(
String
key)
```

Return the value associated with the specified key at this preference
node, or

null

if there is no association for this key, or the
association cannot be determined at this time. It is guaranteed that

key

is non-null. Also, it is guaranteed that this node has
not been removed. (The implementor needn't check for either of these
things.)

Generally speaking, this method should not throw an exception
under any circumstances. If, however, if it does throw an exception,
the exception will be intercepted and treated as a

null

return value.

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:** key

- the key
**Returns:** the value associated with the specified key at this preference
node, or

null

if there is no association for this
key, or the association cannot be determined at this time.

- removeSpi

```java
protected abstract void removeSpi​(
String
key)
```

Remove the association (if any) for the specified key at this
preference node. It is guaranteed that

key

is non-null.
Also, it is guaranteed that this node has not been removed.
(The implementor needn't check for either of these things.)

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:** key

- the key

- removeNodeSpi

```java
protected abstract void removeNodeSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Removes this preference node, invalidating it and any preferences that
it contains. The named child will have no descendants at the time this
invocation is made (i.e., the

Preferences.removeNode()

method
invokes this method repeatedly in a bottom-up fashion, removing each of
a node's descendants before removing the node itself).

This method is invoked with the lock held on this node and its
parent (and all ancestors that are being removed as a
result of a single invocation to

Preferences.removeNode()

).

The removal of a node needn't become persistent until the

flush

method is invoked on this node (or an ancestor).

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

removeNode()

invocation.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- keysSpi

```java
protected abstract
String
[] keysSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Returns all of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node. (The returned array will be of size zero if
this node has no preferences.) It is guaranteed that this node has not
been removed.

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

keys()

invocation.

**Returns:** an array of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- childrenNamesSpi

```java
protected abstract
String
[] childrenNamesSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Returns the names of the children of this preference node. (The
returned array will be of size zero if this node has no children.)
This method need not return the names of any nodes already cached,
but may do so without harm.

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

childrenNames()

invocation.

**Returns:** an array containing the names of the children of this
preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- getChild

```java
protected
AbstractPreferences
getChild​(
String
nodeName)
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Returns the named child if it exists, or

null

if it does not.
It is guaranteed that

nodeName

is non-null, non-empty,
does not contain the slash character ('/'), and is no longer than

Preferences.MAX_NAME_LENGTH

characters. Also, it is guaranteed
that this node has not been removed. (The implementor needn't check
for any of these things if he chooses to override this method.)

Finally, it is guaranteed that the named node has not been returned
by a previous invocation of this method or

childSpi(java.lang.String)

after the
last time that it was removed. In other words, a cached value will
always be used in preference to invoking this method. (The implementor
needn't maintain his own cache of previously returned children if he
chooses to override this method.)

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, invokes

childrenNames()

to get an array of the names of this node's
children, and iterates over the array comparing the name of each child
with the specified node name. If a child node has the correct name,
the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked and the resulting
node is returned. If the iteration completes without finding the
specified name,

null

is returned.

**Parameters:** nodeName

- name of the child to be searched for.
**Returns:** the named child if it exists, or null if it does not.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- childSpi

```java
protected abstract
AbstractPreferences
childSpi​(
String
name)
```

Returns the named child of this preference node, creating it if it does
not already exist. It is guaranteed that

name

is non-null,
non-empty, does not contain the slash character ('/'), and is no longer
than

Preferences.MAX_NAME_LENGTH

characters. Also, it is guaranteed that
this node has not been removed. (The implementor needn't check for any
of these things.)

Finally, it is guaranteed that the named node has not been returned
by a previous invocation of this method or

getChild(String)

after the last time that it was removed. In other words, a cached
value will always be used in preference to invoking this method.
Subclasses need not maintain their own cache of previously returned
children.

The implementer must ensure that the returned node has not been
removed. If a like-named child of this node was previously removed, the
implementer must return a newly constructed

AbstractPreferences

node; once removed, an

AbstractPreferences

node
cannot be "resuscitated."

If this method causes a node to be created, this node is not
guaranteed to be persistent until the

flush

method is
invoked on this node or one of its ancestors (or descendants).

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the child node to return, relative to
this preference node.
**Returns:** The named child node.

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the absolute path name of this preferences node.

**Specified by:** toString

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** a string representation of the object.

- sync

```java
public void sync()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

sync

method as per the specification in

Preferences.sync()

.

This implementation calls a recursive helper method that locks this
node, invokes syncSpi() on it, unlocks this node, and recursively
invokes this method on each "cached child." A cached child is a child
of this node that has been created in this VM and not subsequently
removed. In effect, this method does a depth first traversal of the
"cached subtree" rooted at this node, calling syncSpi() on each node in
the subTree while only that node is locked. Note that syncSpi() is
invoked top-down.

**Specified by:** sync

in class

Preferences
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** flush()

- syncSpi

```java
protected abstract void syncSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

This method is invoked with this node locked. The contract of this
method is to synchronize any cached preferences stored at this node
with any stored in the backing store. (It is perfectly possible that
this node does not exist on the backing store, either because it has
been deleted by another VM, or because it has not yet been created.)
Note that this method should

not

synchronize the preferences in
any subnodes of this node. If the backing store naturally syncs an
entire subtree at once, the implementer is encouraged to override
sync(), rather than merely overriding this method.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

sync()

invocation.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- flush

```java
public void flush()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

flush

method as per the specification in

Preferences.flush()

.

This implementation calls a recursive helper method that locks this
node, invokes flushSpi() on it, unlocks this node, and recursively
invokes this method on each "cached child." A cached child is a child
of this node that has been created in this VM and not subsequently
removed. In effect, this method does a depth first traversal of the
"cached subtree" rooted at this node, calling flushSpi() on each node in
the subTree while only that node is locked. Note that flushSpi() is
invoked top-down.

If this method is invoked on a node that has been removed with
the

removeNode()

method, flushSpi() is invoked on this node,
but not on others.

**Specified by:** flush

in class

Preferences
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**See Also:** flush()

- flushSpi

```java
protected abstract void flushSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

This method is invoked with this node locked. The contract of this
method is to force any cached changes in the contents of this
preference node to the backing store, guaranteeing their persistence.
(It is perfectly possible that this node does not exist on the backing
store, either because it has been deleted by another VM, or because it
has not yet been created.) Note that this method should

not

flush the preferences in any subnodes of this node. If the backing
store naturally flushes an entire subtree at once, the implementer is
encouraged to override flush(), rather than merely overriding this
method.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

flush()

invocation.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- isRemoved

```java
protected boolean isRemoved()
```

Returns

true

iff this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method. This method
locks this node prior to returning the contents of the private
field used to track this state.

**Returns:** true

iff this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- exportNode

```java
public void exportNode​(
OutputStream
os)
throws
IOException
,

BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

exportNode

method as per the specification in

Preferences.exportNode(OutputStream)

.

**Specified by:** exportNode

in class

Preferences
**Parameters:** os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

IOException

.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if preference data cannot be read from
backing store.
**See Also:** Preferences.importPreferences(InputStream)

- exportSubtree

```java
public void exportSubtree​(
OutputStream
os)
throws
IOException
,

BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

exportSubtree

method as per the specification in

Preferences.exportSubtree(OutputStream)

.

**Specified by:** exportSubtree

in class

Preferences
**Parameters:** os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

IOException

.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if preference data cannot be read from
backing store.
**See Also:** Preferences.importPreferences(InputStream)

,

Preferences.exportNode(OutputStream)

- keys

```java
public
String
[] keys()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

keys

method as per the specification in

Preferences.keys()

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, checks that
the node has not been removed and invokes

keysSpi()

.

**Specified by:** keys

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** an array of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- childrenNames

```java
public
String
[] childrenNames()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

children

method as per the specification in

Preferences.childrenNames()

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, checks that
the node has not been removed, constructs a

TreeSet

initialized
to the names of children already cached (the children in this node's
"child-cache"), invokes

childrenNamesSpi()

, and adds all of the
returned child-names into the set. The elements of the tree set are
dumped into a

String

array using the

toArray

method,
and this array is returned.

**Specified by:** childrenNames

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** the names of the children of this preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** cachedChildren()

- cachedChildren

```java
protected final
AbstractPreferences
[] cachedChildren()
```

Returns all known unremoved children of this node.

**Returns:** all known unremoved children of this node.

- parent

```java
public
Preferences
parent()
```

Implements the

parent

method as per the specification in

Preferences.parent()

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, checks that
the node has not been removed and returns the parent value that was
passed to this node's constructor.

**Specified by:** parent

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** the parent of this preference node.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- node

```java
public
Preferences
node​(
String
path)
```

Implements the

node

method as per the specification in

Preferences.node(String)

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock and checks
that the node has not been removed. If

path

is

""

,
this node is returned; if

path

is

"/"

, this node's
root is returned. If the first character in

path

is
not

'/'

, the implementation breaks

path

into
tokens and recursively traverses the path from this node to the
named node, "consuming" a name and a slash from

path

at
each step of the traversal. At each step, the current node is locked
and the node's child-cache is checked for the named node. If it is
not found, the name is checked to make sure its length does not
exceed

MAX_NAME_LENGTH

. Then the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked, and the result stored in this node's child-cache.
If the newly created

Preferences

object's

newNode

field is

true

and there are any node change listeners,
a notification event is enqueued for processing by the event dispatch
thread.

When there are no more tokens, the last value found in the
child-cache or returned by

childSpi

is returned by this
method. If during the traversal, two

"/"

tokens occur
consecutively, or the final token is

"/"

(rather than a name),
an appropriate

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

If the first character of

path

is

'/'

(indicating an absolute path name) this preference node's
lock is dropped prior to breaking

path

into tokens, and
this method recursively traverses the path starting from the root
(rather than starting from this node). The traversal is otherwise
identical to the one described for relative path names. Dropping
the lock on this node prior to commencing the traversal at the root
node is essential to avoid the possibility of deadlock, as per the

locking invariant

.

**Specified by:** node

in class

Preferences
**Parameters:** path

- the path name of the preference node to return.
**Returns:** the specified preference node.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** Preferences.flush()

- nodeExists

```java
public boolean nodeExists​(
String
path)
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

nodeExists

method as per the specification in

Preferences.nodeExists(String)

.

This implementation is very similar to

node(String)

,
except that

getChild(String)

is used instead of

childSpi(String)

.

**Specified by:** nodeExists

in class

Preferences
**Parameters:** path

- the path name of the node whose existence is to be checked.
**Returns:** true if the specified node exists.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method and

pathname

is not the empty string (

""

).

- removeNode

```java
public void removeNode()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

removeNode()

method as per the specification in

Preferences.removeNode()

.

This implementation checks to see that this node is the root; if so,
it throws an appropriate exception. Then, it locks this node's parent,
and calls a recursive helper method that traverses the subtree rooted at
this node. The recursive method locks the node on which it was called,
checks that it has not already been removed, and then ensures that all
of its children are cached: The

childrenNamesSpi()

method is
invoked and each returned child name is checked for containment in the
child-cache. If a child is not already cached, the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked to create a

Preferences

instance for it, and this instance is put into the child-cache. Then
the helper method calls itself recursively on each node contained in its
child-cache. Next, it invokes

removeNodeSpi()

, marks itself
as removed, and removes itself from its parent's child-cache. Finally,
if there are any node change listeners, it enqueues a notification
event for processing by the event dispatch thread.

Note that the helper method is always invoked with all ancestors up
to the "closest non-removed ancestor" locked.

**Specified by:** removeNode

in class

Preferences
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has already
been removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this method is invoked on
the root node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**See Also:** Preferences.flush()

- name

```java
public
String
name()
```

Implements the

name

method as per the specification in

Preferences.name()

.

This implementation merely returns the name that was
passed to this node's constructor.

**Specified by:** name

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** this preference node's name, relative to its parent.

- absolutePath

```java
public
String
absolutePath()
```

Implements the

absolutePath

method as per the specification in

Preferences.absolutePath()

.

This implementation merely returns the absolute path name that
was computed at the time that this node was constructed (based on
the name that was passed to this node's constructor, and the names
that were passed to this node's ancestors' constructors).

**Specified by:** absolutePath

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** this preference node's absolute path name.

- isUserNode

```java
public boolean isUserNode()
```

Implements the

isUserNode

method as per the specification in

Preferences.isUserNode()

.

This implementation compares this node's root node (which is stored
in a private field) with the value returned by

Preferences.userRoot()

. If the two object references are
identical, this method returns true.

**Specified by:** isUserNode

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** true

if this preference node is in the user
preference tree,

false

if it's in the system
preference tree.

- putSpi

```java
protected abstract void putSpi​(
String
key,

String
value)
```

Put the given key-value association into this preference node. It is
guaranteed that

key

and

value

are non-null and of
legal length. Also, it is guaranteed that this node has not been
removed. (The implementor needn't check for any of these things.)

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:** key

- the key
**Parameters:** value

- the value

- getSpi

```java
protected abstract
String
getSpi​(
String
key)
```

Return the value associated with the specified key at this preference
node, or

null

if there is no association for this key, or the
association cannot be determined at this time. It is guaranteed that

key

is non-null. Also, it is guaranteed that this node has
not been removed. (The implementor needn't check for either of these
things.)

Generally speaking, this method should not throw an exception
under any circumstances. If, however, if it does throw an exception,
the exception will be intercepted and treated as a

null

return value.

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:** key

- the key
**Returns:** the value associated with the specified key at this preference
node, or

null

if there is no association for this
key, or the association cannot be determined at this time.

- removeSpi

```java
protected abstract void removeSpi​(
String
key)
```

Remove the association (if any) for the specified key at this
preference node. It is guaranteed that

key

is non-null.
Also, it is guaranteed that this node has not been removed.
(The implementor needn't check for either of these things.)

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:** key

- the key

- removeNodeSpi

```java
protected abstract void removeNodeSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Removes this preference node, invalidating it and any preferences that
it contains. The named child will have no descendants at the time this
invocation is made (i.e., the

Preferences.removeNode()

method
invokes this method repeatedly in a bottom-up fashion, removing each of
a node's descendants before removing the node itself).

This method is invoked with the lock held on this node and its
parent (and all ancestors that are being removed as a
result of a single invocation to

Preferences.removeNode()

).

The removal of a node needn't become persistent until the

flush

method is invoked on this node (or an ancestor).

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

removeNode()

invocation.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- keysSpi

```java
protected abstract
String
[] keysSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Returns all of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node. (The returned array will be of size zero if
this node has no preferences.) It is guaranteed that this node has not
been removed.

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

keys()

invocation.

**Returns:** an array of the keys that have an associated value in this
preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- childrenNamesSpi

```java
protected abstract
String
[] childrenNamesSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Returns the names of the children of this preference node. (The
returned array will be of size zero if this node has no children.)
This method need not return the names of any nodes already cached,
but may do so without harm.

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

childrenNames()

invocation.

**Returns:** an array containing the names of the children of this
preference node.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- getChild

```java
protected
AbstractPreferences
getChild​(
String
nodeName)
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Returns the named child if it exists, or

null

if it does not.
It is guaranteed that

nodeName

is non-null, non-empty,
does not contain the slash character ('/'), and is no longer than

Preferences.MAX_NAME_LENGTH

characters. Also, it is guaranteed
that this node has not been removed. (The implementor needn't check
for any of these things if he chooses to override this method.)

Finally, it is guaranteed that the named node has not been returned
by a previous invocation of this method or

childSpi(java.lang.String)

after the
last time that it was removed. In other words, a cached value will
always be used in preference to invoking this method. (The implementor
needn't maintain his own cache of previously returned children if he
chooses to override this method.)

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock, invokes

childrenNames()

to get an array of the names of this node's
children, and iterates over the array comparing the name of each child
with the specified node name. If a child node has the correct name,
the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked and the resulting
node is returned. If the iteration completes without finding the
specified name,

null

is returned.

**Parameters:** nodeName

- name of the child to be searched for.
**Returns:** the named child if it exists, or null if it does not.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- childSpi

```java
protected abstract
AbstractPreferences
childSpi​(
String
name)
```

Returns the named child of this preference node, creating it if it does
not already exist. It is guaranteed that

name

is non-null,
non-empty, does not contain the slash character ('/'), and is no longer
than

Preferences.MAX_NAME_LENGTH

characters. Also, it is guaranteed that
this node has not been removed. (The implementor needn't check for any
of these things.)

Finally, it is guaranteed that the named node has not been returned
by a previous invocation of this method or

getChild(String)

after the last time that it was removed. In other words, a cached
value will always be used in preference to invoking this method.
Subclasses need not maintain their own cache of previously returned
children.

The implementer must ensure that the returned node has not been
removed. If a like-named child of this node was previously removed, the
implementer must return a newly constructed

AbstractPreferences

node; once removed, an

AbstractPreferences

node
cannot be "resuscitated."

If this method causes a node to be created, this node is not
guaranteed to be persistent until the

flush

method is
invoked on this node or one of its ancestors (or descendants).

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the child node to return, relative to
this preference node.
**Returns:** The named child node.

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the absolute path name of this preferences node.

**Specified by:** toString

in class

Preferences
**Returns:** a string representation of the object.

- sync

```java
public void sync()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

sync

method as per the specification in

Preferences.sync()

.

This implementation calls a recursive helper method that locks this
node, invokes syncSpi() on it, unlocks this node, and recursively
invokes this method on each "cached child." A cached child is a child
of this node that has been created in this VM and not subsequently
removed. In effect, this method does a depth first traversal of the
"cached subtree" rooted at this node, calling syncSpi() on each node in
the subTree while only that node is locked. Note that syncSpi() is
invoked top-down.

**Specified by:** sync

in class

Preferences
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.
**See Also:** flush()

- syncSpi

```java
protected abstract void syncSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

This method is invoked with this node locked. The contract of this
method is to synchronize any cached preferences stored at this node
with any stored in the backing store. (It is perfectly possible that
this node does not exist on the backing store, either because it has
been deleted by another VM, or because it has not yet been created.)
Note that this method should

not

synchronize the preferences in
any subnodes of this node. If the backing store naturally syncs an
entire subtree at once, the implementer is encouraged to override
sync(), rather than merely overriding this method.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

sync()

invocation.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- flush

```java
public void flush()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

flush

method as per the specification in

Preferences.flush()

.

This implementation calls a recursive helper method that locks this
node, invokes flushSpi() on it, unlocks this node, and recursively
invokes this method on each "cached child." A cached child is a child
of this node that has been created in this VM and not subsequently
removed. In effect, this method does a depth first traversal of the
"cached subtree" rooted at this node, calling flushSpi() on each node in
the subTree while only that node is locked. Note that flushSpi() is
invoked top-down.

If this method is invoked on a node that has been removed with
the

removeNode()

method, flushSpi() is invoked on this node,
but not on others.

**Specified by:** flush

in class

Preferences
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**See Also:** flush()

- flushSpi

```java
protected abstract void flushSpi()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

This method is invoked with this node locked. The contract of this
method is to force any cached changes in the contents of this
preference node to the backing store, guaranteeing their persistence.
(It is perfectly possible that this node does not exist on the backing
store, either because it has been deleted by another VM, or because it
has not yet been created.) Note that this method should

not

flush the preferences in any subnodes of this node. If the backing
store naturally flushes an entire subtree at once, the implementer is
encouraged to override flush(), rather than merely overriding this
method.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

, the exception
will propagate out beyond the enclosing

flush()

invocation.

**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.

- isRemoved

```java
protected boolean isRemoved()
```

Returns

true

iff this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method. This method
locks this node prior to returning the contents of the private
field used to track this state.

**Returns:** true

iff this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

- exportNode

```java
public void exportNode​(
OutputStream
os)
throws
IOException
,

BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

exportNode

method as per the specification in

Preferences.exportNode(OutputStream)

.

**Specified by:** exportNode

in class

Preferences
**Parameters:** os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if preference data cannot be read from
backing store.
**See Also:** Preferences.importPreferences(InputStream)

- exportSubtree

```java
public void exportSubtree​(
OutputStream
os)
throws
IOException
,

BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

exportSubtree

method as per the specification in

Preferences.exportSubtree(OutputStream)

.

**Specified by:** exportSubtree

in class

Preferences
**Parameters:** os

- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
**Throws:** IOException

- if writing to the specified output stream
results in an

IOException

.
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if preference data cannot be read from
backing store.

node

```java
public
Preferences
node​(
String
path)
```

Implements the

node

method as per the specification in

Preferences.node(String)

.

This implementation obtains this preference node's lock and checks
that the node has not been removed. If

path

is

""

,
this node is returned; if

path

is

"/"

, this node's
root is returned. If the first character in

path

is
not

'/'

, the implementation breaks

path

into
tokens and recursively traverses the path from this node to the
named node, "consuming" a name and a slash from

path

at
each step of the traversal. At each step, the current node is locked
and the node's child-cache is checked for the named node. If it is
not found, the name is checked to make sure its length does not
exceed

MAX_NAME_LENGTH

. Then the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked, and the result stored in this node's child-cache.
If the newly created

Preferences

object's

newNode

field is

true

and there are any node change listeners,
a notification event is enqueued for processing by the event dispatch
thread.

When there are no more tokens, the last value found in the
child-cache or returned by

childSpi

is returned by this
method. If during the traversal, two

"/"

tokens occur
consecutively, or the final token is

"/"

(rather than a name),
an appropriate

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

If the first character of

path

is

'/'

(indicating an absolute path name) this preference node's
lock is dropped prior to breaking

path

into tokens, and
this method recursively traverses the path starting from the root
(rather than starting from this node). The traversal is otherwise
identical to the one described for relative path names. Dropping
the lock on this node prior to commencing the traversal at the root
node is essential to avoid the possibility of deadlock, as per the

locking invariant

.

**Specified by:** node

in class

Preferences
**Parameters:** path

- the path name of the preference node to return.
**Returns:** the specified preference node.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the path name is invalid (i.e.,
it contains multiple consecutive slash characters, or ends
with a slash character and is more than one character long).
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

removeNode

```java

Implements the

removeNode()

method as per the specification in

Preferences.removeNode()

.

This implementation checks to see that this node is the root; if so,
it throws an appropriate exception. Then, it locks this node's parent,
and calls a recursive helper method that traverses the subtree rooted at
this node. The recursive method locks the node on which it was called,
checks that it has not already been removed, and then ensures that all
of its children are cached: The

childrenNamesSpi()

method is
invoked and each returned child name is checked for containment in the
child-cache. If a child is not already cached, the

childSpi(String)

method is invoked to create a

Preferences

instance for it, and this instance is put into the child-cache. Then
the helper method calls itself recursively on each node contained in its
child-cache. Next, it invokes

removeNodeSpi()

, marks itself
as removed, and removes itself from its parent's child-cache. Finally,
if there are any node change listeners, it enqueues a notification
event for processing by the event dispatch thread.

Note that the helper method is always invoked with all ancestors up
to the "closest non-removed ancestor" locked.

**Specified by:** removeNode

characters. Also, it is guaranteed that
this node has not been removed. (The implementor needn't check for any
of these things.)

Finally, it is guaranteed that the named node has not been returned
by a previous invocation of this method or

getChild(String)

after the last time that it was removed. In other words, a cached
value will always be used in preference to invoking this method.
Subclasses need not maintain their own cache of previously returned
children.

The implementer must ensure that the returned node has not been
removed. If a like-named child of this node was previously removed, the
implementer must return a newly constructed

AbstractPreferences

node; once removed, an

AbstractPreferences

node
cannot be "resuscitated."

If this method causes a node to be created, this node is not
guaranteed to be persistent until the

flush

method is
invoked on this node or one of its ancestors (or descendants).

This method is invoked with the lock on this node held.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the child node to return, relative to
this preference node.
**Returns:** The named child node.

sync

```java
public void sync()
throws
BackingStoreException
```

Implements the

sync

method as per the specification in

Preferences.sync()

.

This implementation calls a recursive helper method that locks this
node, invokes syncSpi() on it, unlocks this node, and recursively
invokes this method on each "cached child." A cached child is a child
of this node that has been created in this VM and not subsequently
removed. In effect, this method does a depth first traversal of the
"cached subtree" rooted at this node, calling syncSpi() on each node in
the subTree while only that node is locked. Note that syncSpi() is
invoked top-down.

**Specified by:** sync

in class

Preferences
**Throws:** BackingStoreException

- if this operation cannot be completed
due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to
communicate with it.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
removed with the

removeNode()

method.

syncSpi

```java
protected abstract void syncSpi()

```

This method is invoked with this node locked. The contract of this
method is to synchronize any cached preferences stored at this node
with any stored in the backing store. (It is perfectly possible that
this node does not exist on the backing store, either because it has
been deleted by another VM, or because it has not yet been created.)
Note that this method should

not

synchronize the preferences in
any subnodes of this node. If the backing store naturally syncs an
entire subtree at once, the implementer is encouraged to override
sync(), rather than merely overriding this method.

If this node throws a

BackingStoreException

will propagate out beyond the enclosing

sync()

invocation.
