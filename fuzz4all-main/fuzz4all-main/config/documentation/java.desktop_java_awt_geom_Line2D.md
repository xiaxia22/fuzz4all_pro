#### public static int relativeCCW​(double x1,
double y1,
double x2,
double y2,
double px,
double py)

Returns an indicator of where the specified point

(px,py)

lies with respect to the line segment from

(x1,y1)

to

(x2,y2)

.
The return value can be either 1, -1, or 0 and indicates
in which direction the specified line must pivot around its
first end point,

(x1,y1)

, in order to point at the
specified point

(px,py)

.

A return value of 1 indicates that the line segment must
turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards
the negative Y axis. In the default coordinate system used by
Java 2D, this direction is counterclockwise.

A return value of -1 indicates that the line segment must
turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards
the positive Y axis. In the default coordinate system, this
direction is clockwise.

A return value of 0 indicates that the point lies
exactly on the line segment. Note that an indicator value
of 0 is rare and not useful for determining collinearity
because of floating point rounding issues.

If the point is colinear with the line segment, but
not between the end points, then the value will be -1 if the point
lies "beyond

(x1,y1)

" or 1 if the point lies
"beyond

(x2,y2)

".

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified rectangular area.
The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Specified by:**
- intersects

in interface

Shape

of the specified rectangular area
- y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area

#### public boolean intersects​(
Rectangle2D
r)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified

Rectangle2D

.
The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the

Rectangle2D

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the

Rectangle2D

does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

#### public boolean contains​(
Rectangle2D
r)

Tests if the interior of this

Line2D

entirely contains
the specified

Rectangle2D

.

#### public
Rectangle
getBounds()

Returns an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses the

Shape

. Note that there is no guarantee that the
returned

Rectangle

is the smallest bounding box that
encloses the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies entirely within the indicated

Rectangle

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a
tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
representation.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then
it must be inside the returned

Rectangle

bounds object
according to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(x,y)

requires

bounds.contains(x,y)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(x,y)

does not imply

shape.contains(x,y)

**Specified by:**
- getBounds

in interface

Shape

**Returns:**
- an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses
the

Shape

.

- relativeCCW

```java
public static int relativeCCW​(double x1,
double y1,
double x2,
double y2,
double px,
double py)
```

Returns an indicator of where the specified point

(px,py)

lies with respect to the line segment from

(x1,y1)

to

(x2,y2)

.
The return value can be either 1, -1, or 0 and indicates
in which direction the specified line must pivot around its
first end point,

(x1,y1)

, in order to point at the
specified point

(px,py)

.

A return value of 1 indicates that the line segment must
turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards
the negative Y axis. In the default coordinate system used by
Java 2D, this direction is counterclockwise.

A return value of -1 indicates that the line segment must
turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards
the positive Y axis. In the default coordinate system, this
direction is clockwise.

A return value of 0 indicates that the point lies
exactly on the line segment. Note that an indicator value
of 0 is rare and not useful for determining collinearity
because of floating point rounding issues.

If the point is colinear with the line segment, but
not between the end points, then the value will be -1 if the point
lies "beyond

(x1,y1)

" or 1 if the point lies
"beyond

(x2,y2)

".

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

- getBounds

```java
public
Rectangle
getBounds()
```

Returns an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses the

Shape

. Note that there is no guarantee that the
returned

Rectangle

is the smallest bounding box that
encloses the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies entirely within the indicated

Rectangle

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a
tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
representation.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then
it must be inside the returned

Rectangle

bounds object
according to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(x,y)

requires

bounds.contains(x,y)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(x,y)

does not imply

shape.contains(x,y)

**Specified by:** getBounds

```

Returns an indicator of where the specified point

(px,py)

lies with respect to the line segment from

in which direction the specified line must pivot around its
first end point,

(x1,y1)

, in order to point at the
specified point

(px,py)

A return value of 1 indicates that the line segment must
turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards
the negative Y axis. In the default coordinate system used by
Java 2D, this direction is counterclockwise.

turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards
the positive Y axis. In the default coordinate system, this
direction is clockwise.

A return value of 0 indicates that the point lies
exactly on the line segment. Note that an indicator value
of 0 is rare and not useful for determining collinearity
because of floating point rounding issues.

If the point is colinear with the line segment, but
not between the end points, then the value will be -1 if the point
lies "beyond

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified rectangular area.
The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise

- getBounds

```java
public
Rectangle
getBounds()
```

Returns an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses the

Shape

. Note that there is no guarantee that the
returned

Rectangle

is the smallest bounding box that
encloses the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies entirely within the indicated

Rectangle

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a
tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
representation.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then
it must be inside the returned

Rectangle

bounds object
according to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(x,y)

requires

bounds.contains(x,y)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(x,y)

does not imply

shape.contains(x,y)

**Specified by:** getBounds

**Returns:** an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses

according to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(x,y)

requires

bounds.contains(x,y)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(x,y)

does not imply

shape.contains(x,y)

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then
it must be inside the returned

Rectangle

getPathIterator

```java
public
PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at)
```

Returns an iteration object that defines the boundary of this

Line2D

.
The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe,
which means that this

Line2D

class does not
guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this

Line2D

object do not affect any iterations of that
geometry that are already in process.

**Specified by:** getPathIterator

in interface

Shape
**Parameters:** at

- the specified

AffineTransform
**Returns:** a

PathIterator

that defines the boundary of this

Line2D

.
**Since:** 1.2

getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at,
double flatness)
```

Returns an iteration object that defines the boundary of this
flattened

Line2D

.
The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe,
which means that this

Line2D

class does not
guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this

Line2D

object do not affect any iterations of that
geometry that are already in process.

**Specified by:** getPathIterator

in interface

Shape
**Parameters:** at

- the specified

AffineTransform
**Parameters:** flatness

- the maximum amount that the control points for a
given curve can vary from colinear before a subdivided
curve is replaced by a straight line connecting the
end points. Since a

Line2D

object is
always flat, this parameter is ignored.
**Returns:** a

PathIterator

that defines the boundary of the
flattened

Line2D
**Since:** 1.2
