# Class ThreadInfo

**Source:** `java.management\java\lang\management\ThreadInfo.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ThreadInfo

extends
Object
```

Thread information.

ThreadInfo

contains the information
about a thread including:

General thread information

- Thread ID.
- Name of the thread.
- Whether a thread is a daemon thread

Execution information

- Thread state.
- The object upon which the thread is blocked due to:

- waiting to enter a synchronization block/method, or
- waiting to be notified in a

Object.wait

method,
or
- parking due to a

LockSupport.park

call.
- The ID of the thread that owns the object
that the thread is blocked.
- Stack trace of the thread.
- List of object monitors locked by the thread.
- List of

ownable synchronizers

locked by the thread.
- Thread priority

Synchronization Statistics

- The number of times that the thread has blocked for
synchronization or waited for notification.
- The accumulated elapsed time that the thread has blocked
for synchronization or waited for notification
since

thread contention monitoring

was enabled. Some Java virtual machine implementation
may not support this. The

ThreadMXBean.isThreadContentionMonitoringSupported()

method can be used to determine if a Java virtual machine
supports this.

This thread information class is designed for use in monitoring of
the system, not for synchronization control.

is mapped to a

CompositeData

with attributes as specified in

### Method Details

#### public long getThreadId()

Returns the ID of the thread associated with this

ThreadInfo

.

**Returns:**
- the ID of the associated thread.

---

String
getThreadName()

Returns the name of the thread associated with this

ThreadInfo

.

---

#### public long getBlockedTime()

Returns the approximate accumulated elapsed time (in milliseconds)

state.

---

#### public
LockInfo
getLockInfo()

Returns the

LockInfo

of an object for which
the thread associated with this

ThreadInfo

is blocked waiting.
A thread can be blocked waiting for one of the following:

- an object monitor to be acquired for entering or reentering
a synchronization block/method.

The thread is in the

BLOCKED

state waiting to enter the

synchronized

statement
or method.
- an object monitor to be notified by another thread.

The thread is in the

WAITING

or

TIMED_WAITING

state
due to a call to the

Object.wait

method.
- a synchronization object responsible for the thread parking.

The thread is in the

WAITING

or

TIMED_WAITING

state
due to a call to the

LockSupport.park

method. The synchronization object
is the object returned from

LockSupport.getBlocker

method. Typically it is an

ownable synchronizer

or a

Condition

.

This method returns

null

if the thread is not in any of
the above conditions.

**Returns:**
- LockInfo

of an object for which the thread
is blocked waiting if any;

null

otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public
String
getLockName()

Returns the

string representation

of an object for which the thread associated with this

ThreadInfo

is blocked waiting.
This method is equivalent to calling:

```java
getLockInfo().toString()
```

This method will return

null

if this thread is not blocked
waiting for any object or if the object is not owned by any thread.

**Returns:**
- the string representation of the object on which
the thread is blocked if any;

null

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- getLockInfo()

---

#### public long getLockOwnerId()

Returns the ID of the thread which owns the object
for which the thread associated with this

ThreadInfo

is blocked waiting.
This method will return

-1

if this thread is not blocked
waiting for any object or if the object is not owned by any thread.

**Returns:**
- the thread ID of the owner thread of the object
this thread is blocked on;

-1

if this thread is not blocked
or if the object is not owned by any thread.

**See Also:**
- getLockInfo()

---

#### public
String
getLockOwnerName()

Returns the name of the thread which owns the object
for which the thread associated with this

ThreadInfo

is blocked waiting.
This method will return

null

if this thread is not blocked
waiting for any object or if the object is not owned by any thread.

**Returns:**
- the name of the thread that owns the object
this thread is blocked on;

null

if this thread is not blocked
or if the object is not owned by any thread.

**See Also:**
- getLockInfo()

---

#### public
StackTraceElement
[] getStackTrace()

Returns the stack trace of the thread
associated with this

ThreadInfo

.
If no stack trace was requested for this thread info, this method
will return a zero-length array.
If the returned array is of non-zero length then the first element of
the array represents the top of the stack, which is the most recent
method invocation in the sequence. The last element of the array
represents the bottom of the stack, which is the least recent method
invocation in the sequence.

Some Java virtual machines may, under some circumstances, omit one
or more stack frames from the stack trace. In the extreme case,
a virtual machine that has no stack trace information concerning
the thread associated with this

ThreadInfo

is permitted to return a zero-length array from this method.

**Returns:**
- an array of

StackTraceElement

objects of the thread.

---

#### public boolean isSuspended()

Tests if the thread associated with this

ThreadInfo

is suspended. This method returns

true

if

Thread.suspend()

has been called.

**Returns:**
- true

if the thread is suspended;

false

otherwise.

---

#### public boolean isInNative()

Tests if the thread associated with this

ThreadInfo

is executing native code via the Java Native Interface (JNI).
The JNI native code does not include
the virtual machine support code or the compiled native
code generated by the virtual machine.

**Returns:**
- true

if the thread is executing native code;

false

otherwise.

---

#### public boolean isDaemon()

Tests if the thread associated with this

ThreadInfo

is
a

daemon thread

.

**Returns:**
- true

if the thread is a daemon thread,

false

otherwise.

ThreadInfo

.

**Since:**

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string representation of this thread info.
The format of this string depends on the implementation.
The returned string will typically include
the

thread name

,
the

thread ID

,
its

state

,
and a

stack trace

if any.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
