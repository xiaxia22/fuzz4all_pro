# Class NamingManager

**Source:** `java.naming\javax\naming\spi\NamingManager.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
NamingManager

extends
Object
```

This class contains methods for creating context objects
and objects referred to by location information in the naming
or directory service.

This class cannot be instantiated. It has only static methods.

The mention of URL in the documentation for this class refers to
a URL string as defined by RFC 1738 and its related RFCs. It is
any string that conforms to the syntax described therein, and
may not always have corresponding support in the java.net.URL
class or Web browsers.

NamingManager is safe for concurrent access by multiple threads.

Except as otherwise noted,
a

Name

or environment parameter
passed to any method is owned by the caller.
The implementation will not modify the object or keep a reference
to it, although it may keep a reference to a clone or copy.

**Direct Known Subclasses:** DirectoryManager

### Field Details

#### public static final
String
CPE

Constant that holds the name of the environment property into
which

getContinuationContext()

stores the value of its

CannotProceedException

parameter.
This property is inherited by the continuation context, and may
be used by that context's service provider to inspect the
fields of the exception.

The value of this constant is "java.naming.spi.CannotProceedException".

### Method Details

#### public static void setObjectFactoryBuilder​(
ObjectFactoryBuilder
builder)
throws
NamingException

The ObjectFactoryBuilder determines the policy used when
trying to load object factories.
See getObjectInstance() and class ObjectFactory for a description
of the default policy.
setObjectFactoryBuilder() overrides this default policy by installing
an ObjectFactoryBuilder. Subsequent object factories will
be loaded and created using the installed builder.

The builder can only be installed if the executing thread is allowed
(by the security manager's checkSetFactory() method) to do so.
Once installed, the builder cannot be replaced.

**Parameters:**
- builder

- The factory builder to install. If null, no builder
is installed.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- builder cannot be installed
for security reasons.
- NamingException

- builder cannot be installed for
a non-security-related reason.
- IllegalStateException

- If a factory has already been installed.

#### public static
Object
getObjectInstance​(
Object
refInfo,

Name
name,

Context
nameCtx,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment)
throws
Exception

Creates an instance of an object for the specified object
and environment.

If an object factory builder has been installed, it is used to
create a factory for creating the object.
Otherwise, the following rules are used to create the object:

- If

refInfo

is a

Reference

or

Referenceable

containing a factory class name,
use the named factory to create the object.
Return

refInfo

if the factory cannot be created.
Under JDK 1.1, if the factory class must be loaded from a location
specified in the reference, a

SecurityManager

must have
been installed or the factory creation will fail.
If an exception is encountered while creating the factory,
it is passed up to the caller.

If

refInfo

is a

Reference

or

Referenceable

with no factory class name,
and the address or addresses are

StringRefAddr

s with
address type "URL",
try the URL context factory corresponding to each URL's scheme id
to create the object (see

getURLContext()

).
If that fails, continue to the next step.

Use the object factories specified in
the

Context.OBJECT_FACTORIES

property of the environment,
and of the provider resource file associated with

nameCtx

, in that order.
The value of this property is a colon-separated list of factory
class names that are tried in order, and the first one that succeeds
in creating an object is the one used.
If none of the factories can be loaded,
return

refInfo

.
If an exception is encountered while creating the object, the
exception is passed up to the caller.

Service providers that implement the

DirContext

interface should use

DirectoryManager.getObjectInstance()

, not this method.
Service providers that implement only the

Context

interface should use this method.

Note that an object factory (an object that implements the ObjectFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.

The

name

and

nameCtx

parameters may
optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created.

name

is the name of the object, relative to context

nameCtx

. This information could be useful to the object
factory or to the object implementation.
If there are several possible contexts from which the object
could be named -- as will often be the case -- it is up to
the caller to select one. A good rule of thumb is to select the
"deepest" context available.
If

nameCtx

is null,

name

is relative
to the default initial context. If no name is being specified, the

name

parameter should be null.

**Parameters:**
- refInfo

- The possibly null object for which to create an object.
- name

- The name of this object relative to

nameCtx

.
Specifying a name is optional; if it is
omitted,

name

should be null.
- nameCtx

- The context relative to which the

name

parameter is specified. If null,

name

is
relative to the default initial context.
- environment

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the object factory and the object.

**Returns:**
- An object created using

refInfo

; or

refInfo

if an object cannot be created using
the algorithm described above.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- if a naming exception was encountered
while attempting to get a URL context, or if one of the
factories accessed throws a NamingException.
- Exception

- if one of the factories accessed throws an
exception, or if an error was encountered while loading
and instantiating the factory and object classes.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.
See ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance().

#### public static
Context
getURLContext​(
String
scheme,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment)
throws
NamingException

Creates a context for the given URL scheme id.

The resulting context is for resolving URLs of the
scheme

scheme

. The resulting context is not tied
to a specific URL. It is able to handle arbitrary URLs with
the specified scheme.

The class name of the factory that creates the resulting context
has the naming convention

scheme-id

URLContextFactory
(e.g. "ftpURLContextFactory" for the "ftp" scheme-id),
in the package specified as follows.
The

Context.URL_PKG_PREFIXES

environment property (which
may contain values taken from system properties,
or application resource files)
contains a colon-separated list of package prefixes.
Each package prefix in
the property is tried in the order specified to load the factory class.
The default package prefix is "com.sun.jndi.url" (if none of the
specified packages work, this default is tried).
The complete package name is constructed using the package prefix,
concatenated with the scheme id.

For example, if the scheme id is "ldap", and the

Context.URL_PKG_PREFIXES

property
contains "com.widget:com.wiz.jndi",
the naming manager would attempt to load the following classes
until one is successfully instantiated:

- com.widget.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

com.wiz.jndi.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

com.sun.jndi.url.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

If none of the package prefixes work, null is returned.

If a factory is instantiated, it is invoked with the following
parameters to produce the resulting context.

factory.getObjectInstance(null, environment);

For example, invoking getObjectInstance() as shown above
on a LDAP URL context factory would return a
context that can resolve LDAP urls
(e.g. "ldap://ldap.wiz.com/o=wiz,c=us",
"ldap://ldap.umich.edu/o=umich,c=us", ...).

Note that an object factory (an object that implements the ObjectFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.

**Parameters:**
- scheme

- The non-null scheme-id of the URLs supported by the context.
- environment

- The possibly null environment properties to be
used in the creation of the object factory and the context.

**Returns:**
- A context for resolving URLs with the
scheme id

scheme

;

null

if the factory for creating the
context is not found.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If a naming exception occurs while creating
the context.

**See Also:**
- getObjectInstance(java.lang.Object, javax.naming.Name, javax.naming.Context, java.util.Hashtable<?, ?>)

,

ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance(java.lang.Object, javax.naming.Name, javax.naming.Context, java.util.Hashtable<?, ?>)

---

#### public static
Context
getInitialContext​(
Hashtable
<?,​?> env)
throws
NamingException

Creates an initial context using the specified environment
properties.

This is done as follows:

- If an InitialContextFactoryBuilder has been installed,
it is used to create the factory for creating the initial
context
- Otherwise, the class specified in the

Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY

environment property
is used

- First, the

ServiceLoader

mechanism tries to locate an

InitialContextFactory

provider using the current thread's context class loader
- Failing that, this implementation tries to locate a suitable

InitialContextFactory

using a built-in mechanism

(Note that an initial context factory (an object that implements
the InitialContextFactory interface) must be public and must have
a public constructor that accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must
be in a package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.)

**Parameters:**
- env

- The possibly null environment properties used when
creating the context.

**Returns:**
- A non-null initial context.

**Throws:**
- NoInitialContextException

- If the

Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY

property
is not found or names a nonexistent
class or a class that cannot be instantiated,
or if the initial context could not be created for some other
reason.
- NamingException

- If some other naming exception was encountered.

**See Also:**
- InitialContext

,

InitialDirContext

#### public static void setInitialContextFactoryBuilder​(
InitialContextFactoryBuilder
builder)
throws
NamingException

Sets the InitialContextFactory builder to be builder.

The builder can only be installed if the executing thread is allowed by
the security manager to do so. Once installed, the builder cannot
be replaced.

**Parameters:**
- builder

- The initial context factory builder to install. If null,
no builder is set.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- builder cannot be installed for security
reasons.
- NamingException

- builder cannot be installed for
a non-security-related reason.
- IllegalStateException

- If a builder was previous installed.

**See Also:**
- hasInitialContextFactoryBuilder()

,

SecurityManager.checkSetFactory()

---

#### public static boolean hasInitialContextFactoryBuilder()

Determines whether an initial context factory builder has
been set.

**Returns:**
- true if an initial context factory builder has
been set; false otherwise.

**See Also:**
- setInitialContextFactoryBuilder(javax.naming.spi.InitialContextFactoryBuilder)

---

#### public static
Context
getContinuationContext​(
CannotProceedException
cpe)
throws
NamingException

Creates a context in which to continue a context operation.

In performing an operation on a name that spans multiple
namespaces, a context from one naming system may need to pass
the operation on to the next naming system. The context
implementation does this by first constructing a

CannotProceedException

containing information
pinpointing how far it has proceeded. It then obtains a
continuation context from JNDI by calling

getContinuationContext

. The context
implementation should then resume the context operation by
invoking the same operation on the continuation context, using
the remainder of the name that has not yet been resolved.

Before making use of the

cpe

parameter, this method
updates the environment associated with that object by setting
the value of the property

CPE

to

cpe

. This property will be inherited by the
continuation context, and may be used by that context's
service provider to inspect the fields of this exception.

**Parameters:**
- cpe

- The non-null exception that triggered this continuation.

**Returns:**
- A non-null Context object for continuing the operation.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If a naming exception occurred.

#### public static
Object
getStateToBind​(
Object
obj,

Name
name,

Context
nameCtx,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment)
throws
NamingException

Retrieves the state of an object for binding.

Service providers that implement the

DirContext

interface
should use

DirectoryManager.getStateToBind()

, not this method.
Service providers that implement only the

Context

interface
should use this method.

This method uses the specified state factories in
the

Context.STATE_FACTORIES

property from the environment
properties, and from the provider resource file associated with

nameCtx

, in that order.
The value of this property is a colon-separated list of factory
class names that are tried in order, and the first one that succeeds
in returning the object's state is the one used.
If no object's state can be retrieved in this way, return the
object itself.
If an exception is encountered while retrieving the state, the
exception is passed up to the caller.

Note that a state factory
(an object that implements the StateFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.

The

name

and

nameCtx

parameters may
optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created.
See the description of "Name and Context Parameters" in

ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()

for details.

This method may return a

Referenceable

object. The
service provider obtaining this object may choose to store it
directly, or to extract its reference (using

Referenceable.getReference()

) and store that instead.

**Parameters:**
- obj

- The non-null object for which to get state to bind.
- name

- The name of this object relative to

nameCtx

,
or null if no name is specified.
- nameCtx

- The context relative to which the

name

parameter is specified, or null if

name

is
relative to the default initial context.
- environment

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the state factory and
the object's state.

**Returns:**
- The non-null object representing

obj

's state for
binding. It could be the object (

obj

) itself.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If one of the factories accessed throws an
exception, or if an error was encountered while loading
and instantiating the factory and object classes.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.

- setObjectFactoryBuilder

```java
public static void setObjectFactoryBuilder​(

The ObjectFactoryBuilder determines the policy used when
trying to load object factories.
See getObjectInstance() and class ObjectFactory for a description
of the default policy.
setObjectFactoryBuilder() overrides this default policy by installing
an ObjectFactoryBuilder. Subsequent object factories will
be loaded and created using the installed builder.

The builder can only be installed if the executing thread is allowed
(by the security manager's checkSetFactory() method) to do so.
Once installed, the builder cannot be replaced.

**Parameters:** builder

- The factory builder to install. If null, no builder
is installed.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- builder cannot be installed
for security reasons.
**Throws:** NamingException

- builder cannot be installed for
a non-security-related reason.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If a factory has already been installed.

If an object factory builder has been installed, it is used to
create a factory for creating the object.
Otherwise, the following rules are used to create the object:

- If

refInfo

is a

use the named factory to create the object.
Return

refInfo

if the factory cannot be created.
Under JDK 1.1, if the factory class must be loaded from a location
specified in the reference, a

SecurityManager

must have
been installed or the factory creation will fail.
If an exception is encountered while creating the factory,
it is passed up to the caller.

If

refInfo

is a

Reference

or

Referenceable

with no factory class name,
and the address or addresses are

StringRefAddr

s with
address type "URL",
try the URL context factory corresponding to each URL's scheme id
to create the object (see

getURLContext()

).
If that fails, continue to the next step.

Use the object factories specified in
the

Context.OBJECT_FACTORIES

property of the environment,
and of the provider resource file associated with

nameCtx

, in that order.
The value of this property is a colon-separated list of factory
class names that are tried in order, and the first one that succeeds
in creating an object is the one used.
If none of the factories can be loaded,
return

Service providers that implement only the

Context

interface should use this method.

Note that an object factory (an object that implements the ObjectFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the object factory and the object.
**Returns:** An object created using

if an object cannot be created using
the algorithm described above.
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception was encountered
while attempting to get a URL context, or if one of the
factories accessed throws a NamingException.
**Throws:** Exception

- if one of the factories accessed throws an
exception, or if an error was encountered while loading
and instantiating the factory and object classes.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.

- getURLContext

```java
public static
Context
getURLContext​(
String
scheme,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates a context for the given URL scheme id.

The resulting context is for resolving URLs of the
scheme

scheme

. The resulting context is not tied
to a specific URL. It is able to handle arbitrary URLs with
the specified scheme.

The class name of the factory that creates the resulting context
has the naming convention

scheme-id

URLContextFactory
(e.g. "ftpURLContextFactory" for the "ftp" scheme-id),
in the package specified as follows.
The

Context.URL_PKG_PREFIXES

environment property (which
may contain values taken from system properties,
or application resource files)
contains a colon-separated list of package prefixes.
Each package prefix in
the property is tried in the order specified to load the factory class.
The default package prefix is "com.sun.jndi.url" (if none of the
specified packages work, this default is tried).
The complete package name is constructed using the package prefix,
concatenated with the scheme id.

For example, if the scheme id is "ldap", and the

Context.URL_PKG_PREFIXES

property
contains "com.widget:com.wiz.jndi",
the naming manager would attempt to load the following classes
until one is successfully instantiated:

- com.widget.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

com.wiz.jndi.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

com.sun.jndi.url.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

If none of the package prefixes work, null is returned.

If a factory is instantiated, it is invoked with the following
parameters to produce the resulting context.

factory.getObjectInstance(null, environment);

For example, invoking getObjectInstance() as shown above
on a LDAP URL context factory would return a
context that can resolve LDAP urls
(e.g. "ldap://ldap.wiz.com/o=wiz,c=us",
"ldap://ldap.umich.edu/o=umich,c=us", ...).

Note that an object factory (an object that implements the ObjectFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.

**Parameters:** scheme

- The non-null scheme-id of the URLs supported by the context.
**Parameters:** environment

- The possibly null environment properties to be
used in the creation of the object factory and the context.
**Returns:** A context for resolving URLs with the
scheme id

scheme

;

null

if the factory for creating the
context is not found.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If a naming exception occurs while creating
the context.
**See Also:** getObjectInstance(java.lang.Object, javax.naming.Name, javax.naming.Context, java.util.Hashtable<?, ?>)

,

- getInitialContext

```java
public static
Context
getInitialContext​(
Hashtable
<?,​?> env)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates an initial context using the specified environment
properties.

This is done as follows:

- If an InitialContextFactoryBuilder has been installed,
it is used to create the factory for creating the initial
context
- Otherwise, the class specified in the

Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY

environment property
is used

- First, the

ServiceLoader

mechanism tries to locate an

InitialContextFactory

provider using the current thread's context class loader
- Failing that, this implementation tries to locate a suitable

InitialContextFactory

using a built-in mechanism

(Note that an initial context factory (an object that implements
the InitialContextFactory interface) must be public and must have
a public constructor that accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must
be in a package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.)

**Parameters:** env

- The possibly null environment properties used when
creating the context.
**Returns:** A non-null initial context.
**Throws:** NoInitialContextException

- If the

Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY

property
is not found or names a nonexistent
class or a class that cannot be instantiated,
or if the initial context could not be created for some other
reason.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If some other naming exception was encountered.
**See Also:** InitialContext

,

InitialDirContext

- setInitialContextFactoryBuilder

```java
public static void setInitialContextFactoryBuilder​(
InitialContextFactoryBuilder
builder)
throws
NamingException
```

Sets the InitialContextFactory builder to be builder.

The builder can only be installed if the executing thread is allowed by
the security manager to do so. Once installed, the builder cannot
be replaced.

**Parameters:** builder

- The initial context factory builder to install. If null,
no builder is set.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- builder cannot be installed for security
reasons.
**Throws:** NamingException

- builder cannot be installed for
a non-security-related reason.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If a builder was previous installed.
**See Also:** hasInitialContextFactoryBuilder()

,

SecurityManager.checkSetFactory()

- hasInitialContextFactoryBuilder

```java
public static boolean hasInitialContextFactoryBuilder()
```

Determines whether an initial context factory builder has
been set.

**Returns:** true if an initial context factory builder has
been set; false otherwise.
**See Also:** setInitialContextFactoryBuilder(javax.naming.spi.InitialContextFactoryBuilder)

- getContinuationContext

```java
public static
Context
getContinuationContext​(
CannotProceedException
cpe)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates a context in which to continue a context operation.

In performing an operation on a name that spans multiple
namespaces, a context from one naming system may need to pass
the operation on to the next naming system. The context
implementation does this by first constructing a

CannotProceedException

containing information
pinpointing how far it has proceeded. It then obtains a
continuation context from JNDI by calling

getContinuationContext

. The context
implementation should then resume the context operation by
invoking the same operation on the continuation context, using
the remainder of the name that has not yet been resolved.

Before making use of the

cpe

parameter, this method
updates the environment associated with that object by setting
the value of the property

CPE

to

cpe

. This property will be inherited by the
continuation context, and may be used by that context's
service provider to inspect the fields of this exception.

**Parameters:** cpe

- The non-null exception that triggered this continuation.
**Returns:** A non-null Context object for continuing the operation.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If a naming exception occurred.

- getStateToBind

```java
public static
Object
getStateToBind​(
Object
obj,

Name
name,

Context
nameCtx,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the state of an object for binding.

Service providers that implement the

DirContext

interface
should use

DirectoryManager.getStateToBind()

, not this method.
Service providers that implement only the

Context

interface
should use this method.

This method uses the specified state factories in
the

Context.STATE_FACTORIES

property from the environment
properties, and from the provider resource file associated with

nameCtx

, in that order.
The value of this property is a colon-separated list of factory
class names that are tried in order, and the first one that succeeds
in returning the object's state is the one used.
If no object's state can be retrieved in this way, return the
object itself.
If an exception is encountered while retrieving the state, the
exception is passed up to the caller.

Note that a state factory
(an object that implements the StateFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.

The

name

and

nameCtx

parameters may
optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created.
See the description of "Name and Context Parameters" in

ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()

for details.

This method may return a

Referenceable

object. The
service provider obtaining this object may choose to store it
directly, or to extract its reference (using

Referenceable.getReference()

) and store that instead.

**Parameters:** obj

- The non-null object for which to get state to bind.
**Parameters:** name

- The name of this object relative to

nameCtx

,
or null if no name is specified.
**Parameters:** nameCtx

- The context relative to which the

name

parameter is specified, or null if

name

is
relative to the default initial context.
**Parameters:** environment

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the state factory and
the object's state.
**Returns:** The non-null object representing

obj

's state for
binding. It could be the object (

obj

) itself.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If one of the factories accessed throws an
exception, or if an error was encountered while loading
and instantiating the factory and object classes.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.

Method Detail

- setObjectFactoryBuilder

```java
public static void setObjectFactoryBuilder​(
ObjectFactoryBuilder
builder)
throws
NamingException
```

The ObjectFactoryBuilder determines the policy used when
trying to load object factories.
See getObjectInstance() and class ObjectFactory for a description
of the default policy.
setObjectFactoryBuilder() overrides this default policy by installing
an ObjectFactoryBuilder. Subsequent object factories will
be loaded and created using the installed builder.

The builder can only be installed if the executing thread is allowed
(by the security manager's checkSetFactory() method) to do so.
Once installed, the builder cannot be replaced.

**Parameters:** builder

- The factory builder to install. If null, no builder
is installed.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- builder cannot be installed
for security reasons.
**Throws:** NamingException

- builder cannot be installed for
a non-security-related reason.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If a factory has already been installed.

- getObjectInstance

```java
public static
Object
getObjectInstance​(
Object
refInfo,

Name
name,

Context
nameCtx,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment)
throws
Exception
```

Creates an instance of an object for the specified object
and environment.

If an object factory builder has been installed, it is used to
create a factory for creating the object.
Otherwise, the following rules are used to create the object:

- If

refInfo

is a

Reference

or

Referenceable

containing a factory class name,
use the named factory to create the object.
Return

refInfo

if the factory cannot be created.
Under JDK 1.1, if the factory class must be loaded from a location
specified in the reference, a

SecurityManager

must have
been installed or the factory creation will fail.
If an exception is encountered while creating the factory,
it is passed up to the caller.

If

refInfo

is a

Reference

or

Referenceable

with no factory class name,
and the address or addresses are

StringRefAddr

s with
address type "URL",
try the URL context factory corresponding to each URL's scheme id
to create the object (see

getURLContext()

).
If that fails, continue to the next step.

Use the object factories specified in
the

Context.OBJECT_FACTORIES

property of the environment,
and of the provider resource file associated with

nameCtx

, in that order.
The value of this property is a colon-separated list of factory
class names that are tried in order, and the first one that succeeds
in creating an object is the one used.
If none of the factories can be loaded,
return

refInfo

.
If an exception is encountered while creating the object, the
exception is passed up to the caller.

Service providers that implement the

DirContext

interface should use

DirectoryManager.getObjectInstance()

, not this method.
Service providers that implement only the

Context

interface should use this method.

Note that an object factory (an object that implements the ObjectFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.

The

name

and

nameCtx

parameters may
optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created.

name

is the name of the object, relative to context

nameCtx

. This information could be useful to the object
factory or to the object implementation.
If there are several possible contexts from which the object
could be named -- as will often be the case -- it is up to
the caller to select one. A good rule of thumb is to select the
"deepest" context available.
If

nameCtx

is null,

name

is relative
to the default initial context. If no name is being specified, the

name

parameter should be null.

**Parameters:** refInfo

- The possibly null object for which to create an object.
**Parameters:** name

- The name of this object relative to

nameCtx

.
Specifying a name is optional; if it is
omitted,

name

should be null.
**Parameters:** nameCtx

- The context relative to which the

name

parameter is specified. If null,

name

is
relative to the default initial context.
**Parameters:** environment

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the object factory and the object.
**Returns:** An object created using

refInfo

; or

refInfo

if an object cannot be created using
the algorithm described above.
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception was encountered
while attempting to get a URL context, or if one of the
factories accessed throws a NamingException.
**Throws:** Exception

- if one of the factories accessed throws an
exception, or if an error was encountered while loading
and instantiating the factory and object classes.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.

- getURLContext

```java
public static
Context
getURLContext​(
String
scheme,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates a context for the given URL scheme id.

The resulting context is for resolving URLs of the
scheme

scheme

. The resulting context is not tied
to a specific URL. It is able to handle arbitrary URLs with
the specified scheme.

The class name of the factory that creates the resulting context
has the naming convention

scheme-id

URLContextFactory
(e.g. "ftpURLContextFactory" for the "ftp" scheme-id),
in the package specified as follows.
The

Context.URL_PKG_PREFIXES

environment property (which
may contain values taken from system properties,
or application resource files)
contains a colon-separated list of package prefixes.
Each package prefix in
the property is tried in the order specified to load the factory class.
The default package prefix is "com.sun.jndi.url" (if none of the
specified packages work, this default is tried).
The complete package name is constructed using the package prefix,
concatenated with the scheme id.

For example, if the scheme id is "ldap", and the

Context.URL_PKG_PREFIXES

property
contains "com.widget:com.wiz.jndi",
the naming manager would attempt to load the following classes
until one is successfully instantiated:

- com.widget.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

com.wiz.jndi.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

com.sun.jndi.url.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

If none of the package prefixes work, null is returned.

If a factory is instantiated, it is invoked with the following
parameters to produce the resulting context.

factory.getObjectInstance(null, environment);

For example, invoking getObjectInstance() as shown above
on a LDAP URL context factory would return a
context that can resolve LDAP urls
(e.g. "ldap://ldap.wiz.com/o=wiz,c=us",
"ldap://ldap.umich.edu/o=umich,c=us", ...).

Note that an object factory (an object that implements the ObjectFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.

**Parameters:** scheme

- The non-null scheme-id of the URLs supported by the context.
**Parameters:** environment

- The possibly null environment properties to be
used in the creation of the object factory and the context.
**Returns:** A context for resolving URLs with the
scheme id

scheme

;

null

if the factory for creating the
context is not found.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If a naming exception occurs while creating
the context.
**See Also:** getObjectInstance(java.lang.Object, javax.naming.Name, javax.naming.Context, java.util.Hashtable<?, ?>)

,

- getInitialContext

```java
public static
Context
getInitialContext​(
Hashtable

throws
NamingException
```

Creates an initial context using the specified environment
properties.

This is done as follows:

- If an InitialContextFactoryBuilder has been installed,
it is used to create the factory for creating the initial
context
- Otherwise, the class specified in the

Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY

environment property
is used

- First, the

ServiceLoader

mechanism tries to locate an

InitialContextFactory

provider using the current thread's context class loader
- Failing that, this implementation tries to locate a suitable

InitialContextFactory

the InitialContextFactory interface) must be public and must have
a public constructor that accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must
be in a package which is exported by that module to the

module.)

**Parameters:** env

- The possibly null environment properties used when
creating the context.
**Returns:** A non-null initial context.
**Throws:** NoInitialContextException

- If the

Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY

property
is not found or names a nonexistent
class or a class that cannot be instantiated,
or if the initial context could not be created for some other
reason.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If some other naming exception was encountered.
**See Also:** InitialContext

,

InitialDirContext

- setInitialContextFactoryBuilder

```java
public static void setInitialContextFactoryBuilder​(

```

Sets the InitialContextFactory builder to be builder.

The builder can only be installed if the executing thread is allowed by
the security manager to do so. Once installed, the builder cannot
be replaced.

**Parameters:** builder

- The initial context factory builder to install. If null,
no builder is set.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- builder cannot be installed for security
reasons.
**Throws:** NamingException

- builder cannot be installed for
a non-security-related reason.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If a builder was previous installed.
**See Also:** hasInitialContextFactoryBuilder()

Determines whether an initial context factory builder has
been set.

**Returns:** true if an initial context factory builder has
been set; false otherwise.
**See Also:** setInitialContextFactoryBuilder(javax.naming.spi.InitialContextFactoryBuilder)

- getContinuationContext

```java
public static
Context
getContinuationContext​(
CannotProceedException
cpe)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates a context in which to continue a context operation.

In performing an operation on a name that spans multiple
namespaces, a context from one naming system may need to pass
the operation on to the next naming system. The context
implementation does this by first constructing a

CannotProceedException

containing information
pinpointing how far it has proceeded. It then obtains a
continuation context from JNDI by calling

getContinuationContext

. The context
implementation should then resume the context operation by
invoking the same operation on the continuation context, using
the remainder of the name that has not yet been resolved.

Before making use of the

cpe

parameter, this method
updates the environment associated with that object by setting
the value of the property

CPE

to

cpe

. This property will be inherited by the
continuation context, and may be used by that context's
service provider to inspect the fields of this exception.

**Parameters:** cpe

- The non-null exception that triggered this continuation.
**Returns:** A non-null Context object for continuing the operation.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If a naming exception occurred.

- getStateToBind

```java
public static
Object
getStateToBind​(
Object
obj,

Name
name,

Context
nameCtx,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the state of an object for binding.

Service providers that implement the

DirContext

interface
should use

DirectoryManager.getStateToBind()

, not this method.
Service providers that implement only the

Context

interface
should use this method.

This method uses the specified state factories in
the

Context.STATE_FACTORIES

property from the environment
properties, and from the provider resource file associated with

nameCtx

, in that order.
The value of this property is a colon-separated list of factory
class names that are tried in order, and the first one that succeeds
in returning the object's state is the one used.
If no object's state can be retrieved in this way, return the
object itself.
If an exception is encountered while retrieving the state, the
exception is passed up to the caller.

Note that a state factory
(an object that implements the StateFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.

The

name

and

nameCtx

parameters may
optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created.
See the description of "Name and Context Parameters" in

ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()

for details.

This method may return a

Referenceable

object. The
service provider obtaining this object may choose to store it
directly, or to extract its reference (using

Referenceable.getReference()

) and store that instead.

**Parameters:** obj

- The non-null object for which to get state to bind.
**Parameters:** name

- The name of this object relative to

nameCtx

,
or null if no name is specified.
**Parameters:** nameCtx

- The context relative to which the

name

parameter is specified, or null if

name

is
relative to the default initial context.
**Parameters:** environment

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the state factory and
the object's state.
**Returns:** The non-null object representing

obj

's state for
binding. It could be the object (

obj

) itself.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If one of the factories accessed throws an
exception, or if an error was encountered while loading
and instantiating the factory and object classes.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.

Note that an object factory (an object that implements the ObjectFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

module.

The

name

and

nameCtx

parameters may
optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created.

is the name of the object, relative to context

nameCtx

. This information could be useful to the object
factory or to the object implementation.
If there are several possible contexts from which the object
could be named -- as will often be the case -- it is up to
the caller to select one. A good rule of thumb is to select the
"deepest" context available.
If

nameCtx

is null,

name

is relative
to the default initial context. If no name is being specified, the

name

parameter should be null.

**Parameters:** refInfo

- The possibly null object for which to create an object.
**Parameters:** name

- The name of this object relative to

nameCtx

.
Specifying a name is optional; if it is
omitted,

name

should be null.
**Parameters:** nameCtx

- The context relative to which the

name

parameter is specified. If null,

name

is
relative to the default initial context.
**Parameters:** environment

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the object factory and the object.
**Returns:** An object created using

refInfo

; or

refInfo

if an object cannot be created using
the algorithm described above.
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception was encountered
while attempting to get a URL context, or if one of the
factories accessed throws a NamingException.
**Throws:** Exception

- if one of the factories accessed throws an
exception, or if an error was encountered while loading
and instantiating the factory and object classes.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.

getURLContext

```java
public static
Context
getURLContext​(
String
scheme,

<?,​?> environment)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates a context for the given URL scheme id.

The resulting context is for resolving URLs of the
scheme

scheme

. The resulting context is not tied
to a specific URL. It is able to handle arbitrary URLs with
the specified scheme.

The class name of the factory that creates the resulting context
has the naming convention

scheme-id

URLContextFactory
(e.g. "ftpURLContextFactory" for the "ftp" scheme-id),
in the package specified as follows.
The

Context.URL_PKG_PREFIXES

environment property (which
may contain values taken from system properties,
or application resource files)
contains a colon-separated list of package prefixes.
Each package prefix in
the property is tried in the order specified to load the factory class.
The default package prefix is "com.sun.jndi.url" (if none of the
specified packages work, this default is tried).
The complete package name is constructed using the package prefix,
concatenated with the scheme id.

For example, if the scheme id is "ldap", and the

Context.URL_PKG_PREFIXES

property
contains "com.widget:com.wiz.jndi",
the naming manager would attempt to load the following classes
until one is successfully instantiated:

- com.widget.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

com.wiz.jndi.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

com.sun.jndi.url.ldap.ldapURLContextFactory

If none of the package prefixes work, null is returned.

If a factory is instantiated, it is invoked with the following
parameters to produce the resulting context.

factory.getObjectInstance(null, environment);

For example, invoking getObjectInstance() as shown above
on a LDAP URL context factory would return a
context that can resolve LDAP urls
(e.g. "ldap://ldap.wiz.com/o=wiz,c=us",
"ldap://ldap.umich.edu/o=umich,c=us", ...).

Note that an object factory (an object that implements the ObjectFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.

**Parameters:** scheme

- The non-null scheme-id of the URLs supported by the context.
**Parameters:** environment

- The possibly null environment properties to be
used in the creation of the object factory and the context.
**Returns:** A context for resolving URLs with the
scheme id

scheme

;

null

if the factory for creating the
context is not found.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If a naming exception occurs while creating
the context.

throws
NamingException
```

Creates a context in which to continue a context operation.

In performing an operation on a name that spans multiple
namespaces, a context from one naming system may need to pass
the operation on to the next naming system. The context
implementation does this by first constructing a

CannotProceedException

containing information
pinpointing how far it has proceeded. It then obtains a
continuation context from JNDI by calling

getContinuationContext

. The context
implementation should then resume the context operation by
invoking the same operation on the continuation context, using
the remainder of the name that has not yet been resolved.

Before making use of the

cpe

parameter, this method
updates the environment associated with that object by setting
the value of the property

CPE

to

cpe

. This property will be inherited by the
continuation context, and may be used by that context's
service provider to inspect the fields of this exception.

**Parameters:** cpe

- The non-null exception that triggered this continuation.
**Returns:** A non-null Context object for continuing the operation.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If a naming exception occurred.

getStateToBind

```java

Object
getStateToBind​(
Object
obj,

Name
name,

Context
nameCtx,

Hashtable
<?,​?> environment)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the state of an object for binding.

Service providers that implement the

DirContext

interface
should use

DirectoryManager.getStateToBind()

, not this method.
Service providers that implement only the

Context

interface
should use this method.

This method uses the specified state factories in
the

Context.STATE_FACTORIES

property from the environment
properties, and from the provider resource file associated with

nameCtx

, in that order.
The value of this property is a colon-separated list of factory
class names that are tried in order, and the first one that succeeds
in returning the object's state is the one used.
If no object's state can be retrieved in this way, return the
object itself.
If an exception is encountered while retrieving the state, the
exception is passed up to the caller.

Note that a state factory
(an object that implements the StateFactory
interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
accepts no arguments.
In cases where the factory is in a named module then it must be in a
package which is exported by that module to the

java.naming

module.

The

name

and

nameCtx

parameters may
optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created.
See the description of "Name and Context Parameters" in

ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()

for details.

This method may return a

Referenceable

object. The
service provider obtaining this object may choose to store it
directly, or to extract its reference (using

Referenceable.getReference()

) and store that instead.

**Parameters:** obj

- The non-null object for which to get state to bind.
**Parameters:** name

- The name of this object relative to

nameCtx

,
or null if no name is specified.
**Parameters:** nameCtx

- The context relative to which the

name

parameter is specified, or null if

name

is
relative to the default initial context.
**Parameters:** environment

- The possibly null environment to
be used in the creation of the state factory and
the object's state.
**Returns:** The non-null object representing

obj

's state for
binding. It could be the object (

obj

) itself.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If one of the factories accessed throws an
exception, or if an error was encountered while loading
and instantiating the factory and object classes.
A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.
