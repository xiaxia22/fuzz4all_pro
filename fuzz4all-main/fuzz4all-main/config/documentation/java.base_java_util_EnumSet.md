# Class EnumSet<E extends Enum <E>>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\EnumSet.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
EnumSet<E extends
Enum
<E>>

extends
AbstractSet
<E>
implements
Cloneable
,
Serializable
```

A specialized

Set

implementation for use with enum types. All of
the elements in an enum set must come from a single enum type that is
specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the set is created. Enum sets
are represented internally as bit vectors. This representation is
extremely compact and efficient. The space and time performance of this
class should be good enough to allow its use as a high-quality, typesafe
alternative to traditional

int

-based "bit flags." Even bulk
operations (such as

containsAll

and

retainAll

) should
run very quickly if their argument is also an enum set.

The iterator returned by the

iterator

method traverses the
elements in their

natural order

(the order in which the enum
constants are declared). The returned iterator is

weakly
consistent

: it will never throw

ConcurrentModificationException

and it may or may not show the effects of any modifications to the set that
occur while the iteration is in progress.

Null elements are not permitted. Attempts to insert a null element
will throw

NullPointerException

. Attempts to test for the
presence of a null element or to remove one will, however, function
properly.

Like most collection implementations,

EnumSet

is not
synchronized. If multiple threads access an enum set concurrently, and at
least one of the threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized
externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some
object that naturally encapsulates the enum set. If no such object exists,
the set should be "wrapped" using the

Collections.synchronizedSet(java.util.Set<T>)

method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
unsynchronized access:

```java
Set<MyEnum> s = Collections.synchronizedSet(EnumSet.noneOf(MyEnum.class));
```

Implementation note: All basic operations execute in constant time.
They are likely (though not guaranteed) to be much faster than their

HashSet

counterparts. Even bulk operations execute in
constant time if their argument is also an enum set.

This class is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

- The class of the elements in the set

---

#### public static <E extends
Enum
<E>>
EnumSet
<E> copyOf​(
Collection
<E> c)

Creates an enum set initialized from the specified collection. If
the specified collection is an

EnumSet

instance, this static
factory method behaves identically to

copyOf(EnumSet)

.
Otherwise, the specified collection must contain at least one element
(in order to determine the new enum set's element type).

**Parameters:**
- c

- the collection from which to initialize this enum set

**Returns:**
- An enum set initialized from the given collection.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

c

is not an

EnumSet

instance and contains no elements
- NullPointerException

- if

c

is null

**Type Parameters:**
- E

- The class of the elements in the collection

---

#### public static <E extends
Enum
<E>>
EnumSet
<E> complementOf​(
EnumSet
<E> s)

Creates an enum set with the same element type as the specified enum
set, initially containing all the elements of this type that are

not

contained in the specified set.

**Parameters:**
- s

- the enum set from whose complement to initialize this enum set

**Returns:**
- The complement of the specified set in this set

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

s

is null

**Type Parameters:**
- E

- The class of the elements in the enum set

---

#### public static <E extends
Enum
<E>>
EnumSet
<E> of​(E e)

Creates an enum set initially containing the specified element.

Overloadings of this method exist to initialize an enum set with
one through five elements. A sixth overloading is provided that
uses the varargs feature. This overloading may be used to create
an enum set initially containing an arbitrary number of elements, but
is likely to run slower than the overloadings that do not use varargs.

**Parameters:**
- e

- the element that this set is to contain initially

**Returns:**
- an enum set initially containing the specified element

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

e

is null

**Type Parameters:**

<E>>

EnumSet

<E> of​(E e1,
E e2,
E e3,
E e4,
E e5)

Creates an enum set initially containing the specified elements.

Overloadings of this method exist to initialize an enum set with
one through five elements. A sixth overloading is provided that
uses the varargs feature. This overloading may be used to create
an enum set initially containing an arbitrary number of elements, but
is likely to run slower than the overloadings that do not use varargs.

of

```java
@SafeVarargs

public static <E extends
Enum
<E>>
EnumSet
<E> of​(E first,
E... rest)
```

Creates an enum set initially containing the specified elements.
This factory, whose parameter list uses the varargs feature, may
be used to create an enum set initially containing an arbitrary
number of elements, but it is likely to run slower than the overloadings
that do not use varargs.

**Type Parameters:** E

- The class of the parameter elements and of the set
**Parameters:** first

- an element that the set is to contain initially
**Parameters:** rest

- the remaining elements the set is to contain initially
**Returns:** an enum set initially containing the specified elements
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the specified elements are null,
or if

rest

is null

be used to create an enum set initially containing an arbitrary
number of elements, but it is likely to run slower than the overloadings
that do not use varargs.

range

```java
public static <E extends
Enum
<E>>
EnumSet
<E> range​(E from,
E to)
```

Creates an enum set initially containing all of the elements in the
range defined by the two specified endpoints. The returned set will
contain the endpoints themselves, which may be identical but must not
be out of order.

**Type Parameters:** E

- The class of the parameter elements and of the set
**Parameters:** from

- the first element in the range
**Parameters:** to

- the last element in the range
**Returns:** an enum set initially containing all of the elements in the
range defined by the two specified endpoints
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

from

or

to

are null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

from.compareTo(to) > 0
