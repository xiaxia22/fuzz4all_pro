# Interface SyncResolver

### Class Description

```java
public interface
SyncResolver

extends
RowSet
```

Defines a framework that allows applications to use a manual decision tree
to decide what should be done when a synchronization conflict occurs.
Although it is not mandatory for
applications to resolve synchronization conflicts manually, this
framework provides the means to delegate to the application when conflicts
arise.

Note that a conflict is a situation where the

RowSet

object's original
values for a row do not match the values in the data source, which indicates that
the data source row has been modified since the last synchronization. Note also that
a

RowSet

object's original values are the values it had just prior to the
the last synchronization, which are not necessarily its initial values.

Description of a

SyncResolver

Object

A

SyncResolver

object is a specialized

RowSet

object
that implements the

SyncResolver

interface.
It

may

operate as either a connected

RowSet

object (an
implementation of the

JdbcRowSet

interface) or a connected

RowSet

object (an implementation of the

CachedRowSet

interface or one of its subinterfaces). For information
on the subinterfaces, see the

javax.sql.rowset

package
description. The reference implementation for

SyncResolver

implements
the

CachedRowSet

interface, but other implementations
may choose to implement the

JdbcRowSet

interface to satisfy
particular needs.

After an application has attempted to synchronize a

RowSet

object with
the data source (by calling the

CachedRowSet

method

acceptChanges

), and one or more conflicts have been found,
a rowset's

SyncProvider

object creates an instance of

SyncResolver

. This new

SyncResolver

object has
the same number of rows and columns as the

RowSet

object that was attempting the synchronization. The

SyncResolver

object contains the values from the data source that caused
the conflict(s) and

null

for all other values.
In addition, it contains information about each conflict.

Getting and Using a

SyncResolver

Object

When the method

acceptChanges

encounters conflicts, the

SyncProvider

object creates a

SyncProviderException

object and sets it with the new

SyncResolver

object. The method

acceptChanges

will throw this exception, which
the application can then catch and use to retrieve the

SyncResolver

object it contains. The following code snippet uses the

SyncProviderException

method

getSyncResolver

to get
the

SyncResolver

object

resolver

.

```java
catch (SyncProviderException spe) {
SyncResolver resolver = spe.getSyncResolver();
...
}

}
```

With

resolver

in hand, an application can use it to get the information
it contains about the conflict or conflicts. A

SyncResolver

object
such as

resolver

keeps
track of the conflicts for each row in which there is a conflict. It also places a
lock on the table or tables affected by the rowset's command so that no more
conflicts can occur while the current conflicts are being resolved.

The following kinds of information can be obtained from a

SyncResolver

object:

What operation was being attempted when a conflict occurred

The

SyncProvider

interface defines four constants
describing states that may occur. Three
constants describe the type of operation (update, delete, or insert) that a

RowSet

object was attempting to perform when a conflict was discovered,
and the fourth indicates that there is no conflict.
These constants are the possible return values when a

SyncResolver

object
calls the method

getStatus

.

```java
int operation = resolver.getStatus();
```

The value in the data source that caused a conflict

A conflict exists when a value that a

RowSet

object has changed
and is attempting to write to the data source
has also been changed in the data source since the last synchronization. An
application can call the

SyncResolver

method

getConflictValue

to retrieve the
value in the data source that is the cause of the conflict because the values in a

SyncResolver

object are the conflict values from the data source.

```java
java.lang.Object conflictValue = resolver.getConflictValue(2);
```

Note that the column in

resolver

can be designated by the column number,
as is done in the preceding line of code, or by the column name.

With the information retrieved from the methods

getStatus

and

getConflictValue

, the application may make a determination as to
which value should be persisted in the data source. The application then calls the

SyncResolver

method

setResolvedValue

, which sets the value
to be persisted in the

RowSet

object and also in the data source.

```java
resolver.setResolvedValue("DEPT", 8390426);
```

In the preceding line of code,
the column name designates the column in the

RowSet

object
that is to be set with the given value. The column number can also be used to
designate the column.

An application calls the method

setResolvedValue

after it has
resolved all of the conflicts in the current conflict row and repeats this process
for each conflict row in the

SyncResolver

object.

Navigating a

SyncResolver

Object

Because a

SyncResolver

object is a

RowSet

object, an
application can use all of the

RowSet

methods for moving the cursor
to navigate a

SyncResolver

object. For example, an application can
use the

RowSet

method

next

to get to each row and then
call the

SyncResolver

method

getStatus

to see if the row
contains a conflict. In a row with one or more conflicts, the application can
iterate through the columns to find any non-null values, which will be the values
from the data source that are in conflict.

To make it easier to navigate a

SyncResolver

object, especially when
there are large numbers of rows with no conflicts, the

SyncResolver

interface defines the methods

nextConflict

and

previousConflict

, which move only to rows
that contain at least one conflict value. Then an application can call the

SyncResolver

method

getConflictValue

, supplying it
with the column number, to get the conflict value itself. The code fragment in the
next section gives an example.

Code Example

The following code fragment demonstrates how a disconnected

RowSet

object

crs

might attempt to synchronize itself with the
underlying data source and then resolve the conflicts. In the

try

block,

crs

calls the method

acceptChanges

, passing it the

Connection

object

con

. If there are no conflicts, the
changes in

crs

are simply written to the data source. However, if there
is a conflict, the method

acceptChanges

throws a

SyncProviderException

object, and the

catch

block takes effect. In this example, which
illustrates one of the many ways a

SyncResolver

object can be used,
the

SyncResolver

method

nextConflict

is used in a

while

loop. The loop will end when

nextConflict

returns

false

, which will occur when there are no more conflict rows in the

SyncResolver

object

resolver

. In This particular code fragment,

resolver

looks for rows that have update conflicts (rows with the status

SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT

), and the rest of this code fragment
executes only for rows where conflicts occurred because

crs

was attempting an
update.

After the cursor for

resolver

has moved to the next conflict row that
has an update conflict, the method

getRow

indicates the number of the
current row, and
the cursor for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

is moved to
the comparable row in

crs

. By iterating
through the columns of that row in both

resolver

and

crs

, the conflicting
values can be retrieved and compared to decide which one should be persisted. In this
code fragment, the value in

crs

is the one set as the resolved value, which means
that it will be used to overwrite the conflict value in the data source.

```java
try {

crs.acceptChanges(con);

} catch (SyncProviderException spe) {

SyncResolver resolver = spe.getSyncResolver();

Object crsValue; // value in the RowSet object
Object resolverValue: // value in the SyncResolver object
Object resolvedValue: // value to be persisted

while(resolver.nextConflict()) {
if(resolver.getStatus() == SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT) {
int row = resolver.getRow();
crs.absolute(row);

int colCount = crs.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
for(int j = 1; j <= colCount; j++) {
if (resolver.getConflictValue(j) != null) {
crsValue = crs.getObject(j);
resolverValue = resolver.getConflictValue(j);
. . .
// compare crsValue and resolverValue to determine
// which should be the resolved value (the value to persist)
resolvedValue = crsValue;

resolver.setResolvedValue(j, resolvedValue);
}
}
}
}
}
```

### Field Details

#### static final int UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT

Indicates that a conflict occurred while the

RowSet

object was
attempting to update a row in the data source.
The values in the data source row to be updated differ from the

RowSet

object's original values for that row, which means that
the row in the data source has been updated or deleted since the last
synchronization.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final int DELETE_ROW_CONFLICT

Indicates that a conflict occurred while the

RowSet

object was
attempting to delete a row in the data source.
The values in the data source row to be updated differ from the

RowSet

object's original values for that row, which means that
the row in the data source has been updated or deleted since the last
synchronization.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final int INSERT_ROW_CONFLICT

Indicates that a conflict occurred while the

RowSet

object was
attempting to insert a row into the data source. This means that a
row with the same primary key as the row to be inserted has been inserted
into the data source since the last synchronization.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final int NO_ROW_CONFLICT

Indicates that

no

conflict occurred while the

RowSet

object
was attempting to update, delete or insert a row in the data source. The values in
the

SyncResolver

will contain

null

values only as an indication
that no information in pertinent to the conflict resolution in this row.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

### Constructor Details

framework provides the means to delegate to the application when conflicts
arise.

Note that a conflict is a situation where the

Description of a

SyncResolver

Object

A

SyncResolver

object is a specialized

RowSet

object
that implements the

SyncResolver

interface.
It

may

operate as either a connected

RowSet

object (an
implementation of the

JdbcRowSet

interface) or a connected

RowSet

object (an implementation of the

CachedRowSet

interface or one of its subinterfaces). For information
on the subinterfaces, see the

javax.sql.rowset

package
description. The reference implementation for

SyncResolver

implements
the

CachedRowSet

interface, but other implementations
may choose to implement the

JdbcRowSet

interface to satisfy
particular needs.

After an application has attempted to synchronize a

RowSet

object with
the data source (by calling the

CachedRowSet

method

acceptChanges

), and one or more conflicts have been found,
a rowset's

SyncProvider

object creates an instance of

SyncResolver

. This new

SyncResolver

object has
the same number of rows and columns as the

RowSet

object that was attempting the synchronization. The

SyncResolver

object contains the values from the data source that caused
the conflict(s) and

null

for all other values.
In addition, it contains information about each conflict.

Getting and Using a

SyncResolver

Object

When the method

acceptChanges

encounters conflicts, the

SyncProvider

object creates a

SyncProviderException

object and sets it with the new

SyncResolver

object. The method

acceptChanges

will throw this exception, which
the application can then catch and use to retrieve the

SyncResolver

object it contains. The following code snippet uses the

SyncProviderException

method

getSyncResolver

to get
the

SyncResolver

object

resolver

.

```java
catch (SyncProviderException spe) {
SyncResolver resolver = spe.getSyncResolver();
...
}

}
```

With

resolver

in hand, an application can use it to get the information
it contains about the conflict or conflicts. A

SyncResolver

object
such as

resolver

keeps
track of the conflicts for each row in which there is a conflict. It also places a
lock on the table or tables affected by the rowset's command so that no more
conflicts can occur while the current conflicts are being resolved.

The following kinds of information can be obtained from a

SyncResolver

object:

What operation was being attempted when a conflict occurred

The

SyncProvider

interface defines four constants
describing states that may occur. Three
constants describe the type of operation (update, delete, or insert) that a

RowSet

object was attempting to perform when a conflict was discovered,
and the fourth indicates that there is no conflict.
These constants are the possible return values when a

SyncResolver

object
calls the method

getStatus

.

```java
int operation = resolver.getStatus();
```

The value in the data source that caused a conflict

A conflict exists when a value that a

RowSet

object has changed
and is attempting to write to the data source
has also been changed in the data source since the last synchronization. An
application can call the

SyncResolver

method

getConflictValue

to retrieve the
value in the data source that is the cause of the conflict because the values in a

SyncResolver

object are the conflict values from the data source.

```java
java.lang.Object conflictValue = resolver.getConflictValue(2);
```

Note that the column in

resolver

can be designated by the column number,
as is done in the preceding line of code, or by the column name.

With the information retrieved from the methods

getStatus

and

getConflictValue

, the application may make a determination as to
which value should be persisted in the data source. The application then calls the

SyncResolver

method

setResolvedValue

, which sets the value
to be persisted in the

RowSet

object and also in the data source.

```java
resolver.setResolvedValue("DEPT", 8390426);
```

In the preceding line of code,
the column name designates the column in the

RowSet

object
that is to be set with the given value. The column number can also be used to
designate the column.

An application calls the method

setResolvedValue

after it has
resolved all of the conflicts in the current conflict row and repeats this process
for each conflict row in the

SyncResolver

object.

Navigating a

SyncResolver

Object

Because a

SyncResolver

object is a

RowSet

object, an
application can use all of the

RowSet

methods for moving the cursor
to navigate a

SyncResolver

object. For example, an application can
use the

RowSet

method

next

to get to each row and then
call the

SyncResolver

method

getStatus

to see if the row
contains a conflict. In a row with one or more conflicts, the application can
iterate through the columns to find any non-null values, which will be the values
from the data source that are in conflict.

To make it easier to navigate a

SyncResolver

object, especially when
there are large numbers of rows with no conflicts, the

SyncResolver

interface defines the methods

nextConflict

and

previousConflict

, which move only to rows
that contain at least one conflict value. Then an application can call the

SyncResolver

method

getConflictValue

, supplying it
with the column number, to get the conflict value itself. The code fragment in the
next section gives an example.

Code Example

The following code fragment demonstrates how a disconnected

RowSet

object

crs

might attempt to synchronize itself with the
underlying data source and then resolve the conflicts. In the

try

block,

crs

calls the method

acceptChanges

, passing it the

Connection

object

con

. If there are no conflicts, the
changes in

crs

are simply written to the data source. However, if there
is a conflict, the method

acceptChanges

throws a

SyncProviderException

object, and the

catch

block takes effect. In this example, which
illustrates one of the many ways a

SyncResolver

object can be used,
the

SyncResolver

method

nextConflict

is used in a

while

loop. The loop will end when

nextConflict

returns

false

, which will occur when there are no more conflict rows in the

SyncResolver

object

resolver

. In This particular code fragment,

resolver

looks for rows that have update conflicts (rows with the status

SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT

), and the rest of this code fragment
executes only for rows where conflicts occurred because

crs

was attempting an
update.

After the cursor for

resolver

has moved to the next conflict row that
has an update conflict, the method

getRow

indicates the number of the
current row, and
the cursor for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

is moved to
the comparable row in

crs

. By iterating
through the columns of that row in both

resolver

and

crs

, the conflicting
values can be retrieved and compared to decide which one should be persisted. In this
code fragment, the value in

crs

is the one set as the resolved value, which means
that it will be used to overwrite the conflict value in the data source.

```java
try {

crs.acceptChanges(con);

} catch (SyncProviderException spe) {

SyncResolver resolver = spe.getSyncResolver();

Object crsValue; // value in the RowSet object
Object resolverValue: // value in the SyncResolver object
Object resolvedValue: // value to be persisted

while(resolver.nextConflict()) {
if(resolver.getStatus() == SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT) {
int row = resolver.getRow();
crs.absolute(row);

int colCount = crs.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
for(int j = 1; j <= colCount; j++) {
if (resolver.getConflictValue(j) != null) {
crsValue = crs.getObject(j);
resolverValue = resolver.getConflictValue(j);
. . .
// compare crsValue and resolverValue to determine
// which should be the resolved value (the value to persist)
resolvedValue = crsValue;

resolver.setResolvedValue(j, resolvedValue);
}
}
}
}
}

After an application has attempted to synchronize a

the data source (by calling the

acceptChanges

), and one or more conflicts have been found,
a rowset's

SyncProvider

object creates an instance of

In addition, it contains information about each conflict.

Getting and Using a

When the method

encounters conflicts, the

SyncProvider

object creates a

object and sets it with the new

SyncResolver

object. The method

acceptChanges

will throw this exception, which
the application can then catch and use to retrieve the

```

With

in hand, an application can use it to get the information
it contains about the conflict or conflicts. A

SyncResolver

object
such as

keeps
track of the conflicts for each row in which there is a conflict. It also places a

These constants are the possible return values when a

.

```java
int operation = resolver.getStatus();
```

The value in the data source that caused a conflict

A conflict exists when a value that a

RowSet

object has changed
and is attempting to write to the data source
has also been changed in the data source since the last synchronization. An
application can call the

SyncResolver

method

getConflictValue

to retrieve the
value in the data source that is the cause of the conflict because the values in a

SyncResolver

object are the conflict values from the data source.

```java
java.lang.Object conflictValue = resolver.getConflictValue(2);
```

Note that the column in

resolver

can be designated by the column number,
as is done in the preceding line of code, or by the column name.

With the information retrieved from the methods

getStatus

and

getConflictValue

, the application may make a determination as to
which value should be persisted in the data source. The application then calls the

SyncResolver

method

setResolvedValue

, which sets the value
to be persisted in the

RowSet

object and also in the data source.

```java
resolver.setResolvedValue("DEPT", 8390426);
```

In the preceding line of code,
the column name designates the column in the

RowSet

object
that is to be set with the given value. The column number can also be used to
designate the column.

An application calls the method

setResolvedValue

after it has
resolved all of the conflicts in the current conflict row and repeats this process
for each conflict row in the

SyncResolver

object.

Navigating a

SyncResolver

Object

Because a

SyncResolver

object is a

RowSet

application can use all of the

RowSet

methods for moving the cursor
to navigate a

SyncResolver

object. For example, an application can
use the

method

getStatus

to see if the row
contains a conflict. In a row with one or more conflicts, the application can
iterate through the columns to find any non-null values, which will be the values
from the data source that are in conflict.

To make it easier to navigate a

there are large numbers of rows with no conflicts, the

previousConflict

, which move only to rows
that contain at least one conflict value. Then an application can call the

SyncResolver

method

nextConflict

is used in a

while

loop. The loop will end when

nextConflict

returns

false

, which will occur when there are no more conflict rows in the

SyncResolver

object

resolver

. In This particular code fragment,

resolver

looks for rows that have update conflicts (rows with the status

SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT

), and the rest of this code fragment
executes only for rows where conflicts occurred because

crs

was attempting an
update.

After the cursor for

resolver

has moved to the next conflict row that
has an update conflict, the method

getRow

indicates the number of the
current row, and
the cursor for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

is moved to
the comparable row in

crs

. By iterating
through the columns of that row in both

resolver

and

crs

, the conflicting
values can be retrieved and compared to decide which one should be persisted. In this
code fragment, the value in

crs

is the one set as the resolved value, which means
that it will be used to overwrite the conflict value in the data source.

```java
try {

crs.acceptChanges(con);

} catch (SyncProviderException spe) {

SyncResolver resolver = spe.getSyncResolver();

Object crsValue; // value in the RowSet object
Object resolverValue: // value in the SyncResolver object
Object resolvedValue: // value to be persisted

while(resolver.nextConflict()) {
if(resolver.getStatus() == SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT) {
int row = resolver.getRow();
crs.absolute(row);

int colCount = crs.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
for(int j = 1; j <= colCount; j++) {
if (resolver.getConflictValue(j) != null) {
crsValue = crs.getObject(j);
resolverValue = resolver.getConflictValue(j);
. . .
// compare crsValue and resolverValue to determine
// which should be the resolved value (the value to persist)
resolvedValue = crsValue;

resolver.setResolvedValue(j, resolvedValue);
}
}
}
}
}
```

Note that a conflict is a situation where the

RowSet

object's original
values for a row do not match the values in the data source, which indicates that
the data source row has been modified since the last synchronization. Note also that
a

RowSet

object's original values are the values it had just prior to the
the last synchronization, which are not necessarily its initial values.

Description of a

SyncResolver

Object

A

SyncResolver

object is a specialized

RowSet

object
that implements the

SyncResolver

interface.
It

may

operate as either a connected

RowSet

object (an
implementation of the

JdbcRowSet

interface) or a connected

RowSet

object (an implementation of the

CachedRowSet

interface or one of its subinterfaces). For information
on the subinterfaces, see the

javax.sql.rowset

package
description. The reference implementation for

SyncResolver

implements
the

CachedRowSet

interface, but other implementations
may choose to implement the

JdbcRowSet

interface to satisfy
particular needs.

After an application has attempted to synchronize a

RowSet

object with
the data source (by calling the

CachedRowSet

method

acceptChanges

), and one or more conflicts have been found,
a rowset's

SyncProvider

object creates an instance of

SyncResolver

. This new

SyncResolver

object has
the same number of rows and columns as the

RowSet

object that was attempting the synchronization. The

SyncResolver

object contains the values from the data source that caused
the conflict(s) and

null

for all other values.
In addition, it contains information about each conflict.

Getting and Using a

SyncResolver

Object

When the method

acceptChanges

encounters conflicts, the

SyncProvider

object creates a

SyncProviderException

object and sets it with the new

SyncResolver

object. The method

acceptChanges

will throw this exception, which
the application can then catch and use to retrieve the

SyncResolver

object it contains. The following code snippet uses the

SyncProviderException

method

getSyncResolver

to get
the

SyncResolver

object

resolver

.

```java
catch (SyncProviderException spe) {
SyncResolver resolver = spe.getSyncResolver();
...
}

}
```

With

resolver

in hand, an application can use it to get the information
it contains about the conflict or conflicts. A

SyncResolver

object
such as

resolver

keeps
track of the conflicts for each row in which there is a conflict. It also places a
lock on the table or tables affected by the rowset's command so that no more
conflicts can occur while the current conflicts are being resolved.

The following kinds of information can be obtained from a

SyncResolver

object:

What operation was being attempted when a conflict occurred

The

SyncProvider

interface defines four constants
describing states that may occur. Three
constants describe the type of operation (update, delete, or insert) that a

RowSet

object was attempting to perform when a conflict was discovered,
and the fourth indicates that there is no conflict.
These constants are the possible return values when a

SyncResolver

object
calls the method

getStatus

.

```java
int operation = resolver.getStatus();
```

The value in the data source that caused a conflict

A conflict exists when a value that a

RowSet

object has changed
and is attempting to write to the data source
has also been changed in the data source since the last synchronization. An
application can call the

SyncResolver

method

getConflictValue

to retrieve the
value in the data source that is the cause of the conflict because the values in a

SyncResolver

object are the conflict values from the data source.

```java
java.lang.Object conflictValue = resolver.getConflictValue(2);
```

Note that the column in

resolver

can be designated by the column number,
as is done in the preceding line of code, or by the column name.

With the information retrieved from the methods

getStatus

and

getConflictValue

, the application may make a determination as to
which value should be persisted in the data source. The application then calls the

SyncResolver

method

setResolvedValue

, which sets the value
to be persisted in the

RowSet

object and also in the data source.

```java
resolver.setResolvedValue("DEPT", 8390426);
```

In the preceding line of code,
the column name designates the column in the

RowSet

object
that is to be set with the given value. The column number can also be used to
designate the column.

An application calls the method

setResolvedValue

after it has
resolved all of the conflicts in the current conflict row and repeats this process
for each conflict row in the

SyncResolver

object.

Navigating a

SyncResolver

Object

Because a

SyncResolver

object is a

RowSet

object, an
application can use all of the

RowSet

methods for moving the cursor
to navigate a

SyncResolver

object. For example, an application can
use the

RowSet

method

next

to get to each row and then
call the

SyncResolver

method

getStatus

to see if the row
contains a conflict. In a row with one or more conflicts, the application can
iterate through the columns to find any non-null values, which will be the values
from the data source that are in conflict.

To make it easier to navigate a

SyncResolver

object, especially when
there are large numbers of rows with no conflicts, the

SyncResolver

interface defines the methods

nextConflict

and

previousConflict

, which move only to rows
that contain at least one conflict value. Then an application can call the

SyncResolver

method

getConflictValue

, supplying it
with the column number, to get the conflict value itself. The code fragment in the
next section gives an example.

Code Example

The following code fragment demonstrates how a disconnected

RowSet

object

crs

might attempt to synchronize itself with the
underlying data source and then resolve the conflicts. In the

try

block,

crs

calls the method

acceptChanges

, passing it the

Connection

object

con

. If there are no conflicts, the
changes in

crs

are simply written to the data source. However, if there
is a conflict, the method

acceptChanges

throws a

SyncProviderException

object, and the

catch

block takes effect. In this example, which
illustrates one of the many ways a

SyncResolver

object can be used,
the

SyncResolver

method

nextConflict

is used in a

while

loop. The loop will end when

nextConflict

returns

false

, which will occur when there are no more conflict rows in the

SyncResolver

object

resolver

. In This particular code fragment,

resolver

looks for rows that have update conflicts (rows with the status

SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT

), and the rest of this code fragment
executes only for rows where conflicts occurred because

crs

was attempting an
update.

After the cursor for

resolver

has moved to the next conflict row that
has an update conflict, the method

getRow

indicates the number of the
current row, and
the cursor for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

is moved to
the comparable row in

crs

. By iterating
through the columns of that row in both

resolver

and

crs

, the conflicting
values can be retrieved and compared to decide which one should be persisted. In this
code fragment, the value in

crs

is the one set as the resolved value, which means
that it will be used to overwrite the conflict value in the data source.

```java
try {

crs.acceptChanges(con);

} catch (SyncProviderException spe) {

SyncResolver resolver = spe.getSyncResolver();

Object crsValue; // value in the RowSet object
Object resolverValue: // value in the SyncResolver object
Object resolvedValue: // value to be persisted

while(resolver.nextConflict()) {
if(resolver.getStatus() == SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT) {
int row = resolver.getRow();
crs.absolute(row);

int colCount = crs.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
for(int j = 1; j <= colCount; j++) {
if (resolver.getConflictValue(j) != null) {
crsValue = crs.getObject(j);
resolverValue = resolver.getConflictValue(j);
. . .
// compare crsValue and resolverValue to determine
// which should be the resolved value (the value to persist)
resolvedValue = crsValue;

resolver.setResolvedValue(j, resolvedValue);
}
}
}
}
}
```

#### Description of a SyncResolver Object

After an application has attempted to synchronize a

a rowset's

When the method

the application can then catch and use to retrieve the

getSyncResolver

to get

}
```

With

In the preceding line of code,
the column name designates the column in the

that is to be set with the given value. The column number can also be used to
designate the column.

An application calls the method

after it has
resolved all of the conflicts in the current conflict row and repeats this process

---

#### What operation was being attempted when a conflict occurred

int operation = resolver.getStatus();

---

#### The value in the data source that caused a conflict

java.lang.Object conflictValue = resolver.getConflictValue(2);

With the information retrieved from the methods

getStatus

and

getConflictValue

, the application may make a determination as to
which value should be persisted in the data source. The application then calls the

SyncResolver

method

setResolvedValue

, which sets the value
to be persisted in the

RowSet

object and also in the data source.

```java
resolver.setResolvedValue("DEPT", 8390426);
```

In the preceding line of code,
the column name designates the column in the

RowSet

object
that is to be set with the given value. The column number can also be used to
designate the column.

An application calls the method

setResolvedValue

after it has
resolved all of the conflicts in the current conflict row and repeats this process
for each conflict row in the

SyncResolver

object.

Navigating a

SyncResolver

Object

Because a

SyncResolver

object is a

RowSet

object, an
application can use all of the

RowSet

methods for moving the cursor
to navigate a

SyncResolver

object. For example, an application can
use the

RowSet

method

next

to get to each row and then
call the

SyncResolver

method

getStatus

to see if the row
contains a conflict. In a row with one or more conflicts, the application can
iterate through the columns to find any non-null values, which will be the values
from the data source that are in conflict.

To make it easier to navigate a

SyncResolver

object, especially when
there are large numbers of rows with no conflicts, the

SyncResolver

interface defines the methods

nextConflict

and

previousConflict

, which move only to rows
that contain at least one conflict value. Then an application can call the

SyncResolver

method

getConflictValue

, supplying it
with the column number, to get the conflict value itself. The code fragment in the
next section gives an example.

Code Example

The following code fragment demonstrates how a disconnected

RowSet

object

crs

might attempt to synchronize itself with the
underlying data source and then resolve the conflicts. In the

try

block,

crs

calls the method

acceptChanges

, passing it the

Connection

object

con

. If there are no conflicts, the
changes in

crs

are simply written to the data source. However, if there
is a conflict, the method

acceptChanges

throws a

SyncProviderException

object, and the

catch

block takes effect. In this example, which
illustrates one of the many ways a

SyncResolver

object can be used,
the

SyncResolver

method

nextConflict

is used in a

while

loop. The loop will end when

nextConflict

returns

false

, which will occur when there are no more conflict rows in the

SyncResolver

object

resolver

. In This particular code fragment,

resolver

looks for rows that have update conflicts (rows with the status

SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT

), and the rest of this code fragment
executes only for rows where conflicts occurred because

crs

was attempting an
update.

After the cursor for

resolver

has moved to the next conflict row that
has an update conflict, the method

getRow

indicates the number of the
current row, and
the cursor for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

is moved to
the comparable row in

crs

. By iterating
through the columns of that row in both

resolver

and

crs

, the conflicting
values can be retrieved and compared to decide which one should be persisted. In this
code fragment, the value in

crs

is the one set as the resolved value, which means
that it will be used to overwrite the conflict value in the data source.

```java
try {

crs.acceptChanges(con);

} catch (SyncProviderException spe) {

SyncResolver resolver = spe.getSyncResolver();

Object crsValue; // value in the RowSet object
Object resolverValue: // value in the SyncResolver object
Object resolvedValue: // value to be persisted

while(resolver.nextConflict()) {
if(resolver.getStatus() == SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT) {
int row = resolver.getRow();
crs.absolute(row);

int colCount = crs.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
for(int j = 1; j <= colCount; j++) {
if (resolver.getConflictValue(j) != null) {
crsValue = crs.getObject(j);
resolverValue = resolver.getConflictValue(j);
. . .
// compare crsValue and resolverValue to determine
// which should be the resolved value (the value to persist)
resolvedValue = crsValue;

resolver.setResolvedValue(j, resolvedValue);
}
}
}
}
}
```

resolver.setResolvedValue("DEPT", 8390426);

An application calls the method

setResolvedValue

after it has
resolved all of the conflicts in the current conflict row and repeats this process
for each conflict row in the

SyncResolver

object.

Navigating a

SyncResolver

Object

Because a

SyncResolver

object is a

RowSet

object, an
application can use all of the

RowSet

methods for moving the cursor
to navigate a

SyncResolver

object. For example, an application can
use the

RowSet

method

next

to get to each row and then
call the

SyncResolver

method

getStatus

to see if the row
contains a conflict. In a row with one or more conflicts, the application can
iterate through the columns to find any non-null values, which will be the values
from the data source that are in conflict.

To make it easier to navigate a

SyncResolver

object, especially when
there are large numbers of rows with no conflicts, the

SyncResolver

interface defines the methods

nextConflict

and

previousConflict

, which move only to rows
that contain at least one conflict value. Then an application can call the

SyncResolver

method

getConflictValue

, supplying it
with the column number, to get the conflict value itself. The code fragment in the
next section gives an example.

Code Example

The following code fragment demonstrates how a disconnected

RowSet

object

crs

might attempt to synchronize itself with the
underlying data source and then resolve the conflicts. In the

try

block,

crs

calls the method

acceptChanges

, passing it the

Connection

object

con

. If there are no conflicts, the
changes in

crs

are simply written to the data source. However, if there
is a conflict, the method

acceptChanges

throws a

SyncProviderException

object, and the

catch

block takes effect. In this example, which
illustrates one of the many ways a

SyncResolver

object can be used,
the

SyncResolver

method

nextConflict

is used in a

while

loop. The loop will end when

nextConflict

returns

false

, which will occur when there are no more conflict rows in the

SyncResolver

object

resolver

. In This particular code fragment,

resolver

looks for rows that have update conflicts (rows with the status

SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT

), and the rest of this code fragment
executes only for rows where conflicts occurred because

crs

was attempting an
update.

After the cursor for

resolver

has moved to the next conflict row that
has an update conflict, the method

getRow

indicates the number of the
current row, and
the cursor for the

CachedRowSet

object

crs

is moved to
the comparable row in

crs

. By iterating
through the columns of that row in both

resolver

and

crs

, the conflicting
values can be retrieved and compared to decide which one should be persisted. In this
code fragment, the value in

crs

is the one set as the resolved value, which means
that it will be used to overwrite the conflict value in the data source.

```java
try {

crs.acceptChanges(con);

} catch (SyncProviderException spe) {

SyncResolver resolver = spe.getSyncResolver();

Object crsValue; // value in the RowSet object
Object resolverValue: // value in the SyncResolver object
Object resolvedValue: // value to be persisted

while(resolver.nextConflict()) {
if(resolver.getStatus() == SyncResolver.UPDATE_ROW_CONFLICT) {
int row = resolver.getRow();
crs.absolute(row);

int colCount = crs.getMetaData().getColumnCount();
for(int j = 1; j <= colCount; j++) {
if (resolver.getConflictValue(j) != null) {
crsValue = crs.getObject(j);
resolverValue = resolver.getConflictValue(j);
. . .
// compare crsValue and resolverValue to determine
// which should be the resolved value (the value to persist)
resolvedValue = crsValue;

resolver.setResolvedValue(j, resolvedValue);
}
}
}
}
}
```

object and persisted in the data source
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs

- nextConflict

```java
boolean nextConflict()
throws
SQLException
```

Moves the cursor down from its current position to the next row that contains
a conflict value. A

SyncResolver

object's
cursor is initially positioned before the first conflict row; the first call to the
method

nextConflict

makes the first conflict row the current row;
the second call makes the second conflict row the current row, and so on.

A call to the method

nextConflict

will implicitly close
an input stream if one is open and will clear the

SyncResolver

object's warning chain.

**Returns:** true

if the new current row is valid;

false

if there are no more rows
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or the result set type
is

TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY

- previousConflict

```java
boolean previousConflict()
throws
SQLException
```

Moves the cursor up from its current position to the previous conflict
row in this

SyncResolver

object.

A call to the method

previousConflict

will implicitly close
an input stream if one is open and will clear the

SyncResolver

object's warning chain.

**Returns:** true

if the cursor is on a valid row;

false

if it is off the result set
**Throws:** SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or the result set type
is

TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY
