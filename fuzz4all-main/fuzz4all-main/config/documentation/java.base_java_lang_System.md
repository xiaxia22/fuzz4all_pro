# Class System

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\System.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
System

extends
Object
```

The

System

class contains several useful class fields
and methods. It cannot be instantiated.

Among the facilities provided by the

System

class
are standard input, standard output, and error output streams;
access to externally defined properties and environment
variables; a means of loading files and libraries; and a utility
method for quickly copying a portion of an array.

**Since:** 1.0

---

### Field Details

#### public static final
InputStream
in

The "standard" input stream. This stream is already
open and ready to supply input data. Typically this stream
corresponds to keyboard input or another input source specified by
the host environment or user.

---

#### public static final
PrintStream
out

The "standard" output stream. This stream is already
open and ready to accept output data. Typically this stream
corresponds to display output or another output destination
specified by the host environment or user.

For simple stand-alone Java applications, a typical way to write
a line of output data is:

```java
System.out.println(data)
```

See the

println

methods in class

PrintStream

.

,

PrintStream.println(int)

,

PrintStream.println(long)

,

PrintStream.println(java.lang.Object)

,

PrintStream.println(java.lang.String)

---

#### public static final
PrintStream
err

The "standard" error output stream. This stream is already
open and ready to accept output data.

Typically this stream corresponds to display output or another
output destination specified by the host environment or user. By
convention, this output stream is used to display error messages
or other information that should come to the immediate attention
of a user even if the principal output stream, the value of the
variable

out

, has been redirected to a file or other
destination that is typically not continuously monitored.

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### public static void setIn​(
InputStream
in)

Reassigns the "standard" input stream.

First, if there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("setIO")

permission
to see if it's ok to reassign the "standard" input stream.

**Parameters:**
- in

- the new standard input stream.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow
reassigning of the standard input stream.

**See Also:**
- SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

RuntimePermission

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### public static void setOut​(
PrintStream
out)

Reassigns the "standard" output stream.

First, if there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("setIO")

permission
to see if it's ok to reassign the "standard" output stream.

**Parameters:**
- out

- the new standard output stream

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow
reassigning of the standard output stream.

**See Also:**
- SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

RuntimePermission

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### public static void setErr​(
PrintStream
err)

Reassigns the "standard" error output stream.

First, if there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("setIO")

permission
to see if it's ok to reassign the "standard" error output stream.

**Parameters:**
- err

- the new standard error output stream.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow
reassigning of the standard error output stream.

**See Also:**
- SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

RuntimePermission

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### public static
Console
console()

Returns the unique

Console

object associated
with the current Java virtual machine, if any.

**Returns:**
- The system console, if any, otherwise

null

.

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public static
Channel
inheritedChannel()
throws
IOException

Returns the channel inherited from the entity that created this
Java virtual machine.

This method returns the channel obtained by invoking the

inheritedChannel

method of the system-wide default

SelectorProvider

object.

In addition to the network-oriented channels described in

inheritedChannel

, this method may return other kinds of
channels in the future.

**Returns:**
- The inherited channel, if any, otherwise

null

.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- If a security manager is present and it does not
permit access to the channel.

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public static void setSecurityManager​(
SecurityManager
s)

Sets the System security.

If there is a security manager already installed, this method first
calls the security manager's

checkPermission

method
with a

RuntimePermission("setSecurityManager")

permission to ensure it's ok to replace the existing
security manager.
This may result in throwing a

SecurityException

.

Otherwise, the argument is established as the current
security manager. If the argument is

null

and no
security manager has been established, then no action is taken and
the method simply returns.

**Parameters:**
- s

- the security manager.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if the security manager has already
been set and its

checkPermission

method
doesn't allow it to be replaced.

**See Also:**
- getSecurityManager()

,

SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

RuntimePermission

---

#### public static
SecurityManager
getSecurityManager()

Gets the system security interface.

**Returns:**
- if a security manager has already been established for the
current application, then that security manager is returned;
otherwise,

null

is returned.

**See Also:**
- setSecurityManager(java.lang.SecurityManager)

---

#### public static long currentTimeMillis()

Returns the current time in milliseconds. Note that
while the unit of time of the return value is a millisecond,
the granularity of the value depends on the underlying
operating system and may be larger. For example, many
operating systems measure time in units of tens of
milliseconds.

See the description of the class

Date

for
a discussion of slight discrepancies that may arise between
"computer time" and coordinated universal time (UTC).

**Returns:**
- the difference, measured in milliseconds, between
the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.

**See Also:**
- Date

---

#### public static long nanoTime()

Returns the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds.

This method can only be used to measure elapsed time and is
not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time.
The value returned represents nanoseconds since some fixed but
arbitrary

origin

time (perhaps in the future, so values
may be negative). The same origin is used by all invocations of
this method in an instance of a Java virtual machine; other
virtual machine instances are likely to use a different origin.

This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily
nanosecond resolution (that is, how frequently the value changes)
- no guarantees are made except that the resolution is at least as
good as that of

currentTimeMillis()

.

Differences in successive calls that span greater than
approximately 292 years (2

63

nanoseconds) will not
correctly compute elapsed time due to numerical overflow.

The values returned by this method become meaningful only when
the difference between two such values, obtained within the same
instance of a Java virtual machine, is computed.

For example, to measure how long some code takes to execute:

```java
long startTime = System.nanoTime();
// ... the code being measured ...
long elapsedNanos = System.nanoTime() - startTime;
```

To compare elapsed time against a timeout, use

```java
if (System.nanoTime() - startTime >= timeoutNanos) ...
```

instead of

```java
if (System.nanoTime() >= startTime + timeoutNanos) ...
```

because of the possibility of numerical overflow.

**Returns:**
- the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public static void arraycopy​(
Object
src,
int srcPos,

Object
dest,
int destPos,
int length)

Copies an array from the specified source array, beginning at the
specified position, to the specified position of the destination array.
A subsequence of array components are copied from the source
array referenced by

src

to the destination array
referenced by

dest

. The number of components copied is
equal to the

length

argument. The components at
positions

srcPos

through

srcPos+length-1

in the source array are copied into
positions

destPos

through

destPos+length-1

, respectively, of the destination
array.

If the

src

and

dest

arguments refer to the
same array object, then the copying is performed as if the
components at positions

srcPos

through

srcPos+length-1

were first copied to a temporary
array with

length

components and then the contents of
the temporary array were copied into positions

destPos

through

destPos+length-1

of the
destination array.

If

dest

is

null

, then a

NullPointerException

is thrown.

If

src

is

null

, then a

NullPointerException

is thrown and the destination
array is not modified.

Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an

ArrayStoreException

is thrown and the destination is
not modified:

- The

src

argument refers to an object that is not an
array.

The

dest

argument refers to an object that is not an
array.

The

src

argument and

dest

argument refer
to arrays whose component types are different primitive types.

The

src

argument refers to an array with a primitive
component type and the

dest

argument refers to an array
with a reference component type.

The

src

argument refers to an array with a reference
component type and the

dest

argument refers to an array
with a primitive component type.

Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

is
thrown and the destination is not modified:

- The

srcPos

argument is negative.

The

destPos

argument is negative.

The

length

argument is negative.

srcPos+length

is greater than

src.length

, the length of the source array.

destPos+length

is greater than

dest.length

, the length of the destination array.

Otherwise, if any actual component of the source array from
position

srcPos

through

srcPos+length-1

cannot be converted to the component
type of the destination array by assignment conversion, an

ArrayStoreException

is thrown. In this case, let

k

be the smallest nonnegative integer less than
length such that

src[srcPos+

k

]

cannot be converted to the component type of the destination
array; when the exception is thrown, source array components from
positions

srcPos

through

srcPos+

k

-1

will already have been copied to destination array positions

destPos

through

destPos+

k

-1

and no other
positions of the destination array will have been modified.
(Because of the restrictions already itemized, this
paragraph effectively applies only to the situation where both
arrays have component types that are reference types.)

**Parameters:**
- src

- the source array.
- srcPos

- starting position in the source array.
- dest

- the destination array.
- destPos

- starting position in the destination data.
- length

- the number of array elements to be copied.

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if copying would cause
access of data outside array bounds.
- ArrayStoreException

- if an element in the

src

array could not be stored into the

dest

array
because of a type mismatch.
- NullPointerException

- if either

src

or

dest

is

null

.

#### public static int identityHashCode​(
Object
x)

Returns the same hash code for the given object as
would be returned by the default method hashCode(),
whether or not the given object's class overrides
hashCode().
The hash code for the null reference is zero.

**Parameters:**
- x

- object for which the hashCode is to be calculated

**Returns:**
- the hashCode

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

Objects.hashCode(Object)

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### public static
Properties
getProperties()

Determines the current system properties.

First, if there is a security manager, its

checkPropertiesAccess

method is called with no
arguments. This may result in a security exception.

The current set of system properties for use by the

getProperty(String)

method is returned as a

Properties

object. If there is no current set of
system properties, a set of system properties is first created and
initialized. This set of system properties always includes values
for the following keys:

defined if the specification implemented by this runtime at the
time of its construction had undergone a

maintenance
release

. When defined, its value identifies that
maintenance release. To indicate the first maintenance release
this property will have the value

"1"

, to indicate the
second maintenance release this property will have the value

"2"

, and so on.

Multiple paths in a system property value are separated by the path
separator character of the platform.

Note that even if the security manager does not permit the

getProperties

operation, it may choose to permit the

getProperty(String)

operation.

**Returns:**
- the system properties

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPropertiesAccess

method doesn't allow access
to the system properties.

**See Also:**
- setProperties(java.util.Properties)

,

SecurityException

,

SecurityManager.checkPropertiesAccess()

,

Properties

**API Note:**
- Changing a standard system property may have unpredictable results
unless otherwise specified.

Property values may be cached during initialization or on first use.
Setting a standard property after initialization using

getProperties()

,

setProperties(Properties)

,

setProperty(String, String)

, or

clearProperty(String)

may not have the desired effect.

**Implementation Note:**
- In addition to the standard system properties, the system
properties may include the following keys:

.

**Returns:**
- the system-dependent line separator string

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

getProperties

method for details.

---

#### public static
String
getenv​(
String
name)

Gets the value of the specified environment variable. An
environment variable is a system-dependent external named
value.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getenv."+name)

permission. This may result in a

SecurityException

being thrown. If no exception is thrown the value of the
variable

name

is returned.

System
properties

and

environment variables

are both
conceptually mappings between names and values. Both
mechanisms can be used to pass user-defined information to a
Java process. Environment variables have a more global effect,
because they are visible to all descendants of the process
which defines them, not just the immediate Java subprocess.
They can have subtly different semantics, such as case
insensitivity, on different operating systems. For these
reasons, environment variables are more likely to have
unintended side effects. It is best to use system properties
where possible. Environment variables should be used when a
global effect is desired, or when an external system interface
requires an environment variable (such as

PATH

).

On UNIX systems the alphabetic case of

name

is
typically significant, while on Microsoft Windows systems it is
typically not. For example, the expression

System.getenv("FOO").equals(System.getenv("foo"))

is likely to be true on Microsoft Windows.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the environment variable

**Returns:**
- the string value of the variable, or

null

if the variable is not defined in the system environment

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow access to the environment variable

name

**See Also:**
- getenv()

,

ProcessBuilder.environment()

---

#### public static
Map
<
String
,​
String
> getenv()

Returns an unmodifiable string map view of the current system environment.
The environment is a system-dependent mapping from names to
values which is passed from parent to child processes.

If the system does not support environment variables, an
empty map is returned.

The returned map will never contain null keys or values.
Attempting to query the presence of a null key or value will
throw a

NullPointerException

. Attempting to query
the presence of a key or value which is not of type

String

will throw a

ClassCastException

.

The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
general contract of the

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

and

Object.hashCode()

methods.

The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getenv.*")

permission.
This may result in a

SecurityException

being thrown.

When passing information to a Java subprocess,

system properties

are generally preferred over environment variables.

**Returns:**
- the environment as a map of variable names to values

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow access to the process environment

**See Also:**
- getenv(String)

,

ProcessBuilder.environment()

**Since:**
- 1.5

#### public static
System.Logger
getLogger​(
String
name)

Returns an instance of

Logger

for the caller's
use.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the logger.

**Returns:**
- an instance of

System.Logger

that can be used by the calling
class.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
- IllegalCallerException

- if there is no Java caller frame on the
stack.

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- This method may defer calling the

LoggerFinder.getLogger

method to create an actual logger supplied by
the logging backend, for instance, to allow loggers to be obtained during
the system initialization time.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Instances returned by this method route messages to loggers
obtained by calling

LoggerFinder.getLogger(name, module)

, where

module

is the caller's module.
In cases where

System.getLogger

is called from a context where
there is no caller frame on the stack (e.g when called directly
from a JNI attached thread),

IllegalCallerException

is thrown.
To obtain a logger in such a context, use an auxiliary class that will
implicitly be identified as the caller, or use the system

LoggerFinder

to obtain a logger instead.
Note that doing the latter may eagerly initialize the underlying
logging system.

---

#### public static
System.Logger
getLogger​(
String
name,

ResourceBundle
bundle)

Returns a localizable instance of

Logger

for the caller's use.
The returned logger will use the provided resource bundle for message
localization.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the logger.
- bundle

- a resource bundle.

**Returns:**
- an instance of

System.Logger

which will use the provided
resource bundle for message localization.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

or

bundle

is

null

.
- IllegalCallerException

- if there is no Java caller frame on the
stack.

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- This method is intended to be used after the system is fully initialized.
This method may trigger the immediate loading and initialization
of the

System.LoggerFinder

service, which may cause issues if the
Java Runtime is not ready to initialize the concrete service
implementation yet.
System classes which may be loaded early in the boot sequence and
need to log localized messages should create a logger using

getLogger(java.lang.String)

and then use the log methods that
take a resource bundle as parameter.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The returned logger will perform message localization as specified
by

LoggerFinder.getLocalizedLogger(name, bundle, module)

, where

module

is the caller's module.
In cases where

System.getLogger

is called from a context where
there is no caller frame on the stack (e.g when called directly
from a JNI attached thread),

IllegalCallerException

is thrown.
To obtain a logger in such a context, use an auxiliary class that
will implicitly be identified as the caller, or use the system

LoggerFinder

to obtain a logger instead.
Note that doing the latter may eagerly initialize the underlying
logging system.

#### public static void exit​(int status)

Terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine. The
argument serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status
code indicates abnormal termination.

This method calls the

exit

method in class

Runtime

. This method never returns normally.

The call

System.exit(n)

is effectively equivalent to
the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().exit(n)
```

**Parameters:**
- status

- exit status.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkExit

method doesn't allow exit with the specified status.

**See Also:**
- Runtime.exit(int)

---

#### public static void gc()

Runs the garbage collector.

Calling the

gc

method suggests that the Java Virtual
Machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects in order to
make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse.
When control returns from the method call, the Java Virtual
Machine has made a best effort to reclaim space from all discarded
objects.

The call

System.gc()

is effectively equivalent to the
call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
```

**See Also:**
- Runtime.gc()

---

#### public static void runFinalization()

Runs the finalization methods of any objects pending finalization.

Calling this method suggests that the Java Virtual Machine expend
effort toward running the

finalize

methods of objects
that have been found to be discarded but whose

finalize

methods have not yet been run. When control returns from the
method call, the Java Virtual Machine has made a best effort to
complete all outstanding finalizations.

The call

System.runFinalization()

is effectively
equivalent to the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().runFinalization()
```

**See Also:**
- Runtime.runFinalization()

---

#### public static void load​(
String
filename)

Loads the native library specified by the filename argument. The filename
argument must be an absolute path name.

If the filename argument, when stripped of any platform-specific library
prefix, path, and file extension, indicates a library whose name is,
for example, L, and a native library called L is statically linked
with the VM, then the JNI_OnLoad_L function exported by the library
is invoked rather than attempting to load a dynamic library.
A filename matching the argument does not have to exist in the
file system.
See the

JNI Specification

for more details.

Otherwise, the filename argument is mapped to a native library image in
an implementation-dependent manner.

The call

System.load(name)

is effectively equivalent
to the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().load(name)
```

**Parameters:**
- filename

- the file to load.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkLink

method doesn't allow
loading of the specified dynamic library
- UnsatisfiedLinkError

- if either the filename is not an
absolute path name, the native library is not statically
linked with the VM, or the library cannot be mapped to
a native library image by the host system.
- NullPointerException

- if

filename

is

null

**See Also:**
- Runtime.load(java.lang.String)

,

SecurityManager.checkLink(java.lang.String)

---

#### public static void loadLibrary​(
String
libname)

Loads the native library specified by the

libname

argument. The

libname

argument must not contain any platform
specific prefix, file extension or path. If a native library
called

libname

is statically linked with the VM, then the
JNI_OnLoad_

libname

function exported by the library is invoked.
See the

JNI Specification

for more details.

Otherwise, the libname argument is loaded from a system library
location and mapped to a native library image in an implementation-
dependent manner.

The call

System.loadLibrary(name)

is effectively
equivalent to the call

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().loadLibrary(name)
```

**Parameters:**
- libname

- the name of the library.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkLink

method doesn't allow
loading of the specified dynamic library
- UnsatisfiedLinkError

- if either the libname argument
contains a file path, the native library is not statically
linked with the VM, or the library cannot be mapped to a
native library image by the host system.
- NullPointerException

- if

libname

is

null

**See Also:**
- Runtime.loadLibrary(java.lang.String)

,

SecurityManager.checkLink(java.lang.String)

---

#### public static
String
mapLibraryName​(
String
libname)

Maps a library name into a platform-specific string representing
a native library.

**Parameters:**
- libname

- the name of the library.

**Returns:**
- a platform-dependent native library name.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

libname

is

null

**See Also:**
- loadLibrary(java.lang.String)

,

ClassLoader.findLibrary(java.lang.String)

**Since:**
- 1.2

#### Methods declared in class java.lang. Object

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- in

```java
public static final
InputStream
in
```

The "standard" input stream. This stream is already
open and ready to supply input data. Typically this stream
corresponds to keyboard input or another input source specified by
the host environment or user.

- out

```java
public static final
PrintStream
out
```

The "standard" output stream. This stream is already
open and ready to accept output data. Typically this stream
corresponds to display output or another output destination
specified by the host environment or user.

For simple stand-alone Java applications, a typical way to write
a line of output data is:

```java
System.out.println(data)
```

See the

println

methods in class

PrintStream

.

PrintStream.println(java.lang.Object)

,

PrintStream.println(java.lang.String)

- err

```java
public static final
PrintStream
err
```

The "standard" error output stream. This stream is already
open and ready to accept output data.

Typically this stream corresponds to display output or another
output destination specified by the host environment or user. By
convention, this output stream is used to display error messages
or other information that should come to the immediate attention
of a user even if the principal output stream, the value of the
variable

out

, has been redirected to a file or other
destination that is typically not continuously monitored.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- setIn

```java
public static void setIn​(
InputStream
in)
```

Reassigns the "standard" input stream.

First, if there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("setIO")

permission
to see if it's ok to reassign the "standard" input stream.

**Parameters:** in

- the new standard input stream.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow
reassigning of the standard input stream.
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

RuntimePermission

- setOut

```java
public static void setOut​(
PrintStream
out)
```

Reassigns the "standard" output stream.

First, if there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("setIO")

permission
to see if it's ok to reassign the "standard" output stream.

**Parameters:** out

- the new standard output stream
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow
reassigning of the standard output stream.
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

RuntimePermission

- setErr

```java
public static void setErr​(
PrintStream
err)
```

Reassigns the "standard" error output stream.

First, if there is a security manager, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("setIO")

permission
to see if it's ok to reassign the "standard" error output stream.

**Parameters:** err

- the new standard error output stream.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow
reassigning of the standard error output stream.
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

RuntimePermission

- console

```java
public static
Console
console()
```

Returns the unique

Console

object associated
with the current Java virtual machine, if any.

**Returns:** The system console, if any, otherwise

null

.
**Since:** 1.6

- inheritedChannel

```java
public static
Channel
inheritedChannel()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the channel inherited from the entity that created this
Java virtual machine.

This method returns the channel obtained by invoking the

inheritedChannel

method of the system-wide default

SelectorProvider

object.

In addition to the network-oriented channels described in

inheritedChannel

, this method may return other kinds of
channels in the future.

**Returns:** The inherited channel, if any, otherwise

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is present and it does not
permit access to the channel.
**Since:** 1.5

- setSecurityManager

```java
public static void setSecurityManager​(
SecurityManager
s)
```

Sets the System security.

If there is a security manager already installed, this method first
calls the security manager's

checkPermission

method
with a

RuntimePermission("setSecurityManager")

permission to ensure it's ok to replace the existing
security manager.
This may result in throwing a

SecurityException

.

Otherwise, the argument is established as the current
security manager. If the argument is

null

and no
security manager has been established, then no action is taken and
the method simply returns.

**Parameters:** s

- the security manager.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if the security manager has already
been set and its

checkPermission

method
doesn't allow it to be replaced.
**See Also:** getSecurityManager()

,

SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

RuntimePermission

- getSecurityManager

```java
public static
SecurityManager
getSecurityManager()
```

Gets the system security interface.

**Returns:** if a security manager has already been established for the
current application, then that security manager is returned;
otherwise,

null

is returned.
**See Also:** setSecurityManager(java.lang.SecurityManager)

- currentTimeMillis

```java
public static long currentTimeMillis()
```

Returns the current time in milliseconds. Note that
while the unit of time of the return value is a millisecond,
the granularity of the value depends on the underlying
operating system and may be larger. For example, many
operating systems measure time in units of tens of
milliseconds.

See the description of the class

Date

for
a discussion of slight discrepancies that may arise between
"computer time" and coordinated universal time (UTC).

**Returns:** the difference, measured in milliseconds, between
the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
**See Also:** Date

- nanoTime

```java
public static long nanoTime()
```

Returns the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds.

This method can only be used to measure elapsed time and is
not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time.
The value returned represents nanoseconds since some fixed but
arbitrary

origin

time (perhaps in the future, so values
may be negative). The same origin is used by all invocations of
this method in an instance of a Java virtual machine; other
virtual machine instances are likely to use a different origin.

This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily
nanosecond resolution (that is, how frequently the value changes)
- no guarantees are made except that the resolution is at least as
good as that of

currentTimeMillis()

.

Differences in successive calls that span greater than
approximately 292 years (2

63

nanoseconds) will not
correctly compute elapsed time due to numerical overflow.

The values returned by this method become meaningful only when
the difference between two such values, obtained within the same
instance of a Java virtual machine, is computed.

For example, to measure how long some code takes to execute:

```java
long startTime = System.nanoTime();
// ... the code being measured ...
long elapsedNanos = System.nanoTime() - startTime;
```

To compare elapsed time against a timeout, use

```java
if (System.nanoTime() - startTime >= timeoutNanos) ...
```

instead of

```java
if (System.nanoTime() >= startTime + timeoutNanos) ...
```

because of the possibility of numerical overflow.

**Returns:** the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds
**Since:** 1.5

- arraycopy

```java
public static void arraycopy​(
Object
src,
int srcPos,

Object
dest,
int destPos,
int length)
```

Copies an array from the specified source array, beginning at the
specified position, to the specified position of the destination array.
A subsequence of array components are copied from the source
array referenced by

src

to the destination array
referenced by

dest

. The number of components copied is
equal to the

length

argument. The components at
positions

srcPos

through

srcPos+length-1

in the source array are copied into
positions

destPos

through

destPos+length-1

, respectively, of the destination
array.

If the

src

and

dest

arguments refer to the
same array object, then the copying is performed as if the
components at positions

srcPos

through

srcPos+length-1

were first copied to a temporary
array with

length

components and then the contents of
the temporary array were copied into positions

destPos

through

destPos+length-1

of the
destination array.

If

dest

is

null

, then a

NullPointerException

is thrown.

If

src

is

null

, then a

NullPointerException

is thrown and the destination
array is not modified.

Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an

ArrayStoreException

is thrown and the destination is
not modified:

- The

src

argument refers to an object that is not an
array.

The

dest

argument refers to an object that is not an
array.

The

src

argument and

dest

argument refer
to arrays whose component types are different primitive types.

The

src

argument refers to an array with a primitive
component type and the

dest

argument refers to an array
with a reference component type.

The

src

argument refers to an array with a reference
component type and the

dest

argument refers to an array
with a primitive component type.

Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

is
thrown and the destination is not modified:

- The

srcPos

argument is negative.

The

destPos

argument is negative.

The

length

argument is negative.

srcPos+length

is greater than

src.length

, the length of the source array.

destPos+length

is greater than

dest.length

, the length of the destination array.

Otherwise, if any actual component of the source array from
position

srcPos

through

srcPos+length-1

cannot be converted to the component
type of the destination array by assignment conversion, an

ArrayStoreException

is thrown. In this case, let

k

be the smallest nonnegative integer less than
length such that

src[srcPos+

k

]

cannot be converted to the component type of the destination
array; when the exception is thrown, source array components from
positions

srcPos

through

srcPos+

k

-1

will already have been copied to destination array positions

destPos

through

destPos+

k

-1

and no other
positions of the destination array will have been modified.
(Because of the restrictions already itemized, this
paragraph effectively applies only to the situation where both
arrays have component types that are reference types.)

**Parameters:** src

- the source array.
**Parameters:** srcPos

- starting position in the source array.
**Parameters:** dest

- the destination array.
**Parameters:** destPos

- starting position in the destination data.
**Parameters:** length

- the number of array elements to be copied.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if copying would cause
access of data outside array bounds.
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if an element in the

src

array could not be stored into the

dest

array
because of a type mismatch.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if either

src

or

dest

is

null

.

- identityHashCode

```java
public static int identityHashCode​(
Object
x)
```

Returns the same hash code for the given object as
would be returned by the default method hashCode(),
whether or not the given object's class overrides
hashCode().
The hash code for the null reference is zero.

**Parameters:** x

- object for which the hashCode is to be calculated
**Returns:** the hashCode
**Since:** 1.1

getProperties()
```

Determines the current system properties.

First, if there is a security manager, its

checkPropertiesAccess

method is called with no
arguments. This may result in a security exception.

The current set of system properties for use by the

getProperty(String)

method is returned as a

Properties

object. If there is no current set of
system properties, a set of system properties is first created and
initialized. This set of system properties always includes values
for the following keys:

The

java.specification.maintenance.version

property is
defined if the specification implemented by this runtime at the
time of its construction had undergone a

maintenance
release

. When defined, its value identifies that
maintenance release. To indicate the first maintenance release
this property will have the value

"1"

, to indicate the
second maintenance release this property will have the value

"2"

, and so on.

Multiple paths in a system property value are separated by the path
separator character of the platform.

Note that even if the security manager does not permit the

getProperties

operation, it may choose to permit the

getProperty(String)

operation.

**API Note:** Changing a standard system property may have unpredictable results
unless otherwise specified.

Property values may be cached during initialization or on first use.
Setting a standard property after initialization using

getProperties()

,

setProperties(Properties)

,

setProperty(String, String)

, or

clearProperty(String)

may not have the desired effect.
**Implementation Note:** In addition to the standard system properties, the system
properties may include the following keys:

SecurityManager.checkPropertiesAccess()

- getenv

```java
public static
String
getenv​(
String
name)
```

Gets the value of the specified environment variable. An
environment variable is a system-dependent external named
value.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getenv."+name)

permission. This may result in a

SecurityException

being thrown. If no exception is thrown the value of the
variable

name

is returned.

System
properties

and

environment variables

are both
conceptually mappings between names and values. Both
mechanisms can be used to pass user-defined information to a
Java process. Environment variables have a more global effect,
because they are visible to all descendants of the process
which defines them, not just the immediate Java subprocess.
They can have subtly different semantics, such as case
insensitivity, on different operating systems. For these
reasons, environment variables are more likely to have
unintended side effects. It is best to use system properties
where possible. Environment variables should be used when a
global effect is desired, or when an external system interface
requires an environment variable (such as

PATH

).

On UNIX systems the alphabetic case of

name

is
typically significant, while on Microsoft Windows systems it is
typically not. For example, the expression

System.getenv("FOO").equals(System.getenv("foo"))

is likely to be true on Microsoft Windows.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the environment variable
**Returns:** the string value of the variable, or

null

if the variable is not defined in the system environment
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow access to the environment variable

name
**See Also:** getenv()

,

ProcessBuilder.environment()

- getenv

```java
public static
Map
<
String
,​
String
> getenv()
```

Returns an unmodifiable string map view of the current system environment.
The environment is a system-dependent mapping from names to
values which is passed from parent to child processes.

If the system does not support environment variables, an
empty map is returned.

The returned map will never contain null keys or values.
Attempting to query the presence of a null key or value will
throw a

NullPointerException

. Attempting to query
the presence of a key or value which is not of type

String

will throw a

ClassCastException

.

The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
general contract of the

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

and

Object.hashCode()

methods.

The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getenv.*")

permission.
This may result in a

SecurityException

being thrown.

When passing information to a Java subprocess,

system properties

are generally preferred over environment variables.

**Returns:** the environment as a map of variable names to values
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow access to the process environment
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** getenv(String)

,

ProcessBuilder.environment()

- getLogger

```java
public static
System.Logger
getLogger​(
String
name)
```

Returns an instance of

Logger

for the caller's
use.

**API Note:** This method may defer calling the

LoggerFinder.getLogger

method to create an actual logger supplied by
the logging backend, for instance, to allow loggers to be obtained during
the system initialization time.
**Implementation Requirements:** Instances returned by this method route messages to loggers
obtained by calling

LoggerFinder.getLogger(name, module)

, where

module

is the caller's module.
In cases where

System.getLogger

is called from a context where
there is no caller frame on the stack (e.g when called directly
from a JNI attached thread),

IllegalCallerException

is thrown.
To obtain a logger in such a context, use an auxiliary class that will
implicitly be identified as the caller, or use the system

LoggerFinder

to obtain a logger instead.
Note that doing the latter may eagerly initialize the underlying
logging system.
**Parameters:** name

- the name of the logger.
**Returns:** an instance of

System.Logger

that can be used by the calling
class.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalCallerException

- if there is no Java caller frame on the
stack.
**Since:** 9

- getLogger

```java
public static
System.Logger
getLogger​(
String
name,

ResourceBundle
bundle)
```

Returns a localizable instance of

Logger

for the caller's use.
The returned logger will use the provided resource bundle for message
localization.

**API Note:** This method is intended to be used after the system is fully initialized.
This method may trigger the immediate loading and initialization
of the

System.LoggerFinder

service, which may cause issues if the
Java Runtime is not ready to initialize the concrete service
implementation yet.
System classes which may be loaded early in the boot sequence and
need to log localized messages should create a logger using

getLogger(java.lang.String)

and then use the log methods that
take a resource bundle as parameter.
**Implementation Requirements:** The returned logger will perform message localization as specified
by

LoggerFinder.getLocalizedLogger(name, bundle, module)

, where

module

is the caller's module.
In cases where

System.getLogger

is called from a context where
there is no caller frame on the stack (e.g when called directly
from a JNI attached thread),

IllegalCallerException

is thrown.
To obtain a logger in such a context, use an auxiliary class that
will implicitly be identified as the caller, or use the system

LoggerFinder

to obtain a logger instead.
Note that doing the latter may eagerly initialize the underlying
logging system.
**Parameters:** name

- the name of the logger.
**Parameters:** bundle

- a resource bundle.
**Returns:** an instance of

System.Logger

which will use the provided
resource bundle for message localization.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

or

bundle

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalCallerException

- if there is no Java caller frame on the
stack.
**Since:** 9

- exit

```java
public static void exit​(int status)
```

Terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine. The
argument serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status
code indicates abnormal termination.

This method calls the

exit

method in class

Runtime

. This method never returns normally.

The call

System.exit(n)

is effectively equivalent to
the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().exit(n)
```

**Parameters:** status

- exit status.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkExit

method doesn't allow exit with the specified status.
**See Also:** Runtime.exit(int)

- gc

```java
public static void gc()
```

Runs the garbage collector.

Calling the

gc

method suggests that the Java Virtual
Machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects in order to
make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse.
When control returns from the method call, the Java Virtual
Machine has made a best effort to reclaim space from all discarded
objects.

The call

System.gc()

is effectively equivalent to the
call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
```

**See Also:** Runtime.gc()

- runFinalization

```java
public static void runFinalization()
```

Runs the finalization methods of any objects pending finalization.

Calling this method suggests that the Java Virtual Machine expend
effort toward running the

finalize

methods of objects
that have been found to be discarded but whose

finalize

methods have not yet been run. When control returns from the
method call, the Java Virtual Machine has made a best effort to
complete all outstanding finalizations.

The call

System.runFinalization()

is effectively
equivalent to the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().runFinalization()
```

**See Also:** Runtime.runFinalization()

- load

```java
public static void load​(
String
filename)
```

Loads the native library specified by the filename argument. The filename
argument must be an absolute path name.

If the filename argument, when stripped of any platform-specific library
prefix, path, and file extension, indicates a library whose name is,
for example, L, and a native library called L is statically linked
with the VM, then the JNI_OnLoad_L function exported by the library
is invoked rather than attempting to load a dynamic library.
A filename matching the argument does not have to exist in the
file system.
See the

JNI Specification

for more details.

Otherwise, the filename argument is mapped to a native library image in
an implementation-dependent manner.

The call

System.load(name)

is effectively equivalent
to the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().load(name)
```

**Parameters:** filename

- the file to load.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkLink

method doesn't allow
loading of the specified dynamic library
**Throws:** UnsatisfiedLinkError

- if either the filename is not an
absolute path name, the native library is not statically
linked with the VM, or the library cannot be mapped to
a native library image by the host system.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

filename

is

null
**See Also:** Runtime.load(java.lang.String)

,

SecurityManager.checkLink(java.lang.String)

- loadLibrary

```java
public static void loadLibrary​(
String
libname)
```

Loads the native library specified by the

libname

argument. The

libname

argument must not contain any platform
specific prefix, file extension or path. If a native library
called

libname

is statically linked with the VM, then the
JNI_OnLoad_

libname

function exported by the library is invoked.
See the

JNI Specification

for more details.

Otherwise, the libname argument is loaded from a system library
location and mapped to a native library image in an implementation-
dependent manner.

The call

System.loadLibrary(name)

is effectively
equivalent to the call

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().loadLibrary(name)
```

**Parameters:** libname

- the name of the library.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkLink

method doesn't allow
loading of the specified dynamic library
**Throws:** UnsatisfiedLinkError

- if either the libname argument
contains a file path, the native library is not statically
linked with the VM, or the library cannot be mapped to a
native library image by the host system.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

libname

is

null
**See Also:** Runtime.loadLibrary(java.lang.String)

,

SecurityManager.checkLink(java.lang.String)

- mapLibraryName

```java
public static
String
mapLibraryName​(
String
libname)
```

Maps a library name into a platform-specific string representing
a native library.

**Parameters:** libname

- the name of the library.
**Returns:** a platform-dependent native library name.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

libname

is

null

permit access to the channel.
**Since:** 1.5

- setSecurityManager

```java
public static void setSecurityManager​(
SecurityManager
s)
```

Sets the System security.

If there is a security manager already installed, this method first
calls the security manager's

checkPermission

method
with a

RuntimePermission("setSecurityManager")

permission to ensure it's ok to replace the existing
security manager.
This may result in throwing a

SecurityException

.

Otherwise, the argument is established as the current
security manager. If the argument is

null

and no
security manager has been established, then no action is taken and
the method simply returns.

**Parameters:** s

- the security manager.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if the security manager has already
been set and its

checkPermission

method
doesn't allow it to be replaced.
**See Also:** getSecurityManager()

,

SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)

,

RuntimePermission

- getSecurityManager

```java
public static
SecurityManager
getSecurityManager()
```

Gets the system security interface.

**Returns:** if a security manager has already been established for the
current application, then that security manager is returned;
otherwise,

null

is returned.
**See Also:** setSecurityManager(java.lang.SecurityManager)

- currentTimeMillis

```java
public static long currentTimeMillis()
```

Returns the current time in milliseconds. Note that
while the unit of time of the return value is a millisecond,
the granularity of the value depends on the underlying
operating system and may be larger. For example, many
operating systems measure time in units of tens of
milliseconds.

See the description of the class

Date

for
a discussion of slight discrepancies that may arise between
"computer time" and coordinated universal time (UTC).

**Returns:** the difference, measured in milliseconds, between
the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
**See Also:** Date

- nanoTime

```java
public static long nanoTime()
```

Returns the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds.

This method can only be used to measure elapsed time and is
not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time.
The value returned represents nanoseconds since some fixed but
arbitrary

origin

time (perhaps in the future, so values
may be negative). The same origin is used by all invocations of
this method in an instance of a Java virtual machine; other
virtual machine instances are likely to use a different origin.

This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily
nanosecond resolution (that is, how frequently the value changes)
- no guarantees are made except that the resolution is at least as
good as that of

currentTimeMillis()

.

Differences in successive calls that span greater than
approximately 292 years (2

63

nanoseconds) will not
correctly compute elapsed time due to numerical overflow.

The values returned by this method become meaningful only when
the difference between two such values, obtained within the same
instance of a Java virtual machine, is computed.

For example, to measure how long some code takes to execute:

```java
long startTime = System.nanoTime();
// ... the code being measured ...
long elapsedNanos = System.nanoTime() - startTime;
```

To compare elapsed time against a timeout, use

```java
if (System.nanoTime() - startTime >= timeoutNanos) ...
```

instead of

```java
if (System.nanoTime() >= startTime + timeoutNanos) ...
```

because of the possibility of numerical overflow.

**Returns:** the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds
**Since:** 1.5

- arraycopy

```java
public static void arraycopy​(
Object
src,
int srcPos,

Object
dest,
int destPos,
int length)
```

Copies an array from the specified source array, beginning at the
specified position, to the specified position of the destination array.
A subsequence of array components are copied from the source
array referenced by

src

to the destination array
referenced by

dest

. The number of components copied is
equal to the

length

argument. The components at
positions

srcPos

through

srcPos+length-1

in the source array are copied into
positions

destPos

through

destPos+length-1

, respectively, of the destination
array.

If the

src

and

dest

arguments refer to the
same array object, then the copying is performed as if the
components at positions

srcPos

through

srcPos+length-1

were first copied to a temporary
array with

length

components and then the contents of
the temporary array were copied into positions

destPos

through

destPos+length-1

of the
destination array.

If

dest

is

null

, then a

NullPointerException

is thrown.

If

src

is

null

, then a

NullPointerException

is thrown and the destination
array is not modified.

Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an

ArrayStoreException

is thrown and the destination is
not modified:

- The

src

argument refers to an object that is not an
array.

The

dest

argument refers to an object that is not an
array.

The

src

argument and

dest

argument refer
to arrays whose component types are different primitive types.

The

src

argument refers to an array with a primitive
component type and the

dest

argument refers to an array
with a reference component type.

The

src

argument refers to an array with a reference
component type and the

dest

argument refers to an array
with a primitive component type.

Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

is
thrown and the destination is not modified:

- The

srcPos

argument is negative.

The

destPos

argument is negative.

The

length

argument is negative.

srcPos+length

is greater than

src.length

, the length of the source array.

destPos+length

is greater than

dest.length

, the length of the destination array.

Otherwise, if any actual component of the source array from
position

srcPos

through

srcPos+length-1

cannot be converted to the component
type of the destination array by assignment conversion, an

ArrayStoreException

is thrown. In this case, let

k

be the smallest nonnegative integer less than
length such that

src[srcPos+

k

]

cannot be converted to the component type of the destination
array; when the exception is thrown, source array components from
positions

srcPos

through

srcPos+

k

-1

will already have been copied to destination array positions

destPos

through

destPos+

k

-1

and no other
positions of the destination array will have been modified.
(Because of the restrictions already itemized, this
paragraph effectively applies only to the situation where both
arrays have component types that are reference types.)

**Parameters:** src

- the source array.
**Parameters:** srcPos

- starting position in the source array.
**Parameters:** dest

- the destination array.
**Parameters:** destPos

- starting position in the destination data.
**Parameters:** length

- the number of array elements to be copied.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if copying would cause
access of data outside array bounds.
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if an element in the

src

array could not be stored into the

dest

array
because of a type mismatch.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if either

src

or

dest

is

null

.

- identityHashCode

```java
public static int identityHashCode​(
Object
x)
```

Returns the same hash code for the given object as
would be returned by the default method hashCode(),
whether or not the given object's class overrides
hashCode().
The hash code for the null reference is zero.

**Parameters:** x

- object for which the hashCode is to be calculated
**Returns:** the hashCode
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

Objects.hashCode(Object)

- getProperties

```java
public static
Properties
getProperties()
```

Determines the current system properties.

First, if there is a security manager, its

checkPropertiesAccess

method is called with no
arguments. This may result in a security exception.

The current set of system properties for use by the

getProperty(String)

method is returned as a

Properties

object. If there is no current set of
system properties, a set of system properties is first created and
initialized. This set of system properties always includes values
for the following keys:

Shows property keys and associated values

The

java.specification.maintenance.version

property is
defined if the specification implemented by this runtime at the
time of its construction had undergone a

maintenance
release

. When defined, its value identifies that
maintenance release. To indicate the first maintenance release
this property will have the value

"1"

, to indicate the
second maintenance release this property will have the value

"2"

, and so on.

Multiple paths in a system property value are separated by the path
separator character of the platform.

Note that even if the security manager does not permit the

getProperties

operation, it may choose to permit the

getProperty(String)

operation.

**API Note:** Changing a standard system property may have unpredictable results
unless otherwise specified.

Property values may be cached during initialization or on first use.
Setting a standard property after initialization using

getProperties()

,

setProperties(Properties)

,

setProperty(String, String)

, or

clearProperty(String)

may not have the desired effect.
**Implementation Note:** In addition to the standard system properties, the system
properties may include the following keys:

```

Removes the system property indicated by the specified key.

First, if a security manager exists, its

SecurityManager.checkPermission

method
is called with a

PropertyPermission(key, "write")

permission. This may result in a SecurityException being thrown.
If no exception is thrown, the specified property is removed.

**API Note:** Changing a standard system property may have unpredictable results
unless otherwise specified

.

SecurityManager.checkPropertiesAccess()

- getenv

```java
public static
String
getenv​(
String
name)
```

Gets the value of the specified environment variable. An
environment variable is a system-dependent external named
value.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getenv."+name)

permission. This may result in a

SecurityException

being thrown. If no exception is thrown the value of the
variable

name

is returned.

System
properties

and

environment variables

are both
conceptually mappings between names and values. Both
mechanisms can be used to pass user-defined information to a
Java process. Environment variables have a more global effect,
because they are visible to all descendants of the process
which defines them, not just the immediate Java subprocess.
They can have subtly different semantics, such as case
insensitivity, on different operating systems. For these
reasons, environment variables are more likely to have
unintended side effects. It is best to use system properties
where possible. Environment variables should be used when a
global effect is desired, or when an external system interface
requires an environment variable (such as

PATH

).

On UNIX systems the alphabetic case of

name

is
typically significant, while on Microsoft Windows systems it is
typically not. For example, the expression

System.getenv("FOO").equals(System.getenv("foo"))

is likely to be true on Microsoft Windows.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the environment variable
**Returns:** the string value of the variable, or

null

if the variable is not defined in the system environment
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow access to the environment variable

name
**See Also:** getenv()

,

ProcessBuilder.environment()

- getenv

```java
public static
Map
<
String
,​
String
> getenv()
```

Returns an unmodifiable string map view of the current system environment.
The environment is a system-dependent mapping from names to
values which is passed from parent to child processes.

If the system does not support environment variables, an
empty map is returned.

The returned map will never contain null keys or values.
Attempting to query the presence of a null key or value will
throw a

NullPointerException

. Attempting to query
the presence of a key or value which is not of type

String

will throw a

ClassCastException

.

The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
general contract of the

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

and

Object.hashCode()

methods.

The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getenv.*")

permission.
This may result in a

SecurityException

being thrown.

When passing information to a Java subprocess,

system properties

are generally preferred over environment variables.

**Returns:** the environment as a map of variable names to values
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow access to the process environment
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** getenv(String)

,

ProcessBuilder.environment()

- getLogger

```java
public static
System.Logger
getLogger​(
String
name)
```

Returns an instance of

Logger

for the caller's
use.

**API Note:** This method may defer calling the

LoggerFinder.getLogger

method to create an actual logger supplied by
the logging backend, for instance, to allow loggers to be obtained during
the system initialization time.
**Implementation Requirements:** Instances returned by this method route messages to loggers
obtained by calling

LoggerFinder.getLogger(name, module)

, where

module

is the caller's module.
In cases where

System.getLogger

is called from a context where
there is no caller frame on the stack (e.g when called directly
from a JNI attached thread),

IllegalCallerException

is thrown.
To obtain a logger in such a context, use an auxiliary class that will
implicitly be identified as the caller, or use the system

LoggerFinder

to obtain a logger instead.
Note that doing the latter may eagerly initialize the underlying
logging system.
**Parameters:** name

- the name of the logger.
**Returns:** an instance of

System.Logger

that can be used by the calling
class.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalCallerException

- if there is no Java caller frame on the
stack.
**Since:** 9

- getLogger

```java
public static
System.Logger
getLogger​(
String
name,

ResourceBundle
bundle)
```

Returns a localizable instance of

Logger

for the caller's use.
The returned logger will use the provided resource bundle for message
localization.

**API Note:** This method is intended to be used after the system is fully initialized.
This method may trigger the immediate loading and initialization
of the

System.LoggerFinder

service, which may cause issues if the
Java Runtime is not ready to initialize the concrete service
implementation yet.
System classes which may be loaded early in the boot sequence and
need to log localized messages should create a logger using

getLogger(java.lang.String)

and then use the log methods that
take a resource bundle as parameter.
**Implementation Requirements:** The returned logger will perform message localization as specified
by

LoggerFinder.getLocalizedLogger(name, bundle, module)

, where

module

is the caller's module.
In cases where

System.getLogger

is called from a context where
there is no caller frame on the stack (e.g when called directly
from a JNI attached thread),

IllegalCallerException

is thrown.
To obtain a logger in such a context, use an auxiliary class that
will implicitly be identified as the caller, or use the system

LoggerFinder

to obtain a logger instead.
Note that doing the latter may eagerly initialize the underlying
logging system.
**Parameters:** name

- the name of the logger.
**Parameters:** bundle

- a resource bundle.
**Returns:** an instance of

System.Logger

which will use the provided
resource bundle for message localization.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

or

bundle

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalCallerException

- if there is no Java caller frame on the
stack.
**Since:** 9

- exit

```java
public static void exit​(int status)
```

Terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine. The
argument serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status
code indicates abnormal termination.

This method calls the

exit

method in class

Runtime

. This method never returns normally.

The call

System.exit(n)

is effectively equivalent to
the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().exit(n)
```

**Parameters:** status

- exit status.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkExit

method doesn't allow exit with the specified status.
**See Also:** Runtime.exit(int)

- gc

```java
public static void gc()
```

Runs the garbage collector.

Calling the

gc

method suggests that the Java Virtual
Machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects in order to
make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse.
When control returns from the method call, the Java Virtual
Machine has made a best effort to reclaim space from all discarded
objects.

The call

System.gc()

is effectively equivalent to the
call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
```

**See Also:** Runtime.gc()

- runFinalization

```java
public static void runFinalization()
```

Runs the finalization methods of any objects pending finalization.

Calling this method suggests that the Java Virtual Machine expend
effort toward running the

finalize

methods of objects
that have been found to be discarded but whose

finalize

methods have not yet been run. When control returns from the
method call, the Java Virtual Machine has made a best effort to
complete all outstanding finalizations.

The call

System.runFinalization()

is effectively
equivalent to the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().runFinalization()
```

**See Also:** Runtime.runFinalization()

- load

```java
public static void load​(
String
filename)
```

Loads the native library specified by the filename argument. The filename
argument must be an absolute path name.

If the filename argument, when stripped of any platform-specific library
prefix, path, and file extension, indicates a library whose name is,
for example, L, and a native library called L is statically linked
with the VM, then the JNI_OnLoad_L function exported by the library
is invoked rather than attempting to load a dynamic library.
A filename matching the argument does not have to exist in the
file system.
See the

JNI Specification

for more details.

Otherwise, the filename argument is mapped to a native library image in
an implementation-dependent manner.

The call

System.load(name)

is effectively equivalent
to the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().load(name)
```

**Parameters:** filename

- the file to load.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkLink

method doesn't allow
loading of the specified dynamic library
**Throws:** UnsatisfiedLinkError

- if either the filename is not an
absolute path name, the native library is not statically
linked with the VM, or the library cannot be mapped to
a native library image by the host system.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

filename

is

null
**See Also:** Runtime.load(java.lang.String)

,

SecurityManager.checkLink(java.lang.String)

- loadLibrary

```java
public static void loadLibrary​(
String
libname)
```

Loads the native library specified by the

libname

argument. The

libname

argument must not contain any platform
specific prefix, file extension or path. If a native library
called

libname

is statically linked with the VM, then the
JNI_OnLoad_

libname

function exported by the library is invoked.
See the

JNI Specification

for more details.

Otherwise, the libname argument is loaded from a system library
location and mapped to a native library image in an implementation-
dependent manner.

The call

System.loadLibrary(name)

is effectively
equivalent to the call

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().loadLibrary(name)
```

**Parameters:** libname

- the name of the library.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkLink

method doesn't allow
loading of the specified dynamic library
**Throws:** UnsatisfiedLinkError

- if either the libname argument
contains a file path, the native library is not statically
linked with the VM, or the library cannot be mapped to a
native library image by the host system.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

libname

is

null
**See Also:** Runtime.loadLibrary(java.lang.String)

,

SecurityManager.checkLink(java.lang.String)

- mapLibraryName

```java
public static
String
mapLibraryName​(
String
libname)
```

Maps a library name into a platform-specific string representing
a native library.

**Parameters:** libname

- the name of the library.
**Returns:** a platform-dependent native library name.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

libname

is

null
**Since:** 1.2

#### Method Detail

setIn

```java
public static void setIn​(
InputStream
in)
```

Reassigns the "standard" input stream.

First, if there is a security manager, its

currentTimeMillis

```java
public static long currentTimeMillis()
```

Returns the current time in milliseconds. Note that
while the unit of time of the return value is a millisecond,
the granularity of the value depends on the underlying
operating system and may be larger. For example, many
operating systems measure time in units of tens of
milliseconds.

See the description of the class

Date

for
a discussion of slight discrepancies that may arise between
"computer time" and coordinated universal time (UTC).

**Returns:** the difference, measured in milliseconds, between
the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.

nanoTime

```java
public static long nanoTime()
```

Returns the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds.

This method can only be used to measure elapsed time and is
not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time.
The value returned represents nanoseconds since some fixed but
arbitrary

origin

time (perhaps in the future, so values
may be negative). The same origin is used by all invocations of
this method in an instance of a Java virtual machine; other
virtual machine instances are likely to use a different origin.

This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily
nanosecond resolution (that is, how frequently the value changes)
- no guarantees are made except that the resolution is at least as
good as that of

currentTimeMillis()

.

Differences in successive calls that span greater than
approximately 292 years (2

63

nanoseconds) will not
correctly compute elapsed time due to numerical overflow.

The values returned by this method become meaningful only when
the difference between two such values, obtained within the same
instance of a Java virtual machine, is computed.

For example, to measure how long some code takes to execute:

```java
long startTime = System.nanoTime();
// ... the code being measured ...
long elapsedNanos = System.nanoTime() - startTime;
```

To compare elapsed time against a timeout, use

```java
if (System.nanoTime() - startTime >= timeoutNanos) ...
```

instead of

```java
if (System.nanoTime() >= startTime + timeoutNanos) ...
```

because of the possibility of numerical overflow.

**Returns:** the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds

array.

The

src

argument and

argument refer
to arrays whose component types are different primitive types.

The

with a reference component type.

The

src

argument refers to an array with a reference
component type and the

dest

argument refers to an array
with a primitive component type.

Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

is
thrown and the destination is not modified:

- The

srcPos

argument is negative.

The

The

length

argument is negative.

srcPos+length

is greater than

src.length

, the length of the source array.

destPos+length

is greater than

dest.length

, the length of the destination array.

Otherwise, if any actual component of the source array from
position

srcPos

through

srcPos+length-1

cannot be converted to the component
type of the destination array by assignment conversion, an

ArrayStoreException

is thrown. In this case, let

k

be the smallest nonnegative integer less than
length such that

cannot be converted to the component type of the destination
array; when the exception is thrown, source array components from
positions

will already have been copied to destination array positions

destPos

through

destPos+

k

-1

and no other
positions of the destination array will have been modified.
(Because of the restrictions already itemized, this
paragraph effectively applies only to the situation where both
arrays have component types that are reference types.)

getenv

```java

name)
```

Gets the value of the specified environment variable. An
environment variable is a system-dependent external named
value.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method is called with a

RuntimePermission("getenv."+name)

permission. This may result in a

SecurityException

being thrown. If no exception is thrown the value of the
variable

name

is returned.

System
properties

and

environment variables

are both
conceptually mappings between names and values. Both
mechanisms can be used to pass user-defined information to a
Java process. Environment variables have a more global effect,
because they are visible to all descendants of the process
which defines them, not just the immediate Java subprocess.
They can have subtly different semantics, such as case
insensitivity, on different operating systems. For these
reasons, environment variables are more likely to have
unintended side effects. It is best to use system properties
where possible. Environment variables should be used when a
global effect is desired, or when an external system interface
requires an environment variable (such as

PATH

).

On UNIX systems the alphabetic case of

name

is
typically significant, while on Microsoft Windows systems it is
typically not. For example, the expression

System.getenv("FOO").equals(System.getenv("foo"))

is likely to be true on Microsoft Windows.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the environment variable
**Returns:** the string value of the variable, or

null

if the variable is not defined in the system environment
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null
**Throws:** SecurityException

Returns an unmodifiable string map view of the current system environment.
The environment is a system-dependent mapping from names to
values which is passed from parent to child processes.

If the system does not support environment variables, an
empty map is returned.

The returned map will never contain null keys or values.
Attempting to query the presence of a null key or value will
throw a

NullPointerException

. Attempting to query
the presence of a key or value which is not of type

String

will throw a

ClassCastException

.

The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
general contract of the

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

getLogger

```java
public static
System.Logger
getLogger​(
String
name)
```

Returns an instance of

Logger

for the caller's
use.

**API Note:** This method may defer calling the

LoggerFinder.getLogger

method to create an actual logger supplied by
the logging backend, for instance, to allow loggers to be obtained during
the system initialization time.
**Implementation Requirements:** Instances returned by this method route messages to loggers
obtained by calling

LoggerFinder.getLogger(name, module)

, where

module

is the caller's module.
In cases where

System.getLogger

is called from a context where
there is no caller frame on the stack (e.g when called directly
from a JNI attached thread),

IllegalCallerException

is thrown.
To obtain a logger in such a context, use an auxiliary class that will
implicitly be identified as the caller, or use the system

LoggerFinder

to obtain a logger instead.
Note that doing the latter may eagerly initialize the underlying
logging system.
**Parameters:** name

- the name of the logger.
**Returns:** an instance of

System.Logger

that can be used by the calling
class.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalCallerException

- if there is no Java caller frame on the
stack.
**Since:** 9

use.

getLogger

```java
public static
System.Logger
getLogger​(
String
name,

ResourceBundle
bundle)
```

Returns a localizable instance of

Logger

for the caller's use.
The returned logger will use the provided resource bundle for message
localization.

**API Note:** This method is intended to be used after the system is fully initialized.
This method may trigger the immediate loading and initialization
of the

System.LoggerFinder

service, which may cause issues if the
Java Runtime is not ready to initialize the concrete service
implementation yet.
System classes which may be loaded early in the boot sequence and
need to log localized messages should create a logger using

getLogger(java.lang.String)

and then use the log methods that
take a resource bundle as parameter.
**Implementation Requirements:** The returned logger will perform message localization as specified
by

LoggerFinder.getLocalizedLogger(name, bundle, module)

, where

module

is the caller's module.
In cases where

System.getLogger

is called from a context where
there is no caller frame on the stack (e.g when called directly
from a JNI attached thread),

IllegalCallerException

is thrown.
To obtain a logger in such a context, use an auxiliary class that
will implicitly be identified as the caller, or use the system

LoggerFinder

to obtain a logger instead.
Note that doing the latter may eagerly initialize the underlying
logging system.
**Parameters:** name

- the name of the logger.
**Parameters:** bundle

- a resource bundle.
**Returns:** an instance of

System.Logger

which will use the provided
resource bundle for message localization.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

or

bundle

is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalCallerException

- if there is no Java caller frame on the
stack.
**Since:** 9

exit

```java
public static void exit​(int status)
```

Terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine. The
argument serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status
code indicates abnormal termination.

This method calls the

exit

method in class

Runtime

. This method never returns normally.

The call

System.exit(n)

is effectively equivalent to
the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().exit(n)
```

**Parameters:** status

- exit status.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkExit

method doesn't allow exit with the specified status.

load

```java
public static void load​(
String
filename)
```

Loads the native library specified by the filename argument. The filename
argument must be an absolute path name.

If the filename argument, when stripped of any platform-specific library
prefix, path, and file extension, indicates a library whose name is,
for example, L, and a native library called L is statically linked
with the VM, then the JNI_OnLoad_L function exported by the library
is invoked rather than attempting to load a dynamic library.
A filename matching the argument does not have to exist in the
file system.
See the

JNI Specification

for more details.

Otherwise, the filename argument is mapped to a native library image in
an implementation-dependent manner.

The call

System.load(name)

is effectively equivalent
to the call:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().load(name)
```

**Parameters:** filename

- the file to load.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkLink

method doesn't allow
loading of the specified dynamic library
**Throws:** UnsatisfiedLinkError

- if either the filename is not an
absolute path name, the native library is not statically
linked with the VM, or the library cannot be mapped to
a native library image by the host system.
**Throws:** NullPointerException
