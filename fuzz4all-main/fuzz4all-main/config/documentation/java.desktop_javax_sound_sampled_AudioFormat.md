### Class Description

```java
public class
AudioFormat

extends
Object
```

AudioFormat

is the class that specifies a particular arrangement of
data in a sound stream. By examining the information stored in the audio
format, you can discover how to interpret the bits in the binary sound data.

Every data line has an audio format associated with its data stream. The
audio format of a source (playback) data line indicates what kind of data the
data line expects to receive for output. For a target (capture) data line,
the audio format specifies the kind of the data that can be read from the
line.

Sound files also have audio formats, of course. The

AudioFileFormat

class encapsulates an

AudioFormat

in addition to other, file-specific
information. Similarly, an

AudioInputStream

has an

AudioFormat

.

The

AudioFormat

class accommodates a number of common sound-file
encoding techniques, including pulse-code modulation (PCM), mu-law encoding,
and a-law encoding. These encoding techniques are predefined, but service
providers can create new encoding types. The encoding that a specific format
uses is named by its

encoding

field.

In addition to the encoding, the audio format includes other properties that
further specify the exact arrangement of the data. These include the number
of channels, sample rate, sample size, byte order, frame rate, and frame
size. Sounds may have different numbers of audio channels: one for mono, two
for stereo. The sample rate measures how many "snapshots" (samples) of the
sound pressure are taken per second, per channel. (If the sound is stereo
rather than mono, two samples are actually measured at each instant of time:
one for the left channel, and another for the right channel; however, the
sample rate still measures the number per channel, so the rate is the same
regardless of the number of channels. This is the standard use of the term.)
The sample size indicates how many bits are used to store each snapshot; 8
and 16 are typical values. For 16-bit samples (or any other sample size
larger than a byte), byte order is important; the bytes in each sample are
arranged in either the "little-endian" or "big-endian" style. For encodings
like PCM, a frame consists of the set of samples for all channels at a given
point in time, and so the size of a frame (in bytes) is always equal to the
size of a sample (in bytes) times the number of channels. However, with some
other sorts of encodings a frame can contain a bundle of compressed data for
a whole series of samples, as well as additional, non-sample data. For such
encodings, the sample rate and sample size refer to the data after it is
decoded into PCM, and so they are completely different from the frame rate
and frame size.

An

AudioFormat

object can include a set of properties. A property is
a pair of key and value: the key is of type

String

, the associated
property value is an arbitrary object. Properties specify additional format
specifications, like the bit rate for compressed formats. Properties are
mainly used as a means to transport additional information of the audio
format to and from the service providers. Therefore, properties are ignored
in the

matches(AudioFormat)

method. However, methods which rely on
the installed service providers, like

(AudioFormat, AudioFormat)
isConversionSupported

may consider properties, depending on the respective
service provider implementation.

The following table lists some common properties which service providers
should use, if applicable:

Audio Format Properties

Property key

"bitrate"

Integer

average bit rate in bits per second

"vbr"

Boolean

true

, if the file is encoded in variable bit rate (VBR)

Vendors of service providers (plugins) are encouraged to seek information
about other already established properties in third party plugins, and follow
the same conventions.

further specify the exact arrangement of the data. These include the number
of channels, sample rate, sample size, byte order, frame rate, and frame
size. Sounds may have different numbers of audio channels: one for mono, two
for stereo. The sample rate measures how many "snapshots" (samples) of the
sound pressure are taken per second, per channel. (If the sound is stereo
rather than mono, two samples are actually measured at each instant of time:
one for the left channel, and another for the right channel; however, the
sample rate still measures the number per channel, so the rate is the same
regardless of the number of channels. This is the standard use of the term.)
The sample size indicates how many bits are used to store each snapshot; 8
and 16 are typical values. For 16-bit samples (or any other sample size
larger than a byte), byte order is important; the bytes in each sample are
arranged in either the "little-endian" or "big-endian" style. For encodings
like PCM, a frame consists of the set of samples for all channels at a given
point in time, and so the size of a frame (in bytes) is always equal to the
size of a sample (in bytes) times the number of channels. However, with some
other sorts of encodings a frame can contain a bundle of compressed data for
a whole series of samples, as well as additional, non-sample data. For such
encodings, the sample rate and sample size refer to the data after it is
decoded into PCM, and so they are completely different from the frame rate
and frame size.

An

AudioFormat

object can include a set of properties. A property is
a pair of key and value: the key is of type

String

, the associated
property value is an arbitrary object. Properties specify additional format
specifications, like the bit rate for compressed formats. Properties are
mainly used as a means to transport additional information of the audio
format to and from the service providers. Therefore, properties are ignored
in the

matches(AudioFormat)

method. However, methods which rely on
the installed service providers, like

(AudioFormat, AudioFormat)
isConversionSupported

may consider properties, depending on the respective
service provider implementation.

The following table lists some common properties which service providers
should use, if applicable:

Vendors of service providers (plugins) are encouraged to seek information
