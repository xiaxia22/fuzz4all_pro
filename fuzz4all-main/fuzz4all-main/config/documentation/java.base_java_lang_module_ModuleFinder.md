### Class Description

```java
public interface
ModuleFinder
```

A finder of modules. A

ModuleFinder

is used to find modules during

resolution

or

service binding

.

A

ModuleFinder

can only find one module with a given name. A

ModuleFinder

that finds modules in a sequence of directories, for
example, will locate the first occurrence of a module of a given name and
will ignore other modules of that name that appear in directories later in
the sequence.

Example usage:

```java
Path dir1, dir2, dir3;

ModuleFinder finder = ModuleFinder.of(dir1, dir2, dir3);

Optional<ModuleReference> omref = finder.find("jdk.foo");
omref.ifPresent(mref -> ... );
```

The

find

and

findAll

methods
defined here can fail for several reasons. These include I/O errors, errors
detected parsing a module descriptor (

module-info.class

), or in the
case of

ModuleFinder

returned by

ModuleFinder.of

, that
two or more modules with the same name are found in a directory.
When an error is detected then these methods throw

FindException

with an appropriate

cause

.
The behavior of a

ModuleFinder

after a

FindException

is
thrown is undefined. For example, invoking

find

after an exception
is thrown may or may not scan the same modules that lead to the exception.
It is recommended that a module finder be discarded after an exception is
thrown.

A

ModuleFinder

is not required to be thread safe.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### Optional
<
ModuleReference
> find​(
String
name)

Finds a reference to a module of a given name.

A

ModuleFinder

provides a consistent view of the
modules that it locates. If

find

is invoked several times to
locate the same module (by name) then it will return the same result
each time. If a module is located then it is guaranteed to be a member
of the set of modules returned by the

findAll

method.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the module to find

**Returns:**
- A reference to a module with the given name or an empty

Optional

if not found

**Throws:**
- FindException

- If an error occurs finding the module
- SecurityException

- If denied by the security manager

---

#### Set
<
ModuleReference
> findAll()

Returns the set of all module references that this finder can locate.

A

ModuleFinder

provides a consistent view of the modules
that it locates. If

findAll

is invoked several times
then it will return the same (equals) result each time. For each

ModuleReference

element in the returned set then it is guaranteed that

find

will locate the

ModuleReference

if invoked
to find that module.

**Returns:**
- The set of all module references that this finder locates

**Throws:**
- FindException

- If an error occurs finding all modules
- SecurityException

- If denied by the security manager

**API Note:**
- This is important to have for methods such as

resolveAndBind

that need to scan the
module path to find modules that provide a specific service.

---

#### static
ModuleFinder
ofSystem()

Returns a module finder that locates the

system modules

. The
system modules are the modules in the Java run-time image.
The module finder will always find

java.base

.

If there is a security manager set then its

checkPermission

method is
invoked to check that the caller has been granted

RuntimePermission("accessSystemModules")

to access the system modules.

**Returns:**
- A

ModuleFinder

that locates the system modules

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If denied by the security manager

---

#### static
ModuleFinder
of​(
Path
... entries)

Returns a module finder that locates modules on the file system by
searching a sequence of directories and/or packaged modules.

Each element in the given array is one of:

- A path to a directory of modules.
- A path to the

top-level

directory of an

exploded module

.
- A path to a

packaged module

.

The module finder locates modules by searching each directory, exploded
module, or packaged module in array index order. It finds the first
occurrence of a module with a given name and ignores other modules of
that name that appear later in the sequence.

If an element is a path to a directory of modules then each entry in
the directory is a packaged module or the top-level directory of an
exploded module. It is an error if a directory contains more than one
module with the same name. If an element is a path to a directory, and
that directory contains a file named

module-info.class

, then the
directory is treated as an exploded module rather than a directory of
modules.

The module finder returned by this method
supports modules packaged as JAR files. A JAR file with a

module-info.class

in its top-level directory, or in a versioned entry
in a

multi-release

JAR file, is a modular JAR file and thus defines an

explicit

module. A JAR file that does not have a

module-info.class

in its
top-level directory defines an

automatic module

, as follows:

- If the JAR file has the attribute "

Automatic-Module-Name

"
in its main manifest then its value is the

module name

. The module name is otherwise
derived from the name of the JAR file.
- The

version

, and the
module name when the attribute "

Automatic-Module-Name

" is not
present, are derived from the file name of the JAR file as follows:

- The "

.jar

" suffix is removed.
- If the name matches the regular expression

"-(\\d+(\\.|$))"

then the module name will be derived from the
subsequence preceding the hyphen of the first occurrence. The
subsequence after the hyphen is parsed as a

Version

and ignored if it cannot be
parsed as a

Version

.
- All non-alphanumeric characters (

[^A-Za-z0-9]

)
in the module name are replaced with a dot (

"."

), all
repeating dots are replaced with one dot, and all leading and
trailing dots are removed.
- As an example, a JAR file named "

foo-bar.jar

" will
derive a module name "

foo.bar

" and no version. A JAR file
named "

foo-bar-1.2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar

" will derive a module
name "

foo.bar

" and "

1.2.3-SNAPSHOT

" as the version.
- The set of packages in the module is derived from the
non-directory entries in the JAR file that have names ending in
"

.class

". A candidate package name is derived from the name
using the characters up to, but not including, the last forward slash.
All remaining forward slashes are replaced with dot (

"."

). If
the resulting string is a legal package name then it is assumed to be
a package name. For example, if the JAR file contains the entry
"

p/q/Foo.class

" then the package name derived is
"

p.q

".
- The contents of entries starting with

META-INF/services/

are assumed to be service configuration files
(see

ServiceLoader

). If the name of a file
(that follows

META-INF/services/

) is a legal class name
then it is assumed to be the fully-qualified class name of a service
type. The entries in the file are assumed to be the fully-qualified
class names of provider classes.
- If the JAR file has a

Main-Class

attribute in its
main manifest, its value is a legal class name, and its package is
in the set of packages derived for the module, then the value is the
module

main class

.

If a

ModuleDescriptor

cannot be created (by means of the

ModuleDescriptor.Builder

API) for an
automatic module then

FindException

is thrown. This can arise
when the value of the "

Automatic-Module-Name

" attribute is not a
legal module name, a legal module name cannot be derived from the file
name of the JAR file, where the JAR file contains a

.class

in
the top-level directory of the JAR file, where an entry in a service
configuration file is not a legal class name or its package name is not
in the set of packages derived for the module.

In addition to JAR files, an implementation may also support modules
that are packaged in other implementation specific module formats. If
an element in the array specified to this method is a path to a directory
of modules then entries in the directory that not recognized as modules
are ignored. If an element in the array is a path to a packaged module
that is not recognized then a

FindException

is thrown when the
file is encountered. Paths to files that do not exist are always ignored.

As with automatic modules, the contents of a packaged or exploded
module may need to be

scanned

in order to determine the packages
in the module. Whether

hidden files

are ignored or not is implementation specific and therefore
not specified. If a

.class

file (other than

module-info.class

) is found in the top-level directory then it is
assumed to be a class in the unnamed package and so

FindException

is thrown.

Finders created by this method are lazy and do not eagerly check
that the given file paths are directories or packaged modules.
Consequently, the

find

or

findAll

methods will only
fail if invoking these methods results in searching a directory or
packaged module and an error is encountered.

**Parameters:**
- entries

- A possibly-empty array of paths to directories of modules
or paths to packaged or exploded modules

**Returns:**
- A

ModuleFinder

that locates modules on the file system

---

#### static
ModuleFinder
compose​(
ModuleFinder
... finders)

Returns a module finder that is composed from a sequence of zero or more
module finders. The

find

method of the resulting
module finder will locate a module by invoking the

find

method
of each module finder, in array index order, until either the module is
found or all module finders have been searched. The

findAll

method of the resulting module finder will return a set of
modules that includes all modules located by the first module finder.
The set of modules will include all modules located by the second or
subsequent module finder that are not located by previous module finders
in the sequence.

When locating modules then any exceptions or errors thrown by the

find

or

findAll

methods of the underlying module finders
will be propagated to the caller of the resulting module finder's

find

or

findAll

methods.

**Parameters:**
- finders

- The array of module finders

**Returns:**
- A

ModuleFinder

that composes a sequence of module finders

Returns a module finder that locates modules on the file system by
searching a sequence of directories and/or packaged modules.

Each element in the given array is one of:

- A path to a directory of modules.
- A path to the

top-level

directory of an

exploded module

.
- A path to a

packaged module

.

The module finder locates modules by searching each directory, exploded
module, or packaged module in array index order. It finds the first
occurrence of a module with a given name and ignores other modules of
that name that appear later in the sequence.

If an element is a path to a directory of modules then each entry in
the directory is a packaged module or the top-level directory of an
exploded module. It is an error if a directory contains more than one
module with the same name. If an element is a path to a directory, and
that directory contains a file named

module-info.class

, then the
directory is treated as an exploded module rather than a directory of
modules.

then the module name will be derived from the
subsequence preceding the hyphen of the first occurrence. The
subsequence after the hyphen is parsed as a

Version

and ignored if it cannot be
parsed as a

Version

.
- All non-alphanumeric characters (

[^A-Za-z0-9]

)
in the module name are replaced with a dot (

"."

), all
repeating dots are replaced with one dot, and all leading and
trailing dots are removed.
- As an example, a JAR file named "

foo-bar.jar

" will
derive a module name "

foo.bar

" and no version. A JAR file
named "

foo-bar-1.2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar

" will derive a module
name "

foo.bar

" and "

1.2.3-SNAPSHOT

" as the version.
- The set of packages in the module is derived from the
non-directory entries in the JAR file that have names ending in
"

using the characters up to, but not including, the last forward slash.
All remaining forward slashes are replaced with dot (

automatic module then

FindException

is thrown. This can arise
when the value of the "

Each element in the given array is one of:

- A path to a directory of modules.
- A path to the

top-level

directory of an

.
- A path to a

packaged module

.

The module finder locates modules by searching each directory, exploded
module, or packaged module in array index order. It finds the first
occurrence of a module with a given name and ignores other modules of
that name that appear later in the sequence.

If an element is a path to a directory of modules then each entry in
the directory is a packaged module or the top-level directory of an
exploded module. It is an error if a directory contains more than one
module with the same name. If an element is a path to a directory, and
that directory contains a file named

module-info.class

, then the
directory is treated as an exploded module rather than a directory of
modules.

- If the name matches the regular expression

"-(\\d+(\\.|$))"

then the module name will be derived from the
subsequence preceding the hyphen of the first occurrence. The
subsequence after the hyphen is parsed as a

Version

and ignored if it cannot be
parsed as a

Version

.
- All non-alphanumeric characters (

[^A-Za-z0-9]

)
in the module name are replaced with a dot (

"."

), all
repeating dots are replaced with one dot, and all leading and
trailing dots are removed.
- As an example, a JAR file named "

foo-bar.jar

" will
derive a module name "

foo.bar

" and no version. A JAR file
named "

foo-bar-1.2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar

" will derive a module
name "

foo.bar

" and "

1.2.3-SNAPSHOT

" as the version.
- The set of packages in the module is derived from the
non-directory entries in the JAR file that have names ending in
"

.class

". A candidate package name is derived from the name
using the characters up to, but not including, the last forward slash.
All remaining forward slashes are replaced with dot (

"."

). If
the resulting string is a legal package name then it is assumed to be
a package name. For example, if the JAR file contains the entry
"

p/q/Foo.class

" then the package name derived is
"

p.q

".
- The contents of entries starting with

META-INF/services/

are assumed to be service configuration files
(see

ServiceLoader

). If the name of a file
(that follows

META-INF/services/

) is a legal class name
then it is assumed to be the fully-qualified class name of a service
type. The entries in the file are assumed to be the fully-qualified
class names of provider classes.
- If the JAR file has a

Main-Class

attribute in its
main manifest, its value is a legal class name, and its package is
in the set of packages derived for the module, then the value is the
module

main class

.

If a

ModuleDescriptor

cannot be created (by means of the

ModuleDescriptor.Builder

API) for an
automatic module then

FindException

is thrown. This can arise
when the value of the "

Automatic-Module-Name

" attribute is not a
legal module name, a legal module name cannot be derived from the file
name of the JAR file, where the JAR file contains a

.class

in
the top-level directory of the JAR file, where an entry in a service
configuration file is not a legal class name or its package name is not
in the set of packages derived for the module.

In addition to JAR files, an implementation may also support modules
that are packaged in other implementation specific module formats. If
an element in the array specified to this method is a path to a directory
of modules then entries in the directory that not recognized as modules
are ignored. If an element in the array is a path to a packaged module
that is not recognized then a

FindException

is thrown when the
file is encountered. Paths to files that do not exist are always ignored.

As with automatic modules, the contents of a packaged or exploded
module may need to be

scanned

in order to determine the packages
in the module. Whether

hidden files

are ignored or not is implementation specific and therefore
not specified. If a

.class

file (other than

module-info.class

) is found in the top-level directory then it is
assumed to be a class in the unnamed package and so

FindException

is thrown.

Finders created by this method are lazy and do not eagerly check
that the given file paths are directories or packaged modules.
Consequently, the

find

or

findAll

methods will only
fail if invoking these methods results in searching a directory or
packaged module and an error is encountered.

**Parameters:** entries

- A possibly-empty array of paths to directories of modules
or paths to packaged or exploded modules
**Returns:** A

ModuleFinder

that locates modules on the file system

- compose

```java
static
ModuleFinder
compose​(
ModuleFinder
... finders)
```

Returns a module finder that is composed from a sequence of zero or more
module finders. The

find

method of the resulting
module finder will locate a module by invoking the

find

method
of each module finder, in array index order, until either the module is
found or all module finders have been searched. The

findAll

method of the resulting module finder will return a set of
modules that includes all modules located by the first module finder.
The set of modules will include all modules located by the second or
subsequent module finder that are not located by previous module finders
in the sequence.

When locating modules then any exceptions or errors thrown by the

find

or

findAll

methods of the underlying module finders
will be propagated to the caller of the resulting module finder's

find

or

findAll

methods.

**Parameters:** finders

- The array of module finders
**Returns:** A

ModuleFinder

that composes a sequence of module finders

of

```java
static
ModuleFinder
of​(
Path
... entries)
```

Returns a module finder that locates modules on the file system by
searching a sequence of directories and/or packaged modules.

Each element in the given array is one of:

- A path to a directory of modules.
- A path to the

top-level

directory of an

exploded module

.
- A path to a

packaged module

.

The module finder locates modules by searching each directory, exploded
module, or packaged module in array index order. It finds the first
occurrence of a module with a given name and ignores other modules of
that name that appear later in the sequence.

If an element is a path to a directory of modules then each entry in
the directory is a packaged module or the top-level directory of an
exploded module. It is an error if a directory contains more than one
module with the same name. If an element is a path to a directory, and
that directory contains a file named

module-info.class

, then the
directory is treated as an exploded module rather than a directory of
modules.

The module finder returned by this method
supports modules packaged as JAR files. A JAR file with a

module-info.class

in its top-level directory, or in a versioned entry
in a

multi-release

JAR file, is a modular JAR file and thus defines an

explicit

module. A JAR file that does not have a

module-info.class

in its
top-level directory defines an

automatic module

, as follows:

- If the JAR file has the attribute "

Automatic-Module-Name

"
in its main manifest then its value is the

module name

. The module name is otherwise
derived from the name of the JAR file.
- The

version

, and the
module name when the attribute "

Automatic-Module-Name

" is not
present, are derived from the file name of the JAR file as follows:

- The "

.jar

" suffix is removed.
- If the name matches the regular expression

"-(\\d+(\\.|$))"

then the module name will be derived from the
subsequence preceding the hyphen of the first occurrence. The
subsequence after the hyphen is parsed as a

Version

and ignored if it cannot be
parsed as a

Version

.
- All non-alphanumeric characters (

[^A-Za-z0-9]

)
in the module name are replaced with a dot (

"."

), all
repeating dots are replaced with one dot, and all leading and
trailing dots are removed.
- As an example, a JAR file named "

foo-bar.jar

" will
derive a module name "

foo.bar

" and no version. A JAR file
named "

foo-bar-1.2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar

" will derive a module
name "

foo.bar

" and "

1.2.3-SNAPSHOT

" as the version.
- The set of packages in the module is derived from the
non-directory entries in the JAR file that have names ending in
"

.class

". A candidate package name is derived from the name
using the characters up to, but not including, the last forward slash.
All remaining forward slashes are replaced with dot (

"."

). If
the resulting string is a legal package name then it is assumed to be
a package name. For example, if the JAR file contains the entry
"

p/q/Foo.class

" then the package name derived is
"

p.q

".
- The contents of entries starting with

META-INF/services/

are assumed to be service configuration files
(see

ServiceLoader

). If the name of a file
(that follows

META-INF/services/

) is a legal class name
then it is assumed to be the fully-qualified class name of a service
type. The entries in the file are assumed to be the fully-qualified
class names of provider classes.
- If the JAR file has a

Main-Class

attribute in its
main manifest, its value is a legal class name, and its package is
in the set of packages derived for the module, then the value is the
module

main class

.

If a

ModuleDescriptor

cannot be created (by means of the

ModuleDescriptor.Builder

API) for an
automatic module then

FindException

is thrown. This can arise
when the value of the "

Automatic-Module-Name

" attribute is not a
legal module name, a legal module name cannot be derived from the file
name of the JAR file, where the JAR file contains a

.class

in
the top-level directory of the JAR file, where an entry in a service
configuration file is not a legal class name or its package name is not
in the set of packages derived for the module.

In addition to JAR files, an implementation may also support modules
that are packaged in other implementation specific module formats. If

ModuleFinder

of​(

Path

... entries)

Returns a module finder that locates modules on the file system by
searching a sequence of directories and/or packaged modules.

Each element in the given array is one of:

- A path to a directory of modules.
- A path to the

top-level

directory of an

exploded module

.
- A path to a

packaged module

.

The module finder locates modules by searching each directory, exploded
module, or packaged module in array index order. It finds the first
occurrence of a module with a given name and ignores other modules of
that name that appear later in the sequence.

If an element is a path to a directory of modules then each entry in
the directory is a packaged module or the top-level directory of an
exploded module. It is an error if a directory contains more than one
module with the same name. If an element is a path to a directory, and
that directory contains a file named

module-info.class

, then the
directory is treated as an exploded module rather than a directory of
modules.

The module finder returned by this method
supports modules packaged as JAR files. A JAR file with a

module-info.class

in its top-level directory, or in a versioned entry
in a

multi-release

JAR file, is a modular JAR file and thus defines an

- The

version

, and the
module name when the attribute "

Automatic-Module-Name

" is not
present, are derived from the file name of the JAR file as follows:

- The "

.jar

" suffix is removed.
- If the name matches the regular expression

"-(\\d+(\\.|$))"

then the module name will be derived from the
subsequence preceding the hyphen of the first occurrence. The
subsequence after the hyphen is parsed as a

Version

and ignored if it cannot be
parsed as a

Version

.
- All non-alphanumeric characters (

[^A-Za-z0-9]

)
in the module name are replaced with a dot (

"."

), all
repeating dots are replaced with one dot, and all leading and
trailing dots are removed.
- As an example, a JAR file named "

foo-bar.jar

" will
derive a module name "

foo.bar

" and no version. A JAR file
named "

foo-bar-1.2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar

" will derive a module
name "

foo.bar

" and "

1.2.3-SNAPSHOT

" as the version.
- The set of packages in the module is derived from the
non-directory entries in the JAR file that have names ending in
"

.class

". A candidate package name is derived from the name
using the characters up to, but not including, the last forward slash.
All remaining forward slashes are replaced with dot (

"."

). If
the resulting string is a legal package name then it is assumed to be
a package name. For example, if the JAR file contains the entry
"

p/q/Foo.class

" then the package name derived is
"

p.q

".
- The contents of entries starting with

META-INF/services/

are assumed to be service configuration files
(see

ServiceLoader

). If the name of a file
(that follows

META-INF/services/

) is a legal class name
then it is assumed to be the fully-qualified class name of a service
type. The entries in the file are assumed to be the fully-qualified
class names of provider classes.
- If the JAR file has a

Main-Class

attribute in its
main manifest, its value is a legal class name, and its package is
in the set of packages derived for the module, then the value is the
module

main class

.

If a

ModuleDescriptor

cannot be created (by means of the

ModuleDescriptor.Builder

API) for an
automatic module then

FindException

is thrown. This can arise
when the value of the "

Automatic-Module-Name

" attribute is not a
legal module name, a legal module name cannot be derived from the file
name of the JAR file, where the JAR file contains a

.class

the top-level directory of the JAR file, where an entry in a service
configuration file is not a legal class name or its package name is not

methods.

**Parameters:** finders

- The array of module finders
**Returns:** A

ModuleFinder

that composes a sequence of module finders

#### compose

static

ModuleFinder

compose​(

ModuleFinder

... finders)

Returns a module finder that is composed from a sequence of zero or more
module finders. The

find

method of the resulting
module finder will locate a module by invoking the

find

method
of each module finder, in array index order, until either the module is
found or all module finders have been searched. The

findAll

method of the resulting module finder will return a set of
modules that includes all modules located by the first module finder.
The set of modules will include all modules located by the second or
subsequent module finder that are not located by previous module finders
in the sequence.

When locating modules then any exceptions or errors thrown by the

find

or

findAll

methods of the underlying module finders
will be propagated to the caller of the resulting module finder's

find

or

findAll

methods.
