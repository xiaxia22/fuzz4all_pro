# Interface DirectoryStream<T>

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\file\DirectoryStream.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
DirectoryStream<T>

extends
Closeable
,
Iterable
<T>
```

An object to iterate over the entries in a directory. A directory stream
allows for the convenient use of the for-each construct to iterate over a
directory.

While

DirectoryStream

extends

Iterable

, it is not a
general-purpose

Iterable

as it supports only a single

Iterator

; invoking the

iterator

method to obtain a second
or subsequent iterator throws

IllegalStateException

.

An important property of the directory stream's

Iterator

is that
its

hasNext

method is guaranteed to read-ahead by
at least one element. If

hasNext

method returns

true

, and is
followed by a call to the

next

method, it is guaranteed that the

next

method will not throw an exception due to an I/O error, or
because the stream has been

closed

. The

Iterator

does
not support the

remove

operation.

A

DirectoryStream

is opened upon creation and is closed by
invoking the

close

method. Closing a directory stream releases any
resources associated with the stream. Failure to close the stream may result
in a resource leak. The try-with-resources statement provides a useful
construct to ensure that the stream is closed:

```java
Path dir = ...
try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir)) {
for (Path entry: stream) {
...
}
}
```

Once a directory stream is closed, then further access to the directory,
using the

Iterator

, behaves as if the end of stream has been reached.
Due to read-ahead, the

Iterator

may return one or more elements
after the directory stream has been closed. Once these buffered elements
have been read, then subsequent calls to the

hasNext

method returns

false

, and subsequent calls to the

next

method will throw

NoSuchElementException

.

A directory stream is not required to be

asynchronously closeable

.
If a thread is blocked on the directory stream's iterator reading from the
directory, and another thread invokes the

close

method, then the
second thread may block until the read operation is complete.

If an I/O error is encountered when accessing the directory then it
causes the

Iterator

's

hasNext

or

next

methods to
throw

DirectoryIteratorException

with the

IOException

as the
cause. As stated above, the

hasNext

method is guaranteed to
read-ahead by at least one element. This means that if

hasNext

method
returns

true

, and is followed by a call to the

next

method,
then it is guaranteed that the

next

method will not fail with a

DirectoryIteratorException

.

The elements returned by the iterator are in no specific order. Some file
systems maintain special links to the directory itself and the directory's
parent directory. Entries representing these links are not returned by the
iterator.

The iterator is

weakly consistent

. It is thread safe but does not
freeze the directory while iterating, so it may (or may not) reflect updates
to the directory that occur after the

DirectoryStream

is created.

Usage Examples:

Suppose we want a list of the source files in a directory. This example uses
both the for-each and try-with-resources constructs.

```java
List<Path> listSourceFiles(Path dir) throws IOException {
List<Path> result = new ArrayList<>();
try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, "*.{c,h,cpp,hpp,java}")) {
for (Path entry: stream) {
result.add(entry);
}
} catch (DirectoryIteratorException ex) {
// I/O error encounted during the iteration, the cause is an IOException
throw ex.getCause();
}
return result;
}
```
