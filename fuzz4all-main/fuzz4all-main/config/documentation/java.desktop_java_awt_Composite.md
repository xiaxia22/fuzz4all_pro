# Interface Composite

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\Composite.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Composite
```

The

Composite

interface, along with

CompositeContext

, defines the methods to compose a draw
primitive with the underlying graphics area.
After the

Composite

is set in the

Graphics2D

context, it combines a shape, text, or an image
being rendered with the colors that have already been rendered
according to pre-defined rules. The classes
implementing this interface provide the rules and a method to create
the context for a particular operation.

CompositeContext

is an environment used by the
compositing operation, which is created by the

Graphics2D

prior to the start of the operation.

CompositeContext

contains private information and resources needed for a compositing
operation. When the

CompositeContext

is no longer needed,
the

Graphics2D

object disposes of it in order to reclaim
resources allocated for the operation.

Instances of classes implementing

Composite

must be
immutable because the

Graphics2D

does not clone
these objects when they are set as an attribute with the

setComposite

method or when the

Graphics2D

object is cloned. This is to avoid undefined rendering behavior of

Graphics2D

, resulting from the modification of
the

Composite

object after it has been set in the

Graphics2D

context.

Since this interface must expose the contents of pixels on the
target device or image to potentially arbitrary code, the use of
custom objects which implement this interface when rendering directly
to a screen device is governed by the

readDisplayPixels

AWTPermission

. The permission check will occur when such
a custom object is passed to the

setComposite

method
of a

Graphics2D

retrieved from a

Component

.

### Method Details

#### CompositeContext
createContext​(
ColorModel
srcColorModel,

ColorModel
dstColorModel,

RenderingHints
hints)

Creates a context containing state that is used to perform
the compositing operation. In a multi-threaded environment,
several contexts can exist simultaneously for a single

Composite

object.

**Parameters:**
- srcColorModel

- the

ColorModel

of the source
- dstColorModel

- the

ColorModel

of the destination
- hints

- the hint that the context object uses to choose between
rendering alternatives

**Returns:**
- the

CompositeContext

object used to perform the
compositing operation.
