# Class SAXParserFactory

**Source:** `java.xml\javax\xml\parsers\SAXParserFactory.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
SAXParserFactory

extends
Object
```

Defines a factory API that enables applications to configure and
obtain a SAX based parser to parse XML documents.

**Since:** 1.4

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected SAXParserFactory()

Protected constructor to force use of

newInstance()

.

---

### Method Details

#### public static
SAXParserFactory
newDefaultInstance()

Creates a new instance of the

SAXParserFactory

builtin
system-default implementation.

**Returns:**
- A new instance of the

SAXParserFactory

builtin
system-default implementation.

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public static
SAXParserFactory
newInstance()

Obtain a new instance of a

SAXParserFactory

. This
static method creates a new factory instance
This method uses the following ordered lookup procedure to determine
the

SAXParserFactory

implementation class to
load:

- Use the

javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory

system
property.
- Use the configuration file "jaxp.properties". The file is in standard

Properties

format and typically located in the

conf

directory of the Java installation. It contains the fully qualified
name of the implementation class with the key being the system property
defined above.

The jaxp.properties file is read only once by the JAXP implementation
and its values are then cached for future use. If the file does not exist
when the first attempt is made to read from it, no further attempts are
made to check for its existence. It is not possible to change the value
of any property in jaxp.properties after it has been read for the first time.
- Use the service-provider loading facility, defined by the

ServiceLoader

class, to attempt to locate and load an
implementation of the service using the

default loading mechanism

:
the service-provider loading facility will use the

current thread's context class loader

to attempt to load the service. If the context class
loader is null, the

system class loader

will be used.
- Otherwise, the

system-default

implementation is returned.

Once an application has obtained a reference to a

SAXParserFactory

it can use the factory to
configure and obtain parser instances.

Tip for Trouble-shooting

Setting the

jaxp.debug

system property will cause
this method to print a lot of debug messages
to

System.err

about what it is doing and where it is looking at.

If you have problems loading

SAXParser

s, try:

```java
java -Djaxp.debug=1 YourProgram ....
```

**Returns:**
- A new instance of a SAXParserFactory.

**Throws:**
- FactoryConfigurationError

- in case of

service configuration error

or if
the implementation is not available or cannot be instantiated.

---

#### public static
SAXParserFactory
newInstance​(
String
factoryClassName,

ClassLoader
classLoader)

Obtain a new instance of a

SAXParserFactory

from class name.
This function is useful when there are multiple providers in the classpath.
It gives more control to the application as it can specify which provider
should be loaded.

Once an application has obtained a reference to a

SAXParserFactory

it can use the factory to configure and obtain parser instances.

Tip for Trouble-shooting

Setting the

jaxp.debug

system property will cause
this method to print a lot of debug messages
to

System.err

about what it is doing and where it is looking at.

If you have problems, try:

```java
java -Djaxp.debug=1 YourProgram ....
```

**Parameters:**
- factoryClassName

- fully qualified factory class name that provides implementation of

javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory

.
- classLoader

-

ClassLoader

used to load the factory class. If

null

current

Thread

's context classLoader is used to load the factory class.

**Returns:**
- New instance of a

SAXParserFactory

**Throws:**
- FactoryConfigurationError

- if

factoryClassName

is

null

, or
the factory class cannot be loaded, instantiated.

**See Also:**
- newInstance()

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public abstract
SAXParser
newSAXParser()
throws
ParserConfigurationException
,

SAXException

Creates a new instance of a SAXParser using the currently
configured factory parameters.

**Returns:**
- A new instance of a SAXParser.

**Throws:**
- ParserConfigurationException

- if a parser cannot
be created which satisfies the requested configuration.
- SAXException

- for SAX errors.

---

#### public void setNamespaceAware​(boolean awareness)

Specifies that the parser produced by this code will
provide support for XML namespaces. By default the value of this is set
to

false

.

**Parameters:**
- awareness

- true if the parser produced by this code will
provide support for XML namespaces; false otherwise.

---

#### public void setValidating​(boolean validating)

Specifies that the parser produced by this code will
validate documents as they are parsed. By default the value of this is
set to

false

.

Note that "the validation" here means

a validating
parser

as defined in the XML recommendation.
In other words, it essentially just controls the DTD validation.
(except the legacy two properties defined in JAXP 1.2.)

To use modern schema languages such as W3C XML Schema or
RELAX NG instead of DTD, you can configure your parser to be
a non-validating parser by leaving the

setValidating(boolean)

method

false

, then use the

setSchema(Schema)

method to associate a schema to a parser.

**Parameters:**
- validating

- true if the parser produced by this code will
validate documents as they are parsed; false otherwise.

---

#### public boolean isNamespaceAware()

Indicates whether or not the factory is configured to produce
parsers which are namespace aware.

**Returns:**
- true if the factory is configured to produce
parsers which are namespace aware; false otherwise.

---

#### public boolean isValidating()

Indicates whether or not the factory is configured to produce
parsers which validate the XML content during parse.

**Returns:**
- true if the factory is configured to produce parsers which validate
the XML content during parse; false otherwise.

---

#### public abstract void setFeature​(
String
name,
boolean value)
throws
ParserConfigurationException
,

SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException

Sets the particular feature in the underlying implementation of
org.xml.sax.XMLReader.
A list of the core features and properties can be found at

http://www.saxproject.org/

All implementations are required to support the

XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING

feature.
When the feature is

- true

: the implementation will limit XML processing to conform to implementation limits.
Examples include entity expansion limits and XML Schema constructs that would consume large amounts of resources.
If XML processing is limited for security reasons, it will be reported via a call to the registered

ErrorHandler.fatalError(SAXParseException exception)

.
See

SAXParser

parse

methods for handler specification.
- When the feature is

false

, the implementation will processing XML according to the XML specifications without
regard to possible implementation limits.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the feature to be set.
- value

- The value of the feature to be set.

**Throws:**
- ParserConfigurationException

- if a parser cannot
be created which satisfies the requested configuration.
- SAXNotRecognizedException

- When the underlying XMLReader does
not recognize the property name.
- SAXNotSupportedException

- When the underlying XMLReader
recognizes the property name but doesn't support the
property.
- NullPointerException

- If the

name

parameter is null.

**See Also:**
- XMLReader.setFeature(java.lang.String, boolean)

---

#### public abstract boolean getFeature​(
String
name)
throws
ParserConfigurationException
,

SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException

Returns the particular property requested for in the underlying
implementation of org.xml.sax.XMLReader.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the property to be retrieved.

**Returns:**
- Value of the requested property.

**Throws:**
- ParserConfigurationException

- if a parser cannot be created which satisfies the requested configuration.
- SAXNotRecognizedException

- When the underlying XMLReader does not recognize the property name.
- SAXNotSupportedException

- When the underlying XMLReader recognizes the property name but doesn't support the property.

**See Also:**
- XMLReader.getProperty(java.lang.String)

---

#### public
Schema
getSchema()

Gets the

Schema

object specified through
the

setSchema(Schema schema)

method.

**Returns:**
- the

Schema

object that was last set through
the

setSchema(Schema)

method, or null
if the method was not invoked since a

SAXParserFactory

is created.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public void setSchema​(
Schema
schema)

Set the

Schema

to be used by parsers created
from this factory.

When a

Schema

is non-null, a parser will use a validator
created from it to validate documents before it passes information
down to the application.

When warnings/errors/fatal errors are found by the validator, the parser must
handle them as if those errors were found by the parser itself.
In other words, if the user-specified

ErrorHandler

is set, it must receive those errors, and if not, they must be
treated according to the implementation specific
default error handling rules.

A validator may modify the SAX event stream (for example by
adding default values that were missing in documents), and a parser
is responsible to make sure that the application will receive
those modified event stream.

Initially,

null

is set as the

Schema

.

This processing will take effect even if
the

isValidating()

method returns

false

.

It is an error to use
the

http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaSource

property and/or the

http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaLanguage

property in conjunction with a non-null

Schema

object.
Such configuration will cause a

SAXException

exception when those properties are set on a

SAXParser

.

Note for implementors

A parser must be able to work with any

Schema

implementation. However, parsers and schemas are allowed
to use implementation-specific custom mechanisms
as long as they yield the result described in the specification.

**Parameters:**
- schema

-

Schema

to use,

null

to remove a schema.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public void setXIncludeAware​(boolean state)

Set state of XInclude processing.

If XInclude markup is found in the document instance, should it be
processed as specified in

XML Inclusions (XInclude) Version 1.0

.

XInclude processing defaults to

false

.

**Parameters:**
- state

- Set XInclude processing to

true

or

false

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public boolean isXIncludeAware()

Get state of XInclude processing.

**Returns:**
- current state of XInclude processing

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method

**Since:**
- 1.5

,

SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Sets the particular feature in the underlying implementation of
org.xml.sax.XMLReader.
A list of the core features and properties can be found at

http://www.saxproject.org/

All implementations are required to support the

XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING

feature.
When the feature is

- true

: the implementation will limit XML processing to conform to implementation limits.
Examples include entity expansion limits and XML Schema constructs that would consume large amounts of resources.
If XML processing is limited for security reasons, it will be reported via a call to the registered

ErrorHandler.fatalError(SAXParseException exception)

.
See

SAXParser

parse

methods for handler specification.
- When the feature is

false

, the implementation will processing XML according to the XML specifications without
regard to possible implementation limits.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the feature to be set.
**Parameters:** value

- The value of the feature to be set.
**Throws:** ParserConfigurationException

- if a parser cannot
be created which satisfies the requested configuration.
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- When the underlying XMLReader does
not recognize the property name.
**Throws:** SAXNotSupportedException

- When the underlying XMLReader
recognizes the property name but doesn't support the
property.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If the

name

parameter is null.

- getFeature

```java
public abstract boolean getFeature​(
String
name)
throws
ParserConfigurationException
,

SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Returns the particular property requested for in the underlying
implementation of org.xml.sax.XMLReader.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the property to be retrieved.
**Returns:** Value of the requested property.
**Throws:** ParserConfigurationException

- if a parser cannot be created which satisfies the requested configuration.
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- When the underlying XMLReader does not recognize the property name.
**Throws:** SAXNotSupportedException

- When the underlying XMLReader recognizes the property name but doesn't support the property.
**See Also:** XMLReader.getProperty(java.lang.String)

- getSchema

```java
public
Schema
getSchema()
```

Gets the

Schema

object specified through
the

setSchema(Schema schema)

method.

**Returns:** the

Schema

object that was last set through
the

setSchema(Schema)

method, or null
if the method was not invoked since a

SAXParserFactory

is created.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method
**Since:** 1.5

- setSchema

```java
public void setSchema​(
Schema
schema)
```

Set the

Schema

to be used by parsers created
from this factory.

When a

Schema

is non-null, a parser will use a validator
created from it to validate documents before it passes information
down to the application.

When warnings/errors/fatal errors are found by the validator, the parser must
handle them as if those errors were found by the parser itself.
In other words, if the user-specified

ErrorHandler

is set, it must receive those errors, and if not, they must be
treated according to the implementation specific
default error handling rules.

A validator may modify the SAX event stream (for example by
adding default values that were missing in documents), and a parser
is responsible to make sure that the application will receive
those modified event stream.

Initially,

null

is set as the

Schema

.

This processing will take effect even if
the

isValidating()

method returns

false

.

It is an error to use
the

http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaSource

property and/or the

http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaLanguage

property in conjunction with a non-null

Schema

object.
Such configuration will cause a

SAXException

exception when those properties are set on a

SAXParser

.

Note for implementors

A parser must be able to work with any

Schema

implementation. However, parsers and schemas are allowed
to use implementation-specific custom mechanisms
as long as they yield the result described in the specification.

**Parameters:** schema

-

Schema

to use,

null

to remove a schema.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method
**Since:** 1.5

- setXIncludeAware

```java
public void setXIncludeAware​(boolean state)
```

Set state of XInclude processing.

If XInclude markup is found in the document instance, should it be
processed as specified in

XML Inclusions (XInclude) Version 1.0

.

XInclude processing defaults to

false

.

**Parameters:** state

- Set XInclude processing to

true

or

false
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method
**Since:** 1.5

- isXIncludeAware

```java
public boolean isXIncludeAware()
```

Get state of XInclude processing.

**Returns:** current state of XInclude processing
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method

**Since:** 9

- newInstance

```java
public static
SAXParserFactory
newInstance()
```

Obtain a new instance of a

SAXParserFactory

. This
static method creates a new factory instance
This method uses the following ordered lookup procedure to determine
the

SAXParserFactory

implementation class to
load:

- Use the

javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory

system
property.
- Use the configuration file "jaxp.properties". The file is in standard

Properties

format and typically located in the

conf

directory of the Java installation. It contains the fully qualified
name of the implementation class with the key being the system property
defined above.

The jaxp.properties file is read only once by the JAXP implementation
and its values are then cached for future use. If the file does not exist
when the first attempt is made to read from it, no further attempts are
made to check for its existence. It is not possible to change the value
of any property in jaxp.properties after it has been read for the first time.
- Use the service-provider loading facility, defined by the

ServiceLoader

class, to attempt to locate and load an
implementation of the service using the

default loading mechanism

:
the service-provider loading facility will use the

current thread's context class loader

to attempt to load the service. If the context class
loader is null, the

system class loader

will be used.
- Otherwise, the

system-default

implementation is returned.

Once an application has obtained a reference to a

SAXParserFactory

it can use the factory to
configure and obtain parser instances.

Tip for Trouble-shooting

Setting the

jaxp.debug

system property will cause
this method to print a lot of debug messages
to

System.err

about what it is doing and where it is looking at.

If you have problems loading

SAXParser

s, try:

```java
java -Djaxp.debug=1 YourProgram ....
```

**Returns:** A new instance of a SAXParserFactory.
**Throws:** FactoryConfigurationError

or if
the implementation is not available or cannot be instantiated.

- newInstance

```java
public static
SAXParserFactory
newInstance​(
String
factoryClassName,

ClassLoader
classLoader)
```

Obtain a new instance of a

SAXParserFactory

from class name.
This function is useful when there are multiple providers in the classpath.
It gives more control to the application as it can specify which provider
should be loaded.

Once an application has obtained a reference to a

SAXParserFactory

it can use the factory to configure and obtain parser instances.

**Parameters:** factoryClassName

- fully qualified factory class name that provides implementation of

javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory

.
**Parameters:** classLoader

-

ClassLoader

used to load the factory class. If

null

current

Thread

's context classLoader is used to load the factory class.
**Returns:** New instance of a

SAXParserFactory
**Throws:** FactoryConfigurationError

- if

factoryClassName

is

null

, or
the factory class cannot be loaded, instantiated.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** newInstance()

- newSAXParser

```java
public abstract
SAXParser
newSAXParser()
throws
ParserConfigurationException
,

SAXException
```

Creates a new instance of a SAXParser using the currently
configured factory parameters.

**Returns:** A new instance of a SAXParser.
**Throws:** ParserConfigurationException

- if a parser cannot
be created which satisfies the requested configuration.
**Throws:** SAXException

- for SAX errors.

- setNamespaceAware

```java
public void setNamespaceAware​(boolean awareness)
```

Specifies that the parser produced by this code will
provide support for XML namespaces. By default the value of this is set
to

false

.

**Parameters:** awareness

- true if the parser produced by this code will
provide support for XML namespaces; false otherwise.

- setValidating

```java
public void setValidating​(boolean validating)
```

Specifies that the parser produced by this code will
validate documents as they are parsed. By default the value of this is
set to

false

.

Note that "the validation" here means

a validating
parser

as defined in the XML recommendation.
In other words, it essentially just controls the DTD validation.
(except the legacy two properties defined in JAXP 1.2.)

To use modern schema languages such as W3C XML Schema or
RELAX NG instead of DTD, you can configure your parser to be
a non-validating parser by leaving the

setValidating(boolean)

method

false

, then use the

setSchema(Schema)

method to associate a schema to a parser.

**Parameters:** validating

- true if the parser produced by this code will
validate documents as they are parsed; false otherwise.

- isNamespaceAware

```java
public boolean isNamespaceAware()
```

Indicates whether or not the factory is configured to produce
parsers which are namespace aware.

**Returns:** true if the factory is configured to produce
parsers which are namespace aware; false otherwise.

- isValidating

```java
public boolean isValidating()
```

Indicates whether or not the factory is configured to produce
parsers which validate the XML content during parse.

**Returns:** true if the factory is configured to produce parsers which validate
the XML content during parse; false otherwise.

- setFeature

```java
public abstract void setFeature​(
String
name,
boolean value)
throws
ParserConfigurationException
,

SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Sets the particular feature in the underlying implementation of
org.xml.sax.XMLReader.
A list of the core features and properties can be found at

http://www.saxproject.org/

All implementations are required to support the

XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING

feature.
When the feature is

- true

: the implementation will limit XML processing to conform to implementation limits.
Examples include entity expansion limits and XML Schema constructs that would consume large amounts of resources.
If XML processing is limited for security reasons, it will be reported via a call to the registered

ErrorHandler.fatalError(SAXParseException exception)

.
See

SAXParser

parse

methods for handler specification.
- When the feature is

false

, the implementation will processing XML according to the XML specifications without
regard to possible implementation limits.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the feature to be set.
**Parameters:** value

- The value of the feature to be set.
**Throws:** ParserConfigurationException

- if a parser cannot
be created which satisfies the requested configuration.
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- When the underlying XMLReader does
not recognize the property name.
**Throws:** SAXNotSupportedException

- When the underlying XMLReader
recognizes the property name but doesn't support the
property.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If the

name

parameter is null.
**See Also:** XMLReader.setFeature(java.lang.String, boolean)

- getFeature

```java
public abstract boolean getFeature​(
String
name)
throws
ParserConfigurationException
,

SAXNotRecognizedException
,

SAXNotSupportedException
```

Returns the particular property requested for in the underlying
implementation of org.xml.sax.XMLReader.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the property to be retrieved.
**Returns:** Value of the requested property.
**Throws:** ParserConfigurationException

- if a parser cannot be created which satisfies the requested configuration.
**Throws:** SAXNotRecognizedException

- When the underlying XMLReader does not recognize the property name.
**Throws:** SAXNotSupportedException

- When the underlying XMLReader recognizes the property name but doesn't support the property.
**See Also:** XMLReader.getProperty(java.lang.String)

- getSchema

```java
public
Schema
getSchema()
```

Gets the

Schema

object specified through
the

setSchema(Schema schema)

method.

**Returns:** the

Schema

object that was last set through
the

setSchema(Schema)

method, or null
if the method was not invoked since a

SAXParserFactory

is created.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method
**Since:** 1.5

- setSchema

```java
public void setSchema​(
Schema
schema)
```

Set the

Schema

to be used by parsers created
from this factory.

When a

Schema

is non-null, a parser will use a validator
created from it to validate documents before it passes information
down to the application.

When warnings/errors/fatal errors are found by the validator, the parser must
handle them as if those errors were found by the parser itself.
In other words, if the user-specified

ErrorHandler

is set, it must receive those errors, and if not, they must be
treated according to the implementation specific
default error handling rules.

A validator may modify the SAX event stream (for example by
adding default values that were missing in documents), and a parser
is responsible to make sure that the application will receive
those modified event stream.

Initially,

null

is set as the

Schema

.

This processing will take effect even if
the

isValidating()

method returns

false

.

It is an error to use
the

http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaSource

property and/or the

http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaLanguage

property in conjunction with a non-null

Schema

object.
Such configuration will cause a

SAXException

exception when those properties are set on a

SAXParser

.

Note for implementors

A parser must be able to work with any

Schema

implementation. However, parsers and schemas are allowed
to use implementation-specific custom mechanisms
as long as they yield the result described in the specification.

**Parameters:** schema

-

Schema

to use,

null

to remove a schema.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method
**Since:** 1.5

- setXIncludeAware

```java
public void setXIncludeAware​(boolean state)
```

Set state of XInclude processing.

If XInclude markup is found in the document instance, should it be
processed as specified in

XML Inclusions (XInclude) Version 1.0

.

XInclude processing defaults to

false

.

**Parameters:** state

- Set XInclude processing to

true

or

false
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method
**Since:** 1.5

- isXIncludeAware

```java
public boolean isXIncludeAware()
```

**Returns:** current state of XInclude processing
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not

#### getFeature

public abstract boolean getFeature​(

String

name)
throws

ParserConfigurationException

,

SAXNotRecognizedException

,

SAXNotSupportedException

Returns the particular property requested for in the underlying
implementation of org.xml.sax.XMLReader.

getSchema

```java
public
Schema
getSchema()
```

Gets the

Schema

object specified through
the

setSchema(Schema schema)

method.

**Returns:** the

Schema

object that was last set through
the

setSchema(Schema)

method, or null
if the method was not invoked since a

SAXParserFactory

is created.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method
**Since:** 1.5

#### getSchema

public

Schema

getSchema()

Gets the

Schema

object specified through
the

setSchema(Schema schema)

method.

setSchema

```java
public void setSchema​(
Schema
schema)
```

Set the

Schema

to be used by parsers created
from this factory.

When a

Schema

is non-null, a parser will use a validator
created from it to validate documents before it passes information
down to the application.

When warnings/errors/fatal errors are found by the validator, the parser must
handle them as if those errors were found by the parser itself.
In other words, if the user-specified

ErrorHandler

is set, it must receive those errors, and if not, they must be
treated according to the implementation specific
default error handling rules.

A validator may modify the SAX event stream (for example by
adding default values that were missing in documents), and a parser
is responsible to make sure that the application will receive
those modified event stream.

Initially,

null

is set as the

Schema

.

This processing will take effect even if
the

isValidating()

method returns

false

.

It is an error to use
the

http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaSource

property and/or the

http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaLanguage

property in conjunction with a non-null

Schema

object.
Such configuration will cause a

SAXException

exception when those properties are set on a

SAXParser

.

Note for implementors

A parser must be able to work with any

Schema

implementation. However, parsers and schemas are allowed
to use implementation-specific custom mechanisms
as long as they yield the result described in the specification.

**Parameters:** schema

-

Schema

to use,

null

to remove a schema.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- When implementation does not
override this method
**Since:** 1.5
