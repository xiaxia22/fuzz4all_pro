# Class BufferedImage

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\BufferedImage.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
BufferedImage

extends
Image

implements
WritableRenderedImage
,
Transparency
```

The

BufferedImage

subclass describes an

Image

with an accessible buffer of image data.
A

BufferedImage

is comprised of a

ColorModel

and a

Raster

of image data.
The number and types of bands in the

SampleModel

of the

Raster

must match the number and types required by the

ColorModel

to represent its color and alpha components.
All

BufferedImage

objects have an upper left corner
coordinate of (0, 0). Any

Raster

used to construct a

BufferedImage

must therefore have minX=0 and minY=0.

This class relies on the data fetching and setting methods
of

Raster

,
and on the color characterization methods of

ColorModel

.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** RenderedImage

,

WritableRenderedImage

,

Transparency

### Field Details

#### public static final int TYPE_CUSTOM

Image type is not recognized so it must be a customized
image. This type is only used as a return value for the getType()
method.

---

#### public static final int TYPE_INT_RGB

Represents an image with 8-bit RGB color components packed into
integer pixels. The image has a

DirectColorModel

#### public static final int TYPE_BYTE_BINARY

Represents an opaque byte-packed 1, 2, or 4 bit image. The
image has an

IndexColorModel

without alpha. When this
type is used as the

imageType

argument to the

BufferedImage

constructor that takes an

imageType

argument but no

ColorModel

argument, a 1-bit image is created with an

IndexColorModel

with two colors in the default
sRGB

ColorSpace

: {0, 0, 0} and
{255, 255, 255}.

Images with 2 or 4 bits per pixel may be constructed via
the

BufferedImage

constructor that takes a

ColorModel

argument by supplying a

ColorModel

with an appropriate map size.

Images with 8 bits per pixel should use the image types

TYPE_BYTE_INDEXED

or

TYPE_BYTE_GRAY

depending on their

ColorModel

.

When color data is stored in an image of this type,
the closest color in the colormap is determined
by the

IndexColorModel

and the resulting index is stored.
Approximation and loss of alpha or color components
can result, depending on the colors in the

IndexColorModel

colormap.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

BufferedImage

constructor that takes an

imageType

argument
but no

ColorModel

argument, an

IndexColorModel

is created with
a 256-color 6/6/6 color cube palette with the rest of the colors
from 216-255 populated by grayscale values in the
default sRGB ColorSpace.

When color data is stored in an image of this type,
the closest color in the colormap is determined
by the

IndexColorModel

and the resulting index is stored.
Approximation and loss of alpha or color components
can result, depending on the colors in the

IndexColorModel

colormap.

Constructs a

BufferedImage

of one of the predefined
image types:

image should have 1, 2, or 4 bits per pixel. If the color model
has 1 or 2 entries, the image will have 1 bit per pixel. If it
has 3 or 4 entries, the image with have 2 bits per pixel. If
it has between 5 and 16 entries, the image will have 4 bits per
pixel. Otherwise, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.

**Parameters:**

- width of the created image
- height

- height of the created image
- imageType

- type of the created image
- cm

-

#### public
ColorModel
getColorModel()

Returns the

ColorModel

.

**Specified by:**
- getColorModel

in interface

ColorModel

of this

BufferedImage

.

---

#### public
WritableRaster
getRaster()

Returns the

WritableRaster

.

**Returns:**
- the

WritableRaster

of this

BufferedImage

.

---

#### public
WritableRaster
getAlphaRaster()

Returns a

WritableRaster

representing the alpha
channel for

BufferedImage

objects
with

ColorModel

objects that support a separate
spatial alpha channel, such as

ComponentColorModel

and

DirectColorModel

. Returns

null

if there
is no alpha channel associated with the

ColorModel

in
this image. This method assumes that for all

ColorModel

objects other than

IndexColorModel

, if the

ColorModel

supports alpha, there is a separate alpha channel
which is stored as the last band of image data.
If the image uses an

IndexColorModel

that
has alpha in the lookup table, this method returns

null

since there is no spatially discrete alpha
channel. This method creates a new

WritableRaster

, but shares the data array.

**Returns:**
- a

WritableRaster

or

null

if this

BufferedImage

has no alpha channel associated
with its

ColorModel

.

this method.

An

ArrayOutOfBoundsException

outRaster

is

null

,
an appropriate

WritableRaster

is created.

**Specified by:**

- a

WritableRaster

to hold the returned
part of the image, or

null

**Returns:**
- a reference to the supplied or created

WritableRaster

.

---

#### public void setData​(
Raster
r)

Sets a rectangular region of the image to the contents of the
specified

Raster r

, which is
assumed to be in the same coordinate space as the

BufferedImage

. The operation is clipped to the bounds
of the

BufferedImage

.

**Specified by:**

in interface

WritableRenderedImage

**Parameters:**
- to

- the specified

TileObserver

---

#### public void removeTileObserver​(
TileObserver
to)

Removes a tile observer. If the observer was not registered,
nothing happens. If the observer was registered for multiple
notifications, it is now registered for one fewer notification.

**Specified by:**
- removeTileObserver

in interface

WritableRenderedImage

**Parameters:**
- to

- the specified

TileObserver

.

---

#### public boolean isTileWritable​(int tileX,

Relinquishes permission to write to a tile. If the caller
continues to write to the tile, the results are undefined.
Calls to this method should only appear in matching pairs
with calls to

getWritableTile(int, int)

to undefined results. All registered

TileObservers

are notified when a tile goes from having one writer to having no
writers.

has 1 or 2 entries, the image will have 1 bit per pixel. If it
has 3 or 4 entries, the image with have 2 bits per pixel. If
it has between 5 and 16 entries, the image will have 4 bits per
pixel. Otherwise, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.

```

Returns a

When color data is stored in an image of this type,
the closest color in the colormap is determined
by the

IndexColorModel

colormap.

Images with 2 or 4 bits per pixel may be constructed via
the

constructor that takes a

ColorModel

argument by supplying a

```

Returns the

ColorModel

.

**Specified by:** getColorModel

in interface

of this

BufferedImage

.

- getRaster

```java

of this

BufferedImage

.

- getAlphaRaster

```java
public

getAlphaRaster()
```

Returns a

WritableRaster

representing the alpha

ColorModel

objects that support a separate
spatial alpha channel, such as

which is stored as the last band of image data.
If the image uses an

null

since there is no spatially discrete alpha
channel. This method creates a new

with its

ColorModel

.

- getRGB
