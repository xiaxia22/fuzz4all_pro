# Class StreamTokenizer

**Source:** `java.base\java\io\StreamTokenizer.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
StreamTokenizer

extends
Object
```

The

StreamTokenizer

class takes an input stream and
parses it into "tokens", allowing the tokens to be
read one at a time. The parsing process is controlled by a table
and a number of flags that can be set to various states. The
stream tokenizer can recognize identifiers, numbers, quoted
strings, and various comment styles.

Each byte read from the input stream is regarded as a character
in the range

'\u0000'

through

'\u00FF'

.
The character value is used to look up five possible attributes of
the character:

white space

,

alphabetic

,

numeric

,

string quote

, and

comment character

.
Each character can have zero or more of these attributes.

In addition, an instance has four flags. These flags indicate:

- Whether line terminators are to be returned as tokens or treated
as white space that merely separates tokens.

Whether C-style comments are to be recognized and skipped.

Whether C++-style comments are to be recognized and skipped.

Whether the characters of identifiers are converted to lowercase.

A typical application first constructs an instance of this class,
sets up the syntax tables, and then repeatedly loops calling the

nextToken

method in each iteration of the loop until
it returns the value

TT_EOF

.

**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** nextToken()

,

TT_EOF

---

### Field Details

#### public int ttype

After a call to the

nextToken

method, this field
contains the type of the token just read. For a single character
token, its value is the single character, converted to an integer.
For a quoted string token, its value is the quote character.
Otherwise, its value is one of the following:

- TT_WORD

indicates that the token is a word.

TT_NUMBER

indicates that the token is a number.

TT_EOL

indicates that the end of line has been read.
The field can only have this value if the

eolIsSignificant

method has been called with the
argument

true

.

TT_EOF

indicates that the end of the input stream
has been reached.

The initial value of this field is -4.

### Constructor Details

#### @Deprecated

public StreamTokenizer​(
InputStream
is)

Creates a stream tokenizer that parses the specified input
stream. The stream tokenizer is initialized to the following
default state:

- All byte values

'A'

through

'Z'

,

'a'

through

'z'

, and

'\u00A0'

through

'\u00FF'

are
considered to be alphabetic.

All byte values

'\u0000'

through

'\u0020'

are considered to be white space.

'/'

is a comment character.

Single quote

'\''

and double quote

'"'

are string quote characters.

Numbers are parsed.

Ends of lines are treated as white space, not as separate tokens.

C-style and C++-style comments are not recognized.

**Parameters:**
- is

- an input stream.

**See Also:**
- BufferedReader

,

InputStreamReader

,

StreamTokenizer(java.io.Reader)

---

#### public StreamTokenizer​(
Reader
r)

Create a tokenizer that parses the given character stream.

**Parameters:**
- r

- a Reader object providing the input stream.

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

### Method Details

#### public void resetSyntax()

Resets this tokenizer's syntax table so that all characters are
"ordinary." See the

ordinaryChar

method
for more information on a character being ordinary.

**See Also:**
- ordinaryChar(int)

---

#### public void wordChars​(int low,
int hi)

Specifies that all characters

c

in the range

low <=

c

<= high

are word constituents. A word token consists of a word constituent
followed by zero or more word constituents or number constituents.

**Parameters:**
- low

- the low end of the range.
- hi

- the high end of the range.

---

#### public void whitespaceChars​(int low,
int hi)

Specifies that all characters

c

in the range

low <=

c

<= high

are white space characters. White space characters serve only to
separate tokens in the input stream.

Any other attribute settings for the characters in the specified
range are cleared.

**Parameters:**
- low

- the low end of the range.
- hi

- the high end of the range.

---

#### public void ordinaryChars​(int low,
int hi)

Specifies that all characters

c

in the range

low <=

c

<= high

are "ordinary" in this tokenizer. See the

ordinaryChar

method for more information on a
character being ordinary.

**Parameters:**
- low

- the low end of the range.
- hi

- the high end of the range.

**See Also:**
- ordinaryChar(int)

---

#### public void ordinaryChar​(int ch)

Specifies that the character argument is "ordinary"
in this tokenizer. It removes any special significance the
character has as a comment character, word component, string
delimiter, white space, or number character. When such a character
is encountered by the parser, the parser treats it as a
single-character token and sets

ttype

field to the
character value.

Making a line terminator character "ordinary" may interfere
with the ability of a

StreamTokenizer

to count
lines. The

lineno

method may no longer reflect
the presence of such terminator characters in its line count.

**Parameters:**
- ch

- the character.

**See Also:**
- ttype

---

#### public void commentChar​(int ch)

Specified that the character argument starts a single-line
comment. All characters from the comment character to the end of
the line are ignored by this stream tokenizer.

Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared.

**Parameters:**
- ch

- the character.

---

#### public void quoteChar​(int ch)

Specifies that matching pairs of this character delimit string
constants in this tokenizer.

When the

nextToken

method encounters a string
constant, the

ttype

field is set to the string
delimiter and the

sval

field is set to the body of
the string.

If a string quote character is encountered, then a string is
recognized, consisting of all characters after (but not including)
the string quote character, up to (but not including) the next
occurrence of that same string quote character, or a line
terminator, or end of file. The usual escape sequences such as

"\n"

and

"\t"

are recognized and
converted to single characters as the string is parsed.

Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared.

**Parameters:**
- ch

- the character.

**See Also:**
- nextToken()

,

sval

,

ttype

---

#### public void parseNumbers()

Specifies that numbers should be parsed by this tokenizer. The
syntax table of this tokenizer is modified so that each of the twelve
characters:

```java
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . -
```

has the "numeric" attribute.

When the parser encounters a word token that has the format of a
double precision floating-point number, it treats the token as a
number rather than a word, by setting the

ttype

field to the value

TT_NUMBER

and putting the numeric
value of the token into the

nval

field.

**See Also:**
- nval

,

TT_NUMBER

,

ttype

---

#### public void eolIsSignificant​(boolean flag)

Determines whether or not ends of line are treated as tokens.
If the flag argument is true, this tokenizer treats end of lines
as tokens; the

nextToken

method returns

TT_EOL

and also sets the

ttype

field to
this value when an end of line is read.

A line is a sequence of characters ending with either a
carriage-return character (

'\r'

) or a newline
character (

'\n'

). In addition, a carriage-return
character followed immediately by a newline character is treated
as a single end-of-line token.

If the

flag

is false, end-of-line characters are
treated as white space and serve only to separate tokens.

**Parameters:**
- flag

-

true

indicates that end-of-line characters
are separate tokens;

false

indicates that
end-of-line characters are white space.

**See Also:**
- nextToken()

,

ttype

,

TT_EOL

---

#### public void slashStarComments​(boolean flag)

Determines whether or not the tokenizer recognizes C-style comments.
If the flag argument is

true

, this stream tokenizer
recognizes C-style comments. All text between successive
occurrences of

/*

and

*/

are discarded.

If the flag argument is

false

, then C-style comments
are not treated specially.

**Parameters:**
- flag

-

true

indicates to recognize and ignore
C-style comments.

---

#### public void slashSlashComments​(boolean flag)

Determines whether or not the tokenizer recognizes C++-style comments.
If the flag argument is

true

, this stream tokenizer
recognizes C++-style comments. Any occurrence of two consecutive
slash characters (

'/'

) is treated as the beginning of
a comment that extends to the end of the line.

If the flag argument is

false

, then C++-style
comments are not treated specially.

**Parameters:**
- flag

-

true

indicates to recognize and ignore
C++-style comments.

---

#### public void lowerCaseMode​(boolean fl)

Determines whether or not word token are automatically lowercased.
If the flag argument is

true

, then the value in the

sval

field is lowercased whenever a word token is
returned (the

ttype

field has the
value

TT_WORD

by the

nextToken

method
of this tokenizer.

If the flag argument is

false

, then the

sval

field is not modified.

**Parameters:**
- fl

-

true

indicates that all word tokens should
be lowercased.

**See Also:**
- nextToken()

,

ttype

,

TT_WORD

---

#### public int nextToken()
throws
IOException

Parses the next token from the input stream of this tokenizer.
The type of the next token is returned in the

ttype

field. Additional information about the token may be in the

nval

field or the

sval

field of this
tokenizer.

Typical clients of this
class first set up the syntax tables and then sit in a loop
calling nextToken to parse successive tokens until TT_EOF
is returned.

**Returns:**
- the value of the

ttype

field.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

**See Also:**
- nval

,

sval

,

ttype

---

#### public void pushBack()

Causes the next call to the

nextToken

method of this
tokenizer to return the current value in the

ttype

field, and not to modify the value in the

nval

or

sval

field.

**See Also:**
- nextToken()

,

nval

,

sval

,

ttype

---

#### public int lineno()

Return the current line number.

**Returns:**
- the current line number of this stream tokenizer.

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns the string representation of the current stream token and
the line number it occurs on.

The precise string returned is unspecified, although the following
example can be considered typical:

```java
Token['a'], line 10
```

**Overrides:**

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- StreamTokenizer

```java
@Deprecated

public StreamTokenizer​(
InputStream
is)
```

Deprecated.

As of JDK version 1.1, the preferred way to tokenize an
input stream is to convert it into a character stream, for example:

```java
Reader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));
StreamTokenizer st = new StreamTokenizer(r);
```

Creates a stream tokenizer that parses the specified input
stream. The stream tokenizer is initialized to the following
default state:

- All byte values

'A'

through

'Z'

,

'a'

through

'z'

, and

'\u00A0'

through

'\u00FF'

are
considered to be alphabetic.

All byte values

'\u0000'

through

'\u0020'

are considered to be white space.

'/'

is a comment character.

Single quote

'\''

and double quote

'"'

are string quote characters.

Numbers are parsed.

Ends of lines are treated as white space, not as separate tokens.

C-style and C++-style comments are not recognized.

**Parameters:** is

- an input stream.
**See Also:** BufferedReader

,

InputStreamReader

,

StreamTokenizer(java.io.Reader)

- StreamTokenizer

```java
public StreamTokenizer​(
Reader
r)
```

Create a tokenizer that parses the given character stream.

**Parameters:** r

- a Reader object providing the input stream.
**Since:** 1.1

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- resetSyntax

```java
public void resetSyntax()
```

Resets this tokenizer's syntax table so that all characters are
"ordinary." See the

ordinaryChar

method
for more information on a character being ordinary.

**See Also:** ordinaryChar(int)

- wordChars

```java
public void wordChars​(int low,
int hi)
```

Specifies that all characters

c

in the range

low <=

c

<= high

are word constituents. A word token consists of a word constituent
followed by zero or more word constituents or number constituents.

**Parameters:** low

- the low end of the range.
**Parameters:** hi

- the high end of the range.

- whitespaceChars

```java
public void whitespaceChars​(int low,
int hi)
```

Specifies that all characters

c

in the range

low <=

c

<= high

are white space characters. White space characters serve only to
separate tokens in the input stream.

Any other attribute settings for the characters in the specified
range are cleared.

**Parameters:** low

- the low end of the range.
**Parameters:** hi

- the high end of the range.

- ordinaryChars

```java
public void ordinaryChars​(int low,
int hi)
```

Specifies that all characters

c

in the range

low <=

c

<= high

are "ordinary" in this tokenizer. See the

ordinaryChar

method for more information on a
character being ordinary.

**Parameters:** low

- the low end of the range.
**Parameters:** hi

- the high end of the range.
**See Also:** ordinaryChar(int)

- ordinaryChar

```java
public void ordinaryChar​(int ch)
```

Specifies that the character argument is "ordinary"
in this tokenizer. It removes any special significance the
character has as a comment character, word component, string
delimiter, white space, or number character. When such a character
is encountered by the parser, the parser treats it as a
single-character token and sets

ttype

field to the
character value.

Making a line terminator character "ordinary" may interfere
with the ability of a

StreamTokenizer

to count
lines. The

lineno

method may no longer reflect
the presence of such terminator characters in its line count.

**Parameters:** ch

- the character.
**See Also:** ttype

- commentChar

```java
public void commentChar​(int ch)
```

Specified that the character argument starts a single-line
comment. All characters from the comment character to the end of
the line are ignored by this stream tokenizer.

Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared.

**Parameters:** ch

- the character.

- quoteChar

```java
public void quoteChar​(int ch)
```

Specifies that matching pairs of this character delimit string
constants in this tokenizer.

When the

nextToken

method encounters a string
constant, the

ttype

field is set to the string
delimiter and the

sval

field is set to the body of
the string.

If a string quote character is encountered, then a string is
recognized, consisting of all characters after (but not including)
the string quote character, up to (but not including) the next
occurrence of that same string quote character, or a line
terminator, or end of file. The usual escape sequences such as

"\n"

and

"\t"

are recognized and
converted to single characters as the string is parsed.

Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared.

**Parameters:** ch

- the character.
**See Also:** nextToken()

,

sval

,

ttype

- parseNumbers

```java
public void parseNumbers()
```

Specifies that numbers should be parsed by this tokenizer. The
syntax table of this tokenizer is modified so that each of the twelve
characters:

```java
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . -
```

has the "numeric" attribute.

When the parser encounters a word token that has the format of a
double precision floating-point number, it treats the token as a
number rather than a word, by setting the

ttype

field to the value

TT_NUMBER

and putting the numeric
value of the token into the

nval

field.

**See Also:** nval

,

TT_NUMBER

,

ttype

- eolIsSignificant

```java
public void eolIsSignificant​(boolean flag)
```

Determines whether or not ends of line are treated as tokens.
If the flag argument is true, this tokenizer treats end of lines
as tokens; the

nextToken

method returns

TT_EOL

and also sets the

ttype

field to
this value when an end of line is read.

A line is a sequence of characters ending with either a
carriage-return character (

'\r'

) or a newline
character (

'\n'

). In addition, a carriage-return
character followed immediately by a newline character is treated
as a single end-of-line token.

If the

flag

is false, end-of-line characters are
treated as white space and serve only to separate tokens.

**Parameters:** flag

-

true

indicates that end-of-line characters
are separate tokens;

false

indicates that
end-of-line characters are white space.
**See Also:** nextToken()

,

,

TT_EOL

- slashStarComments

```java
public void slashStarComments​(boolean flag)
```

Determines whether or not the tokenizer recognizes C-style comments.
If the flag argument is

true

, this stream tokenizer
recognizes C-style comments. All text between successive
occurrences of

/*

and

*/

are discarded.

If the flag argument is

false

, then C-style comments
are not treated specially.

**Parameters:** flag

-

true

indicates to recognize and ignore
C-style comments.

- slashSlashComments

```java
public void slashSlashComments​(boolean flag)
```

Determines whether or not the tokenizer recognizes C++-style comments.
If the flag argument is

true

, this stream tokenizer
recognizes C++-style comments. Any occurrence of two consecutive
slash characters (

'/'

) is treated as the beginning of
a comment that extends to the end of the line.

If the flag argument is

false

, then C++-style
comments are not treated specially.

**Parameters:** flag

-

true

indicates to recognize and ignore
C++-style comments.

- lowerCaseMode

```java
public void lowerCaseMode​(boolean fl)
```

Determines whether or not word token are automatically lowercased.
If the flag argument is

true

, then the value in the

sval

field is lowercased whenever a word token is
returned (the

ttype

field has the
value

TT_WORD

by the

nextToken

method
of this tokenizer.

If the flag argument is

false

, then the

sval

field is not modified.

**Parameters:** fl

When the parser encounters a word token that has the format of a
double precision floating-point number, it treats the token as a
number rather than a word, by setting the

ttype

field to the value

TT_NUMBER

and putting the numeric
value of the token into the

nval

field.

for more information on a character being ordinary.

wordChars

```java
public void wordChars​(int low,
int hi)
```

Specifies that all characters

c

in the range

low <=

c

<= high

are word constituents. A word token consists of a word constituent
followed by zero or more word constituents or number constituents.

**Parameters:** low

- the low end of the range.
**Parameters:** hi

- the high end of the range.

---

#### wordChars

public void wordChars​(int low,
int hi)

followed by zero or more word constituents or number constituents.

whitespaceChars

```java
public void whitespaceChars​(int low,
int hi)
```

Specifies that all characters

c

in the range

low <=

c

<= high

are white space characters. White space characters serve only to
separate tokens in the input stream.

Any other attribute settings for the characters in the specified
range are cleared.

ordinaryChar

```java
public void ordinaryChar​(int ch)
```

Specifies that the character argument is "ordinary"
in this tokenizer. It removes any special significance the
character has as a comment character, word component, string
delimiter, white space, or number character. When such a character
is encountered by the parser, the parser treats it as a
single-character token and sets

ttype

field to the
character value.

Making a line terminator character "ordinary" may interfere
with the ability of a

StreamTokenizer

to count
lines. The

lineno

method may no longer reflect
the presence of such terminator characters in its line count.

nextToken

method encounters a string
constant, the

ttype

field is set to the string
delimiter and the

sval

field is set to the body of
the string.

If a string quote character is encountered, then a string is
recognized, consisting of all characters after (but not including)
the string quote character, up to (but not including) the next
occurrence of that same string quote character, or a line
terminator, or end of file. The usual escape sequences such as

"\n"

and

"\t"

are recognized and
converted to single characters as the string is parsed.

Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared.

syntax table of this tokenizer is modified so that each of the twelve
characters:

```java
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . -
```

has the "numeric" attribute.

When the parser encounters a word token that has the format of a
double precision floating-point number, it treats the token as a
number rather than a word, by setting the

ttype

field to the value

TT_NUMBER

and putting the numeric
value of the token into the

nval

field.
