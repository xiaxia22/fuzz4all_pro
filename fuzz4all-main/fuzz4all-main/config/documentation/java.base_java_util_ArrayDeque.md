# Class ArrayDeque<E>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\ArrayDeque.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ArrayDeque<E>

extends
AbstractCollection
<E>
implements
Deque
<E>,
Cloneable
,
Serializable
```

Resizable-array implementation of the

Deque

interface. Array
deques have no capacity restrictions; they grow as necessary to support
usage. They are not thread-safe; in the absence of external
synchronization, they do not support concurrent access by multiple threads.
Null elements are prohibited. This class is likely to be faster than

Stack

when used as a stack, and faster than

LinkedList

when used as a queue.

Most

ArrayDeque

operations run in amortized constant time.
Exceptions include

remove

,

removeFirstOccurrence

,

removeLastOccurrence

,

contains

,

iterator.remove()

,
and the bulk operations, all of which run in linear time.

The iterators returned by this class's

iterator

method are

fail-fast

: If the deque is modified at any time after
the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own

remove

method, the iterator will generally throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of concurrent
modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
future.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.

This class and its iterator implement all of the

optional

methods of the

Collection

and

Iterator

interfaces.

This class is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

#### public
Object
[] toArray()

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque
in proper sequence (from first to last element).

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this deque. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this deque

---

#### public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque in
proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of the
returned array is that of the specified array. If the deque fits in
the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array
is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the
size of this deque.

If this deque fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this deque), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a deque known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the deque into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- a

- the array into which the elements of the deque are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this deque

**Throws:**
- ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this deque
- NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection

---

#### public
ArrayDeque
<
E
> clone()

Returns a copy of this deque.

**Overrides:**
- clone

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a copy of this deque

**See Also:**
- Cloneable

Description copied from interface:

Iterable

Performs the given action for each element of the

Iterable

until all elements have been processed or the action throws an
exception. Actions are performed in the order of iteration, if that
order is specified. Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the
caller.

- retainAll

```java
public boolean retainAll​(

- toArray

```java

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque
in proper sequence (from first to last element).

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this deque. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque in
proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of the
returned array is that of the specified array. If the deque fits in
the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array
is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the
size of this deque.

If this deque fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this deque), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a deque known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the deque into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

toArray

```java

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque in

the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to
