# Class CheckboxGroup

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\CheckboxGroup.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
CheckboxGroup

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

The

CheckboxGroup

class is used to group together
a set of

Checkbox

buttons.

Exactly one check box button in a

CheckboxGroup

can
be in the "on" state at any given time. Pushing any
button sets its state to "on" and forces any other button that
is in the "on" state into the "off" state.

The following code example produces a new check box group,
with three check boxes:

```java
setLayout(new GridLayout(3, 1));
CheckboxGroup cbg = new CheckboxGroup();
add(new Checkbox("one", cbg, true));
add(new Checkbox("two", cbg, false));
add(new Checkbox("three", cbg, false));
```
