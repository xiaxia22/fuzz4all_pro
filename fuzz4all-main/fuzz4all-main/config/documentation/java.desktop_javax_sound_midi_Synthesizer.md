# Interface Synthesizer

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\sound\midi\Synthesizer.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Synthesizer

extends
MidiDevice
```

A

Synthesizer

generates sound. This usually happens when one of the

Synthesizer

's

MidiChannel

objects receives a

noteOn

message, either directly or via
the

Synthesizer

object. Many

Synthesizer

s support

Receivers

, through which MIDI events can be delivered to the

Synthesizer

. In such cases, the

Synthesizer

typically
responds by sending a corresponding message to the appropriate

MidiChannel

, or by processing the event itself if the event isn't one
of the MIDI channel messages.

The

Synthesizer

interface includes methods for loading and unloading
instruments from soundbanks. An instrument is a specification for
synthesizing a certain type of sound, whether that sound emulates a
traditional instrument or is some kind of sound effect or other imaginary
sound. A soundbank is a collection of instruments, organized by bank and
program number (via the instrument's

Patch

object). Different

Synthesizer

classes might implement different sound-synthesis
techniques, meaning that some instruments and not others might be compatible
with a given synthesizer. Also, synthesizers may have a limited amount of
memory for instruments, meaning that not every soundbank and instrument can
be used by every synthesizer, even if the synthesis technique is compatible.
To see whether the instruments from a certain soundbank can be played by a
given synthesizer, invoke the

isSoundbankSupported

method of

Synthesizer

.

"Loading" an instrument means that that instrument becomes available for
synthesizing notes. The instrument is loaded into the bank and program
location specified by its

Patch

object. Loading does not necessarily
mean that subsequently played notes will immediately have the sound of this
newly loaded instrument. For the instrument to play notes, one of the
synthesizer's

MidiChannel

objects must receive (or have received) a
program-change message that causes that particular instrument's bank and
program number to be selected.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### int getMaxPolyphony()

Obtains the maximum number of notes that this synthesizer can sound
simultaneously.

**Returns:**
- the maximum number of simultaneous notes

**See Also:**
- getVoiceStatus()

---

#### long getLatency()

Obtains the processing latency incurred by this synthesizer, expressed in
microseconds. This latency measures the worst-case delay between the time
a MIDI message is delivered to the synthesizer and the time that the
synthesizer actually produces the corresponding result.

Although the latency is expressed in microseconds, a synthesizer's actual
measured delay may vary over a wider range than this resolution suggests.
For example, a synthesizer might have a worst-case delay of a few
milliseconds or more.

**Returns:**
- the worst-case delay, in microseconds

---

#### MidiChannel
[] getChannels()

Obtains the set of MIDI channels controlled by this synthesizer. Each
non-null element in the returned array is a

MidiChannel

that
receives the MIDI messages sent on that channel number.

The MIDI 1.0 specification provides for 16 channels, so this method
returns an array of at least 16 elements. However, if this synthesizer
doesn't make use of all 16 channels, some of the elements of the array
might be

null

, so you should check each element before using it.

**Returns:**
- an array of the

MidiChannel

objects managed by this

Synthesizer

. Some of the array elements may be

null

.

---

#### VoiceStatus
[] getVoiceStatus()

Obtains the current status of the voices produced by this synthesizer. If
this class of

Synthesizer

does not provide voice information, the
returned array will always be of length 0. Otherwise, its length is
always equal to the total number of voices, as returned by

getMaxPolyphony()

. (See the

VoiceStatus

class description
for an explanation of synthesizer voices.)

**Returns:**
- an array of

VoiceStatus

objects that supply information
about the corresponding synthesizer voices

**See Also:**
- getMaxPolyphony()

,

VoiceStatus

---

#### boolean isSoundbankSupported​(
Soundbank
soundbank)

Informs the caller whether this synthesizer is capable of loading
instruments from the specified soundbank. If the soundbank is
unsupported, any attempts to load instruments from it will result in an

IllegalArgumentException

.

**Parameters:**
- soundbank

- soundbank for which support is queried

**Returns:**
- true

if the soundbank is supported, otherwise

false

**See Also:**
- loadInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank, javax.sound.midi.Patch[])

,

loadAllInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank)

,

unloadInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank, javax.sound.midi.Patch[])

,

unloadAllInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank)

,

getDefaultSoundbank()

---

#### boolean loadInstrument​(
Instrument
instrument)

Makes a particular instrument available for synthesis. This instrument is
loaded into the patch location specified by its

Patch

object, so
that if a program-change message is received (or has been received) that
causes that patch to be selected, subsequent notes will be played using
the sound of

instrument

. If the specified instrument is already
loaded, this method does nothing and returns

true

.

The instrument must be part of a soundbank that this

Synthesizer

supports. (To make sure, you can use the

getSoundbank

method of

Instrument

and the

isSoundbankSupported

method of

Synthesizer

.)

**Parameters:**
- instrument

- instrument to load

**Returns:**
- true

if the instrument is successfully loaded (or already
had been),

false

if the instrument could not be loaded
(for example, if the synthesizer has insufficient memory to load
it)

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if this

Synthesizer

doesn't
support the specified instrument's soundbank

**See Also:**
- unloadInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

,

loadInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank, javax.sound.midi.Patch[])

,

,

SoundbankResource.getSoundbank()

,

MidiChannel.programChange(int, int)

---

#### void unloadInstrument​(
Instrument
instrument)

Unloads a particular instrument.

**Parameters:**
- instrument

- instrument to unload

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if this

Synthesizer

doesn't
support the specified instrument's soundbank

**See Also:**
- loadInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

,

unloadInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank, javax.sound.midi.Patch[])

,

unloadAllInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank)

,

getLoadedInstruments()

,

remapInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument, javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

---

#### boolean remapInstrument​(
Instrument
from,

Instrument
to)

Remaps an instrument. Instrument

to

takes the place of instrument

from

.

For example, if

from

was located at bank number 2, program number
11, remapping causes that bank and program location to be occupied
instead by

to

.

If the function succeeds, instrument

from

is unloaded.

To cancel the remapping reload instrument

from

by invoking one of

loadInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

,

loadInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank, javax.sound.midi.Patch[])

or

loadAllInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank)

.

**Parameters:**
- from

- the

Instrument

object to be replaced
- to

- the

Instrument

object to be used in place of the old
instrument, it should be loaded into the synthesizer

**Returns:**
- true

if the instrument successfully remapped,

false

if feature is not implemented by synthesizer

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if instrument

from

or instrument

to

aren't supported by synthesizer or if instrument

to

is not loaded
- NullPointerException

- if

from

or

to

parameters
have null value

- loadInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

,

loadInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank, javax.sound.midi.Patch[])

,

loadAllInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank)

---

#### Soundbank
getDefaultSoundbank()

Obtains the default soundbank for the synthesizer, if one exists. (Some
synthesizers provide a default or built-in soundbank.) If a synthesizer
doesn't have a default soundbank, instruments must be loaded explicitly
from an external soundbank.

**Returns:**
- default soundbank, or

null

if one does not exist

**See Also:**
- isSoundbankSupported(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank)

---

#### Instrument
[] getAvailableInstruments()

Obtains a list of instruments that come with the synthesizer. These
instruments might be built into the synthesizer, or they might be part of
a default soundbank provided with the synthesizer, etc.

Note that you don't use this method to find out which instruments are
currently loaded onto the synthesizer; for that purpose, you use

getLoadedInstruments()

. Nor does the method indicate all the
instruments that can be loaded onto the synthesizer; it only indicates
the subset that come with the synthesizer. To learn whether another
instrument can be loaded, you can invoke

isSoundbankSupported()

,
and if the instrument's

Soundbank

is supported, you can try
loading the instrument.

**Returns:**
- list of available instruments. If the synthesizer has no
instruments coming with it, an array of length 0 is returned.

**See Also:**
- getLoadedInstruments()

,

isSoundbankSupported(Soundbank)

,

loadInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

#### Instrument
[] getLoadedInstruments()

Obtains a list of the instruments that are currently loaded onto this

Synthesizer

.

**Returns:**
- a list of currently loaded instruments

**See Also:**
- loadInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

,

Synthesizer

all instruments contained in the
specified

Soundbank

.

**Parameters:**
- soundbank

- the

Soundbank

whose are instruments are to be
loaded

**Returns:**
- true

if the instruments are all successfully loaded (or
already had been),

false

if any instrument could not be
loaded (for example, if the

Synthesizer

had insufficient
memory)

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

#### Methods declared in interface javax.sound.midi. MidiDevice

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getMaxPolyphony

```java
int getMaxPolyphony()
```

Obtains the maximum number of notes that this synthesizer can sound
simultaneously.

**Returns:** the maximum number of simultaneous notes
**See Also:** getVoiceStatus()

- getLatency

```java
long getLatency()
```

Obtains the processing latency incurred by this synthesizer, expressed in
microseconds. This latency measures the worst-case delay between the time
a MIDI message is delivered to the synthesizer and the time that the
synthesizer actually produces the corresponding result.

Although the latency is expressed in microseconds, a synthesizer's actual
measured delay may vary over a wider range than this resolution suggests.
For example, a synthesizer might have a worst-case delay of a few
milliseconds or more.

**Returns:** the worst-case delay, in microseconds

- getChannels

```java
MidiChannel
[] getChannels()
```

Obtains the set of MIDI channels controlled by this synthesizer. Each
non-null element in the returned array is a

MidiChannel

that
receives the MIDI messages sent on that channel number.

The MIDI 1.0 specification provides for 16 channels, so this method
returns an array of at least 16 elements. However, if this synthesizer
doesn't make use of all 16 channels, some of the elements of the array
might be

null

, so you should check each element before using it.

**Returns:** an array of the

MidiChannel

objects managed by this

Synthesizer

. Some of the array elements may be

null

.

- getVoiceStatus

```java
VoiceStatus
[] getVoiceStatus()
```

Obtains the current status of the voices produced by this synthesizer. If
this class of

Synthesizer

does not provide voice information, the
returned array will always be of length 0. Otherwise, its length is
always equal to the total number of voices, as returned by

getMaxPolyphony()

. (See the

VoiceStatus

class description
for an explanation of synthesizer voices.)

**Returns:** an array of

VoiceStatus

objects that supply information
about the corresponding synthesizer voices
**See Also:** getMaxPolyphony()

,

VoiceStatus

- isSoundbankSupported

```java
boolean isSoundbankSupported​(
Soundbank
soundbank)
```

Informs the caller whether this synthesizer is capable of loading
instruments from the specified soundbank. If the soundbank is
unsupported, any attempts to load instruments from it will result in an

IllegalArgumentException

.

**Parameters:** soundbank

- soundbank for which support is queried
**Returns:** true

if the soundbank is supported, otherwise

false
**See Also:** loadInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank, javax.sound.midi.Patch[])

getDefaultSoundbank()

- loadInstrument

```java
boolean loadInstrument​(

instrument)
```

Makes a particular instrument available for synthesis. This instrument is
loaded into the patch location specified by its

Patch

object, so
that if a program-change message is received (or has been received) that
causes that patch to be selected, subsequent notes will be played using
the sound of

instrument

. If the specified instrument is already
loaded, this method does nothing and returns

true

.

The instrument must be part of a soundbank that this

Synthesizer

supports. (To make sure, you can use the

getSoundbank

method of

Instrument

and the

isSoundbankSupported

method of

Synthesizer

.)

**Parameters:** instrument

- instrument to load
**Returns:** true

if the instrument is successfully loaded (or already
had been),

remapInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument, javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

- remapInstrument

```java
boolean remapInstrument​(
Instrument
from,

Instrument
to)
```

Remaps an instrument. Instrument

to

takes the place of instrument

from

.

For example, if

from

was located at bank number 2, program number
11, remapping causes that bank and program location to be occupied
instead by

to

.

If the function succeeds, instrument

from

is unloaded.

To cancel the remapping reload instrument

from

by invoking one of

loadInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

,

loadInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank, javax.sound.midi.Patch[])

or

loadAllInstruments(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank)

.

**Parameters:** from

- the

Instrument

object to be replaced
**Parameters:** to

**See Also:** isSoundbankSupported(javax.sound.midi.Soundbank)

- getAvailableInstruments

```java
Instrument
[] getAvailableInstruments()
```

Obtains a list of instruments that come with the synthesizer. These
instruments might be built into the synthesizer, or they might be part of
a default soundbank provided with the synthesizer, etc.

Note that you don't use this method to find out which instruments are
currently loaded onto the synthesizer; for that purpose, you use

. Nor does the method indicate all the
instruments that can be loaded onto the synthesizer; it only indicates
the subset that come with the synthesizer. To learn whether another
instrument can be loaded, you can invoke

Method Detail

- getMaxPolyphony

```java
int getMaxPolyphony()
```

Obtains the maximum number of notes that this synthesizer can sound
simultaneously.

**Returns:** the maximum number of simultaneous notes
**See Also:** getVoiceStatus()

- getLatency

```java
long getLatency()
```

Obtains the processing latency incurred by this synthesizer, expressed in
microseconds. This latency measures the worst-case delay between the time
a MIDI message is delivered to the synthesizer and the time that the
synthesizer actually produces the corresponding result.

Although the latency is expressed in microseconds, a synthesizer's actual
measured delay may vary over a wider range than this resolution suggests.
For example, a synthesizer might have a worst-case delay of a few
milliseconds or more.

**Returns:** the worst-case delay, in microseconds

- getChannels

```java
MidiChannel
[] getChannels()
```

Obtains the set of MIDI channels controlled by this synthesizer. Each
non-null element in the returned array is a

MidiChannel

that
receives the MIDI messages sent on that channel number.

The MIDI 1.0 specification provides for 16 channels, so this method
returns an array of at least 16 elements. However, if this synthesizer
doesn't make use of all 16 channels, some of the elements of the array
might be

null

, so you should check each element before using it.

**Returns:** an array of the

MidiChannel

objects managed by this

Synthesizer

. Some of the array elements may be

null

.

- getVoiceStatus

```java
VoiceStatus
[] getVoiceStatus()
```

Obtains the current status of the voices produced by this synthesizer. If
this class of

Synthesizer

does not provide voice information, the
returned array will always be of length 0. Otherwise, its length is
always equal to the total number of voices, as returned by

getMaxPolyphony()

. (See the

VoiceStatus

class description
for an explanation of synthesizer voices.)

**Returns:** an array of

VoiceStatus

objects that supply information
about the corresponding synthesizer voices
**See Also:** getMaxPolyphony()

,

VoiceStatus

- isSoundbankSupported

```java
boolean isSoundbankSupported​(
Soundbank
soundbank)
```

Informs the caller whether this synthesizer is capable of loading
instruments from the specified soundbank. If the soundbank is
unsupported, any attempts to load instruments from it will result in an

IllegalArgumentException

.

**Parameters:** soundbank

- soundbank for which support is queried
**Returns:** true

if the soundbank is supported, otherwise

false

getDefaultSoundbank()

- loadInstrument

```java
boolean loadInstrument​(
Instrument
instrument)
```

Makes a particular instrument available for synthesis. This instrument is
loaded into the patch location specified by its

Patch

object, so
that if a program-change message is received (or has been received) that
causes that patch to be selected, subsequent notes will be played using
the sound of

instrument

. If the specified instrument is already
loaded, this method does nothing and returns

true

.

The instrument must be part of a soundbank that this

Synthesizer

supports. (To make sure, you can use the

getSoundbank

method of

Instrument

and the

isSoundbankSupported

method of

Synthesizer

.)

**Parameters:** instrument

- instrument to load
**Returns:** true

if the instrument is successfully loaded (or already
had been),

false

if the instrument could not be loaded
(for example, if the synthesizer has insufficient memory to load
it)

instrument can be loaded, you can invoke

isSoundbankSupported()

,
and if the instrument's

Soundbank

is supported, you can try
loading the instrument.

**Returns:** list of available instruments. If the synthesizer has no
instruments coming with it, an array of length 0 is returned.

#### getAvailableInstruments

Instrument

[] getAvailableInstruments()

Obtains a list of instruments that come with the synthesizer. These
instruments might be built into the synthesizer, or they might be part of
a default soundbank provided with the synthesizer, etc.

Note that you don't use this method to find out which instruments are
currently loaded onto the synthesizer; for that purpose, you use

getLoadedInstruments()

. Nor does the method indicate all the
instruments that can be loaded onto the synthesizer; it only indicates
the subset that come with the synthesizer. To learn whether another
instrument can be loaded, you can invoke

isSoundbankSupported()

and if the instrument's

Soundbank

is supported, you can try
loading the instrument.
