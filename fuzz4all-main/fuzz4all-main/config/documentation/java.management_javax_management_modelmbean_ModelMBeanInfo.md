# Interface ModelMBeanInfo

**Source:** `java.management\javax\management\modelmbean\ModelMBeanInfo.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ModelMBeanInfo
```

This interface is implemented by the ModelMBeanInfo for every ModelMBean. An implementation of this interface
must be shipped with every JMX Agent.

Java resources wishing to be manageable instantiate the ModelMBean using the MBeanServer's
createMBean method. The resource then sets the ModelMBeanInfo and Descriptors for the ModelMBean
instance. The attributes, operations, and notifications exposed via the ModelMBeanInfo for the
ModelMBean comprise the management interface and are accessible
from MBeans, connectors/adaptors like other MBeans. Through the Descriptors, values and methods in
the managed application can be defined and mapped to attributes and operations of the ModelMBean.
This mapping can be defined during development in a file or dynamically and
programmatically at runtime.

Every ModelMBean which is instantiated in the MBeanServer becomes manageable:
its attributes, operations, and notifications
become remotely accessible through the connectors/adaptors connected to that MBeanServer.
A Java object cannot be registered in the MBeanServer unless it is a JMX compliant MBean.
By instantiating a ModelMBean, resources are guaranteed that the MBean is valid.

MBeanException and RuntimeOperationsException must be thrown on every public method. This allows
for wrapping exceptions from distributed communications (RMI, EJB, etc.)

If the descriptor does not contain all these fields, they will be added with these default values.

Note:

because of inconsistencies in previous versions of
this specification, it is recommended not to use negative or zero
values for

In addition to any notification specified by the application,
a ModelMBean may always send also two additional notifications:

- One with descriptor name "GENERIC" and displayName "jmx.modelmbean.generic"

Second is a standard attribute change notification
with descriptor name "ATTRIBUTE_CHANGE" and displayName "jmx.attribute.change"

Thus any implementation of ModelMBeanInfo should always add those two notifications
in addition to those specified by the application.

One with descriptor name "GENERIC" and displayName "jmx.modelmbean.generic"

Second is a standard attribute change notification
with descriptor name "ATTRIBUTE_CHANGE" and displayName "jmx.attribute.change"
