# Class ZoneRulesProvider

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\zone\ZoneRulesProvider.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
ZoneRulesProvider

extends
Object
```

Provider of time-zone rules to the system.

This class manages the configuration of time-zone rules.
The static methods provide the public API that can be used to manage the providers.
The abstract methods provide the SPI that allows rules to be provided.

ZoneRulesProvider may be installed in an instance of the Java Platform as
extension classes, that is, jar files placed into any of the usual extension
directories. Installed providers are loaded using the service-provider loading
facility defined by the

ServiceLoader

class. A ZoneRulesProvider
identifies itself with a provider configuration file named

java.time.zone.ZoneRulesProvider

in the resource directory

META-INF/services

. The file should contain a line that specifies the
fully qualified concrete zonerules-provider class name.
Providers may also be made available by adding them to the class path or by
registering themselves via

registerProvider(java.time.zone.ZoneRulesProvider)

method.

The Java virtual machine has a default provider that provides zone rules
for the time-zones defined by IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB). If the system
property

java.time.zone.DefaultZoneRulesProvider

is defined then
it is taken to be the fully-qualified name of a concrete ZoneRulesProvider
class to be loaded as the default provider, using the system class loader.
If this system property is not defined, a system-default provider will be
loaded to serve as the default provider.

Rules are looked up primarily by zone ID, as used by

ZoneId

.
Only zone region IDs may be used, zone offset IDs are not used here.

Time-zone rules are political, thus the data can change at any time.
Each provider will provide the latest rules for each zone ID, but they
may also provide the history of how the rules changed.

**Implementation Requirements:** This interface is a service provider that can be called by multiple threads.
Implementations must be immutable and thread-safe.

Providers must ensure that once a rule has been seen by the application, the
rule must continue to be available.

Providers are encouraged to implement a meaningful

toString

method.

Many systems would like to update time-zone rules dynamically without stopping the JVM.
When examined in detail, this is a complex problem.
Providers may choose to handle dynamic updates, however the default provider does not.
**Since:** 1.8

### Constructor Details

#### protected ZoneRulesProvider()

Constructor.

---

### Method Details

#### public static
Set
<
String
> getAvailableZoneIds()

Gets the set of available zone IDs.

These IDs are the string form of a

ZoneId

.

**Returns:**
- the unmodifiable set of zone IDs, not null

---

#### public static
ZoneRules
getRules​(
String
zoneId,
boolean forCaching)

Gets the rules for the zone ID.

This returns the latest available rules for the zone ID.

This method relies on time-zone data provider files that are configured.
These are loaded using a

ServiceLoader

.

The caching flag is designed to allow provider implementations to
prevent the rules being cached in

ZoneId

.
Under normal circumstances, the caching of zone rules is highly desirable
as it will provide greater performance. However, there is a use case where
the caching would not be desirable, see

provideRules(java.lang.String, boolean)

.

**Parameters:**
- zoneId

- the zone ID as defined by

ZoneId

, not null
- forCaching

- whether the rules are being queried for caching,
true if the returned rules will be cached by

ZoneId

,
false if they will be returned to the user without being cached in

ZoneId

**Returns:**
- the rules, null if

forCaching

is true and this
is a dynamic provider that wants to prevent caching in

ZoneId

,
otherwise not null

**Throws:**
- ZoneRulesException

- if rules cannot be obtained for the zone ID

---

#### public static
NavigableMap
<
String
,​
ZoneRules
> getVersions​(
String
zoneId)

Gets the history of rules for the zone ID.

Time-zones are defined by governments and change frequently.
This method allows applications to find the history of changes to the
rules for a single zone ID. The map is keyed by a string, which is the
version string associated with the rules.

The exact meaning and format of the version is provider specific.
The version must follow lexicographical order, thus the returned map will
be order from the oldest known rules to the newest available rules.
The default 'TZDB' group uses version numbering consisting of the year
followed by a letter, such as '2009e' or '2012f'.

Implementations must provide a result for each valid zone ID, however
they do not have to provide a history of rules.
Thus the map will always contain one element, and will only contain more
than one element if historical rule information is available.

**Parameters:**
- zoneId

- the zone ID as defined by

ZoneId

, not null

**Returns:**
- a modifiable copy of the history of the rules for the ID, sorted
from oldest to newest, not null

**Throws:**
- ZoneRulesException

- if history cannot be obtained for the zone ID

---

#### public static void registerProvider​(
ZoneRulesProvider
provider)

Registers a zone rules provider.

This adds a new provider to those currently available.
A provider supplies rules for one or more zone IDs.
A provider cannot be registered if it supplies a zone ID that has already been
registered. See the notes on time-zone IDs in

ZoneId

, especially
the section on using the concept of a "group" to make IDs unique.

To ensure the integrity of time-zones already created, there is no way
to deregister providers.

**Parameters:**
- provider

- the provider to register, not null

**Throws:**
- ZoneRulesException

- if a zone ID is already registered

---

#### public static boolean refresh()

Refreshes the rules from the underlying data provider.

This method allows an application to request that the providers check
for any updates to the provided rules.
After calling this method, the offset stored in any

ZonedDateTime

may be invalid for the zone ID.

Dynamic update of rules is a complex problem and most applications
should not use this method or dynamic rules.
To achieve dynamic rules, a provider implementation will have to be written
as per the specification of this class.
In addition, instances of

ZoneRules

must not be cached in the
application as they will become stale. However, the boolean flag on

provideRules(String, boolean)

allows provider implementations
to control the caching of

ZoneId

, potentially ensuring that
all objects in the system see the new rules.
Note that there is likely to be a cost in performance of a dynamic rules
provider. Note also that no dynamic rules provider is in this specification.

**Returns:**
- true if the rules were updated

**Throws:**
- ZoneRulesException

- if an error occurs during the refresh

---

#### protected abstract
Set
<
String
> provideZoneIds()

SPI method to get the available zone IDs.

This obtains the IDs that this

ZoneRulesProvider

provides.
A provider should provide data for at least one zone ID.

The returned zone IDs remain available and valid for the lifetime of the application.
A dynamic provider may increase the set of IDs as more data becomes available.

**Returns:**
- the set of zone IDs being provided, not null

**Throws:**
- ZoneRulesException

- if a problem occurs while providing the IDs

---

#### protected abstract
ZoneRules
provideRules​(
String
zoneId,
boolean forCaching)

SPI method to get the rules for the zone ID.

This loads the rules for the specified zone ID.
The provider implementation must validate that the zone ID is valid and
available, throwing a

ZoneRulesException

if it is not.
The result of the method in the valid case depends on the caching flag.

If the provider implementation is not dynamic, then the result of the
method must be the non-null set of rules selected by the ID.

If the provider implementation is dynamic, then the flag gives the option
of preventing the returned rules from being cached in

ZoneId

.
When the flag is true, the provider is permitted to return null, where
null will prevent the rules from being cached in

ZoneId

.
When the flag is false, the provider must return non-null rules.

**Parameters:**
- zoneId

- the zone ID as defined by

ZoneId

, not null
- forCaching

- whether the rules are being queried for caching,
true if the returned rules will be cached by

ZoneId

,
false if they will be returned to the user without being cached in

ZoneId

**Returns:**
- the rules, null if

forCaching

is true and this
is a dynamic provider that wants to prevent caching in

ZoneId

,
otherwise not null

**Throws:**
- ZoneRulesException

- if rules cannot be obtained for the zone ID

---

#### protected abstract
NavigableMap
<
String
,​
ZoneRules
> provideVersions​(
String
zoneId)

SPI method to get the history of rules for the zone ID.

This returns a map of historical rules keyed by a version string.
The exact meaning and format of the version is provider specific.
The version must follow lexicographical order, thus the returned map will
be order from the oldest known rules to the newest available rules.
The default 'TZDB' group uses version numbering consisting of the year
followed by a letter, such as '2009e' or '2012f'.

Implementations must provide a result for each valid zone ID, however
they do not have to provide a history of rules.
Thus the map will contain at least one element, and will only contain
more than one element if historical rule information is available.

The returned versions remain available and valid for the lifetime of the application.
A dynamic provider may increase the set of versions as more data becomes available.

**Parameters:**
- zoneId

- the zone ID as defined by

ZoneId

, not null

**Returns:**
- a modifiable copy of the history of the rules for the ID, sorted
from oldest to newest, not null

**Throws:**
- ZoneRulesException

- if history cannot be obtained for the zone ID

---

#### protected boolean provideRefresh()

SPI method to refresh the rules from the underlying data provider.

This method provides the opportunity for a provider to dynamically
recheck the underlying data provider to find the latest rules.
This could be used to load new rules without stopping the JVM.
Dynamic behavior is entirely optional and most providers do not support it.

This implementation returns false.

**Returns:**
- true if the rules were updated

**Throws:**
- ZoneRulesException

- if an error occurs during the refresh

This returns a map of historical rules keyed by a version string.
The exact meaning and format of the version is provider specific.
The version must follow lexicographical order, thus the returned map will
be order from the oldest known rules to the newest available rules.
The default 'TZDB' group uses version numbering consisting of the year
followed by a letter, such as '2009e' or '2012f'.

Implementations must provide a result for each valid zone ID, however
they do not have to provide a history of rules.
Thus the map will contain at least one element, and will only contain
more than one element if historical rule information is available.

The returned versions remain available and valid for the lifetime of the application.
A dynamic provider may increase the set of versions as more data becomes available.

**Parameters:** zoneId

- the zone ID as defined by

ZoneId

, not null
**Returns:** a modifiable copy of the history of the rules for the ID, sorted
from oldest to newest, not null
**Throws:** ZoneRulesException

- if history cannot be obtained for the zone ID

- provideRefresh

```java
protected boolean provideRefresh()
```

SPI method to refresh the rules from the underlying data provider.

This method provides the opportunity for a provider to dynamically
recheck the underlying data provider to find the latest rules.
This could be used to load new rules without stopping the JVM.
Dynamic behavior is entirely optional and most providers do not support it.

This implementation returns false.

**Returns:** true if the rules were updated
**Throws:** ZoneRulesException

- if an error occurs during the refresh

Method Detail

- getAvailableZoneIds

```java
public static
Set
<
String
> getAvailableZoneIds()
```

Gets the set of available zone IDs.

These IDs are the string form of a

ZoneId

.

**Returns:** the unmodifiable set of zone IDs, not null

- getRules

```java
public static
ZoneRules
getRules​(
String
zoneId,
boolean forCaching)
```

Gets the rules for the zone ID.

This returns the latest available rules for the zone ID.

This method relies on time-zone data provider files that are configured.
These are loaded using a

ServiceLoader

.

The caching flag is designed to allow provider implementations to
prevent the rules being cached in

ZoneId

.
Under normal circumstances, the caching of zone rules is highly desirable
as it will provide greater performance. However, there is a use case where
the caching would not be desirable, see

provideRules(java.lang.String, boolean)

.

**Parameters:** zoneId

- the zone ID as defined by

ZoneId

, not null
**Parameters:** forCaching

- whether the rules are being queried for caching,
true if the returned rules will be cached by

ZoneId

,
false if they will be returned to the user without being cached in

ZoneId
**Returns:** the rules, null if

forCaching

is true and this
is a dynamic provider that wants to prevent caching in

ZoneId

,
otherwise not null
**Throws:** ZoneRulesException

- if rules cannot be obtained for the zone ID

- getVersions

```java
public static
NavigableMap
<
String
,​
ZoneRules
> getVersions​(
String
zoneId)
```

Gets the history of rules for the zone ID.

Time-zones are defined by governments and change frequently.
This method allows applications to find the history of changes to the
rules for a single zone ID. The map is keyed by a string, which is the
version string associated with the rules.

The exact meaning and format of the version is provider specific.
The version must follow lexicographical order, thus the returned map will
be order from the oldest known rules to the newest available rules.
The default 'TZDB' group uses version numbering consisting of the year
followed by a letter, such as '2009e' or '2012f'.

Implementations must provide a result for each valid zone ID, however
they do not have to provide a history of rules.
Thus the map will always contain one element, and will only contain more
than one element if historical rule information is available.

**Parameters:** zoneId

- the zone ID as defined by

ZoneId

, not null
**Returns:** a modifiable copy of the history of the rules for the ID, sorted
from oldest to newest, not null
**Throws:** ZoneRulesException

- if history cannot be obtained for the zone ID

- registerProvider

```java
public static void registerProvider​(
ZoneRulesProvider
provider)
```

Registers a zone rules provider.

This adds a new provider to those currently available.
A provider supplies rules for one or more zone IDs.
A provider cannot be registered if it supplies a zone ID that has already been
registered. See the notes on time-zone IDs in

ZoneId

, especially
the section on using the concept of a "group" to make IDs unique.

To ensure the integrity of time-zones already created, there is no way
to deregister providers.

**Parameters:** provider

- the provider to register, not null
**Throws:** ZoneRulesException

- if a zone ID is already registered

- refresh

```java
public static boolean refresh()
```

Refreshes the rules from the underlying data provider.

This method allows an application to request that the providers check
for any updates to the provided rules.
After calling this method, the offset stored in any

ZonedDateTime

may be invalid for the zone ID.

Dynamic update of rules is a complex problem and most applications
should not use this method or dynamic rules.
To achieve dynamic rules, a provider implementation will have to be written
as per the specification of this class.
In addition, instances of

ZoneRules

must not be cached in the
application as they will become stale. However, the boolean flag on

provideRules(String, boolean)

allows provider implementations
to control the caching of

ZoneId

, potentially ensuring that
all objects in the system see the new rules.
Note that there is likely to be a cost in performance of a dynamic rules
provider. Note also that no dynamic rules provider is in this specification.

**Returns:** true if the rules were updated
**Throws:** ZoneRulesException

- if an error occurs during the refresh

- provideZoneIds

```java
protected abstract
Set
<
String
> provideZoneIds()
```

SPI method to get the available zone IDs.

This obtains the IDs that this

ZoneRulesProvider

provides.
A provider should provide data for at least one zone ID.

The returned zone IDs remain available and valid for the lifetime of the application.
A dynamic provider may increase the set of IDs as more data becomes available.

**Returns:** the set of zone IDs being provided, not null
**Throws:** ZoneRulesException

- if a problem occurs while providing the IDs

- provideRules

```java
protected abstract
ZoneRules
provideRules​(
String
zoneId,
boolean forCaching)
```

SPI method to get the rules for the zone ID.

This loads the rules for the specified zone ID.
The provider implementation must validate that the zone ID is valid and
available, throwing a

ZoneRulesException

if it is not.
The result of the method in the valid case depends on the caching flag.

If the provider implementation is not dynamic, then the result of the
method must be the non-null set of rules selected by the ID.

If the provider implementation is dynamic, then the flag gives the option
of preventing the returned rules from being cached in

ZoneId

.
When the flag is true, the provider is permitted to return null, where
null will prevent the rules from being cached in

ZoneId

.
When the flag is false, the provider must return non-null rules.

**Parameters:** zoneId

- the zone ID as defined by

ZoneId

, not null
**Parameters:** forCaching

- whether the rules are being queried for caching,
true if the returned rules will be cached by

ZoneId

,
false if they will be returned to the user without being cached in

ZoneId
**Returns:** the rules, null if

forCaching

is true and this
is a dynamic provider that wants to prevent caching in

ZoneId

,
otherwise not null
**Throws:** ZoneRulesException

- if rules cannot be obtained for the zone ID
