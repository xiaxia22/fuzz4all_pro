# Class CompositeName

**Source:** `java.naming\javax\naming\CompositeName.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
CompositeName

extends
Object

implements
Name
```

This class represents a composite name -- a sequence of
component names spanning multiple namespaces.
Each component is a string name from the namespace of a
naming system. If the component comes from a hierarchical
namespace, that component can be further parsed into
its atomic parts by using the CompoundName class.

The components of a composite name are numbered. The indexes of a
composite name with N components range from 0 up to, but not including, N.
This range may be written as [0,N).
The most significant component is at index 0.
An empty composite name has no components.

JNDI Composite Name Syntax

JNDI defines a standard string representation for composite names. This
representation is the concatenation of the components of a composite name
from left to right using the component separator (a forward
slash character (/)) to separate each component.
The JNDI syntax defines the following meta characters:

- escape (backward slash \),

quote characters (single (') and double quotes (")), and

component separator (forward slash character (/)).

Any occurrence of a leading quote, an escape preceding any meta character,
an escape at the end of a component, or a component separator character
in an unquoted component must be preceded by an escape character when
that component is being composed into a composite name string.
Alternatively, to avoid adding escape characters as described,
the entire component can be quoted using matching single quotes
or matching double quotes. A single quote occurring within a double-quoted
component is not considered a meta character (and need not be escaped),
and vice versa.

When two composite names are compared, the case of the characters
is significant.

A leading component separator (the composite name string begins with
a separator) denotes a leading empty component (a component consisting
of an empty string).
A trailing component separator (the composite name string ends with
a separator) denotes a trailing empty component.
Adjacent component separators denote an empty component.

Composite Name Examples

This table shows examples of some composite names. Each row shows
the string form of a composite name and its corresponding structural form
(

CompositeName

).

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected CompositeName​(
Enumeration
<
String
> comps)

Constructs a new composite name instance using the components
specified by 'comps'. This protected method is intended
to be used by subclasses of CompositeName when they override
methods such as clone(), getPrefix(), getSuffix().

**Parameters:**
- comps

- A non-null enumeration containing the components for the new
composite name. Each element is of class String.
The enumeration will be consumed to extract its
elements.

---

#### public CompositeName​(
String
n)
throws
InvalidNameException

Constructs a new composite name instance by parsing the string n
using the composite name syntax (left-to-right, slash separated).
The composite name syntax is described in detail in the class
description.

**Parameters:**
- n

- The non-null string to parse.

**Throws:**
- InvalidNameException

- If n has invalid composite name syntax.

---

#### public CompositeName()

Constructs a new empty composite name. Such a name returns true
when

isEmpty()

is invoked on it.

---

### Method Details

#### public
String
toString()

Generates the string representation of this composite name.
The string representation consists of enumerating in order
each component of the composite name and separating
each component by a forward slash character. Quoting and
escape characters are applied where necessary according to
the JNDI syntax, which is described in the class description.
An empty component is represented by an empty string.

The string representation thus generated can be passed to
the CompositeName constructor to create a new equivalent
composite name.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- A non-null string representation of this composite name.

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Determines whether two composite names are equal.
If obj is null or not a composite name, false is returned.
Two composite names are equal if each component in one is equal
to the corresponding component in the other. This implies
both have the same number of components, and each component's
equals() test against the corresponding component in the other name
returns true.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- The possibly null object to compare against.

**Returns:**
- true if obj is equal to this composite name, false otherwise.

**See Also:**
- hashCode()

---

#### public int hashCode()

Computes the hash code of this composite name.
The hash code is the sum of the hash codes of individual components
of this composite name.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- An int representing the hash code of this name.

**See Also:**
- equals(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public int compareTo​(
Object
obj)

Compares this CompositeName with the specified Object for order.
Returns a
negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this Name is less
than, equal to, or greater than the given Object.

If obj is null or not an instance of CompositeName, ClassCastException
is thrown.

See equals() for what it means for two composite names to be equal.
If two composite names are equal, 0 is returned.

Ordering of composite names follows the lexicographical rules for
string comparison, with the extension that this applies to all
the components in the composite name. The effect is as if all the
components were lined up in their specified ordered and the
lexicographical rules applied over the two line-ups.
If this composite name is "lexicographically" lesser than obj,
a negative number is returned.
If this composite name is "lexicographically" greater than obj,
a positive number is returned.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- CompositeName

```java
protected CompositeName​(
Enumeration
<
String
> comps)
```

Constructs a new composite name instance using the components
specified by 'comps'. This protected method is intended
to be used by subclasses of CompositeName when they override
methods such as clone(), getPrefix(), getSuffix().

**Parameters:** comps

- A non-null enumeration containing the components for the new
composite name. Each element is of class String.
The enumeration will be consumed to extract its
elements.

- CompositeName

```java
public CompositeName​(
String
n)
throws
InvalidNameException
```

Constructs a new composite name instance by parsing the string n
using the composite name syntax (left-to-right, slash separated).
The composite name syntax is described in detail in the class
description.

**Parameters:** n

- The non-null string to parse.
**Throws:** InvalidNameException

- If n has invalid composite name syntax.

- CompositeName

```java
public CompositeName()
```

Constructs a new empty composite name. Such a name returns true
when

isEmpty()

is invoked on it.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Generates the string representation of this composite name.
The string representation consists of enumerating in order
each component of the composite name and separating
each component by a forward slash character. Quoting and
escape characters are applied where necessary according to
the JNDI syntax, which is described in the class description.
An empty component is represented by an empty string.

The string representation thus generated can be passed to
the CompositeName constructor to create a new equivalent
composite name.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** A non-null string representation of this composite name.

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Determines whether two composite names are equal.
If obj is null or not a composite name, false is returned.
Two composite names are equal if each component in one is equal
to the corresponding component in the other. This implies
both have the same number of components, and each component's
equals() test against the corresponding component in the other name
returns true.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- The possibly null object to compare against.
**Returns:** true if obj is equal to this composite name, false otherwise.
**See Also:** hashCode()

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Computes the hash code of this composite name.
The hash code is the sum of the hash codes of individual components
of this composite name.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** An int representing the hash code of this name.
**See Also:** equals(java.lang.Object)

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
Object
obj)
```

Compares this CompositeName with the specified Object for order.
Returns a
negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this Name is less
than, equal to, or greater than the given Object.

If obj is null or not an instance of CompositeName, ClassCastException
is thrown.

See equals() for what it means for two composite names to be equal.
If two composite names are equal, 0 is returned.

Ordering of composite names follows the lexicographical rules for
string comparison, with the extension that this applies to all
the components in the composite name. The effect is as if all the
components were lined up in their specified ordered and the
lexicographical rules applied over the two line-ups.
If this composite name is "lexicographically" lesser than obj,
a negative number is returned.
If this composite name is "lexicographically" greater than obj,
a positive number is returned.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

Object

>
**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Name
**Parameters:** obj

- The non-null object to compare against.
**Returns:** a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this Name
is less than, equal to, or greater than the given Object.
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if obj is not a CompositeName.
**See Also:** Comparable.compareTo(Object)

#### Method Detail

toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Generates the string representation of this composite name.
The string representation consists of enumerating in order
each component of the composite name and separating
each component by a forward slash character. Quoting and
escape characters are applied where necessary according to
the JNDI syntax, which is described in the class description.
An empty component is represented by an empty string.

The string representation thus generated can be passed to
the CompositeName constructor to create a new equivalent
composite name.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** A non-null string representation of this composite name.

equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Determines whether two composite names are equal.
If obj is null or not a composite name, false is returned.
Two composite names are equal if each component in one is equal
to the corresponding component in the other. This implies
both have the same number of components, and each component's
equals() test against the corresponding component in the other name
returns true.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- The possibly null object to compare against.
**Returns:** true if obj is equal to this composite name, false otherwise.
**See Also:** hashCode()

---

#### equals

public boolean equals​(

Object

obj)

Determines whether two composite names are equal.
If obj is null or not a composite name, false is returned.
Two composite names are equal if each component in one is equal
to the corresponding component in the other. This implies
both have the same number of components, and each component's
equals() test against the corresponding component in the other name
returns true.

hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Computes the hash code of this composite name.
The hash code is the sum of the hash codes of individual components
of this composite name.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** An int representing the hash code of this name.
**See Also:** equals(java.lang.Object)

---

#### hashCode

public int hashCode()

Computes the hash code of this composite name.

of this composite name.

compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
Object
obj)
```

Compares this CompositeName with the specified Object for order.
Returns a
negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this Name is less
than, equal to, or greater than the given Object.

If obj is null or not an instance of CompositeName, ClassCastException
is thrown.

See equals() for what it means for two composite names to be equal.
If two composite names are equal, 0 is returned.

Ordering of composite names follows the lexicographical rules for
string comparison, with the extension that this applies to all
the components in the composite name. The effect is as if all the
components were lined up in their specified ordered and the
lexicographical rules applied over the two line-ups.
If this composite name is "lexicographically" lesser than obj,
a negative number is returned.
If this composite name is "lexicographically" greater than obj,
a positive number is returned.
