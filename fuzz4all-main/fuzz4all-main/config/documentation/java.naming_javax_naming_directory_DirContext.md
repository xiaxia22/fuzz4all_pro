# Interface DirContext

**Source:** `java.naming\javax\naming\directory\DirContext.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
DirContext

extends
Context
```

The directory service interface, containing
methods for examining and updating attributes
associated with objects, and for searching the directory.

Names

Each name passed as an argument to a

DirContext

method is relative
to that context. The empty name is used to name the context itself.
The name parameter may never be null.

Most of the methods have overloaded versions with one taking a

Name

parameter and one taking a

String

.
These overloaded versions are equivalent in that if
the

Name

and

String

parameters are just
different representations of the same name, then the overloaded
versions of the same methods behave the same.
In the method descriptions below, only one version is documented.
The second version instead has a link to the first: the same
documentation applies to both.

See

Context

for a discussion on the interpretation of the
name argument to the

Context

methods. These same rules
apply to the name argument to the

DirContext

methods.

Attribute Models

There are two basic models of what attributes should be
associated with. First, attributes may be directly associated with a
DirContext object.
In this model, an attribute operation on the named object is
roughly equivalent
to a lookup on the name (which returns the DirContext object),
followed by the attribute operation invoked on the DirContext object
in which the caller supplies an empty name. The attributes can be viewed
as being stored along with the object (note that this does not imply that
the implementation must do so).

The second model is that attributes are associated with a
name (typically an atomic name) in a DirContext.
In this model, an attribute operation on the named object is
roughly equivalent to a lookup on the name of the parent DirContext of the
named object, followed by the attribute operation invoked on the parent
in which the caller supplies the terminal atomic name.
The attributes can be viewed as being stored in the parent DirContext
(again, this does not imply that the implementation must do so).
Objects that are not DirContexts can have attributes, as long as
their parents are DirContexts.

JNDI support both of these models.
It is up to the individual service providers to decide where to
"store" attributes.
JNDI clients are safest when they do not make assumptions about
whether an object's attributes are stored as part of the object, or stored
within the parent object and associated with the object's name.

Attribute Type Names

In the

getAttributes()

and

search()

methods,
you can supply the attributes to return by supplying a list of
attribute names (strings).
The attributes that you get back might not have the same names as the
attribute names you have specified. This is because some directories
support features that cause them to return other attributes. Such
features include attribute subclassing, attribute name synonyms, and
attribute language codes.

In attribute subclassing, attributes are defined in a class hierarchy.
In some directories, for example, the "name" attribute might be the
superclass of all name-related attributes, including "commonName" and
"surName". Asking for the "name" attribute might return both the
"commonName" and "surName" attributes.

With attribute type synonyms, a directory can assign multiple names to
the same attribute. For example, "cn" and "commonName" might both
refer to the same attribute. Asking for "cn" might return the
"commonName" attribute.

Some directories support the language codes for attributes.
Asking such a directory for the "description" attribute, for example,
might return all of the following attributes:

- description

description;lang-en

description;lang-de

description;lang-fr

Operational Attributes

Some directories have the notion of "operational attributes" which are
attributes associated with a directory object for administrative
purposes. An example of operational attributes is the access control
list for an object.

In the

getAttributes()

and

search()

methods,
you can specify that all attributes associated with the requested objects
be returned by supply

null

as the list of attributes to return.
The attributes returned do

not

include operational attributes.
In order to retrieve operational attributes, you must name them explicitly.

Named Context

There are certain methods in which the name must resolve to a context
(for example, when searching a single level context). The documentation
of such methods
use the term

named context

to describe their name parameter.
For these methods, if the named object is not a DirContext,

NotContextException

is thrown.
Aside from these methods, there is no requirement that the

named object

be a DirContext.

Parameters

An

Attributes

,

SearchControls

, or array object
passed as a parameter to any method will not be modified by the
service provider. The service provider may keep a reference to it
for the duration of the operation, including any enumeration of the
method's results and the processing of any referrals generated.
The caller should not modify the object during this time.
An

Attributes

object returned by any method is owned by
the caller. The caller may subsequently modify it; the service
provider will not.

Exceptions

All the methods in this interface can throw a NamingException or
any of its subclasses. See NamingException and their subclasses
for details on each exception.

### Field Details

#### static final int ADD_ATTRIBUTE

This constant specifies to add an attribute with the specified values.

If attribute does not exist,
create the attribute. The resulting attribute has a union of the
specified value set and the prior value set.
Adding an attribute with no value will throw

InvalidAttributeValueException

if the attribute must have
at least one value. For a single-valued attribute where that attribute
already exists, throws

AttributeInUseException

.
If attempting to add more than one value to a single-valued attribute,
throws

InvalidAttributeValueException

.

The value of this constant is

1

.

**See Also:**
- ModificationItem

,

modifyAttributes(javax.naming.Name, int, javax.naming.directory.Attributes)

,

Constant Field Values

---

#### static final int REPLACE_ATTRIBUTE

This constant specifies to replace an attribute with specified values.

If attribute already exists,
replaces all existing values with new specified values. If the
attribute does not exist, creates it. If no value is specified,
deletes all the values of the attribute.
Removal of the last value will remove the attribute if the attribute
is required to have at least one value. If
attempting to add more than one value to a single-valued attribute,
throws

InvalidAttributeValueException

.

The value of this constant is

2

.

**See Also:**
- ModificationItem

,

modifyAttributes(javax.naming.Name, int, javax.naming.directory.Attributes)

,

Constant Field Values

---

#### static final int REMOVE_ATTRIBUTE

This constant specifies to delete
the specified attribute values from the attribute.

The resulting attribute has the set difference of its prior value set
and the specified value set.
If no values are specified, deletes the entire attribute.
If the attribute does not exist, or if some or all members of the
specified value set do not exist, this absence may be ignored
and the operation succeeds, or a NamingException may be thrown to
indicate the absence.
Removal of the last value will remove the attribute if the
attribute is required to have at least one value.

The value of this constant is

3

throws
NamingException

Binds a name to an object, along with associated attributes,
overwriting any existing binding.
If

attrs

is null and

obj

is a

DirContext

,
the attributes from

obj

are used.
If

attrs

is null and

obj

is not a

DirContext

,
any existing attributes associated with the object already bound
in the directory remain unchanged.
If

attrs

is non-null, any existing attributes associated with
the object already bound in the directory are removed and

attrs

is associated with the named object. If

obj

is a

DirContext

and

attrs

is non-null, the attributes
of

obj

are ignored.

**Parameters:**

#### DirContext
createSubcontext​(
Name
name,

Attributes
attrs)
throws
NamingException

Creates and binds a new context, along with associated attributes.
This method creates a new subcontext with the given name, binds it in
the target context (that named by all but terminal atomic
component of the name), and associates the supplied attributes
with the newly created object.
All intermediate and target contexts must already exist.
If

attrs

is null, this method is equivalent to

Context.createSubcontext()

.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the context to create; may not be empty
- attrs

- the attributes to associate with the newly created context

**Returns:**
- the newly created context

**Throws:**
- NameAlreadyBoundException

- if the name is already bound
- InvalidAttributesException

- if

attrs

does not
contain all the mandatory attributes required for creation
- NamingException

attrs

does not
contain all the mandatory attributes required for creation
- NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

---

#### DirContext
getSchema​(
Name
name)
throws
NamingException

Retrieves the schema associated with the named object.
The schema describes rules regarding the structure of the namespace
and the attributes stored within it. The schema
specifies what types of objects can be added to the directory and where
they can be added; what mandatory and optional attributes an object
can have. The range of support for schemas is directory-specific.

This method returns the root of the schema information tree
that is applicable to the named object. Several named objects
(or even an entire directory) might share the same schema.

Issues such as structure and contents of the schema tree,
permission to modify to the contents of the schema
tree, and the effect of such modifications on the directory
are dependent on the underlying directory.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the object whose schema is to be retrieved

**Returns:**
- the schema associated with the context; never null

**Throws:**
- OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
- NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

---

#### DirContext
getSchema​(
String
name)
throws
NamingException

Retrieves the schema associated with the named object.
See

getSchema(Name)

for details.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the object whose schema is to be retrieved

**Returns:**
- the schema associated with the context; never null

**Throws:**
- OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
- NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

---

#### DirContext
getSchemaClassDefinition​(
Name
name)
throws
NamingException

Retrieves a context containing the schema objects of the
named object's class definitions.

One category of information found in directory schemas is

class definitions

. An "object class" definition
specifies the object's

type

and what attributes (mandatory
and optional) the object must/can have. Note that the term
"object class" being referred to here is in the directory sense
rather than in the Java sense.
For example, if the named object is a directory object of
"Person" class,

getSchemaClassDefinition()

would return a

DirContext

representing the (directory's) object class
definition of "Person".

The information that can be retrieved from an object class definition
is directory-dependent.

Prior to JNDI 1.2, this method
returned a single schema object representing the class definition of
the named object.
Since JNDI 1.2, this method returns a

DirContext

containing
all of the named object's class definitions.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the object whose object class
definition is to be retrieved

**Returns:**
- the

DirContext

containing the named
object's class definitions; never null

**Throws:**
- OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
- NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

---

#### DirContext
getSchemaClassDefinition​(
String
name)
throws
NamingException

Retrieves a context containing the schema objects of the
named object's class definitions.
See

getSchemaClassDefinition(Name)

for details.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the object whose object class
definition is to be retrieved

**Returns:**
- the

DirContext

containing the named
object's class definitions; never null

**Throws:**
- OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
- NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

---

#### NamingEnumeration
<
SearchResult
> search​(
Name
name,

Attributes
matchingAttributes,

String
[] attributesToReturn)
throws
NamingException

Searches in a single context for objects that contain a
specified set of attributes, and retrieves selected attributes.
The search is performed using the default

SearchControls

settings.

For an object to be selected, each attribute in

matchingAttributes

must match some attribute of the
object. If

matchingAttributes

is empty or
null, all objects in the target context are returned.

An attribute

A

1

in

matchingAttributes

is considered to match an
attribute

A

2

of an object if

A

1

and

A

2

have the same
identifier, and each value of

A

1

is equal
to some value of

A

2

. This implies that the
order of values is not significant, and that

A

2

may contain "extra" values not found in

A

1

without affecting the comparison. It
also implies that if

A

1

has no values, then
testing for a match is equivalent to testing for the presence
of an attribute

A

2

with the same
identifier.

The precise definition of "equality" used in comparing attribute values
is defined by the underlying directory service. It might use the

Object.equals

method, for example, or might use a schema
to specify a different equality operation.
For matching based on operations other than equality (such as
substring comparison) use the version of the

search

method that takes a filter argument.

When changes are made to this

DirContext

,
the effect on enumerations returned by prior calls to this method
is undefined.

If the object does not have the attribute
specified, the directory will ignore the nonexistent attribute
and return the requested attributes that the object does have.

A directory might return more attributes than was requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description),
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

See also

Operational Attributes

in the class
description.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the context to search
- matchingAttributes

- the attributes to search for. If empty or null,
all objects in the target context are returned.
- attributesToReturn

- the attributes to return. null indicates that
all attributes are to be returned;
an empty array indicates that none are to be returned.

**Returns:**
- a non-null enumeration of

SearchResult

objects.
Each

SearchResult

contains the attributes
identified by

attributesToReturn

and the name of the corresponding object, named relative
to the context named by

name

.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

See

search(Name, Attributes)

for details.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the context to search
- matchingAttributes

- the attributes to search for

**Returns:**
- an enumeration of

SearchResult

objects

**Throws:**
- NamingException

---

#### NamingEnumeration
<
SearchResult
> search​(
Name
name,

String
filter,

SearchControls
cons)
throws
NamingException

Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
given search filter. Performs the search as specified by
the search controls.

The format and interpretation of

filter

follows RFC 2254
with the
following interpretations for

attr

and

value

mentioned in the RFC.

attr

is the attribute's identifier.

value

is the string representation the attribute's value.
The translation of this string representation into the attribute's value
is directory-specific.

For the assertion "someCount=127", for example,

attr

is "someCount" and

value

is "127".
The provider determines, based on the attribute ID ("someCount")
(and possibly its schema), that the attribute's value is an integer.
It then parses the string "127" appropriately.

Any non-ASCII characters in the filter string should be
represented by the appropriate Java (Unicode) characters, and
not encoded as UTF-8 octets. Alternately, the
"backslash-hexcode" notation described in RFC 2254 may be used.

If the directory does not support a string representation of
some or all of its attributes, the form of

search

that
accepts filter arguments in the form of Objects can be used instead.
The service provider for such a directory would then translate
the filter arguments to its service-specific representation
for filter evaluation.
See

search(Name, String, Object[], SearchControls)

.

RFC 2254 defines certain operators for the filter, including substring
matches, equality, approximate match, greater than, less than. These
operators are mapped to operators with corresponding semantics in the
underlying directory. For example, for the equals operator, suppose
the directory has a matching rule defining "equality" of the
attributes in the filter. This rule would be used for checking
equality of the attributes specified in the filter with the attributes
of objects in the directory. Similarly, if the directory has a
matching rule for ordering, this rule would be used for
making "greater than" and "less than" comparisons.

Not all of the operators defined in RFC 2254 are applicable to all
attributes. When an operator is not applicable, the exception

InvalidSearchFilterException

is thrown.

The result is returned in an enumeration of

SearchResult

s.
Each

SearchResult

contains the name of the object
and other information about the object (see SearchResult).
The name is either relative to the target context of the search
(which is named by the

name

parameter), or
it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
the enumeration (as is possible when

cons

specifies a search scope of

SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE

or

SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE

), its name is the empty
string. The

SearchResult

may also contain attributes of the
matching object if the

cons

argument specified that attributes
be returned.

If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
nonexistent attribute will be ignored. Those requested
attributes that the object does have will be returned.

A directory might return more attributes than were requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description)
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

See also

Operational Attributes

in the class
description.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the context or object to search
- filter

- the filter expression to use for the search; may not be null
- cons

- the search controls that control the search. If null,
the default search controls are used (equivalent
to

(new SearchControls())

).

**Returns:**
- an enumeration of

SearchResult

s of
the objects that satisfy the filter; never null

**Throws:**
- InvalidSearchFilterException

- if the search filter specified is
not supported or understood by the underlying directory
- InvalidSearchControlsException

- if the search controls
contain invalid settings
- NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

search(Name, String, SearchControls)

for details.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the context or object to search
- filter

- the filter expression to use for the search; may not be null
- cons

- the search controls that control the search. If null,
the default search controls are used (equivalent
to

(new SearchControls())

).

**Returns:**
- an enumeration of

SearchResult

s for
the objects that satisfy the filter.

**Throws:**
- InvalidSearchFilterException

- if the search filter specified is
not supported or understood by the underlying directory
- InvalidSearchControlsException

- if the search controls
contain invalid settings
- NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

#### NamingEnumeration
<
SearchResult
> search​(
Name
name,

String
filterExpr,

Object
[] filterArgs,

SearchControls
cons)
throws
NamingException

Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
given search filter. Performs the search as specified by
the search controls.

The interpretation of

filterExpr

is based on RFC
2254. It may additionally contain variables of the form

{i}

-- where

i

is an integer -- that
refer to objects in the

filterArgs

array. The
interpretation of

filterExpr

is otherwise
identical to that of the

filter

parameter of the
method

search(Name, String, SearchControls)

.

When a variable

{i}

appears in a search filter, it
indicates that the filter argument

filterArgs[i]

is to be used in that place. Such variables may be used
wherever an

attr

,

value

, or

matchingrule

production appears in the filter grammar
of RFC 2254, section 4. When a string-valued filter argument
is substituted for a variable, the filter is interpreted as if
the string were given in place of the variable, with any
characters having special significance within filters (such as

'*'

) having been escaped according to the rules of
RFC 2254.

For directories that do not use a string representation for
some or all of their attributes, the filter argument
corresponding to an attribute value may be of a type other than
String. Directories that support unstructured binary-valued
attributes, for example, should accept byte arrays as filter
arguments. The interpretation (if any) of filter arguments of
any other type is determined by the service provider for that
directory, which maps the filter operations onto operations with
corresponding semantics in the underlying directory.

This method returns an enumeration of the results.
Each element in the enumeration contains the name of the object
and other information about the object (see

SearchResult

).
The name is either relative to the target context of the search
(which is named by the

name

parameter), or
it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
the enumeration (as is possible when

cons

specifies a search scope of

SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE

or

SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE

),
its name is the empty string.

The

SearchResult

may also contain attributes of the matching
object if the

cons

argument specifies that attributes be
returned.

If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
nonexistent attribute will be ignored. Those requested
attributes that the object does have will be returned.

A directory might return more attributes than were requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description)
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

If a search filter with invalid variable substitutions is provided
to this method, the result is undefined.
When changes are made to this DirContext,
the effect on enumerations returned by prior calls to this method
is undefined.

See also

Operational Attributes

in the class
description.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the context or object to search
- filterExpr

- the filter expression to use for the search.
The expression may contain variables of the
form "

{i}

" where

i

is a nonnegative integer. May not be null.
- filterArgs

- the array of arguments to substitute for the variables
in

filterExpr

. The value of

filterArgs[i]

will replace each
occurrence of "

{i}

".
If null, equivalent to an empty array.
- cons

- the search controls that control the search. If null,
the default search controls are used (equivalent
to

(new SearchControls())

).

**Returns:**
- an enumeration of

SearchResult

s of the objects
that satisfy the filter; never null

**Throws:**
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

filterExpr

contains

{i}

expressions where

i

is outside
the bounds of the array

- InvalidSearchControlsException

- if

cons

contains

- InvalidSearchFilterException

- if

InitialLdapContext

```java
public interface
DirContext

extends
Context
```

The directory service interface, containing
methods for examining and updating attributes
associated with objects, and for searching the directory.

Names

Each name passed as an argument to a

DirContext

method is relative
to that context. The empty name is used to name the context itself.
The name parameter may never be null.

Most of the methods have overloaded versions with one taking a

Name

parameter and one taking a

String

.
These overloaded versions are equivalent in that if
the

Name

and

String

parameters are just
different representations of the same name, then the overloaded
versions of the same methods behave the same.
In the method descriptions below, only one version is documented.
The second version instead has a link to the first: the same
documentation applies to both.

See

Context

for a discussion on the interpretation of the
name argument to the

Context

methods. These same rules
apply to the name argument to the

DirContext

methods.

Attribute Models

There are two basic models of what attributes should be
associated with. First, attributes may be directly associated with a
DirContext object.
In this model, an attribute operation on the named object is
roughly equivalent
to a lookup on the name (which returns the DirContext object),
followed by the attribute operation invoked on the DirContext object
in which the caller supplies an empty name. The attributes can be viewed
as being stored along with the object (note that this does not imply that
the implementation must do so).

The second model is that attributes are associated with a
name (typically an atomic name) in a DirContext.
In this model, an attribute operation on the named object is
roughly equivalent to a lookup on the name of the parent DirContext of the
named object, followed by the attribute operation invoked on the parent
in which the caller supplies the terminal atomic name.
The attributes can be viewed as being stored in the parent DirContext
(again, this does not imply that the implementation must do so).
Objects that are not DirContexts can have attributes, as long as
their parents are DirContexts.

JNDI support both of these models.
It is up to the individual service providers to decide where to
"store" attributes.
JNDI clients are safest when they do not make assumptions about
whether an object's attributes are stored as part of the object, or stored
within the parent object and associated with the object's name.

Attribute Type Names

In the

getAttributes()

and

search()

methods,
you can supply the attributes to return by supplying a list of
attribute names (strings).
The attributes that you get back might not have the same names as the
attribute names you have specified. This is because some directories
support features that cause them to return other attributes. Such
features include attribute subclassing, attribute name synonyms, and
attribute language codes.

In attribute subclassing, attributes are defined in a class hierarchy.
In some directories, for example, the "name" attribute might be the
superclass of all name-related attributes, including "commonName" and
"surName". Asking for the "name" attribute might return both the
"commonName" and "surName" attributes.

With attribute type synonyms, a directory can assign multiple names to
the same attribute. For example, "cn" and "commonName" might both
refer to the same attribute. Asking for "cn" might return the
"commonName" attribute.

Some directories support the language codes for attributes.
Asking such a directory for the "description" attribute, for example,
might return all of the following attributes:

- description

description;lang-en

description;lang-de

description;lang-fr

Operational Attributes

Some directories have the notion of "operational attributes" which are
attributes associated with a directory object for administrative
purposes. An example of operational attributes is the access control
list for an object.

In the

getAttributes()

and

search()

methods,
you can specify that all attributes associated with the requested objects
be returned by supply

null

as the list of attributes to return.
The attributes returned do

not

include operational attributes.
In order to retrieve operational attributes, you must name them explicitly.

Named Context

There are certain methods in which the name must resolve to a context
(for example, when searching a single level context). The documentation
of such methods
use the term

named context

to describe their name parameter.
For these methods, if the named object is not a DirContext,

NotContextException

is thrown.
Aside from these methods, there is no requirement that the

named object

be a DirContext.

Parameters

An

Attributes

,

SearchControls

, or array object
passed as a parameter to any method will not be modified by the
service provider. The service provider may keep a reference to it
for the duration of the operation, including any enumeration of the
method's results and the processing of any referrals generated.
The caller should not modify the object during this time.
An

Attributes

object returned by any method is owned by
the caller. The caller may subsequently modify it; the service
provider will not.

Exceptions

All the methods in this interface can throw a NamingException or
any of its subclasses. See NamingException and their subclasses
for details on each exception.

as the list of attributes to return.
The attributes returned do

not

include operational attributes.
In order to retrieve operational attributes, you must name them explicitly.

Named Context

There are certain methods in which the name must resolve to a context
(for example, when searching a single level context). The documentation
of such methods
use the term

named context

to describe their name parameter.
For these methods, if the named object is not a DirContext,

NotContextException

is thrown.
Aside from these methods, there is no requirement that the

named object

be a DirContext.

Parameters

An

Attributes

,

SearchControls

, or array object
passed as a parameter to any method will not be modified by the
service provider. The service provider may keep a reference to it
for the duration of the operation, including any enumeration of the
method's results and the processing of any referrals generated.
The caller should not modify the object during this time.
An

Attributes

object returned by any method is owned by
the caller. The caller may subsequently modify it; the service
provider will not.

Exceptions

All the methods in this interface can throw a NamingException or
any of its subclasses. See NamingException and their subclasses
for details on each exception.

#### Attribute Type Names

In attribute subclassing, attributes are defined in a class hierarchy.
In some directories, for example, the "name" attribute might be the
superclass of all name-related attributes, including "commonName" and
"surName". Asking for the "name" attribute might return both the
"commonName" and "surName" attributes.

With attribute type synonyms, a directory can assign multiple names to
the same attribute. For example, "cn" and "commonName" might both
refer to the same attribute. Asking for "cn" might return the
"commonName" attribute.

Some directories support the language codes for attributes.
Asking such a directory for the "description" attribute, for example,
might return all of the following attributes:

- description

description;lang-en

description;lang-de

description;lang-fr

Operational Attributes

Some directories have the notion of "operational attributes" which are
attributes associated with a directory object for administrative
purposes. An example of operational attributes is the access control
list for an object.

In the

getAttributes()

and

search()

methods,
you can specify that all attributes associated with the requested objects
be returned by supply

null

as the list of attributes to return.
The attributes returned do

not

include operational attributes.
In order to retrieve operational attributes, you must name them explicitly.

Named Context

There are certain methods in which the name must resolve to a context
(for example, when searching a single level context). The documentation
of such methods
use the term

named context

to describe their name parameter.
For these methods, if the named object is not a DirContext,

NotContextException

is thrown.
Aside from these methods, there is no requirement that the

named object

be a DirContext.

Parameters

An

Attributes

,

SearchControls

, or array object
passed as a parameter to any method will not be modified by the
service provider. The service provider may keep a reference to it
for the duration of the operation, including any enumeration of the

- ADD_ATTRIBUTE

```java
static final int ADD_ATTRIBUTE
```

This constant specifies to add an attribute with the specified values.

If attribute does not exist,
create the attribute. The resulting attribute has a union of the
specified value set and the prior value set.
Adding an attribute with no value will throw

InvalidAttributeValueException

if the attribute must have
at least one value. For a single-valued attribute where that attribute
already exists, throws

AttributeInUseException

.
If attempting to add more than one value to a single-valued attribute,
throws

InvalidAttributeValueException

.

Constant Field Values

- REPLACE_ATTRIBUTE

```java
static final int REPLACE_ATTRIBUTE
```

This constant specifies to replace an attribute with specified values.

If attribute already exists,
replaces all existing values with new specified values. If the
attribute does not exist, creates it. If no value is specified,
deletes all the values of the attribute.
Removal of the last value will remove the attribute if the attribute
is required to have at least one value. If
attempting to add more than one value to a single-valued attribute,
throws

InvalidAttributeValueException

.

The value of this constant is

- REMOVE_ATTRIBUTE

```java
static final int REMOVE_ATTRIBUTE
```

This constant specifies to delete
the specified attribute values from the attribute.

The resulting attribute has the set difference of its prior value set
and the specified value set.
If no values are specified, deletes the entire attribute.
If the attribute does not exist, or if some or all members of the
specified value set do not exist, this absence may be ignored
and the operation succeeds, or a NamingException may be thrown to
indicate the absence.
Removal of the last value will remove the attribute if the
attribute is required to have at least one value.

```

Retrieves selected attributes associated with a named object.
See the class description regarding attribute models, attribute
type names, and operational attributes.

If the object does not have an attribute
specified, the directory will ignore the nonexistent attribute
and return those requested attributes that the object does have.

A directory might return more attributes than was requested
(see

- createSubcontext

```java
DirContext
createSubcontext​(
Name
name,

Attributes
attrs)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates and binds a new context, along with associated attributes.
This method creates a new subcontext with the given name, binds it in
the target context (that named by all but terminal atomic
component of the name), and associates the supplied attributes
with the newly created object.
All intermediate and target contexts must already exist.
If

attrs

is null, this method is equivalent to

Context.createSubcontext()

.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context to create; may not be empty
**Parameters:** attrs

- the attributes to associate with the newly created context
**Returns:** the newly created context
**Throws:** NameAlreadyBoundException

- if the name is already bound
**Throws:** InvalidAttributesException

- getSchema

```java
DirContext
getSchema​(
Name
name)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the schema associated with the named object.
The schema describes rules regarding the structure of the namespace
and the attributes stored within it. The schema
specifies what types of objects can be added to the directory and where
they can be added; what mandatory and optional attributes an object
can have. The range of support for schemas is directory-specific.

This method returns the root of the schema information tree
that is applicable to the named object. Several named objects
(or even an entire directory) might share the same schema.

Issues such as structure and contents of the schema tree,
permission to modify to the contents of the schema
tree, and the effect of such modifications on the directory
are dependent on the underlying directory.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the object whose schema is to be retrieved
**Returns:** the schema associated with the context; never null
**Throws:** OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- getSchema

```java
DirContext
getSchema​(
String
name)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the schema associated with the named object.
See

getSchema(Name)

for details.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the object whose schema is to be retrieved
**Returns:** the schema associated with the context; never null
**Throws:** OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- getSchemaClassDefinition

```java
DirContext
getSchemaClassDefinition​(
Name
name)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves a context containing the schema objects of the
named object's class definitions.

One category of information found in directory schemas is

class definitions

. An "object class" definition
specifies the object's

type

and what attributes (mandatory
and optional) the object must/can have. Note that the term
"object class" being referred to here is in the directory sense
rather than in the Java sense.
For example, if the named object is a directory object of
"Person" class,

getSchemaClassDefinition()

would return a

DirContext

representing the (directory's) object class
definition of "Person".

The information that can be retrieved from an object class definition
is directory-dependent.

Prior to JNDI 1.2, this method
returned a single schema object representing the class definition of
the named object.
Since JNDI 1.2, this method returns a

DirContext

containing
all of the named object's class definitions.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the object whose object class
definition is to be retrieved
**Returns:** the

DirContext

containing the named
object's class definitions; never null
**Throws:** OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- getSchemaClassDefinition

```java
DirContext
getSchemaClassDefinition​(
String
name)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves a context containing the schema objects of the
named object's class definitions.
See

getSchemaClassDefinition(Name)

for details.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the object whose object class
definition is to be retrieved
**Returns:** the

DirContext

containing the named
object's class definitions; never null
**Throws:** OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- search

```java
NamingEnumeration
<
SearchResult
> search​(
Name
name,

Attributes
matchingAttributes,

String
[] attributesToReturn)
throws
NamingException
```

Searches in a single context for objects that contain a
specified set of attributes, and retrieves selected attributes.
The search is performed using the default

SearchControls

settings.

For an object to be selected, each attribute in

matchingAttributes

must match some attribute of the
object. If

matchingAttributes

is empty or
null, all objects in the target context are returned.

An attribute

A

1

in

matchingAttributes

is considered to match an
attribute

A

2

of an object if

A

1

and

A

2

have the same
identifier, and each value of

A

1

is equal
to some value of

A

2

. This implies that the
order of values is not significant, and that

A

2

may contain "extra" values not found in

A

1

without affecting the comparison. It
also implies that if

A

1

has no values, then
testing for a match is equivalent to testing for the presence
of an attribute

A

2

with the same
identifier.

The precise definition of "equality" used in comparing attribute values
is defined by the underlying directory service. It might use the

Object.equals

method, for example, or might use a schema
to specify a different equality operation.
For matching based on operations other than equality (such as
substring comparison) use the version of the

search

method that takes a filter argument.

When changes are made to this

DirContext

,
the effect on enumerations returned by prior calls to this method
is undefined.

If the object does not have the attribute
specified, the directory will ignore the nonexistent attribute
and return the requested attributes that the object does have.

A directory might return more attributes than was requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description),
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

See also

Operational Attributes

in the class
description.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context to search
**Parameters:** matchingAttributes

- the attributes to search for. If empty or null,
all objects in the target context are returned.
**Parameters:** attributesToReturn

- the attributes to return. null indicates that
all attributes are to be returned;
an empty array indicates that none are to be returned.
**Returns:** a non-null enumeration of

SearchResult

objects.
Each

SearchResult

contains the attributes
identified by

attributesToReturn

and the name of the corresponding object, named relative
to the context named by

name

.

for a full description.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context to search
**Parameters:** matchingAttributes

- the attributes to search for
**Returns:** an enumeration of

SearchResult

objects

- search

```java
NamingEnumeration

```

Searches in a single context for objects that contain a
specified set of attributes.
See

search(Name, Attributes)

for details.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context to search
**Parameters:** matchingAttributes

- the attributes to search for
**Returns:** an enumeration of

SearchResult

objects
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- search

```java
NamingEnumeration
<
SearchResult
> search​(
Name
name,

String
filter,

SearchControls
cons)
throws
NamingException
```

Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
given search filter. Performs the search as specified by
the search controls.

The format and interpretation of

filter

follows RFC 2254
with the
following interpretations for

attr

and

value

mentioned in the RFC.

attr

is the attribute's identifier.

value

is the string representation the attribute's value.
The translation of this string representation into the attribute's value
is directory-specific.

For the assertion "someCount=127", for example,

attr

is "someCount" and

value

is "127".
The provider determines, based on the attribute ID ("someCount")
(and possibly its schema), that the attribute's value is an integer.
It then parses the string "127" appropriately.

Any non-ASCII characters in the filter string should be
represented by the appropriate Java (Unicode) characters, and
not encoded as UTF-8 octets. Alternately, the
"backslash-hexcode" notation described in RFC 2254 may be used.

If the directory does not support a string representation of
some or all of its attributes, the form of

search

that
accepts filter arguments in the form of Objects can be used instead.
The service provider for such a directory would then translate
the filter arguments to its service-specific representation
for filter evaluation.
See

search(Name, String, Object[], SearchControls)

.

RFC 2254 defines certain operators for the filter, including substring
matches, equality, approximate match, greater than, less than. These
operators are mapped to operators with corresponding semantics in the
underlying directory. For example, for the equals operator, suppose
the directory has a matching rule defining "equality" of the
attributes in the filter. This rule would be used for checking
equality of the attributes specified in the filter with the attributes
of objects in the directory. Similarly, if the directory has a
matching rule for ordering, this rule would be used for
making "greater than" and "less than" comparisons.

Not all of the operators defined in RFC 2254 are applicable to all
attributes. When an operator is not applicable, the exception

InvalidSearchFilterException

is thrown.

The result is returned in an enumeration of

SearchResult

s.
Each

SearchResult

contains the name of the object
and other information about the object (see SearchResult).
The name is either relative to the target context of the search
(which is named by the

name

parameter), or
it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
the enumeration (as is possible when

cons

specifies a search scope of

SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE

or

SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE

), its name is the empty
string. The

SearchResult

may also contain attributes of the
matching object if the

cons

argument specified that attributes
be returned.

If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
nonexistent attribute will be ignored. Those requested
attributes that the object does have will be returned.

A directory might return more attributes than were requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description)
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

**Parameters:** name

SearchResult

- search

```java
NamingEnumeration
<
SearchResult

throws
NamingException
```

Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
given search filter. Performs the search as specified by
the search controls.
See

search(Name, String, SearchControls)

for details.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context or object to search
**Parameters:** filter

- the filter expression to use for the search; may not be null
**Parameters:** cons

- the search controls that control the search. If null,
the default search controls are used (equivalent
to

(new SearchControls())

).
**Returns:** an enumeration of

SearchResult

s for
the objects that satisfy the filter.
**Throws:** InvalidSearchFilterException

- if the search filter specified is
not supported or understood by the underlying directory
**Throws:** InvalidSearchControlsException

- if the search controls

**Throws:** NamingException

```java
NamingEnumeration
<
SearchResult
> search​(
Name
name,

String
filterExpr,

Object
[] filterArgs,

SearchControls
cons)
throws
NamingException
```

Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
given search filter. Performs the search as specified by
the search controls.

The interpretation of

filterExpr

is based on RFC
2254. It may additionally contain variables of the form

{i}

-- where

i

is an integer -- that
refer to objects in the

filterArgs

array. The
interpretation of

filterExpr

is otherwise
identical to that of the

filter

parameter of the
method

search(Name, String, SearchControls)

.

When a variable

{i}

appears in a search filter, it
indicates that the filter argument

filterArgs[i]

is to be used in that place. Such variables may be used
wherever an

attr

,

value

, or

matchingrule

production appears in the filter grammar
of RFC 2254, section 4. When a string-valued filter argument
is substituted for a variable, the filter is interpreted as if
the string were given in place of the variable, with any
characters having special significance within filters (such as

'*'

) having been escaped according to the rules of
RFC 2254.

For directories that do not use a string representation for
some or all of their attributes, the filter argument
corresponding to an attribute value may be of a type other than
String. Directories that support unstructured binary-valued
attributes, for example, should accept byte arrays as filter
arguments. The interpretation (if any) of filter arguments of
any other type is determined by the service provider for that
directory, which maps the filter operations onto operations with
corresponding semantics in the underlying directory.

This method returns an enumeration of the results.
Each element in the enumeration contains the name of the object
and other information about the object (see

SearchResult

).
The name is either relative to the target context of the search
(which is named by the

name

parameter), or
it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
the enumeration (as is possible when

cons

specifies a search scope of

SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE

or

SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE

),
its name is the empty string.

The

SearchResult

may also contain attributes of the matching
object if the

cons

argument specifies that attributes be
returned.

If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
nonexistent attribute will be ignored. Those requested
attributes that the object does have will be returned.

A directory might return more attributes than were requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description)
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

If a search filter with invalid variable substitutions is provided
to this method, the result is undefined.
When changes are made to this DirContext,
the effect on enumerations returned by prior calls to this method
is undefined.

- createSubcontext

```java
DirContext
createSubcontext​(
Name
name,

Attributes
attrs)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates and binds a new context, along with associated attributes.
This method creates a new subcontext with the given name, binds it in
the target context (that named by all but terminal atomic
component of the name), and associates the supplied attributes
with the newly created object.
All intermediate and target contexts must already exist.
If

attrs

is null, this method is equivalent to

Context.createSubcontext()

.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context to create; may not be empty
**Parameters:** attrs

- the attributes to associate with the newly created context
**Returns:** the newly created context
**Throws:** NameAlreadyBoundException

- if the name is already bound
**Throws:** InvalidAttributesException

- if

attrs

does not
contain all the mandatory attributes required for creation
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered
**See Also:** Context.createSubcontext(Name)

- createSubcontext

```java
DirContext
createSubcontext​(
String
name,

Attributes
attrs)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates and binds a new context, along with associated attributes.
See

createSubcontext(Name, Attributes)

for details.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context to create; may not be empty
**Parameters:** attrs

- the attributes to associate with the newly created context
**Returns:** the newly created context
**Throws:** NameAlreadyBoundException

- if the name is already bound
**Throws:** InvalidAttributesException

- if

attrs

does not
contain all the mandatory attributes required for creation
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- getSchema

```java
DirContext
getSchema​(
Name
name)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the schema associated with the named object.
The schema describes rules regarding the structure of the namespace
and the attributes stored within it. The schema
specifies what types of objects can be added to the directory and where
they can be added; what mandatory and optional attributes an object
can have. The range of support for schemas is directory-specific.

This method returns the root of the schema information tree
that is applicable to the named object. Several named objects
(or even an entire directory) might share the same schema.

Issues such as structure and contents of the schema tree,
permission to modify to the contents of the schema
tree, and the effect of such modifications on the directory
are dependent on the underlying directory.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the object whose schema is to be retrieved
**Returns:** the schema associated with the context; never null
**Throws:** OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- getSchema

```java
DirContext
getSchema​(
String
name)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the schema associated with the named object.
See

getSchema(Name)

for details.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the object whose schema is to be retrieved
**Returns:** the schema associated with the context; never null
**Throws:** OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- getSchemaClassDefinition

```java
DirContext
getSchemaClassDefinition​(
Name
name)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves a context containing the schema objects of the
named object's class definitions.

One category of information found in directory schemas is

class definitions

. An "object class" definition
specifies the object's

type

and what attributes (mandatory
and optional) the object must/can have. Note that the term
"object class" being referred to here is in the directory sense
rather than in the Java sense.
For example, if the named object is a directory object of
"Person" class,

getSchemaClassDefinition()

would return a

DirContext

representing the (directory's) object class
definition of "Person".

The information that can be retrieved from an object class definition
is directory-dependent.

Prior to JNDI 1.2, this method
returned a single schema object representing the class definition of
the named object.
Since JNDI 1.2, this method returns a

DirContext

containing
all of the named object's class definitions.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the object whose object class
definition is to be retrieved
**Returns:** the

DirContext

containing the named
object's class definitions; never null
**Throws:** OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- getSchemaClassDefinition

```java
DirContext
getSchemaClassDefinition​(
String
name)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves a context containing the schema objects of the
named object's class definitions.
See

getSchemaClassDefinition(Name)

for details.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the object whose object class
definition is to be retrieved
**Returns:** the

DirContext

containing the named
object's class definitions; never null
**Throws:** OperationNotSupportedException

- if schema not supported
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- search

```java
NamingEnumeration
<
SearchResult
> search​(
Name
name,

Attributes
matchingAttributes,

String
[] attributesToReturn)
throws
NamingException
```

Searches in a single context for objects that contain a
specified set of attributes, and retrieves selected attributes.
The search is performed using the default

SearchControls

settings.

For an object to be selected, each attribute in

matchingAttributes

must match some attribute of the
object. If

matchingAttributes

is empty or
null, all objects in the target context are returned.

An attribute

A

1

in

matchingAttributes

is considered to match an
attribute

A

2

of an object if

A

1

and

A

2

have the same
identifier, and each value of

A

1

is equal
to some value of

A

2

. This implies that the
order of values is not significant, and that

A

2

may contain "extra" values not found in

A

1

without affecting the comparison. It
also implies that if

A

1

has no values, then
testing for a match is equivalent to testing for the presence
of an attribute

A

2

with the same
identifier.

The precise definition of "equality" used in comparing attribute values
is defined by the underlying directory service. It might use the

Object.equals

method, for example, or might use a schema
to specify a different equality operation.
For matching based on operations other than equality (such as
substring comparison) use the version of the

search

method that takes a filter argument.

When changes are made to this

DirContext

,
the effect on enumerations returned by prior calls to this method
is undefined.

If the object does not have the attribute
specified, the directory will ignore the nonexistent attribute
and return the requested attributes that the object does have.

A directory might return more attributes than was requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description),
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

See also

Operational Attributes

in the class
description.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context to search
**Parameters:** matchingAttributes

- the attributes to search for. If empty or null,
all objects in the target context are returned.
**Parameters:** attributesToReturn

- the attributes to return. null indicates that
all attributes are to be returned;
an empty array indicates that none are to be returned.
**Returns:** a non-null enumeration of

SearchResult

objects.
Each

SearchResult

contains the attributes
identified by

attributesToReturn

and the name of the corresponding object, named relative
to the context named by

name

.
**Throws:** NamingException

.

See

search(Name, Attributes, String[])

for a full description.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context to search

- the attributes to search for
**Returns:** an enumeration of

SearchResult

objects
**Throws:** NamingException

**See Also:** search(Name, Attributes, String[])

- search

```java
NamingEnumeration

> search​(
String
name,

Attributes
matchingAttributes)
throws
NamingException
```

Searches in a single context for objects that contain a
specified set of attributes.
See

search(Name, Attributes)

for details.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context to search
**Parameters:** matchingAttributes

- the attributes to search for
**Returns:** an enumeration of

SearchResult

objects
**Throws:** NamingException

- if a naming exception is encountered

- search

```java
NamingEnumeration
<
SearchResult
> search​(
Name
name,

String
filter,

SearchControls
cons)
throws
NamingException
```

Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
given search filter. Performs the search as specified by
the search controls.

The format and interpretation of

filter

follows RFC 2254
with the
following interpretations for

attr

and

value

mentioned in the RFC.

attr

is the attribute's identifier.

value

is the string representation the attribute's value.
The translation of this string representation into the attribute's value
is directory-specific.

For the assertion "someCount=127", for example,

attr

is "someCount" and

value

is "127".
The provider determines, based on the attribute ID ("someCount")
(and possibly its schema), that the attribute's value is an integer.
It then parses the string "127" appropriately.

Any non-ASCII characters in the filter string should be
represented by the appropriate Java (Unicode) characters, and
not encoded as UTF-8 octets. Alternately, the
"backslash-hexcode" notation described in RFC 2254 may be used.

If the directory does not support a string representation of
some or all of its attributes, the form of

search

that
accepts filter arguments in the form of Objects can be used instead.
The service provider for such a directory would then translate
the filter arguments to its service-specific representation
for filter evaluation.
See

search(Name, String, Object[], SearchControls)

.

RFC 2254 defines certain operators for the filter, including substring
matches, equality, approximate match, greater than, less than. These
operators are mapped to operators with corresponding semantics in the
underlying directory. For example, for the equals operator, suppose
the directory has a matching rule defining "equality" of the
attributes in the filter. This rule would be used for checking
equality of the attributes specified in the filter with the attributes
of objects in the directory. Similarly, if the directory has a
matching rule for ordering, this rule would be used for
making "greater than" and "less than" comparisons.

Not all of the operators defined in RFC 2254 are applicable to all
attributes. When an operator is not applicable, the exception

InvalidSearchFilterException

is thrown.

The result is returned in an enumeration of

SearchResult

s.
Each

SearchResult

contains the name of the object
and other information about the object (see SearchResult).
The name is either relative to the target context of the search
(which is named by the

name

parameter), or
it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
the enumeration (as is possible when

cons

specifies a search scope of

SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE

or

SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE

), its name is the empty
string. The

SearchResult

may also contain attributes of the
matching object if the

cons

argument specified that attributes
be returned.

If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
nonexistent attribute will be ignored. Those requested
attributes that the object does have will be returned.

A directory might return more attributes than were requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description)
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

```java
NamingEnumeration
<
SearchResult
> search​(
Name
name,

String
filterExpr,

Object
[] filterArgs,

SearchControls
cons)
throws
NamingException
```

Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
given search filter. Performs the search as specified by
the search controls.

The interpretation of

filterExpr

is based on RFC
2254. It may additionally contain variables of the form

{i}

-- where

i

is an integer -- that
refer to objects in the

filterArgs

array. The
interpretation of

filterExpr

is otherwise
identical to that of the

filter

parameter of the
method

search(Name, String, SearchControls)

.

When a variable

{i}

appears in a search filter, it
indicates that the filter argument

filterArgs[i]

is to be used in that place. Such variables may be used
wherever an

attr

,

value

, or

matchingrule

production appears in the filter grammar
of RFC 2254, section 4. When a string-valued filter argument
is substituted for a variable, the filter is interpreted as if
the string were given in place of the variable, with any
characters having special significance within filters (such as

'*'

) having been escaped according to the rules of
RFC 2254.

For directories that do not use a string representation for
some or all of their attributes, the filter argument
corresponding to an attribute value may be of a type other than
String. Directories that support unstructured binary-valued
attributes, for example, should accept byte arrays as filter
arguments. The interpretation (if any) of filter arguments of
any other type is determined by the service provider for that
directory, which maps the filter operations onto operations with
corresponding semantics in the underlying directory.

This method returns an enumeration of the results.
Each element in the enumeration contains the name of the object
and other information about the object (see

SearchResult

).
The name is either relative to the target context of the search
(which is named by the

name

parameter), or
it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
the enumeration (as is possible when

cons

specifies a search scope of

SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE

or

SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE

),
its name is the empty string.

The

SearchResult

may also contain attributes of the matching
object if the

cons

argument specifies that attributes be
returned.

If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
nonexistent attribute will be ignored. Those requested
attributes that the object does have will be returned.

A directory might return more attributes than were requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description)
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

If a search filter with invalid variable substitutions is provided
to this method, the result is undefined.
When changes are made to this DirContext,
the effect on enumerations returned by prior calls to this method
is undefined.

getSchema

```java
DirContext
getSchema​(
Name
name)
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the schema associated with the named object.
The schema describes rules regarding the structure of the namespace
and the attributes stored within it. The schema
specifies what types of objects can be added to the directory and where
they can be added; what mandatory and optional attributes an object
can have. The range of support for schemas is directory-specific.

This method returns the root of the schema information tree
that is applicable to the named object. Several named objects
(or even an entire directory) might share the same schema.

Issues such as structure and contents of the schema tree,
permission to modify to the contents of the schema
tree, and the effect of such modifications on the directory
are dependent on the underlying directory.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the object whose schema is to be retrieved
**Returns:** the schema associated with the context; never null

```

Retrieves a context containing the schema objects of the
named object's class definitions.

One category of information found in directory schemas is

class definitions

. An "object class" definition
specifies the object's

type

and what attributes (mandatory
and optional) the object must/can have. Note that the term
"object class" being referred to here is in the directory sense
rather than in the Java sense.
For example, if the named object is a directory object of
"Person" class,

getSchemaClassDefinition()

would return a

DirContext

representing the (directory's) object class
definition of "Person".

The information that can be retrieved from an object class definition
is directory-dependent.

Prior to JNDI 1.2, this method
returned a single schema object representing the class definition of
the named object.
Since JNDI 1.2, this method returns a

search

```java

Name
name,

Attributes
matchingAttributes,

String
[] attributesToReturn)
throws
NamingException
```

Searches in a single context for objects that contain a
specified set of attributes, and retrieves selected attributes.
The search is performed using the default

SearchControls

settings.

For an object to be selected, each attribute in

matchingAttributes

must match some attribute of the
object. If

matchingAttributes

is empty or
null, all objects in the target context are returned.

An attribute

A

1

in

matchingAttributes

is considered to match an
attribute

A

2

of an object if

A

1

and

A

2

have the same
identifier, and each value of

A

1

is equal
to some value of

A

2

. This implies that the
order of values is not significant, and that

A

2

may contain "extra" values not found in

A

1

without affecting the comparison. It
also implies that if

A

1

has no values, then
testing for a match is equivalent to testing for the presence
of an attribute

A

2

with the same
identifier.

The precise definition of "equality" used in comparing attribute values
is defined by the underlying directory service. It might use the

Object.equals

method, for example, or might use a schema
to specify a different equality operation.
For matching based on operations other than equality (such as
substring comparison) use the version of the

search

method that takes a filter argument.

When changes are made to this

DirContext

,
the effect on enumerations returned by prior calls to this method
is undefined.

If the object does not have the attribute
specified, the directory will ignore the nonexistent attribute
and return the requested attributes that the object does have.

A directory might return more attributes than was requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description),
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

Operational Attributes

in the class
description.

**Parameters:** name

- the name of the context to search
**Parameters:** matchingAttributes

- the attributes to search for. If empty or null,
all objects in the target context are returned.
**Parameters:** attributesToReturn

- the attributes to return. null indicates that
all attributes are to be returned;
an empty array indicates that none are to be returned.
**Returns:** a non-null enumeration of

SearchResult

objects.
Each

throws
NamingException
```

Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
given search filter. Performs the search as specified by
the search controls.

The format and interpretation of

filter

follows RFC 2254
with the
following interpretations for

attr

and

value

mentioned in the RFC.

attr

is the attribute's identifier.

value

is the string representation the attribute's value.
The translation of this string representation into the attribute's value
is directory-specific.

For the assertion "someCount=127", for example,

attr

is "someCount" and

value

is "127".
The provider determines, based on the attribute ID ("someCount")
(and possibly its schema), that the attribute's value is an integer.
It then parses the string "127" appropriately.

Any non-ASCII characters in the filter string should be
represented by the appropriate Java (Unicode) characters, and
not encoded as UTF-8 octets. Alternately, the
"backslash-hexcode" notation described in RFC 2254 may be used.

If the directory does not support a string representation of
some or all of its attributes, the form of

search

that
accepts filter arguments in the form of Objects can be used instead.
The service provider for such a directory would then translate
the filter arguments to its service-specific representation
for filter evaluation.
See

search(Name, String, Object[], SearchControls)

.

RFC 2254 defines certain operators for the filter, including substring
matches, equality, approximate match, greater than, less than. These
operators are mapped to operators with corresponding semantics in the
underlying directory. For example, for the equals operator, suppose
the directory has a matching rule defining "equality" of the
attributes in the filter. This rule would be used for checking
equality of the attributes specified in the filter with the attributes
of objects in the directory. Similarly, if the directory has a
matching rule for ordering, this rule would be used for
making "greater than" and "less than" comparisons.

Not all of the operators defined in RFC 2254 are applicable to all
attributes. When an operator is not applicable, the exception

InvalidSearchFilterException

is thrown.

The result is returned in an enumeration of

SearchResult

s.
Each

SearchResult

contains the name of the object
and other information about the object (see SearchResult).
The name is either relative to the target context of the search
(which is named by the

name

parameter), or
it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
the enumeration (as is possible when

cons

specifies a search scope of

SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE

or

SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE

), its name is the empty
string. The

SearchResult

may also contain attributes of the
matching object if the

cons

argument specified that attributes
be returned.

If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
nonexistent attribute will be ignored. Those requested
attributes that the object does have will be returned.

A directory might return more attributes than were requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description)
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

Each

SearchResult

contains the name of the object
and other information about the object (see SearchResult).
The name is either relative to the target context of the search

parameter), or
it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
the enumeration (as is possible when

cons

specifies a search scope of

SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE

), its name is the empty
string. The

argument specified that attributes
be returned.

If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
nonexistent attribute will be ignored. Those requested
attributes that the object does have will be returned.

A directory might return more attributes than were requested
(see

Attribute Type Names

in the class description)
but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

Any non-ASCII characters in the filter string should be
represented by the appropriate Java (Unicode) characters, and
not encoded as UTF-8 octets. Alternately, the
"backslash-hexcode" notation described in RFC 2254 may be used.

If the directory does not support a string representation of
some or all of its attributes, the form of

search

that
accepts filter arguments in the form of Objects can be used instead.
The service provider for such a directory would then translate
the filter arguments to its service-specific representation
for filter evaluation.
See

search(Name, String, Object[], SearchControls)

.

RFC 2254 defines certain operators for the filter, including substring
matches, equality, approximate match, greater than, less than. These
operators are mapped to operators with corresponding semantics in the
underlying directory. For example, for the equals operator, suppose
the directory has a matching rule defining "equality" of the
attributes in the filter. This rule would be used for checking
equality of the attributes specified in the filter with the attributes
of objects in the directory. Similarly, if the directory has a
matching rule for ordering, this rule would be used for
making "greater than" and "less than" comparisons.

```

Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
given search filter. Performs the search as specified by
the search controls.

The interpretation of

filterExpr

is based on RFC
2254. It may additionally contain variables of the form

{i}

-- where

i

is an integer -- that
refer to objects in the

filterArgs

array. The
interpretation of

filterExpr

is otherwise
identical to that of the

filter

parameter of the
method

search(Name, String, SearchControls)

.

When a variable

{i}

appears in a search filter, it
indicates that the filter argument

filterArgs[i]

is to be used in that place. Such variables may be used
wherever an

attr

,

value

, or

matchingrule

production appears in the filter grammar
of RFC 2254, section 4. When a string-valued filter argument
is substituted for a variable, the filter is interpreted as if
the string were given in place of the variable, with any
characters having special significance within filters (such as

'*'

) having been escaped according to the rules of
RFC 2254.

For directories that do not use a string representation for
some or all of their attributes, the filter argument
corresponding to an attribute value may be of a type other than
String. Directories that support unstructured binary-valued
attributes, for example, should accept byte arrays as filter
arguments. The interpretation (if any) of filter arguments of
any other type is determined by the service provider for that
directory, which maps the filter operations onto operations with
corresponding semantics in the underlying directory.

This method returns an enumeration of the results.
Each element in the enumeration contains the name of the object
and other information about the object (see

SearchResult

).
The name is either relative to the target context of the search
(which is named by the

name

parameter), or
it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
the enumeration (as is possible when

cons

specifies a search scope of

SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE

or

SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE

),
its name is the empty string.

The

SearchResult

may also contain attributes of the matching
object if the

cons

argument specifies that attributes be
returned.

If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
nonexistent attribute will be ignored. Those requested
attributes that the object does have will be returned.

A directory might return more attributes than were requested
(see

but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

If a search filter with invalid variable substitutions is provided
to this method, the result is undefined.
When changes are made to this DirContext,
the effect on enumerations returned by prior calls to this method
is undefined.
