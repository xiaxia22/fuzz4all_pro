# Class JTextComponent

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\text\JTextComponent.html`

### Class Description

```java
@JavaBean
(
defaultProperty
="UI")
public abstract class
JTextComponent

extends
JComponent

implements
Scrollable
,
Accessible
```

JTextComponent

is the base class for swing text
components. It tries to be compatible with the

java.awt.TextComponent

class
where it can reasonably do so. Also provided are other services
for additional flexibility (beyond the pluggable UI and bean
support).
You can find information on how to use the functionality
this class provides in

General Rules for Using Text Components

,
a section in

The Java Tutorial.

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.
Please see

XMLEncoder

**All Implemented Interfaces:** ImageObserver

,

MenuContainer

,

Serializable

,

Accessible

### Constructor Details

#### public JTextComponent()

Creates a new

JTextComponent

.
Listeners for caret events are established, and the pluggable
UI installed. The component is marked as editable. No layout manager
is used, because layout is managed by the view subsystem of text.
The document model is set to

null

.

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="the text document model")
public void setDocument​(
Document
doc)

Associates the editor with a text document.
The currently registered factory is used to build a view for
the document, which gets displayed by the editor after revalidation.
A PropertyChange event ("document") is propagated to each listener.

**Parameters:**
- doc

- the document to display/edit

**See Also:**
- getDocument()

---

#### public
Document
getDocument()

Fetches the model associated with the editor. This is
primarily for the UI to get at the minimal amount of
state required to be a text editor. Subclasses will
return the actual type of the model which will typically
be something that extends Document.

**Returns:**
- the model

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
Action
[] getActions()

Fetches the command list for the editor. This is
the list of commands supported by the plugged-in UI
augmented by the collection of commands that the
editor itself supports. These are useful for binding
to events, such as in a keymap.

**Returns:**
- the command list

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
description
="desired space between the border and text area")
public void setMargin​(
Insets
m)

Sets margin space between the text component's border
and its text. The text component's default

Border

object will use this value to create the proper margin.
However, if a non-default border is set on the text component,
it is that

Border

object's responsibility to create the
appropriate margin space (else this property will effectively
be ignored). This causes a redraw of the component.
A PropertyChange event ("margin") is sent to all listeners.

**Parameters:**
- m

- the space between the border and the text

---

#### public
Insets
getMargin()

Returns the margin between the text component's border and
its text.

**Returns:**
- the margin

---

#### public void setNavigationFilter​(
NavigationFilter
filter)

Sets the

NavigationFilter

.

NavigationFilter

is used by

DefaultCaret

and the default cursor movement
actions as a way to restrict the cursor movement.

**Parameters:**
- filter

- the filter

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public
NavigationFilter
getNavigationFilter()

Returns the

NavigationFilter

.

NavigationFilter

is used by

DefaultCaret

and the default cursor movement
actions as a way to restrict the cursor movement. A null return value
implies the cursor movement and selection should not be restricted.

**Returns:**
- the NavigationFilter

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public
Caret
getCaret()

Fetches the caret that allows text-oriented navigation over
the view.

**Returns:**
- the caret

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="the caret used to select/navigate")
public void setCaret​(
Caret
c)

Sets the caret to be used. By default this will be set
by the UI that gets installed. This can be changed to
a custom caret if desired. Setting the caret results in a
PropertyChange event ("caret") being fired.

**Parameters:**
- c

- the caret

**See Also:**
- getCaret()

---

#### public
Highlighter
getHighlighter()

Fetches the object responsible for making highlights.

**Returns:**
- the highlighter

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="object responsible for background highlights")
public void setHighlighter​(
Highlighter
h)

Sets the highlighter to be used. By default this will be set
by the UI that gets installed. This can be changed to
a custom highlighter if desired. The highlighter can be set to

null

to disable it.
A PropertyChange event ("highlighter") is fired
when a new highlighter is installed.

**Parameters:**
- h

- the highlighter

**See Also:**
- getHighlighter()

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
description
="set of key event to action bindings to use")
public void setKeymap​(
Keymap
map)

Sets the keymap to use for binding events to
actions. Setting to

null

effectively disables
keyboard input.
A PropertyChange event ("keymap") is fired when a new keymap
is installed.

**Parameters:**
- map

- the keymap

**See Also:**
- getKeymap()

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
component's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the component's

TextUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
a selection and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
component's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:**
- b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true

**See Also:**
- GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

,

getDragEnabled()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public boolean getDragEnabled()

Returns whether or not automatic drag handling is enabled.

**Returns:**
- the value of the

dragEnabled

property

**See Also:**
- setDragEnabled(boolean)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public final void setDropMode​(
DropMode
dropMode)

Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility,
the default for this property is

DropMode.USE_SELECTION

.
Usage of

DropMode.INSERT

is recommended, however,
for an improved user experience. It offers similar behavior of dropping
between text locations, but does so without affecting the actual text
selection and caret location.

JTextComponents

support the following drop modes:

- DropMode.USE_SELECTION
- DropMode.INSERT

The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a

TransferHandler

that accepts drops.

**Parameters:**
- dropMode

- the drop mode to use

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the drop mode is unsupported
or

null

**See Also:**
- getDropMode()

,

getDropLocation()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public final
DropMode
getDropMode()

Returns the drop mode for this component.

**Returns:**
- the drop mode for this component

**See Also:**
- setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public final
JTextComponent.DropLocation
getDropLocation()

Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
or

null

if no location is to currently be shown.

This method is not meant for querying the drop location
from a

TransferHandler

, as the drop location is only
set after the

TransferHandler

's

canImport

has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown.

When this property changes, a property change event with
name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.

**Returns:**
- the drop location

**See Also:**
- setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

,

TransferHandler.canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public
Keymap
getKeymap()

Fetches the keymap currently active in this text
component.

**Returns:**
- the keymap

---

#### public static
Keymap
addKeymap​(
String
nm,

Keymap
parent)

Adds a new keymap into the keymap hierarchy. Keymap bindings
resolve from bottom up so an attribute specified in a child
will override an attribute specified in the parent.

**Parameters:**
- nm

- the name of the keymap (must be unique within the
collection of named keymaps in the document); the name may
be

null

if the keymap is unnamed,
but the caller is responsible for managing the reference
returned as an unnamed keymap can't
be fetched by name
- parent

- the parent keymap; this may be

null

if
unspecified bindings need not be resolved in some other keymap

**Returns:**
- the keymap

---

#### public static
Keymap
removeKeymap​(
String
nm)

Removes a named keymap previously added to the document. Keymaps
with

null

names may not be removed in this way.

**Parameters:**
- nm

- the name of the keymap to remove

**Returns:**
- the keymap that was removed

---

#### public static
Keymap
getKeymap​(
String
nm)

Fetches a named keymap previously added to the document.
This does not work with

null

-named keymaps.

**Parameters:**
- nm

- the name of the keymap

**Returns:**
- the keymap

---

#### public static void loadKeymap​(
Keymap
map,

JTextComponent.KeyBinding
[] bindings,

Action
[] actions)

Loads a keymap with a bunch of
bindings. This can be used to take a static table of
definitions and load them into some keymap. The following
example illustrates an example of binding some keys to
the cut, copy, and paste actions associated with a
JTextComponent. A code fragment to accomplish
this might look as follows:

```java
static final JTextComponent.KeyBinding[] defaultBindings = {
new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(
KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_C, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),
DefaultEditorKit.copyAction),
new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(
KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_V, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),
DefaultEditorKit.pasteAction),
new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(
KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_X, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),
DefaultEditorKit.cutAction),
};

JTextComponent c = new JTextPane();
Keymap k = c.getKeymap();
JTextComponent.loadKeymap(k, defaultBindings, c.getActions());
```

The sets of bindings and actions may be empty but must be
non-

null

.

**Parameters:**
- map

- the keymap
- bindings

- the bindings
- actions

- the set of actions

public void setText​(
String
t)

Sets the text of this

TextComponent

to the specified text. If the text is

null

or empty, has the effect of simply deleting the old text.
When text has been inserted, the resulting caret location
is determined by the implementation of the caret class.

Note that text is not a bound property, so no

PropertyChangeEvent

is fired when it changes. To listen for changes to the text,
use

DocumentListener

.

**Parameters:**
- t

- the new text to be set

**See Also:**
- getText(int, int)

,

DefaultCaret

public void setSelectionEnd​(int selectionEnd)

Sets the selection end to the specified position. The new
end point is constrained to be at or after the current
selection start.

This is available for backward compatibility to code
that called this method on

java.awt.TextComponent

.
This is implemented to forward to the

Caret

implementation which is where the actual selection is maintained.

**Parameters:**
- selectionEnd

- the end position of the text ≥ 0

---

#### public void select​(int selectionStart,
int selectionEnd)

Selects the text between the specified start and end positions.

This method sets the start and end positions of the
selected text, enforcing the restriction that the start position
must be greater than or equal to zero. The end position must be
greater than or equal to the start position, and less than or
equal to the length of the text component's text.

If the caller supplies values that are inconsistent or out of
bounds, the method enforces these constraints silently, and
without failure. Specifically, if the start position or end
position is greater than the length of the text, it is reset to
equal the text length. If the start position is less than zero,
it is reset to zero, and if the end position is less than the
start position, it is reset to the start position.

This call is provided for backward compatibility.
It is routed to a call to

setCaretPosition

followed by a call to

moveCaretPosition

.
The preferred way to manage selection is by calling
those methods directly.

**Parameters:**
- selectionStart

- the start position of the text
- selectionEnd

- the end position of the text

**See Also:**
- setCaretPosition(int)

,

moveCaretPosition(int)

#### public void selectAll()

Selects all the text in the

TextComponent

.
Does nothing on a

null

or empty document.

---

#### public
String
getToolTipText​(
MouseEvent
event)

Returns the string to be used as the tooltip for

event

.
This will return one of:

- If

setToolTipText

has been invoked with a
non-

null

value, it will be returned, otherwise

The value from invoking

getToolTipText

on
the UI will be returned.

By default

JTextComponent

does not register
itself with the

ToolTipManager

.
This means that tooltips will NOT be shown from the

TextUI

unless

registerComponent

has
been invoked on the

ToolTipManager

.

**Overrides:**
- getToolTipText

in class

JComponent

**Parameters:**
- event

- the event in question

**Returns:**
- the string to be used as the tooltip for

event

public
Dimension
getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()

Returns the preferred size of the viewport for a view component.
This is implemented to do the default behavior of returning
the preferred size of the component.

**Specified by:**
- getPreferredScrollableViewportSize

in interface

Scrollable

**Returns:**
- the

preferredSize

of a

JViewport

whose view is this

Scrollable

**See Also:**
- JComponent.getPreferredSize()

#### public int getScrollableUnitIncrement​(
Rectangle
visibleRect,
int orientation,
int direction)

Components that display logical rows or columns should compute
the scroll increment that will completely expose one new row
or column, depending on the value of orientation. Ideally,
components should handle a partially exposed row or column by
returning the distance required to completely expose the item.

The default implementation of this is to simply return 10% of
the visible area. Subclasses are likely to be able to provide
a much more reasonable value.

**Specified by:**
- getScrollableUnitIncrement

in interface

Scrollable

**Parameters:**
- visibleRect

- the view area visible within the viewport
- orientation

- either

SwingConstants.VERTICAL

or

SwingConstants.HORIZONTAL
- direction

- less than zero to scroll up/left, greater than
zero for down/right

**Returns:**
- the "unit" increment for scrolling in the specified direction

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- for an invalid orientation

**See Also:**
- JScrollBar.setUnitIncrement(int)

---

#### public int getScrollableBlockIncrement​(
Rectangle
visibleRect,
int orientation,
int direction)

Components that display logical rows or columns should compute
the scroll increment that will completely expose one block
of rows or columns, depending on the value of orientation.

The default implementation of this is to simply return the visible
area. Subclasses will likely be able to provide a much more
reasonable value.

**Specified by:**
- getScrollableBlockIncrement

in interface

Scrollable

**Parameters:**
- visibleRect

- the view area visible within the viewport
- orientation

- either

SwingConstants.VERTICAL

or

SwingConstants.HORIZONTAL
- direction

- less than zero to scroll up/left, greater than zero
for down/right

**Returns:**
- the "block" increment for scrolling in the specified direction

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- for an invalid orientation

**See Also:**
- JScrollBar.setBlockIncrement(int)

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportWidth()

Returns true if a viewport should always force the width of this

Scrollable

to match the width of the viewport.
For example a normal text view that supported line wrapping
would return true here, since it would be undesirable for
wrapped lines to disappear beyond the right
edge of the viewport. Note that returning true for a

Scrollable

whose ancestor is a

JScrollPane

effectively disables horizontal scrolling.

Scrolling containers, like

JViewport

,
will use this method each time they are validated.

**Specified by:**
- getScrollableTracksViewportWidth

in interface

Scrollable

**Returns:**
- true if a viewport should force the

Scrollable

s
width to match its own

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportHeight()

Returns true if a viewport should always force the height of this

Scrollable

to match the height of the viewport.
For example a columnar text view that flowed text in left to
right columns could effectively disable vertical scrolling by
returning true here.

Scrolling containers, like

JViewport

,
will use this method each time they are validated.

**Specified by:**
- getScrollableTracksViewportHeight

in interface

Scrollable

**Returns:**
- true if a viewport should force the Scrollables height
to match its own

boolean showPrintDialog,

PrintService
service,

PrintRequestAttributeSet
attributes,
boolean interactive)
throws
PrinterException

Prints the content of this

JTextComponent

. Note: this method
blocks until printing is done.

Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests

Strings

from the formats, providing a single item which may be
included in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the
current page number.

showPrintDialog boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether
a print dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user
may use the dialog to change printing attributes or even cancel the
print.

service

allows you to provide the initial

PrintService

for the print dialog, or to specify

PrintService

to print to when the dialog is not shown.

attributes

can be used to provide the
initial values for the print dialog, or to supply any needed
attributes when the dialog is not shown.

attributes

can
be used to control how the job will print, for example

duplex

or

single-sided

.

interactive boolean

parameter allows you to specify
whether to perform printing in

interactive

mode. If

true

, a progress dialog, with an abort option,
is displayed for the duration of printing. This dialog is

modal

when

print

is invoked on the

Event Dispatch
Thread

and

non-modal

otherwise.

Warning

:
calling this method on the

Event Dispatch Thread

with

interactive false

blocks

all

events, including repaints, from
being processed until printing is complete. It is only
recommended when printing from an application with no
visible GUI.

Note: In

headless

mode,

showPrintDialog

and

interactive

parameters are ignored and no dialogs are
shown.

This method ensures the

document

is not mutated during printing.
To indicate it visually,

setEnabled(false)

is set for the
duration of printing.

This method uses

getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

to render document content.

This method is thread-safe, although most Swing methods are not. Please
see

Concurrency in Swing

for more information.

Sample Usage

. This code snippet shows a cross-platform print
dialog and then prints the

JTextComponent

in

interactive

mode
unless the user cancels the dialog:

```java
textComponent.print(new MessageFormat("My text component header"),
new MessageFormat("Footer. Page - {0}"), true, null, null, true);
```

Executing this code off the

Event Dispatch Thread

performs printing on the

background

.
The following pattern might be used for

background

printing:

```java
FutureTask<Boolean> future =
new FutureTask<Boolean>(
new Callable<Boolean>() {
public Boolean call() {
return textComponent.print(.....);
}
});
executor.execute(future);
```

**Parameters:**
- headerFormat

- the text, in

MessageFormat

, to be
used as the header, or

null

for no header
- footerFormat

- the text, in

A

Keymap

lets an application bind key
strokes to actions.
In order to allow keymaps to be shared across multiple text components, they
can use actions that extend

TextAction

.

TextAction

can determine which

JTextComponent

most recently has or had focus and therefore is the subject of
the action (In the case that the

ActionEvent

sent to the action doesn't contain the target text component as its source).

The

Input Method Framework

lets text components interact with input methods, separate software
components that preprocess events to let users enter thousands of
different characters using keyboards with far fewer keys.

JTextComponent

is an

active client

of
the framework, so it implements the preferred user interface for interacting
with input methods. As a consequence, some key events do not reach the text
component because they are handled by an input method, and some text input
reaches the text component as committed text within an

InputMethodEvent

instead of as a key event.
The complete text input is the combination of the characters in

keyTyped

key events and committed text in input method events.

The AWT listener model lets applications attach event listeners to
components in order to bind events to actions. Swing encourages the
use of keymaps instead of listeners, but maintains compatibility
with listeners by giving the listeners a chance to steal an event
by consuming it.

Keyboard event and input method events are handled in the following stages,
with each stage capable of consuming the event:

Stages of keyboard and input method event handling

Stage

KeyEvent

InputMethodEvent

1.

input methods

(generated here)

2.

focus manager

3.

registered key listeners

registered input method listeners

4.

input method handling in JTextComponent

5.

keymap handling using the current keymap

6.

keyboard handling in JComponent (e.g. accelerators, component
navigation, etc.)

To maintain compatibility with applications that listen to key
events but are not aware of input method events, the input
method handling in stage 4 provides a compatibility mode for
components that do not process input method events. For these
components, the committed text is converted to keyTyped key events
and processed in the key event pipeline starting at stage 3
instead of in the input method event pipeline.

By default the component will create a keymap (named

DEFAULT_KEYMAP

)
that is shared by all JTextComponent instances as the default keymap.
Typically a look-and-feel implementation will install a different keymap
that resolves to the default keymap for those bindings not found in the
different keymap. The minimal bindings include:

- inserting content into the editor for the
printable keys.

removing content with the backspace and del
keys.

caret movement forward and backward

Model/View Split

The text components have a model-view split. A text component pulls
together the objects used to represent the model, view, and controller.
The text document model may be shared by other views which act as observers
of the model (e.g. a document may be shared by multiple components).

The model is defined by the

Document

interface.
This is intended to provide a flexible text storage mechanism
that tracks change during edits and can be extended to more sophisticated
models. The model interfaces are meant to capture the capabilities of
expression given by SGML, a system used to express a wide variety of
content.
Each modification to the document causes notification of the
details of the change to be sent to all observers in the form of a

DocumentEvent

which allows the views to stay up to date with the model.
This event is sent to observers that have implemented the

DocumentListener

interface and registered interest with the model being observed.

Location Information

The capability of determining the location of text in
the view is provided. There are two methods,

modelToView(int)

and

viewToModel(java.awt.Point)

for determining this information.

Undo/Redo support

Support for an edit history mechanism is provided to allow
undo/redo operations. The text component does not itself
provide the history buffer by default, but does provide
the

UndoableEdit

records that can be used in conjunction
with a history buffer to provide the undo/redo support.
The support is provided by the Document model, which allows
one to attach UndoableEditListener implementations.

Thread Safety

The swing text components provide some support of thread
safe operations. Because of the high level of configurability
of the text components, it is possible to circumvent the
protection provided. The protection primarily comes from
the model, so the documentation of

AbstractDocument

describes the assumptions of the protection provided.
The methods that are safe to call asynchronously are marked
with comments.

Newlines

For a discussion on how newlines are handled, see

DefaultEditorKit

.

Printing support

Several

print

methods are provided for basic
document printing. If more advanced printing is needed, use the

getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

method.

The

Input Method Framework

lets text components interact with input methods, separate software
components that preprocess events to let users enter thousands of
different characters using keyboards with far fewer keys.

component because they are handled by an input method, and some text input

keyTyped

key events and committed text in input method events.

interface.
This is intended to provide a flexible text storage mechanism
that tracks change during edits and can be extended to more sophisticated
models. The model interfaces are meant to capture the capabilities of
expression given by SGML, a system used to express a wide variety of
content.
Each modification to the document causes notification of the
details of the change to be sent to all observers in the form of a

DocumentEvent

which allows the views to stay up to date with the model.
This event is sent to observers that have implemented the

DocumentListener

interface and registered interest with the model being observed.

Location Information

The capability of determining the location of text in
the view is provided. There are two methods,

modelToView(int)

and

viewToModel(java.awt.Point)

for determining this information.

Undo/Redo support

Support for an edit history mechanism is provided to allow
undo/redo operations. The text component does not itself
provide the history buffer by default, but does provide
the

UndoableEdit

records that can be used in conjunction
with a history buffer to provide the undo/redo support.
The support is provided by the Document model, which allows
one to attach UndoableEditListener implementations.

Thread Safety

The swing text components provide some support of thread
safe operations. Because of the high level of configurability
of the text components, it is possible to circumvent the
protection provided. The protection primarily comes from
the model, so the documentation of

AbstractDocument

describes the assumptions of the protection provided.
The methods that are safe to call asynchronously are marked
with comments.

Newlines

For a discussion on how newlines are handled, see

DefaultEditorKit

.

Printing support

Several

print

methods are provided for basic
document printing. If more advanced printing is needed, use the

getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

method.

Keyboard event and input method events are handled in the following stages,
with each stage capable of consuming the event:

Stages of keyboard and input method event handling

Stage

KeyEvent

InputMethodEvent

1.

input methods

(generated here)

2.

focus manager

3.

registered key listeners

registered input method listeners

4.

input method handling in JTextComponent

5.

keymap handling using the current keymap

6.

keyboard handling in JComponent (e.g. accelerators, component
navigation, etc.)

To maintain compatibility with applications that listen to key
events but are not aware of input method events, the input
method handling in stage 4 provides a compatibility mode for
components that do not process input method events. For these
components, the committed text is converted to keyTyped key events
and processed in the key event pipeline starting at stage 3
instead of in the input method event pipeline.

By default the component will create a keymap (named

DEFAULT_KEYMAP

)
that is shared by all JTextComponent instances as the default keymap.
Typically a look-and-feel implementation will install a different keymap
that resolves to the default keymap for those bindings not found in the
different keymap. The minimal bindings include:

- inserting content into the editor for the
printable keys.

removing content with the backspace and del
keys.

caret movement forward and backward

Model/View Split

The text components have a model-view split. A text component pulls
together the objects used to represent the model, view, and controller.
The text document model may be shared by other views which act as observers
of the model (e.g. a document may be shared by multiple components).

The model is defined by the

Document

interface.
This is intended to provide a flexible text storage mechanism
that tracks change during edits and can be extended to more sophisticated
models. The model interfaces are meant to capture the capabilities of
expression given by SGML, a system used to express a wide variety of

- addCaretListener

```java
public void addCaretListener​(
CaretListener
listener)
```

Adds a caret listener for notification of any changes
to the caret.

**Parameters:** listener

- the listener to be added
**See Also:** CaretEvent

- removeCaretListener

```java
public void removeCaretListener​(
CaretListener
listener)
```

Removes a caret listener.

**Parameters:** listener

- the listener to be removed
**See Also:** CaretEvent

- getCaretListeners

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
CaretListener
[] getCaretListeners()
```

Returns an array of all the caret listeners
registered on this text component.

**Returns:** all of this component's

CaretListener

s
or an empty
array if no caret listeners are currently registered
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** addCaretListener(javax.swing.event.CaretListener)

,

removeCaretListener(javax.swing.event.CaretListener)

- fireCaretUpdate

```java
protected void fireCaretUpdate​(
CaretEvent
e)
```

Notifies all listeners that have registered interest for
notification on this event type. The event instance
is lazily created using the parameters passed into
the fire method. The listener list is processed in a
last-to-first manner.

**Parameters:** e

- the event
**See Also:** EventListenerList

- setDocument

```java
@BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="the text document model")
public void setDocument​(
Document
doc)
```

Associates the editor with a text document.
The currently registered factory is used to build a view for
the document, which gets displayed by the editor after revalidation.
A PropertyChange event ("document") is propagated to each listener.

**Parameters:** doc

- the document to display/edit
**See Also:** getDocument()

- getDocument

```java
public
Document
getDocument()
```

Fetches the model associated with the editor. This is
primarily for the UI to get at the minimal amount of
state required to be a text editor. Subclasses will
return the actual type of the model which will typically
be something that extends Document.

**Returns:** the model

- getActions

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
Action
[] getActions()
```

Fetches the command list for the editor. This is
the list of commands supported by the plugged-in UI
augmented by the collection of commands that the
editor itself supports. These are useful for binding
to events, such as in a keymap.

**Returns:** the command list

- setMargin

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="desired space between the border and text area")
public void setMargin​(
Insets
m)
```

Sets margin space between the text component's border
and its text. The text component's default

Border

object will use this value to create the proper margin.
However, if a non-default border is set on the text component,
it is that

Border

object's responsibility to create the
appropriate margin space (else this property will effectively
be ignored). This causes a redraw of the component.
A PropertyChange event ("margin") is sent to all listeners.

**Parameters:** m

- the space between the border and the text

- getMargin

```java
public
Insets
getMargin()
```

Returns the margin between the text component's border and
its text.

**Returns:** the margin

- setNavigationFilter

```java
public void setNavigationFilter​(
NavigationFilter
filter)
```

Sets the

NavigationFilter

.

NavigationFilter

is used by

DefaultCaret

and the default cursor movement
actions as a way to restrict the cursor movement.

**Parameters:** filter

- the filter
**Since:** 1.4

- getNavigationFilter

```java
public
NavigationFilter
getNavigationFilter()
```

Returns the

NavigationFilter

.

NavigationFilter

is used by

DefaultCaret

and the default cursor movement
actions as a way to restrict the cursor movement. A null return value
implies the cursor movement and selection should not be restricted.

**Returns:** the NavigationFilter
**Since:** 1.4

- getCaret

```java
public
Caret
getCaret()
```

Fetches the caret that allows text-oriented navigation over
the view.

**Returns:** the caret

- setCaret

```java
@BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="the caret used to select/navigate")
public void setCaret​(
Caret
c)
```

Sets the caret to be used. By default this will be set
by the UI that gets installed. This can be changed to
a custom caret if desired. Setting the caret results in a
PropertyChange event ("caret") being fired.

**Parameters:** c

- the caret
**See Also:** getCaret()

- getHighlighter

```java
public
Highlighter
getHighlighter()
```

Fetches the object responsible for making highlights.

**Returns:** the highlighter

- setHighlighter

```java
@BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="object responsible for background highlights")
public void setHighlighter​(
Highlighter
h)
```

Sets the highlighter to be used. By default this will be set
by the UI that gets installed. This can be changed to
a custom highlighter if desired. The highlighter can be set to

null

to disable it.
A PropertyChange event ("highlighter") is fired
when a new highlighter is installed.

**Parameters:** h

- the highlighter
**See Also:** getHighlighter()

- setKeymap

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="set of key event to action bindings to use")
public void setKeymap​(
Keymap
map)
```

Sets the keymap to use for binding events to
actions. Setting to

null

effectively disables
keyboard input.
A PropertyChange event ("keymap") is fired when a new keymap
is installed.

**Parameters:** map

- the keymap
**See Also:** getKeymap()

- setDragEnabled

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)
```

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
component's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the component's

TextUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
a selection and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
component's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:** b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

,

getDragEnabled()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDragEnabled

```java
public boolean getDragEnabled()
```

Returns whether or not automatic drag handling is enabled.

**Returns:** the value of the

dragEnabled

property
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setDragEnabled(boolean)

- setDropMode

```java
public final void setDropMode​(
DropMode
dropMode)
```

Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility,
the default for this property is

DropMode.USE_SELECTION

.
Usage of

DropMode.INSERT

is recommended, however,
for an improved user experience. It offers similar behavior of dropping
between text locations, but does so without affecting the actual text
selection and caret location.

JTextComponents

support the following drop modes:

- DropMode.USE_SELECTION
- DropMode.INSERT

The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a

TransferHandler

that accepts drops.

**Parameters:** dropMode

- the drop mode to use
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the drop mode is unsupported
or

null
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** getDropMode()

,

getDropLocation()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDropMode

```java
public final
DropMode
getDropMode()
```

Returns the drop mode for this component.

**Returns:** the drop mode for this component
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

- getDropLocation

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public final
JTextComponent.DropLocation
getDropLocation()
```

Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
or

null

if no location is to currently be shown.

This method is not meant for querying the drop location
from a

TransferHandler

, as the drop location is only
set after the

TransferHandler

's

canImport

has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown.

When this property changes, a property change event with
name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.

**Returns:** the drop location
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

,

TransferHandler.canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)

- getKeymap

```java
public
Keymap
getKeymap()
```

Fetches the keymap currently active in this text
component.

**Returns:** the keymap

- addKeymap

```java
public static
Keymap
addKeymap​(
String
nm,

Keymap
parent)
```

Adds a new keymap into the keymap hierarchy. Keymap bindings
resolve from bottom up so an attribute specified in a child
will override an attribute specified in the parent.

**Parameters:** nm

- the name of the keymap (must be unique within the
collection of named keymaps in the document); the name may
be

null

if the keymap is unnamed,
but the caller is responsible for managing the reference
returned as an unnamed keymap can't
be fetched by name
**Parameters:** parent

- the parent keymap; this may be

null

if
unspecified bindings need not be resolved in some other keymap
**Returns:** the keymap

- removeKeymap

```java
public static
Keymap
removeKeymap​(
String
nm)
```

Removes a named keymap previously added to the document. Keymaps
with

null

names may not be removed in this way.

**Parameters:** nm

- the name of the keymap to remove
**Returns:** the keymap that was removed

- getKeymap

```java
public static
Keymap
getKeymap​(
String
nm)
```

Fetches a named keymap previously added to the document.
This does not work with

null

-named keymaps.

**Parameters:** nm

- the name of the keymap
**Returns:** the keymap

- loadKeymap

```java
public static void loadKeymap​(
Keymap
map,

JTextComponent.KeyBinding
[] bindings,

Action
[] actions)
```

Loads a keymap with a bunch of
bindings. This can be used to take a static table of
definitions and load them into some keymap. The following
example illustrates an example of binding some keys to
the cut, copy, and paste actions associated with a
JTextComponent. A code fragment to accomplish
this might look as follows:

```java
static final JTextComponent.KeyBinding[] defaultBindings = {
new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(
KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_C, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),
DefaultEditorKit.copyAction),
new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(
KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_V, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),
DefaultEditorKit.pasteAction),
new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(
KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_X, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),
DefaultEditorKit.cutAction),
};

JTextComponent c = new JTextPane();
Keymap k = c.getKeymap();
JTextComponent.loadKeymap(k, defaultBindings, c.getActions());
```

The sets of bindings and actions may be empty but must be
non-

null

.

**Parameters:** map

- the keymap
**Parameters:** bindings

- the bindings
**Parameters:** actions

- the set of actions

- getCaretColor

```java
public
Color
getCaretColor()
```

Fetches the current color used to render the
caret.

**Returns:** the color

- setCaretColor

```java
@BeanProperty
(
preferred
=true,

description
="the color used to render the caret")
public void setCaretColor​(
Color
c)
```

Sets the current color used to render the caret.
Setting to

null

effectively restores the default color.
Setting the color results in a PropertyChange event ("caretColor")
being fired.

**Parameters:** c

- the color
**See Also:** getCaretColor()

- getSelectionColor

```java
public
Color
getSelectionColor()
```

Fetches the current color used to render the
selection.

**Returns:** the color

- setSelectionColor

```java
@BeanProperty
(
preferred
=true,

description
="color used to render selection background")
public void setSelectionColor​(
Color
c)
```

Sets the current color used to render the selection.
Setting the color to

null

is the same as setting

Color.white

. Setting the color results in a
PropertyChange event ("selectionColor").

**Parameters:** c

- the color
**See Also:** getSelectionColor()

- getSelectedTextColor

```java
public
Color
getSelectedTextColor()
```

Fetches the current color used to render the
selected text.

**Returns:** the color

- setSelectedTextColor

```java
@BeanProperty
(
preferred
=true,

description
="color used to render selected text")
public void setSelectedTextColor​(
Color
c)
```

Sets the current color used to render the selected text.
Setting the color to

null

is the same as

Color.black

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="accelerator character used to grab focus")
public void setFocusAccelerator​(char aKey)
```

Sets the key accelerator that will cause the receiving text
component to get the focus. The accelerator will be the
key combination of the platform-specific modifier key and
the character given (converted to upper case). For example,
the ALT key is used as a modifier on Windows and the CTRL+ALT
combination is used on Mac. By default, there is no focus
accelerator key. Any previous key accelerator setting will be
superseded. A '\0' key setting will be registered, and has the
effect of turning off the focus accelerator. When the new key
is set, a PropertyChange event (FOCUS_ACCELERATOR_KEY) will be fired.

**Parameters:** aKey

- the key
**See Also:** getFocusAccelerator()

- getFocusAccelerator

```java
public char getFocusAccelerator()
```

Returns the key accelerator that will cause the receiving
text component to get the focus. Return '\0' if no focus
accelerator has been set.

**Returns:** the key

- read

```java
public void read​(
Reader
in,

Object
desc)
throws
IOException
```

Initializes from a stream. This creates a
model of the type appropriate for the component
and initializes the model from the stream.
By default this will load the model as plain
text. Previous contents of the model are discarded.

**Parameters:** in

- the stream to read from
**Parameters:** desc

- an object describing the stream; this
might be a string, a File, a URL, etc. Some kinds
of documents (such as html for example) might be
able to make use of this information; if non-

null

,
it is added as a property of the document
**Throws:** IOException

- setCaretPosition

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="the caret position")
public void setCaretPosition​(int position)
```

Sets the position of the text insertion caret for the

TextComponent

. Note that the caret tracks change,
so this may move if the underlying text of the component is changed.
If the document is

null

, does nothing. The position
must be between 0 and the length of the component's text or else
an exception is thrown.

**Parameters:** position

- the position
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the value supplied
for

position

is less than zero or greater
than the component's text length

- getCaretPosition

```java
public int getCaretPosition()

description
="the text of this component")
public void setText​(
String
t)
```

Sets the text of this

TextComponent

to the specified text. If the text is

null

or empty, has the effect of simply deleting the old text.
When text has been inserted, the resulting caret location
is determined by the implementation of the caret class.

Note that text is not a bound property, so no

PropertyChangeEvent

is fired when it changes. To listen for changes to the text,
use

DocumentListener

.

**Parameters:** t

- the new text to be set
**See Also:** getText(int, int)

,

DefaultCaret

- getText

```java
public
String
getText()
```

Returns the text contained in this

TextComponent

.
If the underlying document is

null

,
will give a

NullPointerException

.

Note that text is not a bound property, so no

PropertyChangeEvent

is fired when it changes. To listen for changes to the text,
use

DocumentListener

.

**Returns:** the text
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the document is

null
**See Also:** setText(java.lang.String)

- getSelectedText

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
String
getSelectedText()
```

Returns the selected text contained in this

TextComponent

. If the selection is

null

or the document empty, returns

null

.

**Returns:** the text
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the selection doesn't
have a valid mapping into the document for some reason
**See Also:** setText(java.lang.String)

- isEditable

```java
public boolean isEditable()
```

Returns the boolean indicating whether this

TextComponent

is editable or not.

**Returns:** the boolean value
**See Also:** setEditable(boolean)

- setEditable

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="specifies if the text can be edited")
public void setEditable​(boolean b)
```

Sets the specified boolean to indicate whether or not this

TextComponent

should be editable.
A PropertyChange event ("editable") is fired when the
state is changed.

**Parameters:** b

- the boolean to be set
**See Also:** isEditable()

- getSelectionStart

```java
public int getSelectionStart()
```

Returns the selected text's start position. Return 0 for an
empty document, or the value of dot if no selection.

**Returns:** the start position ≥ 0

- setSelectionStart

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="starting location of the selection.")
public void setSelectionStart​(int selectionStart)
```

Sets the selection start to the specified position. The new
starting point is constrained to be before or at the current
selection end.

This is available for backward compatibility to code
that called this method on

java.awt.TextComponent

.
This is implemented to forward to the

Caret

implementation which is where the actual selection is maintained.

**Parameters:** selectionStart

- the start position of the text ≥ 0

- getSelectionEnd

```java
public int getSelectionEnd()
```

Returns the selected text's end position. Return 0 if the document
is empty, or the value of dot if there is no selection.

**Returns:** the end position ≥ 0

- setSelectionEnd

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="ending location of the selection.")
public void setSelectionEnd​(int selectionEnd)
```

Sets the selection end to the specified position. The new
end point is constrained to be at or after the current
selection start.

This is available for backward compatibility to code
that called this method on

java.awt.TextComponent

.
This is implemented to forward to the

Caret

implementation which is where the actual selection is maintained.

**Parameters:** selectionEnd

- the end position of the text ≥ 0

- select

```java
public void select​(int selectionStart,
int selectionEnd)
```

Selects the text between the specified start and end positions.

This method sets the start and end positions of the
selected text, enforcing the restriction that the start position
must be greater than or equal to zero. The end position must be
greater than or equal to the start position, and less than or
equal to the length of the text component's text.

If the caller supplies values that are inconsistent or out of
bounds, the method enforces these constraints silently, and
without failure. Specifically, if the start position or end
position is greater than the length of the text, it is reset to
equal the text length. If the start position is less than zero,
it is reset to zero, and if the end position is less than the
start position, it is reset to the start position.

This call is provided for backward compatibility.
It is routed to a call to

setCaretPosition

followed by a call to

moveCaretPosition

.
The preferred way to manage selection is by calling
those methods directly.

**Parameters:** selectionStart

- the start position of the text
**Parameters:** selectionEnd

- the end position of the text
**See Also:** setCaretPosition(int)

,

moveCaretPosition(int)

- selectAll

```java
public void selectAll()
```

Selects all the text in the

TextComponent

.
Does nothing on a

null

or empty document.

- getToolTipText

```java
public
String
getToolTipText​(
MouseEvent
event)
```

Returns the string to be used as the tooltip for

event

.
This will return one of:

- If

setToolTipText

has been invoked with a
non-

null

value, it will be returned, otherwise

The value from invoking

getToolTipText

on
the UI will be returned.

By default

JTextComponent

does not register
itself with the

ToolTipManager

.
This means that tooltips will NOT be shown from the

TextUI

unless

registerComponent

has
been invoked on the

ToolTipManager

.

**Overrides:** getToolTipText

in class

JComponent
**Parameters:** event

- the event in question
**Returns:** the string to be used as the tooltip for

event
**See Also:** JComponent.setToolTipText(java.lang.String)

,

TextUI.getToolTipText(javax.swing.text.JTextComponent, java.awt.Point)

- getPreferredScrollableViewportSize

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
Dimension
getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()
```

Returns the preferred size of the viewport for a view component.
This is implemented to do the default behavior of returning
the preferred size of the component.

**Specified by:** getPreferredScrollableViewportSize

in interface

Scrollable
**Returns:** the

preferredSize

of a

JViewport

whose view is this

Scrollable
**See Also:** JComponent.getPreferredSize()

- getScrollableUnitIncrement

```java
public int getScrollableUnitIncrement​(
Rectangle
visibleRect,
int orientation,
int direction)
```

Components that display logical rows or columns should compute
the scroll increment that will completely expose one new row
or column, depending on the value of orientation. Ideally,
components should handle a partially exposed row or column by
returning the distance required to completely expose the item.

The default implementation of this is to simply return 10% of
the visible area. Subclasses are likely to be able to provide
a much more reasonable value.

**Specified by:** getScrollableUnitIncrement

in interface

Scrollable
**Parameters:** visibleRect

- the view area visible within the viewport
**Parameters:** orientation

- either

SwingConstants.VERTICAL

or

SwingConstants.HORIZONTAL
**Parameters:** direction

- less than zero to scroll up/left, greater than
zero for down/right
**Returns:** the "unit" increment for scrolling in the specified direction
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- for an invalid orientation
**See Also:** JScrollBar.setUnitIncrement(int)

- getScrollableBlockIncrement

```java
public int getScrollableBlockIncrement​(
Rectangle
visibleRect,
int orientation,
int direction)
```

Components that display logical rows or columns should compute
the scroll increment that will completely expose one block
of rows or columns, depending on the value of orientation.

The default implementation of this is to simply return the visible
area. Subclasses will likely be able to provide a much more
reasonable value.

**Specified by:** getScrollableBlockIncrement

in interface

Scrollable
**Parameters:** visibleRect

- the view area visible within the viewport
**Parameters:** orientation

- either

SwingConstants.VERTICAL

or

SwingConstants.HORIZONTAL
**Parameters:** direction

- less than zero to scroll up/left, greater than zero
for down/right
**Returns:** the "block" increment for scrolling in the specified direction
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- for an invalid orientation
**See Also:** JScrollBar.setBlockIncrement(int)

- getScrollableTracksViewportWidth

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportWidth()
```

Returns true if a viewport should always force the width of this

Scrollable

to match the width of the viewport.
For example a normal text view that supported line wrapping
would return true here, since it would be undesirable for
wrapped lines to disappear beyond the right
edge of the viewport. Note that returning true for a

Scrollable

whose ancestor is a

JScrollPane

effectively disables horizontal scrolling.

Scrolling containers, like

JViewport

,
will use this method each time they are validated.

**Specified by:** getScrollableTracksViewportWidth

in interface

Scrollable
**Returns:** true if a viewport should force the

Scrollable

s
width to match its own

- getScrollableTracksViewportHeight

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportHeight()
```

Returns true if a viewport should always force the height of this

Scrollable

to match the height of the viewport.
For example a columnar text view that flowed text in left to
right columns could effectively disable vertical scrolling by
returning true here.

Scrolling containers, like

JViewport

,
will use this method each time they are validated.

**Specified by:** getScrollableTracksViewportHeight

in interface

Scrollable
**Returns:** true if a viewport should force the Scrollables height
to match its own

- print

```java
public boolean print()
throws
PrinterException
```

A convenience print method that displays a print dialog, and then
prints this

JTextComponent

in

interactive

mode with no
header or footer text. Note: this method
blocks until printing is done.

Note: In

headless

mode, no dialogs will be shown.

This method calls the full featured

print

method to perform printing.

**Returns:** true

, unless printing is canceled by the user

boolean showPrintDialog,

PrintService
service,

PrintRequestAttributeSet
attributes,
boolean interactive)
throws
PrinterException
```

Prints the content of this

JTextComponent

. Note: this method
blocks until printing is done.

Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests

Strings

from the formats, providing a single item which may be
included in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the
current page number.

showPrintDialog boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether
a print dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user
may use the dialog to change printing attributes or even cancel the
print.

service

allows you to provide the initial

PrintService

for the print dialog, or to specify

PrintService

to print to when the dialog is not shown.

attributes

can be used to provide the
initial values for the print dialog, or to supply any needed
attributes when the dialog is not shown.

attributes

can
be used to control how the job will print, for example

duplex

or

single-sided

.

interactive boolean

parameter allows you to specify
whether to perform printing in

interactive

mode. If

true

, a progress dialog, with an abort option,
is displayed for the duration of printing. This dialog is

modal

when

print

is invoked on the

Event Dispatch
Thread

and

non-modal

otherwise.

Warning

:
calling this method on the

Event Dispatch Thread

with

interactive false

blocks

all

events, including repaints, from
being processed until printing is complete. It is only
recommended when printing from an application with no
visible GUI.

Note: In

headless

mode,

showPrintDialog

and

interactive

parameters are ignored and no dialogs are
shown.

This method ensures the

document

is not mutated during printing.
To indicate it visually,

setEnabled(false)

is set for the
duration of printing.

This method uses

getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

to render document content.

This method is thread-safe, although most Swing methods are not. Please
see

Concurrency in Swing

for more information.

Sample Usage

. This code snippet shows a cross-platform print
dialog and then prints the

JTextComponent

in

interactive

mode
unless the user cancels the dialog:

```java
textComponent.print(new MessageFormat("My text component header"),
new MessageFormat("Footer. Page - {0}"), true, null, null, true);
```

Executing this code off the

Event Dispatch Thread

performs printing on the

background

.
The following pattern might be used for

background

printing:

```java

new Callable<Boolean>() {
public Boolean call() {
return textComponent.print(.....);
}
});
executor.execute(future);
```

- getPrintable

```java
public
Printable
getPrintable​(
MessageFormat
headerFormat,

MessageFormat
footerFormat)
```

Returns a

Printable

to use for printing the content of this

JTextComponent

. The returned

Printable

prints
the document as it looks on the screen except being reformatted
to fit the paper.
The returned

Printable

can be wrapped inside another

Printable

in order to create complex reports and
documents.

The returned

Printable

shares the

document

with this

JTextComponent

. It is the responsibility of the developer to
ensure that the

document

is not mutated while this

Printable

is used. Printing behavior is undefined when the

document

is
mutated during printing.

Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests

Strings

from the formats, providing a single item which may be
included in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the
current page number.

The returned

Printable

when printed, formats the
document content appropriately for the page size. For correct
line wrapping the

imageable width

of all pages must be the
same. See

(
bound
=false)
public
CaretListener
[] getCaretListeners()
```

Returns an array of all the caret listeners
registered on this text component.

**Returns:** all of this component's

CaretListener

s
or an empty
array if no caret listeners are currently registered
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** addCaretListener(javax.swing.event.CaretListener)

,

removeCaretListener(javax.swing.event.CaretListener)

- fireCaretUpdate

```java
protected void fireCaretUpdate​(
CaretEvent
e)
```

Notifies all listeners that have registered interest for
notification on this event type. The event instance
is lazily created using the parameters passed into
the fire method. The listener list is processed in a
last-to-first manner.

**Parameters:** e

- the event
**See Also:** EventListenerList

- setDocument

```java
@BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="the text document model")
public void setDocument​(
Document
doc)
```

Associates the editor with a text document.
The currently registered factory is used to build a view for
the document, which gets displayed by the editor after revalidation.
A PropertyChange event ("document") is propagated to each listener.

**Parameters:** doc

- the document to display/edit
**See Also:** getDocument()

- getDocument

```java
public
Document
getDocument()
```

Fetches the model associated with the editor. This is
primarily for the UI to get at the minimal amount of
state required to be a text editor. Subclasses will
return the actual type of the model which will typically
be something that extends Document.

**Returns:** the model

- getActions

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
Action
[] getActions()
```

Fetches the command list for the editor. This is
the list of commands supported by the plugged-in UI

editor itself supports. These are useful for binding
to events, such as in a keymap.

**Returns:** the command list

- setMargin

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="desired space between the border and text area")
public void setMargin​(
Insets
m)
```

Sets margin space between the text component's border
and its text. The text component's default

Border

object will use this value to create the proper margin.
However, if a non-default border is set on the text component,
it is that

Border

object's responsibility to create the
appropriate margin space (else this property will effectively
be ignored). This causes a redraw of the component.
A PropertyChange event ("margin") is sent to all listeners.

**Parameters:** m

- the space between the border and the text

- getMargin

```java
public
Insets
getMargin()
```

Returns the margin between the text component's border and
its text.

**Returns:** the margin

actions as a way to restrict the cursor movement.

**Parameters:** filter

- the filter
**Since:** 1.4

- getNavigationFilter

```java
public
NavigationFilter
getNavigationFilter()
```

Returns the

NavigationFilter

.

NavigationFilter

is used by

DefaultCaret

and the default cursor movement
actions as a way to restrict the cursor movement. A null return value
implies the cursor movement and selection should not be restricted.

**Returns:** the NavigationFilter
**Since:** 1.4

- getCaret

```java
public
Caret
getCaret()
```

Fetches the caret that allows text-oriented navigation over
the view.

**Returns:** the caret

- setCaret

```java
@BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="the caret used to select/navigate")
public void setCaret​(
Caret
c)
```

Sets the caret to be used. By default this will be set
by the UI that gets installed. This can be changed to
a custom caret if desired. Setting the caret results in a
PropertyChange event ("caret") being fired.

**Parameters:** c

- the caret
**See Also:** getCaret()

- getHighlighter

```java
public
Highlighter
getHighlighter()
```

Fetches the object responsible for making highlights.

**Returns:** the highlighter

- setHighlighter

```java
@BeanProperty
(
expert
=true,

description
="object responsible for background highlights")
public void setHighlighter​(
Highlighter
h)
```

Sets the highlighter to be used. By default this will be set
by the UI that gets installed. This can be changed to
a custom highlighter if desired. The highlighter can be set to

null

to disable it.
A PropertyChange event ("highlighter") is fired
when a new highlighter is installed.

**Parameters:** h

- the highlighter
**See Also:** getHighlighter()

- setKeymap

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="set of key event to action bindings to use")
public void setKeymap​(
Keymap
map)
```

Sets the keymap to use for binding events to
actions. Setting to

null

effectively disables
keyboard input.
A PropertyChange event ("keymap") is fired when a new keymap
is installed.

**Parameters:** map

- the keymap
**See Also:** getKeymap()

- setDragEnabled

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)
```

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
component's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the component's

TextUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
a selection and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
component's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:** b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

,

getDragEnabled()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDragEnabled

```java
public boolean getDragEnabled()
```

Returns whether or not automatic drag handling is enabled.

**Returns:** the value of the

dragEnabled

property
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** setDragEnabled(boolean)

- setDropMode

```java
public final void setDropMode​(
DropMode
dropMode)
```

Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility,
the default for this property is

DropMode.USE_SELECTION

.
Usage of

DropMode.INSERT

is recommended, however,
for an improved user experience. It offers similar behavior of dropping
between text locations, but does so without affecting the actual text
selection and caret location.

JTextComponents

support the following drop modes:

- DropMode.USE_SELECTION
- DropMode.INSERT

The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a

TransferHandler

that accepts drops.

**Parameters:** dropMode

- the drop mode to use
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the drop mode is unsupported
or

null
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** getDropMode()

,

getDropLocation()

,

JComponent.setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)

,

TransferHandler

- getDropMode

```java
public final
DropMode
getDropMode()
```

Returns the drop mode for this component.

**Returns:** the drop mode for this component
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

- getDropLocation

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public final
JTextComponent.DropLocation
getDropLocation()
```

Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
or

null

if no location is to currently be shown.

This method is not meant for querying the drop location
from a

TransferHandler

, as the drop location is only
set after the

TransferHandler

's

canImport

has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown.

When this property changes, a property change event with
name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.

**Returns:** the drop location
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** setDropMode(javax.swing.DropMode)

,

TransferHandler.canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)

- getKeymap

```java
public
Keymap
getKeymap()
```

Fetches the keymap currently active in this text
component.

**Returns:** the keymap

- addKeymap

```java
public static
Keymap
addKeymap​(
String
nm,

Keymap
parent)
```

Adds a new keymap into the keymap hierarchy. Keymap bindings
resolve from bottom up so an attribute specified in a child
will override an attribute specified in the parent.

**Parameters:** nm

- the name of the keymap (must be unique within the
collection of named keymaps in the document); the name may
be

null

if the keymap is unnamed,
but the caller is responsible for managing the reference
returned as an unnamed keymap can't
be fetched by name
**Parameters:** parent

- the parent keymap; this may be

null

if
unspecified bindings need not be resolved in some other keymap
**Returns:** the keymap

- removeKeymap

```java
public static
Keymap
removeKeymap​(
String
nm)
```

Removes a named keymap previously added to the document. Keymaps
with

null

names may not be removed in this way.

**Parameters:** nm

- the name of the keymap to remove
**Returns:** the keymap that was removed

- getKeymap

```java
public static
Keymap
getKeymap​(
String
nm)
```

Fetches a named keymap previously added to the document.
This does not work with

null

-named keymaps.

**Parameters:** nm

- the name of the keymap
**Returns:** the keymap

- loadKeymap

```java
public static void loadKeymap​(
Keymap
map,

JTextComponent.KeyBinding
[] bindings,

Action
[] actions)
```

Loads a keymap with a bunch of
bindings. This can be used to take a static table of
definitions and load them into some keymap. The following
example illustrates an example of binding some keys to
the cut, copy, and paste actions associated with a
JTextComponent. A code fragment to accomplish
this might look as follows:

```java
static final JTextComponent.KeyBinding[] defaultBindings = {
new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(
KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_C, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),
DefaultEditorKit.copyAction),
new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(
KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_V, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),
DefaultEditorKit.pasteAction),
new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(
KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_X, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),
DefaultEditorKit.cutAction),
};

JTextComponent c = new JTextPane();
Keymap k = c.getKeymap();
JTextComponent.loadKeymap(k, defaultBindings, c.getActions());
```

The sets of bindings and actions may be empty but must be
non-

null

.

- replaceSelection

```java
public void replaceSelection​(
String
content)
```

Replaces the currently selected content with new content
represented by the given string. If there is no selection
this amounts to an insert of the given text. If there
is no replacement text this amounts to a removal of the

Returns the selected text's start position. Return 0 for an
empty document, or the value of dot if no selection.

**Returns:** the start position ≥ 0

- setSelectionStart

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="starting location of the selection.")
public void setSelectionStart​(int selectionStart)
```

Sets the selection start to the specified position. The new
starting point is constrained to be before or at the current
selection end.

This is available for backward compatibility to code
that called this method on

java.awt.TextComponent

.
This is implemented to forward to the

Caret

implementation which is where the actual selection is maintained.

**Parameters:** selectionStart

- the start position of the text ≥ 0

- getSelectionEnd

```java
public int getSelectionEnd()
```

Returns the selected text's end position. Return 0 if the document
is empty, or the value of dot if there is no selection.

**Returns:** the end position ≥ 0

- setSelectionEnd

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="ending location of the selection.")
public void setSelectionEnd​(int selectionEnd)
```

Sets the selection end to the specified position. The new
end point is constrained to be at or after the current
selection start.

This is available for backward compatibility to code
that called this method on

java.awt.TextComponent

.
This is implemented to forward to the

Caret

implementation which is where the actual selection is maintained.

**Parameters:** selectionEnd

- the end position of the text ≥ 0

- select

```java
public void select​(int selectionStart,
int selectionEnd)
```

Selects the text between the specified start and end positions.

This method sets the start and end positions of the
selected text, enforcing the restriction that the start position
must be greater than or equal to zero. The end position must be
greater than or equal to the start position, and less than or
equal to the length of the text component's text.

If the caller supplies values that are inconsistent or out of
bounds, the method enforces these constraints silently, and
without failure. Specifically, if the start position or end
position is greater than the length of the text, it is reset to
equal the text length. If the start position is less than zero,
it is reset to zero, and if the end position is less than the
start position, it is reset to the start position.

This call is provided for backward compatibility.
It is routed to a call to

setCaretPosition

followed by a call to

moveCaretPosition

.
The preferred way to manage selection is by calling
those methods directly.

**Parameters:** selectionStart

- the start position of the text
**Parameters:** selectionEnd

- the end position of the text
**See Also:** setCaretPosition(int)

,

moveCaretPosition(int)

- selectAll

```java
public void selectAll()
```

Selects all the text in the

TextComponent

.
Does nothing on a

null

or empty document.

- getToolTipText

```java
public
String
getToolTipText​(
MouseEvent
event)
```

Returns the string to be used as the tooltip for

event

.
This will return one of:

- If

setToolTipText

has been invoked with a
non-

null

value, it will be returned, otherwise

The value from invoking

getToolTipText

on
the UI will be returned.

By default

JTextComponent

does not register
itself with the

ToolTipManager

.
This means that tooltips will NOT be shown from the

TextUI

unless

registerComponent

has
been invoked on the

ToolTipManager

.

**Overrides:** getToolTipText

in class

JComponent
**Parameters:** event

- the event in question
**Returns:** the string to be used as the tooltip for

event
**See Also:** JComponent.setToolTipText(java.lang.String)

,

- getPreferredScrollableViewportSize

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
Dimension
getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()
```

Returns the preferred size of the viewport for a view component.
This is implemented to do the default behavior of returning
the preferred size of the component.

**Specified by:** getPreferredScrollableViewportSize

in interface

Scrollable
**Returns:** the

preferredSize

of a

JViewport

whose view is this

Scrollable
**See Also:** JComponent.getPreferredSize()

- getScrollableUnitIncrement

```java
public int getScrollableUnitIncrement​(
Rectangle
visibleRect,
int orientation,
int direction)
```

Components that display logical rows or columns should compute
the scroll increment that will completely expose one new row
or column, depending on the value of orientation. Ideally,
components should handle a partially exposed row or column by
returning the distance required to completely expose the item.

The default implementation of this is to simply return 10% of
the visible area. Subclasses are likely to be able to provide
a much more reasonable value.

**Specified by:** getScrollableUnitIncrement

in interface

Scrollable
**Parameters:** visibleRect

- the view area visible within the viewport
**Parameters:** orientation

- either

SwingConstants.VERTICAL

or

SwingConstants.HORIZONTAL
**Parameters:** direction

- less than zero to scroll up/left, greater than
zero for down/right
**Returns:** the "unit" increment for scrolling in the specified direction
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- for an invalid orientation
**See Also:** JScrollBar.setUnitIncrement(int)

- getScrollableBlockIncrement

```java
public int getScrollableBlockIncrement​(
Rectangle
visibleRect,
int orientation,
int direction)
```

Components that display logical rows or columns should compute
the scroll increment that will completely expose one block
of rows or columns, depending on the value of orientation.

The default implementation of this is to simply return the visible
area. Subclasses will likely be able to provide a much more
reasonable value.

**Specified by:** getScrollableBlockIncrement

in interface

Scrollable
**Parameters:** visibleRect

- the view area visible within the viewport
**Parameters:** orientation

- either

SwingConstants.VERTICAL

or

SwingConstants.HORIZONTAL
**Parameters:** direction

- less than zero to scroll up/left, greater than zero
for down/right
**Returns:** the "block" increment for scrolling in the specified direction
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- for an invalid orientation
**See Also:** JScrollBar.setBlockIncrement(int)

- getScrollableTracksViewportWidth

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportWidth()
```

Returns true if a viewport should always force the width of this

Scrollable

to match the width of the viewport.
For example a normal text view that supported line wrapping
would return true here, since it would be undesirable for
wrapped lines to disappear beyond the right
edge of the viewport. Note that returning true for a

Scrollable

whose ancestor is a

JScrollPane

effectively disables horizontal scrolling.

Scrolling containers, like

JViewport

,
will use this method each time they are validated.

**Specified by:** getScrollableTracksViewportWidth

in interface

Scrollable
**Returns:** true if a viewport should force the

Scrollable

s
width to match its own

- getScrollableTracksViewportHeight

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportHeight()
```

Returns true if a viewport should always force the height of this

Scrollable

to match the height of the viewport.
For example a columnar text view that flowed text in left to
right columns could effectively disable vertical scrolling by
returning true here.

Scrolling containers, like

JViewport

,
will use this method each time they are validated.

**Specified by:** getScrollableTracksViewportHeight

in interface

Scrollable
**Returns:** true if a viewport should force the Scrollables height
to match its own

- print

```java
public boolean print()
throws
PrinterException
```

A convenience print method that displays a print dialog, and then
prints this

JTextComponent

in

interactive

mode with no
header or footer text. Note: this method
blocks until printing is done.

Note: In

headless

mode, no dialogs will be shown.

This method calls the full featured

print

method to perform printing.

**Returns:** true

, unless printing is canceled by the user

PrintService
service,

PrintRequestAttributeSet
attributes,
boolean interactive)
throws
PrinterException
```

Prints the content of this

JTextComponent

. Note: this method
blocks until printing is done.

Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests

Strings

from the formats, providing a single item which may be
included in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the
current page number.

showPrintDialog boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether
a print dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user
may use the dialog to change printing attributes or even cancel the
print.

service

allows you to provide the initial

PrintService

for the print dialog, or to specify

PrintService

to print to when the dialog is not shown.

attributes

can be used to provide the
initial values for the print dialog, or to supply any needed
attributes when the dialog is not shown.

attributes

can
be used to control how the job will print, for example

duplex

or

single-sided

.

interactive boolean

parameter allows you to specify
whether to perform printing in

interactive

mode. If

true

, a progress dialog, with an abort option,
is displayed for the duration of printing. This dialog is

modal

when

print

is invoked on the

Event Dispatch
Thread

and

non-modal

otherwise.

Warning

:
calling this method on the

Event Dispatch Thread

with

interactive false

blocks

all

events, including repaints, from
being processed until printing is complete. It is only
recommended when printing from an application with no
visible GUI.

Note: In

headless

mode,

showPrintDialog

and

interactive

parameters are ignored and no dialogs are
shown.

This method ensures the

document

is not mutated during printing.
To indicate it visually,

setEnabled(false)

is set for the
duration of printing.

This method uses

getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

to render document content.

This method is thread-safe, although most Swing methods are not. Please
see

Concurrency in Swing

for more information.

Sample Usage

. This code snippet shows a cross-platform print
dialog and then prints the

JTextComponent

in

interactive

mode
unless the user cancels the dialog:

```java
textComponent.print(new MessageFormat("My text component header"),
new MessageFormat("Footer. Page - {0}"), true, null, null, true);
```

Executing this code off the

Event Dispatch Thread

performs printing on the

background

.
The following pattern might be used for

background

printing:

```java
FutureTask<Boolean> future =
new FutureTask<Boolean>(
new Callable<Boolean>() {
public Boolean call() {
return textComponent.print(.....);
}
});
executor.execute(future);
```

**Parameters:** headerFormat

- the text, in

MessageFormat

, to be
used as the header, or

null

for no header
**Parameters:** footerFormat

- the text, in

MessageFormat

, to be
used as the footer, or

null

for no footer
**Parameters:** showPrintDialog

-

true

to display a print dialog,

false

otherwise
**Parameters:** service

- initial

PrintService

, or

null

for the
default
**Parameters:** attributes

- the job attributes to be applied to the print job, or

null

for none
**Parameters:** interactive

- whether to print in an interactive mode
**Returns:** true

, unless printing is canceled by the user
**Throws:** PrinterException

- if an error in the print system causes the job
to be aborted
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if this thread is not allowed to
initiate a print job request

- getPrintable

```java
public
Printable
getPrintable​(
MessageFormat
headerFormat,

MessageFormat
footerFormat)
```

Returns a

Printable

to use for printing the content of this

JTextComponent

. The returned

Printable

prints
the document as it looks on the screen except being reformatted
to fit the paper.
The returned

Printable

can be wrapped inside another

Printable

in order to create complex reports and
documents.

The returned

Printable

shares the

document

with this

JTextComponent

. It is the responsibility of the developer to
ensure that the

document

is not mutated while this

Printable

is used. Printing behavior is undefined when the

document

is
mutated during printing.

Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests

Strings

from the formats, providing a single item which may be
included in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the
current page number.

The returned

Printable

when printed, formats the
document content appropriately for the page size. For correct
line wrapping the

imageable width

of all pages must be the
same. See

PageFormat.getImageableWidth()

.

This method is thread-safe, although most Swing methods are not. Please
see

Concurrency in Swing

for more information.

The returned

Printable

can be printed on any thread.

This implementation returned

Printable

performs all painting on
the

public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)
```

Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
drag handling, this property should be set to

true

, and the
component's

TransferHandler

needs to be

non-null

.
The default value of the

dragEnabled

property is

false

.

The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the component's

TextUI

. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
feels (including those that subclass

BasicLookAndFeel

) begin a
drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
a selection and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to

true

can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
begin a drag and drop operation by calling

exportAsDrag

on the
component's

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:** b

- whether or not to enable automatic drag handling
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true

select

```java
public void select​(int selectionStart,

```

Selects the text between the specified start and end positions.

This method sets the start and end positions of the
selected text, enforcing the restriction that the start position
must be greater than or equal to zero. The end position must be
greater than or equal to the start position, and less than or
equal to the length of the text component's text.

If the caller supplies values that are inconsistent or out of
bounds, the method enforces these constraints silently, and
without failure. Specifically, if the start position or end
position is greater than the length of the text, it is reset to
equal the text length. If the start position is less than zero,
it is reset to zero, and if the end position is less than the
start position, it is reset to the start position.

This call is provided for backward compatibility.
It is routed to a call to

Prints the content of this

JTextComponent

. Note: this method
blocks until printing is done.

Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests

Strings

from the formats, providing a single item which may be
included in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the
current page number.

showPrintDialog boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether
a print dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user
may use the dialog to change printing attributes or even cancel the
print.

service

allows you to provide the initial

PrintService

for the print dialog, or to specify

PrintService

to print to when the dialog is not shown.

attributes

can be used to provide the
initial values for the print dialog, or to supply any needed
attributes when the dialog is not shown.

attributes

can
be used to control how the job will print, for example

duplex

or

single-sided

.

interactive boolean

parameter allows you to specify
whether to perform printing in

interactive

mode. If

true

, a progress dialog, with an abort option,
is displayed for the duration of printing. This dialog is

modal

when

print

is invoked on the

Event Dispatch
Thread

and

non-modal

otherwise.

Warning

:
calling this method on the

Event Dispatch Thread

with

interactive false

blocks

all

events, including repaints, from
being processed until printing is complete. It is only
recommended when printing from an application with no
visible GUI.

Note: In

headless

mode,

showPrintDialog

and

interactive

parameters are ignored and no dialogs are
shown.

This method ensures the

document

is not mutated during printing.
To indicate it visually,

setEnabled(false)

is set for the
duration of printing.

This method uses

getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

to render document content.

This method is thread-safe, although most Swing methods are not. Please
see

Concurrency in Swing

for more information.

Sample Usage

. This code snippet shows a cross-platform print
dialog and then prints the

JTextComponent

in

interactive

mode
unless the user cancels the dialog:

```java
textComponent.print(new MessageFormat("My text component header"),
new MessageFormat("Footer. Page - {0}"), true, null, null, true);
```

Executing this code off the

Event Dispatch Thread

performs printing on the

background

.
The following pattern might be used for

background

printing:

```java

new FutureTask<Boolean>(
new Callable<Boolean>() {
public Boolean call() {
return textComponent.print(.....);
}
});
executor.execute(future);
```

null

for no footer
**Parameters:** showPrintDialog

-

true

false

otherwise
**Parameters:** service

- initial

PrintService

, or

null

for the
default
**Parameters:** attributes

- the job attributes to be applied to the print job, or

null

Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing

MessageFormat

arguments. The printing code requests

Strings

from the formats, providing a single item which may be
included in the formatted string: an

Integer

representing the
current page number.

showPrintDialog boolean

parameter allows you to specify whether
a print dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user
may use the dialog to change printing attributes or even cancel the
print.

service

allows you to provide the initial

PrintService

for the print dialog, or to specify

PrintService

to print to when the dialog is not shown.

attributes

can be used to provide the
initial values for the print dialog, or to supply any needed
attributes when the dialog is not shown.

attributes

can
be used to control how the job will print, for example

duplex

or

single-sided

.

interactive boolean

parameter allows you to specify
whether to perform printing in

interactive

mode. If

true

, a progress dialog, with an abort option,
is displayed for the duration of printing. This dialog is

modal

when

print

is invoked on the

Event Dispatch
Thread

and

non-modal

otherwise.

Warning

:
calling this method on the

Event Dispatch Thread

with

interactive false

blocks

all

events, including repaints, from
being processed until printing is complete. It is only
recommended when printing from an application with no
visible GUI.

Note: In

headless

mode,

showPrintDialog

and

interactive

parameters are ignored and no dialogs are
shown.

This method ensures the

document

is not mutated during printing.
To indicate it visually,

setEnabled(false)

is set for the
duration of printing.

This method uses

getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)

to render document content.
