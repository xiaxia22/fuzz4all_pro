# Interface ProcessHandle

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\ProcessHandle.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ProcessHandle

extends
Comparable
<
ProcessHandle
>
```

ProcessHandle identifies and provides control of native processes. Each
individual process can be monitored for liveness, list its children,
get information about the process or destroy it.
By comparison,

Process

instances were started
by the current process and additionally provide access to the process
input, output, and error streams.

The native process ID is an identification number that the
operating system assigns to the process.
The range for process id values is dependent on the operating system.
For example, an embedded system might use a 16-bit value.
Status information about a process is retrieved from the native system
and may change asynchronously; processes may be created or terminate
spontaneously.
The time between when a process terminates and the process id
is reused for a new process is unpredictable.
Race conditions can exist between checking the status of a process and
acting upon it. When using ProcessHandles avoid assumptions
about the liveness or identity of the underlying process.

Each ProcessHandle identifies and allows control of a process in the native
system. ProcessHandles are returned from the factory methods

current()

,

of(long)

,

children()

,

descendants()

,

parent()

and

allProcesses()

.

The

Process

instances created by

ProcessBuilder

can be queried
for a ProcessHandle that provides information about the Process.
ProcessHandle references should not be freely distributed.

A

CompletableFuture

available from

onExit()

can be used to wait for process termination, and possibly trigger dependent
actions.

The factory methods limit access to ProcessHandles using the
SecurityManager checking the

RuntimePermission("manageProcess")

.
The ability to control processes is also restricted by the native system,
ProcessHandle provides no more access to, or control over, the native process
than would be allowed by a native application.

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### long pid()

Returns the native process ID of the process. The native process ID is an
identification number that the operating system assigns to the process.
The operating system may reuse the process ID after a process terminates.
Use

equals

or

compareTo

to compare ProcessHandles.

**Returns:**
- the native process ID of the process

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation
does not support this operation

---

#### static
Optional
<
ProcessHandle
> of​(long pid)

Returns an

Optional<ProcessHandle>

for an existing native process.

**Parameters:**
- pid

- a native process ID

**Returns:**
- an

Optional<ProcessHandle>

of the PID for the process;
the

Optional

is empty if the process does not exist

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager has been installed and
it denies RuntimePermission("manageProcess")
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation
does not support this operation

---

#### static
ProcessHandle
current()

Returns a ProcessHandle for the current process. The ProcessHandle cannot be
used to destroy the current process, use

System.exit

instead.

**Returns:**
- a ProcessHandle for the current process

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager has been installed and
it denies RuntimePermission("manageProcess")
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation
does not support this operation

---

#### Optional
<
ProcessHandle
> parent()

Returns an

Optional<ProcessHandle>

for the parent process.
Note that Processes in a zombie state usually don't have a parent.

**Returns:**
- an

Optional<ProcessHandle>

of the parent process;
the

Optional

is empty if the child process does not have a parent
or if the parent is not available, possibly due to operating system limitations

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager has been installed and
it denies RuntimePermission("manageProcess")

---

#### Stream
<
ProcessHandle
> children()

Returns a snapshot of the current direct children of the process.
The

parent()

of a direct child process is the process.
Typically, a process that is

not alive

has no children.

Note that processes are created and terminate asynchronously.
There is no guarantee that a process is

alive

.

**Returns:**
- a sequential Stream of ProcessHandles for processes that are
direct children of the process

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager has been installed and
it denies RuntimePermission("manageProcess")

---

#### Stream
<
ProcessHandle
> descendants()

Returns a snapshot of the descendants of the process.
The descendants of a process are the children of the process
plus the descendants of those children, recursively.
Typically, a process that is

not alive

has no children.

Note that processes are created and terminate asynchronously.
There is no guarantee that a process is

alive

.

**Returns:**
- a sequential Stream of ProcessHandles for processes that
are descendants of the process

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager has been installed and
it denies RuntimePermission("manageProcess")

---

#### static
Stream
<
ProcessHandle
> allProcesses()

Returns a snapshot of all processes visible to the current process.

Note that processes are created and terminate asynchronously. There
is no guarantee that a process in the stream is alive or that no other
processes may have been created since the inception of the snapshot.

**Returns:**
- a Stream of ProcessHandles for all processes

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager has been installed and
it denies RuntimePermission("manageProcess")
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the implementation
does not support this operation

---

#### ProcessHandle.Info
info()

Returns a snapshot of information about the process.

A

ProcessHandle.Info

instance has accessor methods that return
information about the process if it is available.

**Returns:**
- a snapshot of information about the process, always non-null

---

#### CompletableFuture
<
ProcessHandle
> onExit()

Returns a

CompletableFuture<ProcessHandle>

for the termination
of the process.
The

CompletableFuture

provides the ability
to trigger dependent functions or actions that may be run synchronously
or asynchronously upon process termination.
When the process has terminated the CompletableFuture is

completed

regardless
of the exit status of the process.
The

onExit

method can be called multiple times to invoke
independent actions when the process exits.

Calling

onExit().get()

waits for the process to terminate and returns
the ProcessHandle. The future can be used to check if the process is

done

or to

wait

for it to terminate.

Cancelling

the CompleteableFuture does not affect the Process.

**Returns:**
- a new

CompletableFuture<ProcessHandle>

for the ProcessHandle

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the process is the current process

**API Note:**
- The process may be observed to have terminated with

isAlive()

before the ComputableFuture is completed and dependent actions are invoked.

---

#### boolean supportsNormalTermination()

Returns

true

if the implementation of

destroy()

normally terminates the process.
Returns

false

if the implementation of

destroy

forcibly and immediately terminates the process.

**Returns:**
- true

if the implementation of

destroy()

normally terminates the process;
otherwise,

destroy()

forcibly terminates the process

---

#### boolean destroy()

Requests the process to be killed.
Whether the process represented by this

ProcessHandle

object is

normally terminated

or not is
implementation dependent.
Forcible process destruction is defined as the immediate termination of the
process, whereas normal termination allows the process to shut down cleanly.
If the process is not alive, no action is taken.
The operating system access controls may prevent the process
from being killed.

The

CompletableFuture

from

onExit()

is

completed

when the process has terminated.

Note: The process may not terminate immediately.
For example,

isAlive()

may return true for a brief period
after

destroy()

is called.

**Returns:**
- true

if termination was successfully requested,
otherwise

false

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the process is the current process

---

#### boolean destroyForcibly()

Requests the process to be killed forcibly.
The process represented by this

ProcessHandle

object is
forcibly terminated.
Forcible process destruction is defined as the immediate termination of the
process, whereas normal termination allows the process to shut down cleanly.
If the process is not alive, no action is taken.
The operating system access controls may prevent the process
from being killed.

The

CompletableFuture

from

onExit()

is

completed

when the process has terminated.

Note: The process may not terminate immediately.
For example,

isAlive()

may return true for a brief period
after

destroyForcibly()

is called.

**Returns:**
- true

if termination was successfully requested,
otherwise

false

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the process is the current process

---

#### boolean isAlive()

Tests whether the process represented by this

ProcessHandle

is alive.
Process termination is implementation and operating system specific.
The process is considered alive as long as the PID is valid.

**Returns:**
- true

if the process represented by this

ProcessHandle

object has not yet terminated

---

#### int hashCode()

Returns a hash code value for this ProcessHandle.
The hashcode value follows the general contract for

Object.hashCode()

.
The value is a function of the

pid()

value and
may be a function of additional information to uniquely identify the process.
If two ProcessHandles are equal according to the

equals

method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects
must produce the same integer result.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a hash code value for this object

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### boolean equals​(
Object
other)

Returns

true

if

other

object is non-null, is of the
same implementation, and represents the same system process;
otherwise it returns

false

.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- other

- another object

**Returns:**
- true

if the

other

object is non-null,
is of the same implementation class and represents
the same system process; otherwise returns

false

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

**Implementation Note:**
- It is implementation specific whether ProcessHandles with the same PID
represent the same system process. ProcessHandle implementations
should contain additional information to uniquely identify the process.
For example, the start time of the process could be used
to determine if the PID has been re-used.
The implementation of

equals

should return

true

for two
ProcessHandles with the same PID unless there is information to
distinguish them.

---

#### int compareTo​(
ProcessHandle
other)

Compares this ProcessHandle with the specified ProcessHandle for order.
The order is not specified, but is consistent with

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,
which returns

true

if and only if two instances of ProcessHandle
are of the same implementation and represent the same system process.
Comparison is only supported among objects of same implementation.
If attempt is made to mutually compare two different implementations
of

ProcessHandle

s,

ClassCastException

is thrown.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

ProcessHandle

>

**Parameters:**
- other

- the ProcessHandle to be compared

**Returns:**
- a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object
is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the specified object is null
- ClassCastException

- if the specified object is not of same class
as this object

- destroy

```java
boolean destroy()
```

Requests the process to be killed.
Whether the process represented by this

ProcessHandle

object is

normally terminated

or not is
implementation dependent.
Forcible process destruction is defined as the immediate termination of the
process, whereas normal termination allows the process to shut down cleanly.
If the process is not alive, no action is taken.
The operating system access controls may prevent the process
from being killed.

The

CompletableFuture

from

onExit()

is

completed

when the process has terminated.

Note: The process may not terminate immediately.
For example,

isAlive()

may return true for a brief period
after

destroy()

is called.

**Returns:** true

if termination was successfully requested,
otherwise

false
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the process is the current process

- destroyForcibly

```java
boolean destroyForcibly()
