# Interface LdapContext

**Source:** `java.naming\javax\naming\ldap\LdapContext.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
LdapContext

extends
DirContext
```

This interface represents a context in which you can perform
operations with LDAPv3-style controls and perform LDAPv3-style
extended operations.

For applications that do not require such controls or extended
operations, the more generic

javax.naming.directory.DirContext

should be used instead.

Usage Details About Controls

This interface provides support for LDAP v3 controls.
At a high level, this support allows a user
program to set request controls for LDAP operations that are executed
in the course of the user program's invocation of

Context

/

DirContext

methods, and read response controls resulting from LDAP operations.
At the implementation level, there are some details that developers of
both the user program and service providers need to understand in order
to correctly use request and response controls.

Request Controls

There are two types of request controls:

- Request controls that affect how a connection is created

Request controls that affect context methods

The former is used whenever a connection needs to be established or
re-established with an LDAP server. The latter is used when all other
LDAP operations are sent to the LDAP server. The reason why a
distinction between these two types of request controls is necessary
is because JNDI is a high-level API that does not deal directly with
connections. It is the job of service providers to do any necessary
connection management. Consequently, a single
connection may be shared by multiple context instances, and a service provider
is free to use its own algorithms to conserve connection and network
usage. Thus, when a method is invoked on the context instance, the service
provider might need to do some connection management in addition to
performing the corresponding LDAP operations. For connection management,
it uses the

connection request controls

, while for the normal
LDAP operations, it uses the

context request controls

.

Unless explicitly qualified, the term "request controls" refers to
context request controls.

Context Request Controls

There are two ways in which a context instance gets its request controls:

- ldapContext.newInstance(

reqCtls

)

ldapContext.setRequestControls(

reqCtls

)

where

ldapContext

is an instance of

LdapContext

.
Specifying

null

or an empty array for

reqCtls

means no request controls.

newInstance()

creates a new instance of a context using

reqCtls

, while

setRequestControls()

updates an existing context instance's request controls to

reqCtls

.

Unlike environment properties, request controls of a context instance

are not inherited

by context instances that are derived from
it. Derived context instances have

null

as their context
request controls. You must set the request controls of a derived context
instance explicitly using

setRequestControls()

.

A context instance's request controls are retrieved using
the method

getRequestControls()

.

Connection Request Controls

There are three ways in which connection request controls are set:

- new InitialLdapContext(env,

connCtls

)

refException.getReferralContext(env,

connCtls

)

ldapContext.reconnect(

connCtls

);

where

refException

is an instance of

LdapReferralException

, and

ldapContext

is an
instance of

LdapContext

.
Specifying

null

or an empty array for

connCtls

means no connection request controls.

Like environment properties, connection request controls of a context

are inherited

by contexts that are derived from it.
Typically, you initialize the connection request controls using the

InitialLdapContext

constructor or

LdapReferralContext.getReferralContext()

. These connection
request controls are inherited by contexts that share the same
connection--that is, contexts derived from the initial or referral
contexts.

Use

reconnect()

to change the connection request controls of
a context.
Invoking

ldapContext.reconnect()

affects only the
connection used by

ldapContext

and any new contexts instances that are
derived form

ldapContext

. Contexts that previously shared the
connection with

ldapContext

remain unchanged. That is, a context's
connection request controls must be explicitly changed and is not
affected by changes to another context's connection request
controls.

A context instance's connection request controls are retrieved using
the method

getConnectControls()

.

Service Provider Requirements

A service provider supports connection and context request controls
in the following ways. Context request controls must be associated on
a per context instance basis while connection request controls must be
associated on a per connection instance basis. The service provider
must look for the connection request controls in the environment
property "java.naming.ldap.control.connect" and pass this environment
property on to context instances that it creates.

Response Controls

The method

LdapContext.getResponseControls()

is used to
retrieve the response controls generated by LDAP operations executed
as the result of invoking a

Context

/

DirContext

operation. The result is all of the responses controls generated
by the underlying LDAP operations, including any implicit reconnection.
To get only the reconnection response controls,
use

reconnect()

followed by

getResponseControls()

.

Parameters

A

Control[]

array
passed as a parameter to any method is owned by the caller.
The service provider will not modify the array or keep a reference to it,
although it may keep references to the individual

Control

objects
in the array.
A

Control[]

array returned by any method is immutable, and may
not subsequently be modified by either the caller or the service provider.

### Field Details

#### static final
String
CONTROL_FACTORIES

Constant that holds the name of the environment property
for specifying the list of control factories to use. The value
of the property should be a colon-separated list of the fully
qualified class names of factory classes that will create a control
given another control. See

ControlFactory.getControlInstance()

for details.
This property may be specified in the environment, a system property,
or one or more resource files.

The value of this constant is "java.naming.factory.control".

### Method Details

#### ExtendedResponse
extendedOperation​(
ExtendedRequest
request)
throws
NamingException

Performs an extended operation.

This method is used to support LDAPv3 extended operations.

**Parameters:**
- request

- The non-null request to be performed.

**Returns:**
- The possibly null response of the operation. null means
the operation did not generate any response.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If an error occurred while performing the
extended operation.

---

#### LdapContext
newInstance​(
Control
[] requestControls)
throws
NamingException

Creates a new instance of this context initialized using request controls.

This method is a convenience method for creating a new instance
of this context for the purposes of multithreaded access.
For example, if multiple threads want to use different context
request controls,
each thread may use this method to get its own copy of this context
and set/get context request controls without having to synchronize with other
threads.

The new context has the same environment properties and connection
request controls as this context. See the class description for details.
Implementations might also allow this context and the new context
to share the same network connection or other resources if doing
so does not impede the independence of either context.

**Parameters:**
- requestControls

- The possibly null request controls
to use for the new context.
If null, the context is initialized with no request controls.

**Returns:**
- A non-null

LdapContext

instance.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If an error occurred while creating
the new instance.

**See Also:**
- InitialLdapContext

---

#### void reconnect​(
Control
[] connCtls)
throws
NamingException

Reconnects to the LDAP server using the supplied controls and
this context's environment.

This method is a way to explicitly initiate an LDAP "bind" operation.
For example, you can use this method to set request controls for
the LDAP "bind" operation, or to explicitly connect to the server
to get response controls returned by the LDAP "bind" operation.

This method sets this context's

connCtls

to be its new connection request controls. This context's
context request controls are not affected.
After this method has been invoked, any subsequent
implicit reconnections will be done using

connCtls

.

connCtls

are also used as
connection request controls for new context instances derived from this
context.
These connection request controls are not
affected by

setRequestControls()

.

Service provider implementors should read the "Service Provider" section
in the class description for implementation details.

**Parameters:**
- connCtls

- The possibly null controls to use. If null, no
controls are used.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If an error occurred while reconnecting.

**See Also:**
- getConnectControls()

,

newInstance(javax.naming.ldap.Control[])

---

#### Control
[] getConnectControls()
throws
NamingException

Retrieves the connection request controls in effect for this context.
The controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

**Returns:**
- A possibly-null array of controls. null means no connect controls
have been set for this context.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If an error occurred while getting the request
controls.

---

#### void setRequestControls​(
Control
[] requestControls)
throws
NamingException

Sets the request controls for methods subsequently
invoked on this context.
The request controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

This removes any previous request controls and adds

requestControls

for use by subsequent methods invoked on this context.
This method does not affect this context's connection request controls.

Note that

requestControls

will be in effect until the next
invocation of

setRequestControls()

. You need to explicitly
invoke

setRequestControls()

with

null

or an empty
array to clear the controls if you don't want them to affect the
context methods any more.
To check what request controls are in effect for this context, use

getRequestControls()

.

**Parameters:**
- requestControls

- The possibly null controls to use. If null, no
controls are used.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If an error occurred while setting the
request controls.

**See Also:**
- getRequestControls()

---

#### Control
[] getRequestControls()
throws
NamingException

Retrieves the request controls in effect for this context.
The request controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

**Returns:**
- A possibly-null array of controls. null means no request controls
have been set for this context.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If an error occurred while getting the request
controls.

**See Also:**
- setRequestControls(javax.naming.ldap.Control[])

---

#### Control
[] getResponseControls()
throws
NamingException

Retrieves the response controls produced as a result of the last
method invoked on this context.
The response controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

These response controls might have been generated by a successful or
failed operation.

When a context method that may return response controls is invoked,
response controls from the previous method invocation are cleared.

getResponseControls()

returns all of the response controls
generated by LDAP operations used by the context method in the order
received from the LDAP server.
Invoking

getResponseControls()

does not
clear the response controls. You can call it many times (and get
back the same controls) until the next context method that may return
controls is invoked.

**Returns:**
- A possibly null array of controls. If null, the previous
method invoked on this context did not produce any controls.

**Throws:**
- NamingException

- If an error occurred while getting the response
controls.

#### Context Request Controls

ldapContext.newInstance(

reqCtls

)

ldapContext.setRequestControls(

reqCtls

)

Unlike environment properties, request controls of a context instance

are not inherited

by context instances that are derived from
it. Derived context instances have

null

as their context
request controls. You must set the request controls of a derived context
instance explicitly using

setRequestControls()

.

A context instance's request controls are retrieved using
the method

getRequestControls()

.

Connection Request Controls

There are three ways in which connection request controls are set:

- new InitialLdapContext(env,

connCtls

)

refException.getReferralContext(env,

connCtls

)

ldapContext.reconnect(

connCtls

);

where

refException

is an instance of

LdapReferralException

, and

ldapContext

is an
instance of

LdapContext

.
Specifying

null

or an empty array for

connCtls

means no connection request controls.

Like environment properties, connection request controls of a context

are inherited

by contexts that are derived from it.
Typically, you initialize the connection request controls using the

InitialLdapContext

constructor or

LdapReferralContext.getReferralContext()

. These connection
request controls are inherited by contexts that share the same
connection--that is, contexts derived from the initial or referral
contexts.

Use

reconnect()

to change the connection request controls of
a context.
Invoking

ldapContext.reconnect()

affects only the
connection used by

ldapContext

and any new contexts instances that are
derived form

ldapContext

. Contexts that previously shared the
connection with

ldapContext

remain unchanged. That is, a context's
connection request controls must be explicitly changed and is not
affected by changes to another context's connection request
controls.

A context instance's connection request controls are retrieved using
the method

getConnectControls()

.

Service Provider Requirements

A service provider supports connection and context request controls
in the following ways. Context request controls must be associated on
a per context instance basis while connection request controls must be
associated on a per connection instance basis. The service provider
must look for the connection request controls in the environment
property "java.naming.ldap.control.connect" and pass this environment
property on to context instances that it creates.

Response Controls

The method

LdapContext.getResponseControls()

is used to
retrieve the response controls generated by LDAP operations executed
as the result of invoking a

Context

/

DirContext

operation. The result is all of the responses controls generated
by the underlying LDAP operations, including any implicit reconnection.
To get only the reconnection response controls,
use

reconnect()

followed by

getResponseControls()

.

Parameters

A

Control[]

array
passed as a parameter to any method is owned by the caller.
The service provider will not modify the array or keep a reference to it,
although it may keep references to the individual

Control

objects
in the array.
A

Control[]

array returned by any method is immutable, and may
not subsequently be modified by either the caller or the service provider.

must look for the connection request controls in the environment
property "java.naming.ldap.control.connect" and pass this environment
property on to context instances that it creates.

Parameters

A

array
passed as a parameter to any method is owned by the caller.
The service provider will not modify the array or keep a reference to it,
although it may keep references to the individual

Control

objects
in the array.
A

Control[]

array returned by any method is immutable, and may
not subsequently be modified by either the caller or the service provider.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- extendedOperation

```java
ExtendedResponse
extendedOperation​(
ExtendedRequest
request)
throws
NamingException
```

Performs an extended operation.

This method is used to support LDAPv3 extended operations.

**Parameters:** request

- The non-null request to be performed.
**Returns:** The possibly null response of the operation. null means
the operation did not generate any response.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while performing the
extended operation.

- newInstance

```java
LdapContext
newInstance​(
Control
[] requestControls)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates a new instance of this context initialized using request controls.

This method is a convenience method for creating a new instance
of this context for the purposes of multithreaded access.
For example, if multiple threads want to use different context
request controls,
each thread may use this method to get its own copy of this context
and set/get context request controls without having to synchronize with other
threads.

The new context has the same environment properties and connection
request controls as this context. See the class description for details.
Implementations might also allow this context and the new context
to share the same network connection or other resources if doing
so does not impede the independence of either context.

**Parameters:** requestControls

- The possibly null request controls
to use for the new context.
If null, the context is initialized with no request controls.
**Returns:** A non-null

LdapContext

instance.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while creating
the new instance.
**See Also:** InitialLdapContext

- reconnect

```java
void reconnect​(
Control
[] connCtls)
throws
NamingException
```

Reconnects to the LDAP server using the supplied controls and
this context's environment.

This method is a way to explicitly initiate an LDAP "bind" operation.
For example, you can use this method to set request controls for
the LDAP "bind" operation, or to explicitly connect to the server
to get response controls returned by the LDAP "bind" operation.

This method sets this context's

connCtls

to be its new connection request controls. This context's
context request controls are not affected.
After this method has been invoked, any subsequent
implicit reconnections will be done using

connCtls

.

connCtls

are also used as
connection request controls for new context instances derived from this
context.
These connection request controls are not
affected by

setRequestControls()

.

Service provider implementors should read the "Service Provider" section
in the class description for implementation details.

**Parameters:** connCtls

- The possibly null controls to use. If null, no
controls are used.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while reconnecting.
**See Also:** getConnectControls()

,

newInstance(javax.naming.ldap.Control[])

- getConnectControls

```java
Control
[] getConnectControls()
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the connection request controls in effect for this context.
The controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

**Returns:** A possibly-null array of controls. null means no connect controls
have been set for this context.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while getting the request
controls.

- setRequestControls

```java
void setRequestControls​(
Control
[] requestControls)
throws
NamingException
```

Sets the request controls for methods subsequently
invoked on this context.
The request controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

This removes any previous request controls and adds

requestControls

for use by subsequent methods invoked on this context.
This method does not affect this context's connection request controls.

Note that

requestControls

will be in effect until the next
invocation of

setRequestControls()

. You need to explicitly
invoke

setRequestControls()

with

null

or an empty
array to clear the controls if you don't want them to affect the
context methods any more.
To check what request controls are in effect for this context, use

getRequestControls()

.

**Parameters:** requestControls

- The possibly null controls to use. If null, no
controls are used.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while setting the
request controls.
**See Also:** getRequestControls()

- getRequestControls

```java
Control
[] getRequestControls()
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the request controls in effect for this context.
The request controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

**Returns:** A possibly-null array of controls. null means no request controls
have been set for this context.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while getting the request
controls.
**See Also:** setRequestControls(javax.naming.ldap.Control[])

- getResponseControls

```java
Control
[] getResponseControls()
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the response controls produced as a result of the last
method invoked on this context.
The response controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

These response controls might have been generated by a successful or
failed operation.

When a context method that may return response controls is invoked,
response controls from the previous method invocation are cleared.

getResponseControls()

returns all of the response controls
generated by LDAP operations used by the context method in the order
received from the LDAP server.
Invoking

getResponseControls()

does not
clear the response controls. You can call it many times (and get
back the same controls) until the next context method that may return
controls is invoked.

**Returns:** A possibly null array of controls. If null, the previous
method invoked on this context did not produce any controls.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while getting the response
controls.

Field Detail

- CONTROL_FACTORIES

```java

CONTROL_FACTORIES
```

Constant that holds the name of the environment property
for specifying the list of control factories to use. The value
of the property should be a colon-separated list of the fully
qualified class names of factory classes that will create a control
given another control. See

and set/get context request controls without having to synchronize with other
threads.

The new context has the same environment properties and connection
request controls as this context. See the class description for details.
Implementations might also allow this context and the new context
to share the same network connection or other resources if doing
so does not impede the independence of either context.

**Parameters:** requestControls

- The possibly null request controls
to use for the new context.
If null, the context is initialized with no request controls.
**Returns:** A non-null

LdapContext

instance.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while creating
the new instance.
**See Also:** InitialLdapContext

- reconnect

```java
void reconnect​(
Control
[] connCtls)
throws
NamingException
```

Reconnects to the LDAP server using the supplied controls and
this context's environment.

This method is a way to explicitly initiate an LDAP "bind" operation.
For example, you can use this method to set request controls for
the LDAP "bind" operation, or to explicitly connect to the server
to get response controls returned by the LDAP "bind" operation.

This method sets this context's

connCtls

to be its new connection request controls. This context's
context request controls are not affected.
After this method has been invoked, any subsequent
implicit reconnections will be done using

connCtls

.

connCtls

are also used as
connection request controls for new context instances derived from this
context.
These connection request controls are not
affected by

setRequestControls()

.

Service provider implementors should read the "Service Provider" section
in the class description for implementation details.

**Parameters:** connCtls

- The possibly null controls to use. If null, no
controls are used.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while reconnecting.
**See Also:** getConnectControls()

,

newInstance(javax.naming.ldap.Control[])

- getConnectControls

```java
Control
[] getConnectControls()
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the connection request controls in effect for this context.
The controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

**Returns:** A possibly-null array of controls. null means no connect controls
have been set for this context.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while getting the request
controls.

- setRequestControls

```java
void setRequestControls​(
Control
[] requestControls)
throws
NamingException
```

Sets the request controls for methods subsequently
invoked on this context.
The request controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

This removes any previous request controls and adds

requestControls

for use by subsequent methods invoked on this context.
This method does not affect this context's connection request controls.

Note that

requestControls

will be in effect until the next
invocation of

setRequestControls()

. You need to explicitly
invoke

setRequestControls()

with

null

or an empty
array to clear the controls if you don't want them to affect the
context methods any more.
To check what request controls are in effect for this context, use

getRequestControls()

.

**Parameters:** requestControls

- The possibly null controls to use. If null, no
controls are used.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while setting the
request controls.
**See Also:** getRequestControls()

- getRequestControls

```java
Control
[] getRequestControls()
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the request controls in effect for this context.
The request controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

**Returns:** A possibly-null array of controls. null means no request controls
have been set for this context.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while getting the request
controls.
**See Also:** setRequestControls(javax.naming.ldap.Control[])

- getResponseControls

```java
Control
[] getResponseControls()
throws
NamingException
```

Retrieves the response controls produced as a result of the last
method invoked on this context.
The response controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
caller.

These response controls might have been generated by a successful or
failed operation.

When a context method that may return response controls is invoked,
response controls from the previous method invocation are cleared.

getResponseControls()

returns all of the response controls
generated by LDAP operations used by the context method in the order
received from the LDAP server.
Invoking

getResponseControls()

does not
clear the response controls. You can call it many times (and get
back the same controls) until the next context method that may return
controls is invoked.

**Returns:** A possibly null array of controls. If null, the previous
method invoked on this context did not produce any controls.
**Throws:** NamingException

- If an error occurred while getting the response
controls.

newInstance

```java
LdapContext
newInstance​(
Control
[] requestControls)
throws
NamingException
```

Creates a new instance of this context initialized using request controls.

This method is a convenience method for creating a new instance
of this context for the purposes of multithreaded access.
For example, if multiple threads want to use different context
request controls,
each thread may use this method to get its own copy of this context
and set/get context request controls without having to synchronize with other
threads.

The new context has the same environment properties and connection
request controls as this context. See the class description for details.
Implementations might also allow this context and the new context
to share the same network connection or other resources if doing
so does not impede the independence of either context.

**Parameters:** requestControls

- The possibly null request controls
to use for the new context.
If null, the context is initialized with no request controls.
**Returns:** A non-null
