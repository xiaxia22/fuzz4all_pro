# Class ArrayBlockingQueue<E>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\concurrent\ArrayBlockingQueue.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ArrayBlockingQueue<E>

extends
AbstractQueue
<E>
implements
BlockingQueue
<E>,
Serializable
```

A bounded

blocking queue

backed by an
array. This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out). The

head

of the queue is that element that has been on the
queue the longest time. The

tail

of the queue is that
element that has been on the queue the shortest time. New elements
are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval
operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.

This is a classic "bounded buffer", in which a
fixed-sized array holds elements inserted by producers and
extracted by consumers. Once created, the capacity cannot be
changed. Attempts to

put

an element into a full queue
will result in the operation blocking; attempts to

take

an
element from an empty queue will similarly block.

This class supports an optional fairness policy for ordering
waiting producer and consumer threads. By default, this ordering
is not guaranteed. However, a queue constructed with fairness set
to

true

grants threads access in FIFO order. Fairness
generally decreases throughput but reduces variability and avoids
starvation.

This class and its iterator implement all of the

optional

methods of the

Collection

and

Iterator

interfaces.

This class is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

**Type Parameters:** E

- the type of elements held in this queue

### Constructor Details

#### public ArrayBlockingQueue​(int capacity)

Creates an

ArrayBlockingQueue

with the given (fixed)
capacity and default access policy.

**Parameters:**

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

capacity < 1

---

#### public ArrayBlockingQueue​(int capacity,
boolean fair)

Creates an

ArrayBlockingQueue

with the given (fixed)
capacity and the specified access policy.

**Parameters:**
- capacity

- the capacity of this queue
- fair

- if

true

then queue accesses for threads blocked
on insertion or removal, are processed in FIFO order;
if

false

the access order is unspecified.

**Throws:**

---

#### public ArrayBlockingQueue​(int capacity,
boolean fair,

Collection
<? extends
E
> c)

Creates an

ArrayBlockingQueue

with the given (fixed)
capacity, the specified access policy and initially containing the
elements of the given collection,
added in traversal order of the collection's iterator.

**Parameters:**
- capacity

- the capacity of this queue
- fair

- if

true

then queue accesses for threads blocked
on insertion or removal, are processed in FIFO order;
if

false

the access order is unspecified.
- c

- the collection of elements to initially contain

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

capacity

is less than

c.size()

, or less than 1.
- NullPointerException

- if the specified collection or any
of its elements are null

---

### Method Details

#### public boolean add​(
E
e)

Inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue if it is
possible to do so immediately without exceeding the queue's capacity,
returning

true

upon success and throwing an

IllegalStateException

if this queue is full.

**Specified by:**
- add

**Parameters:**
- e

- the element to add

**Returns:**
- true

(as specified by

Collection.add(E)

)

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

---

#### public boolean offer​(
E
e)

Inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue if it is
possible to do so immediately without exceeding the queue's capacity,
returning

true

upon success and

false

if this queue
is full. This method is generally preferable to method

add(E)

,
which can fail to insert an element only by throwing an exception.

**Specified by:**
- offer

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>
- offer

in interface

Queue

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- e

- the element to add

**Returns:**
- true

if the element was added to this queue, else

false

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null

---

#### public void put​(
E
e)
throws
InterruptedException

Inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue, waiting
for space to become available if the queue is full.

**Specified by:**
- put

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- e

- the element to add

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if interrupted while waiting
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null

---

#### public boolean offer​(
E
e,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException

Inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue, waiting
up to the specified wait time for space to become available if
the queue is full.

**Specified by:**
- offer

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- e

- the element to add
- timeout

- how long to wait before giving up, in units of

unit
- unit

- a

TimeUnit

determining how to interpret the

timeout

parameter

**Returns:**
- true

if successful, or

false

if
the specified waiting time elapses before space is available

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if interrupted while waiting
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null

---

#### public int size()

Returns the number of elements in this queue.

**Specified by:**
- size

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- the number of elements in this queue

---

#### public int remainingCapacity()

Returns the number of additional elements that this queue can ideally
(in the absence of memory or resource constraints) accept without
blocking. This is always equal to the initial capacity of this queue
less the current

size

of this queue.

Note that you

cannot

always tell if an attempt to insert
an element will succeed by inspecting

remainingCapacity

because it may be the case that another thread is about to
insert or remove an element.

**Specified by:**
- remainingCapacity

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- the remaining capacity

---

#### public boolean remove​(
Object
o)

Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue,
if it is present. More formally, removes an element

e

such
that

o.equals(e)

, if this queue contains one or more such
elements.
Returns

true

if this queue contained the specified element
(or equivalently, if this queue changed as a result of the call).

Removal of interior elements in circular array based queues
is an intrinsically slow and disruptive operation, so should
be undertaken only in exceptional circumstances, ideally
only when the queue is known not to be accessible by other
threads.

**Specified by:**
- remove

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>
- remove

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- remove

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- o

- element to be removed from this queue, if present

**Returns:**
- true

if this queue changed as a result of the call

---

#### public boolean contains​(
Object
o)

Returns

true

if this queue contains the specified element.
More formally, returns

true

if and only if this queue contains
at least one element

e

such that

o.equals(e)

.

**Specified by:**
- contains

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>
- contains

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- contains

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- o

- object to be checked for containment in this queue

**Returns:**
- true

if this queue contains the specified element

---

#### public
Object
[] toArray()

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this queue. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this queue

---

#### public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of
the specified array. If the queue fits in the specified array, it
is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the
runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue.

If this queue fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this queue), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the queue is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a queue known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- a

- the array into which the elements of the queue are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this queue

**Throws:**
- ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this queue
- NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection

---

#### public void clear()

Atomically removes all of the elements from this queue.
The queue will be empty after this call returns.

**Specified by:**
- clear

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- clear

in class

AbstractQueue

A bounded

backed by an
array. This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out). The

head

of the queue is that element that has been on the

tail

of the queue is that

are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval
operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.

```

Inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue if it is
possible to do so immediately without exceeding the queue's capacity,
returning

true

upon success and

false

if this queue
is full. This method is generally preferable to method

add(E)

,
which can fail to insert an element only by throwing an exception.

**Specified by:** offer

```

Inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue, waiting
for space to become available if the queue is full.

**Specified by:** put

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

**Parameters:** e

- the element to add
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if interrupted while waiting
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null

- offer

```java
public boolean offer​(
E
e,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws

```

Inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue, waiting
up to the specified wait time for space to become available if
the queue is full.

**Specified by:** offer

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>
**Parameters:** e

- the element to add
**Parameters:** timeout

- how long to wait before giving up, in units of

unit
**Parameters:** unit

- a

TimeUnit

determining how to interpret the

timeout

parameter
**Returns:** true

if successful, or

false

if
the specified waiting time elapses before space is available
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if interrupted while waiting
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null

- size

```java
public int size()
```

Returns the number of elements in this queue.

**Specified by:** size

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Returns:** the number of elements in this queue

- remainingCapacity

```java
public int remainingCapacity()
```

Returns the number of additional elements that this queue can ideally
(in the absence of memory or resource constraints) accept without
blocking. This is always equal to the initial capacity of this queue
less the current

size

of this queue.

Note that you

cannot

always tell if an attempt to insert
an element will succeed by inspecting

remainingCapacity

because it may be the case that another thread is about to
insert or remove an element.

**Specified by:** remainingCapacity

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>
**Returns:** the remaining capacity

- remove

```java
public boolean remove​(
Object
o)
```

Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue,
if it is present. More formally, removes an element

e

such
that

o.equals(e)

, if this queue contains one or more such
elements.
Returns

true

if this queue contained the specified element
(or equivalently, if this queue changed as a result of the call).

Removal of interior elements in circular array based queues
is an intrinsically slow and disruptive operation, so should
be undertaken only in exceptional circumstances, ideally
only when the queue is known not to be accessible by other
threads.

**Specified by:** remove

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>
**Specified by:** remove

in interface

Collection

<

**Parameters:** o

- element to be removed from this queue, if present
**Returns:** true

if this queue changed as a result of the call

- contains

```java
public boolean contains​(
Object
o)
```

Returns

true

if this queue contains the specified element.
More formally, returns

true

if and only if this queue contains
at least one element

e

such that

o.equals(e)

.

**Specified by:** contains

BlockingQueue

<

E

>
**Specified by:** contains

in interface

Collection

<

E

**Overrides:** contains

AbstractCollection

<

E

**Parameters:** o

- object to be checked for containment in this queue
**Returns:** true

if this queue contains the specified element

- toArray

```java
public
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this queue. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this queue

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of
the specified array. If the queue fits in the specified array, it
is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the
runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue.

If this queue fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this queue), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the queue is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a queue known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Type Parameters:** T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection
**Parameters:** a

- the array into which the elements of the queue are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this queue
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this queue
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

- clear

```java
public void clear()
```

Atomically removes all of the elements from this queue.
The queue will be empty after this call returns.

- drainTo

```java
public int drainTo​(
Collection
<? super
E

```

Description copied from interface:

BlockingQueue

Removes all available elements from this queue and adds them
to the given collection. This operation may be more
efficient than repeatedly polling this queue. A failure
encountered while attempting to add elements to
collection

c

may result in elements being in neither,
either or both collections when the associated exception is
thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in

IllegalArgumentException

. Further, the behavior of
this operation is undefined if the specified collection is
modified while the operation is in progress.

**Specified by:** drainTo

in interface

BlockingQueue

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- the collection to transfer elements into
**Returns:** the number of elements transferred
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if addition of elements
is not supported by the specified collection
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this queue
prevents it from being added to the specified collection
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified collection is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified collection is this
queue, or some property of an element of this queue prevents
it from being added to the specified collection

Returns

true

if this queue contains the specified element.
More formally, returns

true

if and only if this queue contains
at least one element

e

such that

o.equals(e)

.

**Parameters:** o

- object to be checked for containment in this queue
**Returns:** true

if this queue contains the specified element

- toArray

```java
public
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this queue. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this queue

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of
the specified array. If the queue fits in the specified array, it
is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the
runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue.

If this queue fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this queue), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the queue is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a queue known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

forEach

```java
public void forEach​(
Consumer
<? super
E
> action)
```

Description copied from interface:

Iterable

Performs the given action for each element of the

Iterable

until all elements have been processed or the action throws an
exception. Actions are performed in the order of iteration, if that
order is specified. Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the
caller.

The behavior of this method is unspecified if the action performs
side-effects that modify the underlying source of elements, unless an
overriding class has specified a concurrent modification policy.

**Specified by:** forEach

in interface

**Parameters:** action

- The action to be performed for each element
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified action is null
