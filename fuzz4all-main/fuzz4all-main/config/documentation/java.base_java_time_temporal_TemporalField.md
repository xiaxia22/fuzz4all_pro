# Interface TemporalField

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\temporal\TemporalField.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
TemporalField
```

A field of date-time, such as month-of-year or hour-of-minute.

Date and time is expressed using fields which partition the time-line into something
meaningful for humans. Implementations of this interface represent those fields.

The most commonly used units are defined in

ChronoField

.
Further fields are supplied in

IsoFields

,

WeekFields

and

JulianFields

.
Fields can also be written by application code by implementing this interface.

The field works using double dispatch. Client code calls methods on a date-time like

LocalDateTime

which check if the field is a

ChronoField

.
If it is, then the date-time must handle it.
Otherwise, the method call is re-dispatched to the matching method in this interface.

### Method Details

#### default
String
getDisplayName​(
Locale
locale)

Gets the display name for the field in the requested locale.

If there is no display name for the locale then a suitable default must be returned.

The default implementation must check the locale is not null
and return

toString()

.

**Parameters:**
- locale

- the locale to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the display name for the locale or a suitable default, not null

---

#### TemporalUnit
getBaseUnit()

Gets the unit that the field is measured in.

The unit of the field is the period that varies within the range.
For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the unit is 'Months'.
See also

getRangeUnit()

.

**Returns:**
- the unit defining the base unit of the field, not null

---

#### TemporalUnit
getRangeUnit()

Gets the range that the field is bound by.

The range of the field is the period that the field varies within.
For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the range is 'Years'.
See also

getBaseUnit()

.

The range is never null. For example, the 'Year' field is shorthand for
'YearOfForever'. It therefore has a unit of 'Years' and a range of 'Forever'.

**Returns:**
- the unit defining the range of the field, not null

---

#### ValueRange
range()

Gets the range of valid values for the field.

All fields can be expressed as a

long

integer.
This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.
This method is generally only applicable to the ISO-8601 calendar system.

Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.

**Returns:**
- the range of valid values for the field, not null

---

#### boolean isDateBased()

Checks if this field represents a component of a date.

A field is date-based if it can be derived from

EPOCH_DAY

.
Note that it is valid for both

isDateBased()

and

isTimeBased()

to return false, such as when representing a field like minute-of-week.

**Returns:**
- true if this field is a component of a date

---

#### boolean isTimeBased()

Checks if this field represents a component of a time.

A field is time-based if it can be derived from

NANO_OF_DAY

.
Note that it is valid for both

isDateBased()

and

isTimeBased()

to return false, such as when representing a field like minute-of-week.

**Returns:**
- true if this field is a component of a time

---

#### boolean isSupportedBy​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)

Checks if this field is supported by the temporal object.

This determines whether the temporal accessor supports this field.
If this returns false, then the temporal cannot be queried for this field.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalAccessor.isSupported(TemporalField)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.isSupportedBy(temporal);
temporal = temporal.isSupported(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

isSupported(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should determine whether they are supported using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object to query, not null

**Returns:**
- true if the date-time can be queried for this field, false if not

---

#### ValueRange
rangeRefinedBy​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)

Get the range of valid values for this field using the temporal object to
refine the result.

This uses the temporal object to find the range of valid values for the field.
This is similar to

range()

, however this method refines the result
using the temporal. For example, if the field is

DAY_OF_MONTH

the

range

method is not accurate as there are four possible month lengths,
28, 29, 30 and 31 days. Using this method with a date allows the range to be
accurate, returning just one of those four options.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalAccessor.range(TemporalField)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.rangeRefinedBy(temporal);
temporal = temporal.range(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

range(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.
If the field is not supported an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object used to refine the result, not null

**Returns:**
- the range of valid values for this field, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the range for the field cannot be obtained
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported by the temporal

---

#### long getFrom​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)

Gets the value of this field from the specified temporal object.

This queries the temporal object for the value of this field.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalAccessor.getLong(TemporalField)

(or

TemporalAccessor.get(TemporalField)

):

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.getFrom(temporal);
temporal = temporal.getLong(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

getLong(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.
If the field is not supported an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object to query, not null

**Returns:**
- the value of this field, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported by the temporal
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### <R extends
Temporal
> R adjustInto​(R temporal,
long newValue)

Returns a copy of the specified temporal object with the value of this field set.

This returns a new temporal object based on the specified one with the value for
this field changed. For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to
set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object has the same observable type as the specified object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the implementation is responsible for resolving the result.
Typically it will choose the previous valid date, which would be the last valid
day of February in this example.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

with(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.
If the field is not supported an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

Implementations must not alter the specified temporal object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object to adjust, not null
- newValue

- the new value of the field

**Returns:**
- the adjusted temporal object, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported by the temporal
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Type Parameters:**
- R

- the type of the Temporal object

---

#### default
TemporalAccessor
resolve​(
Map
<
TemporalField
,​
Long
> fieldValues,

TemporalAccessor
partialTemporal,

ResolverStyle
resolverStyle)

Resolves this field to provide a simpler alternative or a date.

This method is invoked during the resolve phase of parsing.
It is designed to allow application defined fields to be simplified into
more standard fields, such as those on

ChronoField

, or into a date.

Applications should not normally invoke this method directly.

**Parameters:**
- fieldValues

- the map of fields to values, which can be updated, not null
- partialTemporal

- the partially complete temporal to query for zone and
chronology; querying for other things is undefined and not recommended, not null
- resolverStyle

- the requested type of resolve, not null

**Returns:**
- the resolved temporal object; null if resolving only
changed the map, or no resolve occurred

**Throws:**
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs
- DateTimeException

- if resolving results in an error. This must not be thrown
by querying a field on the temporal without first checking if it is supported

**Implementation Requirements:**
- If an implementation represents a field that can be simplified, or
combined with others, then this method must be implemented.

The specified map contains the current state of the parse.
The map is mutable and must be mutated to resolve the field and
any related fields. This method will only be invoked during parsing
if the map contains this field, and implementations should therefore
assume this field is present.

Resolving a field will consist of looking at the value of this field,
and potentially other fields, and either updating the map with a
simpler value, such as a

ChronoField

, or returning a
complete

ChronoLocalDate

. If a resolve is successful,
the code must remove all the fields that were resolved from the map,
including this field.

For example, the

IsoFields

class contains the quarter-of-year
and day-of-quarter fields. The implementation of this method in that class
resolves the two fields plus the

YEAR

into a
complete

LocalDate

. The resolve method will remove all three
fields from the map before returning the

LocalDate

.

A partially complete temporal is used to allow the chronology and zone
to be queried. In general, only the chronology will be needed.
Querying items other than the zone or chronology is undefined and
must not be relied on.
The behavior of other methods such as

get

,

getLong

,

range

and

isSupported

is unpredictable and the results undefined.

If resolution should be possible, but the data is invalid, the resolver
style should be used to determine an appropriate level of leniency, which
may require throwing a

DateTimeException

or

ArithmeticException

.
If no resolution is possible, the resolve method must return null.

When resolving time fields, the map will be altered and null returned.
When resolving date fields, the date is normally returned from the method,
with the map altered to remove the resolved fields. However, it would also
be acceptable for the date fields to be resolved into other

ChronoField

instances that can produce a date, such as

EPOCH_DAY

.

Not all

TemporalAccessor

implementations are accepted as return values.
Implementations that call this method must accept

ChronoLocalDate

,

ChronoLocalDateTime

,

ChronoZonedDateTime

and

LocalTime

.

The default implementation must return null.

---

#### String
toString()

Gets a descriptive name for the field.

The should be of the format 'BaseOfRange', such as 'MonthOfYear',
unless the field has a range of

FOREVER

, when only
the base unit is mentioned, such as 'Year' or 'Era'.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- the name of the field, not null

#### Interface TemporalField

**All Known Implementing Classes:** ChronoField

```java
public interface
TemporalField
```

A field of date-time, such as month-of-year or hour-of-minute.

Date and time is expressed using fields which partition the time-line into something
meaningful for humans. Implementations of this interface represent those fields.

The most commonly used units are defined in

ChronoField

.
Further fields are supplied in

IsoFields

,

WeekFields

and

JulianFields

.
Fields can also be written by application code by implementing this interface.

The field works using double dispatch. Client code calls methods on a date-time like

LocalDateTime

which check if the field is a

ChronoField

.
If it is, then the date-time must handle it.
Otherwise, the method call is re-dispatched to the matching method in this interface.

**Implementation Requirements:** This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
Implementations should be

Serializable

where possible.
An enum is as effective implementation choice.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getDisplayName

```java
default
String
getDisplayName​(
Locale
locale)
```

Gets the display name for the field in the requested locale.

If there is no display name for the locale then a suitable default must be returned.

The default implementation must check the locale is not null
and return

toString()

.

**Parameters:** locale

- the locale to use, not null
**Returns:** the display name for the locale or a suitable default, not null

- getBaseUnit

```java
TemporalUnit
getBaseUnit()
```

Gets the unit that the field is measured in.

The unit of the field is the period that varies within the range.
For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the unit is 'Months'.
See also

getRangeUnit()

.

**Returns:** the unit defining the base unit of the field, not null

- getRangeUnit

```java
TemporalUnit
getRangeUnit()
```

Gets the range that the field is bound by.

The range of the field is the period that the field varies within.
For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the range is 'Years'.
See also

getBaseUnit()

.

The range is never null. For example, the 'Year' field is shorthand for
'YearOfForever'. It therefore has a unit of 'Years' and a range of 'Forever'.

**Returns:** the unit defining the range of the field, not null

- range

```java
ValueRange
range()
```

Gets the range of valid values for the field.

All fields can be expressed as a

long

integer.
This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.
This method is generally only applicable to the ISO-8601 calendar system.

Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.

**Returns:** the range of valid values for the field, not null

- isDateBased

```java
boolean isDateBased()
```

Checks if this field represents a component of a date.

A field is date-based if it can be derived from

EPOCH_DAY

.
Note that it is valid for both

isDateBased()

and

isTimeBased()

to return false, such as when representing a field like minute-of-week.

**Returns:** true if this field is a component of a date

- isTimeBased

```java
boolean isTimeBased()
```

Checks if this field represents a component of a time.

A field is time-based if it can be derived from

NANO_OF_DAY

.
Note that it is valid for both

isDateBased()

and

isTimeBased()

to return false, such as when representing a field like minute-of-week.

**Returns:** true if this field is a component of a time

- isSupportedBy

```java
boolean isSupportedBy​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Checks if this field is supported by the temporal object.

This determines whether the temporal accessor supports this field.
If this returns false, then the temporal cannot be queried for this field.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalAccessor.isSupported(TemporalField)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.isSupportedBy(temporal);
temporal = temporal.isSupported(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

isSupported(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should determine whether they are supported using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to query, not null
**Returns:** true if the date-time can be queried for this field, false if not

- rangeRefinedBy

```java
ValueRange
rangeRefinedBy​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Get the range of valid values for this field using the temporal object to
refine the result.

This uses the temporal object to find the range of valid values for the field.
This is similar to

range()

, however this method refines the result
using the temporal. For example, if the field is

DAY_OF_MONTH

the

range

method is not accurate as there are four possible month lengths,
28, 29, 30 and 31 days. Using this method with a date allows the range to be
accurate, returning just one of those four options.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalAccessor.range(TemporalField)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.rangeRefinedBy(temporal);
temporal = temporal.range(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

range(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.
If the field is not supported an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object used to refine the result, not null
**Returns:** the range of valid values for this field, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the range for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported by the temporal

- getFrom

```java
long getFrom​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Gets the value of this field from the specified temporal object.

This queries the temporal object for the value of this field.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalAccessor.getLong(TemporalField)

(or

TemporalAccessor.get(TemporalField)

):

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.getFrom(temporal);
temporal = temporal.getLong(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

getLong(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.
If the field is not supported an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to query, not null
**Returns:** the value of this field, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported by the temporal
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- adjustInto

```java
<R extends
Temporal
> R adjustInto​(R temporal,
long newValue)
```

Returns a copy of the specified temporal object with the value of this field set.

This returns a new temporal object based on the specified one with the value for
this field changed. For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to
set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object has the same observable type as the specified object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the implementation is responsible for resolving the result.
Typically it will choose the previous valid date, which would be the last valid
day of February in this example.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

with(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.
If the field is not supported an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

Implementations must not alter the specified temporal object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the Temporal object
**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to adjust, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field
**Returns:** the adjusted temporal object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported by the temporal
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- resolve

```java
default
TemporalAccessor
resolve​(
Map
<
TemporalField
,​
Long
> fieldValues,

TemporalAccessor
partialTemporal,

ResolverStyle
resolverStyle)
```

Resolves this field to provide a simpler alternative or a date.

This method is invoked during the resolve phase of parsing.
It is designed to allow application defined fields to be simplified into
more standard fields, such as those on

ChronoField

, or into a date.

Applications should not normally invoke this method directly.

**Implementation Requirements:** If an implementation represents a field that can be simplified, or
combined with others, then this method must be implemented.

The specified map contains the current state of the parse.
The map is mutable and must be mutated to resolve the field and
any related fields. This method will only be invoked during parsing
if the map contains this field, and implementations should therefore
assume this field is present.

Resolving a field will consist of looking at the value of this field,
and potentially other fields, and either updating the map with a
simpler value, such as a

ChronoField

, or returning a
complete

ChronoLocalDate

. If a resolve is successful,
the code must remove all the fields that were resolved from the map,
including this field.

For example, the

IsoFields

class contains the quarter-of-year
and day-of-quarter fields. The implementation of this method in that class
resolves the two fields plus the

YEAR

into a
complete

LocalDate

. The resolve method will remove all three
fields from the map before returning the

LocalDate

.

A partially complete temporal is used to allow the chronology and zone
to be queried. In general, only the chronology will be needed.
Querying items other than the zone or chronology is undefined and
must not be relied on.
The behavior of other methods such as

get

,

getLong

,

range

and

isSupported

is unpredictable and the results undefined.

If resolution should be possible, but the data is invalid, the resolver
style should be used to determine an appropriate level of leniency, which
may require throwing a

DateTimeException

or

ArithmeticException

.
If no resolution is possible, the resolve method must return null.

When resolving time fields, the map will be altered and null returned.
When resolving date fields, the date is normally returned from the method,
with the map altered to remove the resolved fields. However, it would also
be acceptable for the date fields to be resolved into other

ChronoField

instances that can produce a date, such as

EPOCH_DAY

.

Not all

TemporalAccessor

implementations are accepted as return values.
Implementations that call this method must accept

ChronoLocalDate

,

ChronoLocalDateTime

,

ChronoZonedDateTime

and

LocalTime

.

The default implementation must return null.
**Parameters:** fieldValues

- the map of fields to values, which can be updated, not null
**Parameters:** partialTemporal

- the partially complete temporal to query for zone and
chronology; querying for other things is undefined and not recommended, not null
**Parameters:** resolverStyle

- the requested type of resolve, not null
**Returns:** the resolved temporal object; null if resolving only
changed the map, or no resolve occurred
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if resolving results in an error. This must not be thrown
by querying a field on the temporal without first checking if it is supported

- toString

```java
String
toString()
```

Gets a descriptive name for the field.

The should be of the format 'BaseOfRange', such as 'MonthOfYear',
unless the field has a range of

FOREVER

, when only
the base unit is mentioned, such as 'Year' or 'Era'.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** the name of the field, not null

Method Detail

- getDisplayName

```java
default
String
getDisplayName​(
Locale
locale)
```

Gets the display name for the field in the requested locale.

If there is no display name for the locale then a suitable default must be returned.

The default implementation must check the locale is not null
and return

toString()

.

**Parameters:** locale

- the locale to use, not null
**Returns:** the display name for the locale or a suitable default, not null

- getBaseUnit

```java
TemporalUnit
getBaseUnit()
```

Gets the unit that the field is measured in.

The unit of the field is the period that varies within the range.
For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the unit is 'Months'.
See also

getRangeUnit()

.

**Returns:** the unit defining the base unit of the field, not null

- getRangeUnit

```java
TemporalUnit
getRangeUnit()
```

Gets the range that the field is bound by.

The range of the field is the period that the field varies within.
For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the range is 'Years'.
See also

getBaseUnit()

.

The range is never null. For example, the 'Year' field is shorthand for
'YearOfForever'. It therefore has a unit of 'Years' and a range of 'Forever'.

**Returns:** the unit defining the range of the field, not null

- range

```java
ValueRange
range()
```

Gets the range of valid values for the field.

All fields can be expressed as a

long

integer.
This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.
This method is generally only applicable to the ISO-8601 calendar system.

Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.

**Returns:** the range of valid values for the field, not null

- isDateBased

```java
boolean isDateBased()
```

Checks if this field represents a component of a date.

A field is date-based if it can be derived from

EPOCH_DAY

.
Note that it is valid for both

isDateBased()

and

isTimeBased()

to return false, such as when representing a field like minute-of-week.

**Returns:** true if this field is a component of a date

- isTimeBased

```java
boolean isTimeBased()
```

Checks if this field represents a component of a time.

A field is time-based if it can be derived from

NANO_OF_DAY

.
Note that it is valid for both

isDateBased()

and

isTimeBased()

to return false, such as when representing a field like minute-of-week.

**Returns:** true if this field is a component of a time

- isSupportedBy

```java
boolean isSupportedBy​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Checks if this field is supported by the temporal object.

This determines whether the temporal accessor supports this field.
If this returns false, then the temporal cannot be queried for this field.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalAccessor.isSupported(TemporalField)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.isSupportedBy(temporal);
temporal = temporal.isSupported(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

isSupported(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should determine whether they are supported using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to query, not null
**Returns:** true if the date-time can be queried for this field, false if not

- rangeRefinedBy

```java
ValueRange
rangeRefinedBy​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Get the range of valid values for this field using the temporal object to
refine the result.

This uses the temporal object to find the range of valid values for the field.
This is similar to

range()

, however this method refines the result
using the temporal. For example, if the field is

DAY_OF_MONTH

the

range

method is not accurate as there are four possible month lengths,
28, 29, 30 and 31 days. Using this method with a date allows the range to be
accurate, returning just one of those four options.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalAccessor.range(TemporalField)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.rangeRefinedBy(temporal);
temporal = temporal.range(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

range(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.
If the field is not supported an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object used to refine the result, not null
**Returns:** the range of valid values for this field, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the range for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported by the temporal

- getFrom

```java
long getFrom​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Gets the value of this field from the specified temporal object.

This queries the temporal object for the value of this field.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalAccessor.getLong(TemporalField)

(or

TemporalAccessor.get(TemporalField)

):

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.getFrom(temporal);
temporal = temporal.getLong(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

getLong(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.
If the field is not supported an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to query, not null
**Returns:** the value of this field, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported by the temporal
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- adjustInto

```java
<R extends
Temporal
> R adjustInto​(R temporal,
long newValue)
```

Returns a copy of the specified temporal object with the value of this field set.

This returns a new temporal object based on the specified one with the value for
this field changed. For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to
set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object has the same observable type as the specified object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the implementation is responsible for resolving the result.
Typically it will choose the previous valid date, which would be the last valid
day of February in this example.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisField.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisField);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach,

with(TemporalField)

,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
available in

ChronoField

.
If the field is not supported an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

Implementations must not alter the specified temporal object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the Temporal object
**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to adjust, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field
**Returns:** the adjusted temporal object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported by the temporal
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- resolve

```java
default
TemporalAccessor
resolve​(
Map
<
TemporalField
,​
Long
> fieldValues,

TemporalAccessor
partialTemporal,

ResolverStyle
resolverStyle)
```

Resolves this field to provide a simpler alternative or a date.

This method is invoked during the resolve phase of parsing.
It is designed to allow application defined fields to be simplified into
more standard fields, such as those on

ChronoField

, or into a date.

Applications should not normally invoke this method directly.

**Implementation Requirements:** If an implementation represents a field that can be simplified, or
combined with others, then this method must be implemented.

The specified map contains the current state of the parse.
The map is mutable and must be mutated to resolve the field and
any related fields. This method will only be invoked during parsing
if the map contains this field, and implementations should therefore
assume this field is present.

Resolving a field will consist of looking at the value of this field,
and potentially other fields, and either updating the map with a
simpler value, such as a

ChronoField

, or returning a
complete

ChronoLocalDate

. If a resolve is successful,
the code must remove all the fields that were resolved from the map,
including this field.

For example, the

IsoFields

class contains the quarter-of-year
and day-of-quarter fields. The implementation of this method in that class
resolves the two fields plus the

YEAR

into a
complete

LocalDate

. The resolve method will remove all three
fields from the map before returning the

LocalDate

.

A partially complete temporal is used to allow the chronology and zone
to be queried. In general, only the chronology will be needed.
Querying items other than the zone or chronology is undefined and
must not be relied on.
The behavior of other methods such as

get

,

getLong

,

range

and

isSupported

is unpredictable and the results undefined.

If resolution should be possible, but the data is invalid, the resolver
style should be used to determine an appropriate level of leniency, which
may require throwing a

DateTimeException

or

ArithmeticException

.
If no resolution is possible, the resolve method must return null.

When resolving time fields, the map will be altered and null returned.
When resolving date fields, the date is normally returned from the method,
with the map altered to remove the resolved fields. However, it would also
be acceptable for the date fields to be resolved into other

ChronoField

instances that can produce a date, such as

EPOCH_DAY

.

Not all

TemporalAccessor

implementations are accepted as return values.
Implementations that call this method must accept

ChronoLocalDate

,

ChronoLocalDateTime

,

ChronoZonedDateTime

and

LocalTime

.

The default implementation must return null.

adjustInto

```java
<R extends
Temporal
> R adjustInto​(R temporal,
long newValue)
```

Returns a copy of the specified temporal object with the value of this field set.

This returns a new temporal object based on the specified one with the value for
this field changed. For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to
set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object has the same observable type as the specified object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the implementation is responsible for resolving the result.
Typically it will choose the previous valid date, which would be the last valid
day of February in this example.

The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

resolve

```java
default
TemporalAccessor
resolve​(
Map
<
TemporalField
,​
Long
> fieldValues,

TemporalAccessor
partialTemporal,

ResolverStyle
resolverStyle)
```

Resolves this field to provide a simpler alternative or a date.

This method is invoked during the resolve phase of parsing.
It is designed to allow application defined fields to be simplified into
more standard fields, such as those on

ChronoField

, or into a date.

Applications should not normally invoke this method directly.

**Implementation Requirements:** If an implementation represents a field that can be simplified, or
combined with others, then this method must be implemented.

The specified map contains the current state of the parse.
The map is mutable and must be mutated to resolve the field and
any related fields. This method will only be invoked during parsing
if the map contains this field, and implementations should therefore
assume this field is present.

Resolving a field will consist of looking at the value of this field,
and potentially other fields, and either updating the map with a
simpler value, such as a

ChronoField

, or returning a
complete

ChronoLocalDate

. If a resolve is successful,
the code must remove all the fields that were resolved from the map,
including this field.

For example, the

IsoFields

class contains the quarter-of-year
and day-of-quarter fields. The implementation of this method in that class
resolves the two fields plus the

YEAR

into a
complete

LocalDate

. The resolve method will remove all three
fields from the map before returning the

LocalDate

.

A partially complete temporal is used to allow the chronology and zone
to be queried. In general, only the chronology will be needed.
Querying items other than the zone or chronology is undefined and
must not be relied on.
The behavior of other methods such as

get

,

getLong

,

range

and

isSupported

is unpredictable and the results undefined.

If resolution should be possible, but the data is invalid, the resolver
style should be used to determine an appropriate level of leniency, which
may require throwing a

DateTimeException

or

ArithmeticException

.
If no resolution is possible, the resolve method must return null.

When resolving time fields, the map will be altered and null returned.
When resolving date fields, the date is normally returned from the method,
with the map altered to remove the resolved fields. However, it would also
be acceptable for the date fields to be resolved into other

ChronoField

instances that can produce a date, such as

EPOCH_DAY

.

Not all

TemporalAccessor

implementations are accepted as return values.
Implementations that call this method must accept

ChronoLocalDate

,

ChronoLocalDateTime

,

ChronoZonedDateTime

and

LocalTime

.

The default implementation must return null.
**Parameters:** fieldValues

- the map of fields to values, which can be updated, not null
**Parameters:** partialTemporal

- the partially complete temporal to query for zone and
chronology; querying for other things is undefined and not recommended, not null
**Parameters:** resolverStyle

- the requested type of resolve, not null
**Returns:** the resolved temporal object; null if resolving only
changed the map, or no resolve occurred
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if resolving results in an error. This must not be thrown
by querying a field on the temporal without first checking if it is supported
