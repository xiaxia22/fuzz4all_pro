# Interface DOMErrorHandler

**Source:** `java.xml\org\w3c\dom\DOMErrorHandler.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
DOMErrorHandler
```

DOMErrorHandler

is a callback interface that the DOM
implementation can call when reporting errors that happens while
processing XML data, or when doing some other processing (e.g. validating
a document). A

DOMErrorHandler

object can be attached to a

Document

using the "error-handler" on the

DOMConfiguration

interface. If more than one error needs to
be reported during an operation, the sequence and numbers of the errors
passed to the error handler are implementation dependent.

The application that is using the DOM implementation is expected to
implement this interface.

error)

This method is called on the error handler when an error occurs.

If an exception is thrown from this method, it is considered to be
equivalent of returning

true

.

**Parameters:**
- error

- The error object that describes the error. This object
may be reused by the DOM implementation across multiple calls to
the

handleError

method.

**Returns:**
- If the

handleError

method returns

false

, the DOM implementation should stop the current
processing when possible. If the method returns

true

,
the processing may continue depending on
