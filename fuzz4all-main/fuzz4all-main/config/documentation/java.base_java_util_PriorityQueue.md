# Class PriorityQueue<E>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\PriorityQueue.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
PriorityQueue<E>

extends
AbstractQueue
<E>
implements
Serializable
```

An unbounded priority

queue

based on a priority heap.
The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their

natural ordering

, or by a

Comparator

provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is
used. A priority queue does not permit

null

elements.
A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit
insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in

ClassCastException

).

The

head

of this queue is the

least

element
with respect to the specified ordering. If multiple elements are
tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are
broken arbitrarily. The queue retrieval operations

poll

,

remove

,

peek

, and

element

access the
element at the head of the queue.

A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal

capacity

governing the size of an array used to store the
elements on the queue. It is always at least as large as the queue
size. As elements are added to a priority queue, its capacity
grows automatically. The details of the growth policy are not
specified.

This class and its iterator implement all of the

optional

methods of the

Collection

and

Iterator

interfaces. The Iterator provided in method

iterator()

and the Spliterator provided in method

spliterator()

are

not

guaranteed to traverse the elements of
the priority queue in any particular order. If you need ordered
traversal, consider using

Arrays.sort(pq.toArray())

.

Note that this implementation is not synchronized.

Multiple threads should not access a

PriorityQueue

instance concurrently if any of the threads modifies the queue.
Instead, use the thread-safe

PriorityBlockingQueue

class.

Implementation note: this implementation provides
O(log(n)) time for the enqueuing and dequeuing methods
(

offer

,

poll

,

remove()

and

add

);
linear time for the

remove(Object)

and

contains(Object)

methods; and constant time for the retrieval methods
(

peek

,

element

, and

size

).

This class is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

**Type Parameters:** E

- the type of elements held in this queue

- offer

in interface

Queue

<

E

>

compared with elements currently in this priority queue
according to the priority queue's ordering
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null

---

#### public boolean remove​(
Object
o)

Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue,
if it is present. More formally, removes an element

e

such
that

o.equals(e)

, if this queue contains one or more such
elements. Returns

true

if and only if this queue contained
the specified element (or equivalently, if this queue changed as a
result of the call).

**Specified by:**
- remove

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- remove

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- o

- element to be removed from this queue, if present

**Returns:**
- true

if this queue changed as a result of the call

---

#### public boolean contains​(
Object
o)

Returns

true

if this queue contains the specified element.
More formally, returns

true

if and only if this queue contains
at least one element

e

such that

o.equals(e)

.

**Specified by:**
- contains

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- contains

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- o

- object to be checked for containment in this queue

**Returns:**
- true

if this queue contains the specified element

---

#### public
Object
[] toArray()

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue.
The elements are in no particular order.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this queue. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this queue

---

#### public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue; the
runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
The returned array elements are in no particular order.
If the queue fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
specified array and the size of this queue.

If the queue fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than the queue), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a queue known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- a

- the array into which the elements of the queue are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose.

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this queue

**Throws:**
- ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this queue
- NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection

---

#### public
Iterator
<
E
> iterator()

Returns an iterator over the elements in this queue. The iterator
does not return the elements in any particular order.

**Specified by:**
- iterator

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
- iterator

in interface

Iterable

<

E

>
- iterator

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- an iterator over the elements in this queue

---

#### public void clear()

Removes all of the elements from this priority queue.
The queue will be empty after this call returns.

**Specified by:**
- clear

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- clear

in class

AbstractQueue

<

E

>

---

#### public
Comparator
<? super
E
> comparator()

Returns the comparator used to order the elements in this
queue, or

null

if this queue is sorted according to
the

natural ordering

of its elements.

**Returns:**
- the comparator used to order this queue, or

null

if this queue is sorted according to the
natural ordering of its elements

---

#### public final
Spliterator
<
E
> spliterator()

Creates a

late-binding

and

fail-fast

Spliterator

over the elements in this
queue. The spliterator does not traverse elements in any particular order
(the

ORDERED

characteristic is not reported).

The

Spliterator

reports

Spliterator.SIZED

,

Spliterator.SUBSIZED

, and

Spliterator.NONNULL

.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- add

```java
public boolean add​(
E
e)
```

Inserts the specified element into this priority queue.

**Specified by:** add

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Specified by:** add

in interface

Queue

<

E

>
**Overrides:** add

in class

AbstractQueue

<

E

>
**Parameters:** e

- the element to add
**Returns:** true

(as specified by

Collection.add(E)

)
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the specified element cannot be
compared with elements currently in this priority queue
according to the priority queue's ordering
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null

- offer

```java
public boolean offer​(
E
e)
```

Inserts the specified element into this priority queue.

**Specified by:** offer

in interface

Queue

<

E

>
**Parameters:** e

- the element to add
**Returns:** true

(as specified by

Queue.offer(E)

)
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the specified element cannot be
compared with elements currently in this priority queue
according to the priority queue's ordering
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null

- remove

```java
public boolean remove​(
Object
o)
```

Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue,
if it is present. More formally, removes an element

e

such
that

o.equals(e)

, if this queue contains one or more such
elements. Returns

true

if and only if this queue contained
the specified element (or equivalently, if this queue changed as a
result of the call).

**Specified by:** remove

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** remove

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** o

- element to be removed from this queue, if present
**Returns:** true

if this queue changed as a result of the call

- contains

```java
public boolean contains​(
Object
o)
```

Returns

true

if this queue contains the specified element.
More formally, returns

true

if and only if this queue contains
at least one element

e

such that

o.equals(e)

.

**Specified by:** contains

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** contains

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** o

- object to be checked for containment in this queue
**Returns:** true

if this queue contains the specified element

- toArray

```java
public
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue.
The elements are in no particular order.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this queue. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this queue

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue; the
runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
The returned array elements are in no particular order.
If the queue fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
specified array and the size of this queue.

If the queue fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than the queue), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a queue known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Type Parameters:** T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection
**Parameters:** a

- the array into which the elements of the queue are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose.
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this queue
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this queue
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

- iterator

```java
public
Iterator
<
E
> iterator()
```

Returns an iterator over the elements in this queue. The iterator
does not return the elements in any particular order.

**Specified by:** iterator

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Specified by:** iterator

in interface

Iterable

<

E

>
**Specified by:** iterator

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Returns:** an iterator over the elements in this queue

- clear

```java
public void clear()
```

Removes all of the elements from this priority queue.
The queue will be empty after this call returns.

**Specified by:** clear

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** clear

in class

AbstractQueue

<

E

>

- comparator

```java
public
Comparator
<? super
E
> comparator()
```

Returns the comparator used to order the elements in this
queue, or

null

if this queue is sorted according to
the

natural ordering

of its elements.

**Returns:** the comparator used to order this queue, or

null

if this queue is sorted according to the
natural ordering of its elements

- spliterator

```java
public final
Spliterator
<
E
> spliterator()
```

Creates a

late-binding

and

fail-fast

Spliterator

over the elements in this
queue. The spliterator does not traverse elements in any particular order
(the

ORDERED

characteristic is not reported).

The

Spliterator

reports

Spliterator.SIZED

,

Spliterator.SUBSIZED

, and

Spliterator.NONNULL

.
Overriding implementations should document the reporting of additional
characteristic values.

**Specified by:** spliterator

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Specified by:** spliterator

in interface

Iterable

<

E

>
**Returns:** a

Spliterator

over the elements in this queue
**Since:** 1.8

- removeIf

```java
public boolean removeIf​(
Predicate
<? super
E
> filter)
```

Description copied from interface:

Collection

Removes all of the elements of this collection that satisfy the given
predicate. Errors or runtime exceptions thrown during iteration or by
the predicate are relayed to the caller.

**Specified by:** removeIf

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** filter

- a predicate which returns

true

for elements to be
removed
**Returns:** true

if any elements were removed
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- removeAll

```java
public boolean removeAll​(
Collection
<?> c)

Removes all of this collection's elements that are also contained in the
specified collection (optional operation). After this call returns,
this collection will contain no elements in common with the specified
collection.

**Specified by:** removeAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** removeAll

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection containing elements to be removed from this collection
**Returns:** true

if this collection changed as a result of the
call
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if this collection contains one or more
null elements and the specified collection does not support
null elements
(

optional

),
or if the specified collection is null
**See Also:** AbstractCollection.remove(Object)

,

AbstractCollection.contains(Object)

- retainAll

```java
public boolean retainAll​(
Collection
<?> c)
```

Description copied from class:

AbstractCollection

Retains only the elements in this collection that are contained in the
specified collection (optional operation). In other words, removes from
this collection all of its elements that are not contained in the
specified collection.

**Specified by:** retainAll

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** retainAll

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** c

- collection containing elements to be retained in this collection
**Returns:** true

- forEach

```java
public void forEach​(
Consumer
<? super
E
> action)
```

Description copied from interface:

Iterable

Performs the given action for each element of the

Iterable

until all elements have been processed or the action throws an
exception. Actions are performed in the order of iteration, if that
order is specified. Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the
caller.

The behavior of this method is unspecified if the action performs
side-effects that modify the underlying source of elements, unless an
overriding class has specified a concurrent modification policy.

**Specified by:** forEach

in interface

Iterable

<

E

>
**Parameters:** action

- The action to be performed for each element
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- toArray

```java

```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue.
The elements are in no particular order.

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this queue. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue; the
runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
The returned array elements are in no particular order.
If the queue fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
specified array and the size of this queue.

If the queue fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than the queue), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a queue known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.
