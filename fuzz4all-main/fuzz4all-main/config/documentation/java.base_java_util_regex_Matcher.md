# Class Matcher

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\regex\Matcher.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
Matcher

extends
Object

implements
MatchResult
```

An engine that performs match operations on a

character sequence

by interpreting a

Pattern

.

A matcher is created from a pattern by invoking the pattern's

matcher

method. Once created, a matcher can be used to
perform three different kinds of match operations:

- The

matches

method attempts to match the entire
input sequence against the pattern.
- The

lookingAt

method attempts to match the
input sequence, starting at the beginning, against the pattern.
- The

find

method scans the input sequence looking
for the next subsequence that matches the pattern.

Each of these methods returns a boolean indicating success or failure.
More information about a successful match can be obtained by querying the
state of the matcher.

A matcher finds matches in a subset of its input called the

region

. By default, the region contains all of the matcher's input.
The region can be modified via the

region

method
and queried via the

regionStart

and

regionEnd

methods. The way that the region boundaries interact
with some pattern constructs can be changed. See

useAnchoringBounds

and

useTransparentBounds

for more details.

This class also defines methods for replacing matched subsequences with
new strings whose contents can, if desired, be computed from the match
result. The

appendReplacement

and

appendTail

methods can be used in tandem in order to collect
the result into an existing string buffer or string builder. Alternatively,
the more convenient

replaceAll

method can be used to
create a string in which every matching subsequence in the input sequence
is replaced.

The explicit state of a matcher includes the start and end indices of
the most recent successful match. It also includes the start and end
indices of the input subsequence captured by each

capturing group

in the pattern as well as a total
count of such subsequences. As a convenience, methods are also provided for
returning these captured subsequences in string form.

The explicit state of a matcher is initially undefined; attempting to
query any part of it before a successful match will cause an

IllegalStateException

to be thrown. The explicit state of a matcher is
recomputed by every match operation.

The implicit state of a matcher includes the input character sequence as
well as the

append position

, which is initially zero and is updated
by the

appendReplacement

method.

A matcher may be reset explicitly by invoking its

reset()

method or, if a new input sequence is desired, its

reset(CharSequence)

method. Resetting a
matcher discards its explicit state information and sets the append position
to zero.

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

### Method Details

#### public
Pattern
pattern()

Returns the pattern that is interpreted by this matcher.

**Returns:**
- The pattern for which this matcher was created

---

#### public
MatchResult
toMatchResult()

Returns the match state of this matcher as a

MatchResult

.
The result is unaffected by subsequent operations performed upon this
matcher.

**Returns:**
- a

MatchResult

with the state of this matcher

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
Matcher
usePattern​(
Pattern
newPattern)

Changes the

Pattern

that this

Matcher

uses to
find matches with.

This method causes this matcher to lose information
about the groups of the last match that occurred. The
matcher's position in the input is maintained and its
last append position is unaffected.

**Parameters:**
- newPattern

- The new pattern used by this matcher

**Returns:**
- This matcher

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If newPattern is

null

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
Matcher
reset()

Resets this matcher.

Resetting a matcher discards all of its explicit state information
and sets its append position to zero. The matcher's region is set to the
default region, which is its entire character sequence. The anchoring
and transparency of this matcher's region boundaries are unaffected.

**Returns:**
- This matcher

---

#### public
Matcher
reset​(
CharSequence
input)

Resets this matcher with a new input sequence.

Resetting a matcher discards all of its explicit state information
and sets its append position to zero. The matcher's region is set to
the default region, which is its entire character sequence. The
anchoring and transparency of this matcher's region boundaries are
unaffected.

**Parameters:**
- input

- The new input character sequence

**Returns:**
- This matcher

---

#### public int start()

Returns the start index of the previous match.

**Specified by:**
- start

in interface

MatchResult

**Returns:**
- The index of the first character matched

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed

---

#### public int start​(int group)

Returns the start index of the subsequence captured by the given group
during the previous match operation.

Capturing groups

are indexed from left
to right, starting at one. Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
the expression

m.

start(0)

is equivalent to

m.

start()

.

**Specified by:**
- start

in interface

MatchResult

**Parameters:**
- group

- The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern

**Returns:**
- The index of the first character captured by the group,
or

-1

if the match was successful but the group
itself did not match anything

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If there is no capturing group in the pattern
with the given index

---

#### public int start​(
String
name)

Returns the start index of the subsequence captured by the given

named-capturing group

during the
previous match operation.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of a named-capturing group in this matcher's pattern

**Returns:**
- The index of the first character captured by the group,
or

-1

if the match was successful but the group
itself did not match anything

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
- IllegalArgumentException

- If there is no capturing group in the pattern
with the given name

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public int end()

Returns the offset after the last character matched.

---

#### public int end​(int group)

Returns the offset after the last character of the subsequence
captured by the given group during the previous match operation.

Capturing groups

are indexed from left
to right, starting at one. Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
the expression

m.

end(0)

is equivalent to

m.

end()

.

**Specified by:**
- end

in interface

MatchResult

**Parameters:**
- group

- The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern

**Returns:**
- The offset after the last character captured by the group,
or

-1

if the match was successful
but the group itself did not match anything

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If there is no capturing group in the pattern
with the given index

---

#### public int end​(
String
name)

captured by the given

named-capturing
group

during the previous match operation.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of a named-capturing group in this matcher's pattern

**Returns:**
- The offset after the last character captured by the group,
or

-1

if the match was successful
but the group itself did not match anything

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

or if the previous match operation failed
- IllegalArgumentException

- If there is no capturing group in the pattern
with the given name

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public
String
group()

Returns the input subsequence matched by the previous match.

For a matcher

m

with input sequence

s

,
the expressions

m.

group()

and

s.

substring(

m.

start(),

m.

end())

are equivalent.

Note that some patterns, for example

a*

, match the empty
string. This method will return the empty string when the pattern
successfully matches the empty string in the input.

**Specified by:**
- group

in interface

MatchResult

**Returns:**
- The (possibly empty) subsequence matched by the previous match,
in string form

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed

---

#### public
String
group​(int group)

Returns the input subsequence captured by the given group during the
previous match operation.

For a matcher

m

, input sequence

s

, and group index

g

, the expressions

m.

group(

g

)

and

s.

substring(

m.

start(

g

),

m.

end(

g

))

are equivalent.

Capturing groups

are indexed from left
to right, starting at one. Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
the expression

m.group(0)

is equivalent to

m.group()

.

If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match
any part of the input sequence, then

null

is returned. Note
that some groups, for example

(a*)

, match the empty string.
This method will return the empty string when such a group successfully
matches the empty string in the input.

**Specified by:**
- group

in interface

MatchResult

**Parameters:**
- group

- The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern

**Returns:**
- The (possibly empty) subsequence captured by the group
during the previous match, or

null

if the group
failed to match part of the input

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If there is no capturing group in the pattern
with the given index

---

#### public
String
group​(
String
name)

Returns the input subsequence captured by the given

named-capturing group

during the
previous match operation.

If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match
any part of the input sequence, then

null

is returned. Note
that some groups, for example

(a*)

, match the empty string.
This method will return the empty string when such a group successfully
matches the empty string in the input.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of a named-capturing group in this matcher's pattern

**Returns:**
- The (possibly empty) subsequence captured by the named group
during the previous match, or

null

if the group
failed to match part of the input

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
- IllegalArgumentException

- If there is no capturing group in the pattern
with the given name

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public int groupCount()

Returns the number of capturing groups in this matcher's pattern.

Group zero denotes the entire pattern by convention. It is not
included in this count.

Any non-negative integer smaller than or equal to the value
returned by this method is guaranteed to be a valid group index for
this matcher.

**Specified by:**
- groupCount

in interface

MatchResult

**Returns:**
- The number of capturing groups in this matcher's pattern

---

#### public boolean matches()

Attempts to match the entire region against the pattern.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, the entire region sequence
matches this matcher's pattern

---

#### public boolean find()

Attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches
the pattern.

This method starts at the beginning of this matcher's region, or, if
a previous invocation of the method was successful and the matcher has
not since been reset, at the first character not matched by the previous
match.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, a subsequence of the input
sequence matches this matcher's pattern

---

#### public boolean find​(int start)

Resets this matcher and then attempts to find the next subsequence of
the input sequence that matches the pattern, starting at the specified
index.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods, and subsequent
invocations of the

find()

method will start at the first
character not matched by this match.

**Parameters:**
- start

- the index to start searching for a match

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, a subsequence of the input
sequence starting at the given index matches this matcher's
pattern

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If start is less than zero or if start is greater than the
length of the input sequence.

---

#### public boolean lookingAt()

Attempts to match the input sequence, starting at the beginning of the
region, against the pattern.

Like the

matches

method, this method always starts
at the beginning of the region; unlike that method, it does not
require that the entire region be matched.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, a prefix of the input
sequence matches this matcher's pattern

---

#### public static
String
quoteReplacement​(
String
s)

Returns a literal replacement

String

for the specified

String

.

This method produces a

String

that will work
as a literal replacement

s

in the

appendReplacement

method of the

Matcher

class.
The

String

produced will match the sequence of characters
in

s

treated as a literal sequence. Slashes ('\') and
dollar signs ('$') will be given no special meaning.

**Parameters:**
- s

- The string to be literalized

**Returns:**
- A literal string replacement

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
Matcher
appendReplacement​(
StringBuffer
sb,

String
replacement)

Implements a non-terminal append-and-replace step.

This method performs the following actions:

- It reads characters from the input sequence, starting at the
append position, and appends them to the given string buffer. It
stops after reading the last character preceding the previous match,
that is, the character at index

start()

-

1

.
- It appends the given replacement string to the string buffer.
- It sets the append position of this matcher to the index of
the last character matched, plus one, that is, to

end()

.

The replacement string may contain references to subsequences
captured during the previous match: Each occurrence of

${

name

}

or

$

g

will be replaced by the result of evaluating the corresponding

group(name)

or

group(g)

respectively. For

$

g

,
the first number after the

$

is always treated as part of
the group reference. Subsequent numbers are incorporated into g if
they would form a legal group reference. Only the numerals '0'
through '9' are considered as potential components of the group
reference. If the second group matched the string

"foo"

, for
example, then passing the replacement string

"$2bar"

would
cause

"foobar"

to be appended to the string buffer. A dollar
sign (

$

) may be included as a literal in the replacement
string by preceding it with a backslash (

\$

).

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

This method is intended to be used in a loop together with the

appendTail

and

find

methods. The following code, for example, writes

one dog two dogs
in the yard

to the standard-output stream:

```java
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("cat");
Matcher m = p.matcher("one cat two cats in the yard");
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
while (m.find()) {
m.appendReplacement(sb, "dog");
}
m.appendTail(sb);
System.out.println(sb.toString());
```

**Parameters:**
- sb

- The target string buffer
- replacement

- The replacement string

**Returns:**
- This matcher

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the replacement string refers to a named-capturing
group that does not exist in the pattern
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If the replacement string refers to a capturing group
that does not exist in the pattern

---

#### public
Matcher
appendReplacement​(
StringBuilder
sb,

String
replacement)

Implements a non-terminal append-and-replace step.

This method performs the following actions:

- It reads characters from the input sequence, starting at the
append position, and appends them to the given string builder. It
stops after reading the last character preceding the previous match,
that is, the character at index

start()

-

1

.
- It appends the given replacement string to the string builder.
- It sets the append position of this matcher to the index of
the last character matched, plus one, that is, to

end()

.

The replacement string may contain references to subsequences
captured during the previous match: Each occurrence of

$

g

will be replaced by the result of
evaluating

group

(

g

)

.
The first number after the

$

is always treated as part of
the group reference. Subsequent numbers are incorporated into g if
they would form a legal group reference. Only the numerals '0'
through '9' are considered as potential components of the group
reference. If the second group matched the string

"foo"

, for
example, then passing the replacement string

"$2bar"

would
cause

"foobar"

to be appended to the string builder. A dollar
sign (

$

) may be included as a literal in the replacement
string by preceding it with a backslash (

\$

).

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

This method is intended to be used in a loop together with the

appendTail

and

find

methods. The following code, for example, writes

one dog two dogs in the yard

to the standard-output stream:

```java
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("cat");
Matcher m = p.matcher("one cat two cats in the yard");
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
while (m.find()) {
m.appendReplacement(sb, "dog");
}
m.appendTail(sb);
System.out.println(sb.toString());
```

**Parameters:**
- sb

- The target string builder
- replacement

- The replacement string

**Returns:**
- This matcher

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the replacement string refers to a named-capturing
group that does not exist in the pattern
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If the replacement string refers to a capturing group
that does not exist in the pattern

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public
StringBuffer
appendTail​(
StringBuffer
sb)

Implements a terminal append-and-replace step.

This method reads characters from the input sequence, starting at
the append position, and appends them to the given string buffer. It is
intended to be invoked after one or more invocations of the

appendReplacement

method in
order to copy the remainder of the input sequence.

**Parameters:**
- sb

- The target string buffer

**Returns:**
- The target string buffer

---

#### public
StringBuilder
appendTail​(
StringBuilder
sb)

Implements a terminal append-and-replace step.

This method reads characters from the input sequence, starting at
the append position, and appends them to the given string builder. It is
intended to be invoked after one or more invocations of the

appendReplacement

method in order to copy the remainder of the input
sequence.

**Parameters:**
- sb

- The target string builder

**Returns:**
- The target string builder

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public
String
replaceAll​(
String
replacement)

Replaces every subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
pattern with the given replacement string.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for matches of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of any match are appended directly to the result string; each match
is replaced in the result by the replacement string. The replacement
string may contain references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

Given the regular expression

a*b

, the input

"aabfooaabfooabfoob"

, and the replacement string

"-"

, an invocation of this method on a matcher for that
expression would yield the string

"-foo-foo-foo-"

.

Invoking this method changes this matcher's state. If the matcher
is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
reset.

**Parameters:**
- replacement

- The replacement string

**Returns:**
- The string constructed by replacing each matching subsequence
by the replacement string, substituting captured subsequences
as needed

---

#### public
String
replaceAll​(
Function
<
MatchResult
,​
String
> replacer)

Replaces every subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
pattern with the result of applying the given replacer function to the
match result of this matcher corresponding to that subsequence.
Exceptions thrown by the function are relayed to the caller.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for matches of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of any match are appended directly to the result string; each match
is replaced in the result by the applying the replacer function that
returns a replacement string. Each replacement string may contain
references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
a replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

Given the regular expression

dog

, the input

"zzzdogzzzdogzzz"

, and the function

mr -> mr.group().toUpperCase()

, an invocation of this method on
a matcher for that expression would yield the string

"zzzDOGzzzDOGzzz"

.

Invoking this method changes this matcher's state. If the matcher
is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
reset.

The replacer function should not modify this matcher's state during
replacement. This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if such modification is
detected.

The state of each match result passed to the replacer function is
guaranteed to be constant only for the duration of the replacer function
call and only if the replacer function does not modify this matcher's
state.

**Parameters:**
- replacer

- The function to be applied to the match result of this matcher
that returns a replacement string.

**Returns:**
- The string constructed by replacing each matching subsequence
with the result of applying the replacer function to that
matched subsequence, substituting captured subsequences as
needed.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the replacer function is null
- ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected, on a
best-effort basis, that the replacer function modified this
matcher's state

**Since:**
- 9

**Implementation Note:**
- This implementation applies the replacer function to this matcher, which
is an instance of

MatchResult

.

---

#### public
Stream
<
MatchResult
> results()

Returns a stream of match results for each subsequence of the input
sequence that matches the pattern. The match results occur in the
same order as the matching subsequences in the input sequence.

Each match result is produced as if by

toMatchResult()

.

This method does not reset this matcher. Matching starts on
initiation of the terminal stream operation either at the beginning of
this matcher's region, or, if the matcher has not since been reset, at
the first character not matched by a previous match.

If the matcher is to be used for further matching operations after
the terminal stream operation completes then it should be first reset.

This matcher's state should not be modified during execution of the
returned stream's pipeline. The returned stream's source

Spliterator

is

fail-fast

and will, on a best-effort
basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if such
modification is detected.

**Returns:**
- a sequential stream of match results.

**Since:**
- 9

pattern with the given replacement string.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for a match of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of the match are appended directly to the result string; the match
is replaced in the result by the replacement string. The replacement
string may contain references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it

#### public
Matcher
region​(int start,
int end)

Sets the limits of this matcher's region. The region is the part of the
input sequence that will be searched to find a match. Invoking this
method resets the matcher, and then sets the region to start at the
index specified by the

start

parameter and end at the
index specified by the

end

parameter.

Depending on the transparency and anchoring being used (see

useTransparentBounds

and

useAnchoringBounds

), certain
constructs such as anchors may behave differently at or around the
boundaries of the region.

**Parameters:**
- start

- The index to start searching at (inclusive)
- end

- The index to end searching at (exclusive)

**Returns:**
- this matcher

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If start or end is less than zero, if
start is greater than the length of the input sequence, if
end is greater than the length of the input sequence, or if
start is greater than end.

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public int regionStart()

Reports the start index of this matcher's region. The
searches this matcher conducts are limited to finding matches
within

regionStart

(inclusive) and

regionEnd

(exclusive).

**Returns:**
- The starting point of this matcher's region

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public int regionEnd()

Reports the end index (exclusive) of this matcher's region.
The searches this matcher conducts are limited to finding matches
within

regionStart

(inclusive) and

regionEnd

(exclusive).

**Returns:**
- the ending point of this matcher's region

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public boolean hasTransparentBounds()

Queries the transparency of region bounds for this matcher.

This method returns

true

if this matcher uses

transparent

bounds,

false

if it uses

opaque

bounds.

See

useTransparentBounds

for a
description of transparent and opaque bounds.

By default, a matcher uses opaque region boundaries.

**Returns:**
- true

iff this matcher is using transparent bounds,

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- useTransparentBounds(boolean)

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
Matcher
useTransparentBounds​(boolean b)

Sets the transparency of region bounds for this matcher.

Invoking this method with an argument of

true

will set this
matcher to use

transparent

bounds. If the boolean
argument is

false

, then

opaque

bounds will be used.

Using transparent bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region are transparent to lookahead, lookbehind,
and boundary matching constructs. Those constructs can see beyond the
boundaries of the region to see if a match is appropriate.

Using opaque bounds, the boundaries of this matcher's
region are opaque to lookahead, lookbehind, and boundary matching
constructs that may try to see beyond them. Those constructs cannot
look past the boundaries so they will fail to match anything outside
of the region.

By default, a matcher uses opaque bounds.

**Parameters:**
- b

- a boolean indicating whether to use opaque or transparent
regions

**Returns:**
- this matcher

**See Also:**
- hasTransparentBounds()

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public boolean hasAnchoringBounds()

Queries the anchoring of region bounds for this matcher.

This method returns

true

if this matcher uses

anchoring

bounds,

false

otherwise.

See

useAnchoringBounds

for a
description of anchoring bounds.

By default, a matcher uses anchoring region boundaries.

**Returns:**
- true

iff this matcher is using anchoring bounds,

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- useAnchoringBounds(boolean)

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
Matcher
useAnchoringBounds​(boolean b)

Sets the anchoring of region bounds for this matcher.

Invoking this method with an argument of

true

will set this
matcher to use

anchoring

bounds. If the boolean
argument is

false

, then

non-anchoring

bounds will be
used.

Using anchoring bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region match anchors such as ^ and $.

Without anchoring bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region will not match anchors such as ^ and $.

By default, a matcher uses anchoring region boundaries.

**Parameters:**
- b

- a boolean indicating whether or not to use anchoring bounds.

**Returns:**
- this matcher

**See Also:**
- hasAnchoringBounds()

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns the string representation of this matcher. The
string representation of a

Matcher

contains information
that may be useful for debugging. The exact format is unspecified.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- The string representation of this matcher

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public boolean hitEnd()

Returns true if the end of input was hit by the search engine in
the last match operation performed by this matcher.

When this method returns true, then it is possible that more input
would have changed the result of the last search.

**Returns:**
- true iff the end of input was hit in the last match; false
otherwise

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public boolean requireEnd()

Returns true if more input could change a positive match into a
negative one.

If this method returns true, and a match was found, then more
input could cause the match to be lost. If this method returns false
and a match was found, then more input might change the match but the
match won't be lost. If a match was not found, then requireEnd has no
meaning.

**Returns:**
- true iff more input could change a positive match into a
negative one.

**Since:**
- 1.5

java.util.regex.Matcher

**All Implemented Interfaces:** MatchResult

```java
public final class
Matcher

extends
Object

implements
MatchResult
```

An engine that performs match operations on a

character sequence

by interpreting a

Pattern

.

A matcher is created from a pattern by invoking the pattern's

matcher

method. Once created, a matcher can be used to
perform three different kinds of match operations:

- The

matches

method attempts to match the entire
input sequence against the pattern.
- The

lookingAt

method attempts to match the
input sequence, starting at the beginning, against the pattern.
- The

find

method scans the input sequence looking
for the next subsequence that matches the pattern.

Each of these methods returns a boolean indicating success or failure.
More information about a successful match can be obtained by querying the
state of the matcher.

A matcher finds matches in a subset of its input called the

region

. By default, the region contains all of the matcher's input.
The region can be modified via the

region

method
and queried via the

regionStart

and

regionEnd

methods. The way that the region boundaries interact
with some pattern constructs can be changed. See

useAnchoringBounds

and

useTransparentBounds

for more details.

This class also defines methods for replacing matched subsequences with
new strings whose contents can, if desired, be computed from the match
result. The

appendReplacement

and

appendTail

methods can be used in tandem in order to collect
the result into an existing string buffer or string builder. Alternatively,
the more convenient

replaceAll

method can be used to
create a string in which every matching subsequence in the input sequence
is replaced.

The explicit state of a matcher includes the start and end indices of
the most recent successful match. It also includes the start and end
indices of the input subsequence captured by each

capturing group

in the pattern as well as a total
count of such subsequences. As a convenience, methods are also provided for
returning these captured subsequences in string form.

The explicit state of a matcher is initially undefined; attempting to
query any part of it before a successful match will cause an

IllegalStateException

to be thrown. The explicit state of a matcher is
recomputed by every match operation.

The implicit state of a matcher includes the input character sequence as
well as the

append position

, which is initially zero and is updated
by the

appendReplacement

method.

A matcher may be reset explicitly by invoking its

reset()

method or, if a new input sequence is desired, its

reset(CharSequence)

method. Resetting a
matcher discards its explicit state information and sets the append position
to zero.

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

- usePattern

```java
public
Matcher
usePattern​(
Pattern
newPattern)
```

Changes the

Pattern

that this

Matcher

uses to
find matches with.

This method causes this matcher to lose information
about the groups of the last match that occurred. The
matcher's position in the input is maintained and its
last append position is unaffected.

```

Resets this matcher.

Resetting a matcher discards all of its explicit state information
and sets its append position to zero. The matcher's region is set to the
default region, which is its entire character sequence. The anchoring
and transparency of this matcher's region boundaries are unaffected.

**Returns:** This matcher

- reset

```java
public
Matcher
reset​(
CharSequence
input)
```

Resets this matcher with a new input sequence.

Resetting a matcher discards all of its explicit state information
and sets its append position to zero. The matcher's region is set to
the default region, which is its entire character sequence. The

captured by the given group during the previous match operation.

Capturing groups

are indexed from left
to right, starting at one. Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
the expression

m.

end(0)

is equivalent to

m.

end()

.

**Specified by:** end

in interface

MatchResult
**Parameters:** group

- The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern
**Returns:** The offset after the last character captured by the group,
or

- group

```java
public
String
group()
```

Returns the input subsequence matched by the previous match.

For a matcher

m

with input sequence

s

,
the expressions

m.

group()

and

s.

substring(

m.

start(),

m.

end())

are equivalent.

Note that some patterns, for example

a*

, match the empty
string. This method will return the empty string when the pattern
successfully matches the empty string in the input.

**Specified by:** group

in interface

MatchResult
**Returns:** The (possibly empty) subsequence matched by the previous match,
in string form
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed

- group

```java
public
String
group​(int group)
```

Returns the input subsequence captured by the given group during the
previous match operation.

For a matcher

m

, input sequence

s

g

, the expressions

m.

group(

g

)

and

s.

substring(

m.

start(

g

),

m.

end(

g

))

are equivalent.

Capturing groups

are indexed from left
to right, starting at one. Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
the expression

m.group(0)

is equivalent to

m.group()

.

If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match
any part of the input sequence, then

null

is returned. Note
that some groups, for example

(a*)

, match the empty string.
This method will return the empty string when such a group successfully
matches the empty string in the input.

**Specified by:** group

in interface

MatchResult
**Parameters:** group

- The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern
**Returns:** The (possibly empty) subsequence captured by the group
during the previous match, or

null

if the group
failed to match part of the input
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If there is no capturing group in the pattern
with the given index

- group

```java
public
String
group​(
String
name)
```

Returns the input subsequence captured by the given

named-capturing group

during the
previous match operation.

If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match
any part of the input sequence, then

null

is returned. Note
that some groups, for example

(a*)

, match the empty string.
This method will return the empty string when such a group successfully
matches the empty string in the input.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of a named-capturing group in this matcher's pattern
**Returns:** The (possibly empty) subsequence captured by the named group
during the previous match, or

null

if the group
failed to match part of the input

**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If there is no capturing group in the pattern
with the given name
**Since:** 1.7

- groupCount

```java
public int groupCount()
```

Returns the number of capturing groups in this matcher's pattern.

Group zero denotes the entire pattern by convention. It is not
included in this count.

Any non-negative integer smaller than or equal to the value
returned by this method is guaranteed to be a valid group index for
this matcher.

**Specified by:** groupCount

in interface

MatchResult
**Returns:** The number of capturing groups in this matcher's pattern

- matches

```java
public boolean matches()
```

Attempts to match the entire region against the pattern.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, the entire region sequence
matches this matcher's pattern

- find

```java
public boolean find()
```

Attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches
the pattern.

This method starts at the beginning of this matcher's region, or, if
a previous invocation of the method was successful and the matcher has
not since been reset, at the first character not matched by the previous
match.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, a subsequence of the input
sequence matches this matcher's pattern

- find

```java
public boolean find​(int start)
```

Resets this matcher and then attempts to find the next subsequence of
the input sequence that matches the pattern, starting at the specified
index.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods, and subsequent
invocations of the

find()

method will start at the first
character not matched by this match.

**Parameters:** start

- the index to start searching for a match
**Returns:** true

if, and only if, a subsequence of the input
sequence starting at the given index matches this matcher's
pattern
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If start is less than zero or if start is greater than the
length of the input sequence.

- lookingAt

```java
public boolean lookingAt()
```

Attempts to match the input sequence, starting at the beginning of the
region, against the pattern.

Like the

matches

method, this method always starts
at the beginning of the region; unlike that method, it does not
require that the entire region be matched.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, a prefix of the input
sequence matches this matcher's pattern

- quoteReplacement

```java
public static
String
quoteReplacement​(
String
s)
```

Returns a literal replacement

String

for the specified

String

.

This method produces a

String

that will work
as a literal replacement

s

in the

appendReplacement

method of the

Matcher

class.
The

String

produced will match the sequence of characters
in

s

treated as a literal sequence. Slashes ('\') and
dollar signs ('$') will be given no special meaning.

**Parameters:** s

- The string to be literalized
**Returns:** A literal string replacement
**Since:** 1.5

- appendReplacement

```java
public
Matcher
appendReplacement​(
StringBuffer
sb,

String
replacement)
```

Implements a non-terminal append-and-replace step.

This method performs the following actions:

- It reads characters from the input sequence, starting at the
append position, and appends them to the given string buffer. It
stops after reading the last character preceding the previous match,
that is, the character at index

start()

-

1

.
- It appends the given replacement string to the string buffer.
- It sets the append position of this matcher to the index of
the last character matched, plus one, that is, to

end()

.

The replacement string may contain references to subsequences
captured during the previous match: Each occurrence of

${

name

}

or

$

g

will be replaced by the result of evaluating the corresponding

group(name)

or

group(g)

respectively. For

$

g

,
the first number after the

$

is always treated as part of
the group reference. Subsequent numbers are incorporated into g if
they would form a legal group reference. Only the numerals '0'
through '9' are considered as potential components of the group
reference. If the second group matched the string

"foo"

, for
example, then passing the replacement string

"$2bar"

would
cause

"foobar"

to be appended to the string buffer. A dollar
sign (

$

) may be included as a literal in the replacement
string by preceding it with a backslash (

\$

).

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

This method is intended to be used in a loop together with the

appendTail

and

find

methods. The following code, for example, writes

one dog two dogs
in the yard

to the standard-output stream:

```java
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("cat");
Matcher m = p.matcher("one cat two cats in the yard");
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
while (m.find()) {
m.appendReplacement(sb, "dog");
}
m.appendTail(sb);
System.out.println(sb.toString());
```

**Parameters:** sb

- The target string buffer
**Parameters:** replacement

- The replacement string
**Returns:** This matcher
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the replacement string refers to a named-capturing
group that does not exist in the pattern
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If the replacement string refers to a capturing group
that does not exist in the pattern

- appendReplacement

```java
public
Matcher
appendReplacement​(
StringBuilder
sb,

String
replacement)
```

Implements a non-terminal append-and-replace step.

This method performs the following actions:

- It reads characters from the input sequence, starting at the
append position, and appends them to the given string builder. It
stops after reading the last character preceding the previous match,
that is, the character at index

start()

-

1

.
- It appends the given replacement string to the string builder.
- It sets the append position of this matcher to the index of
the last character matched, plus one, that is, to

end()

.

The replacement string may contain references to subsequences
captured during the previous match: Each occurrence of

$

g

will be replaced by the result of
evaluating

group

(

g

)

.
The first number after the

$

is always treated as part of
the group reference. Subsequent numbers are incorporated into g if
they would form a legal group reference. Only the numerals '0'
through '9' are considered as potential components of the group
reference. If the second group matched the string

"foo"

, for
example, then passing the replacement string

"$2bar"

would
cause

"foobar"

to be appended to the string builder. A dollar
sign (

$

) may be included as a literal in the replacement
string by preceding it with a backslash (

\$

).

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

This method is intended to be used in a loop together with the

appendTail

and

find

methods. The following code, for example, writes

one dog two dogs in the yard

to the standard-output stream:

```java
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("cat");
Matcher m = p.matcher("one cat two cats in the yard");
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
while (m.find()) {
m.appendReplacement(sb, "dog");
}
m.appendTail(sb);
System.out.println(sb.toString());
```

**Parameters:** sb

- The target string builder
**Parameters:** replacement

- The replacement string
**Returns:** This matcher
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the replacement string refers to a named-capturing
group that does not exist in the pattern
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If the replacement string refers to a capturing group
that does not exist in the pattern
**Since:** 9

- appendTail

```java
public
StringBuffer
appendTail​(
StringBuffer
sb)
```

Implements a terminal append-and-replace step.

This method reads characters from the input sequence, starting at
the append position, and appends them to the given string buffer. It is
intended to be invoked after one or more invocations of the

appendReplacement

method in
order to copy the remainder of the input sequence.

**Parameters:** sb

- The target string buffer
**Returns:** The target string buffer

- appendTail

```java
public
StringBuilder
appendTail​(
StringBuilder
sb)
```

Implements a terminal append-and-replace step.

This method reads characters from the input sequence, starting at
the append position, and appends them to the given string builder. It is
intended to be invoked after one or more invocations of the

appendReplacement

method in order to copy the remainder of the input
sequence.

**Parameters:** sb

- The target string builder
**Returns:** The target string builder
**Since:** 9

- replaceAll

```java
public
String
replaceAll​(
String
replacement)
```

Replaces every subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
pattern with the given replacement string.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for matches of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of any match are appended directly to the result string; each match
is replaced in the result by the replacement string. The replacement
string may contain references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

Given the regular expression

a*b

, the input

"aabfooaabfooabfoob"

, and the replacement string

"-"

, an invocation of this method on a matcher for that
expression would yield the string

"-foo-foo-foo-"

.

Invoking this method changes this matcher's state. If the matcher
is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
reset.

**Parameters:** replacement

- The replacement string
**Returns:** The string constructed by replacing each matching subsequence
by the replacement string, substituting captured subsequences
as needed

- replaceAll

```java
public
String
replaceAll​(
Function
<
MatchResult
,​
String
> replacer)
```

Replaces every subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
pattern with the result of applying the given replacer function to the
match result of this matcher corresponding to that subsequence.
Exceptions thrown by the function are relayed to the caller.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for matches of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of any match are appended directly to the result string; each match
is replaced in the result by the applying the replacer function that
returns a replacement string. Each replacement string may contain
references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
a replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

Given the regular expression

dog

, the input

"zzzdogzzzdogzzz"

, and the function

mr -> mr.group().toUpperCase()

, an invocation of this method on
a matcher for that expression would yield the string

"zzzDOGzzzDOGzzz"

.

Invoking this method changes this matcher's state. If the matcher
is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
reset.

The replacer function should not modify this matcher's state during
replacement. This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if such modification is
detected.

The state of each match result passed to the replacer function is
guaranteed to be constant only for the duration of the replacer function
call and only if the replacer function does not modify this matcher's
state.

**Implementation Note:** This implementation applies the replacer function to this matcher, which
is an instance of

MatchResult

.
**Parameters:** replacer

- The function to be applied to the match result of this matcher
that returns a replacement string.
**Returns:** The string constructed by replacing each matching subsequence
with the result of applying the replacer function to that
matched subsequence, substituting captured subsequences as
needed.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the replacer function is null
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected, on a
best-effort basis, that the replacer function modified this
matcher's state
**Since:** 9

- results

```java
public
Stream
<
MatchResult
> results()
```

Returns a stream of match results for each subsequence of the input
sequence that matches the pattern. The match results occur in the
same order as the matching subsequences in the input sequence.

Each match result is produced as if by

toMatchResult()

.

This method does not reset this matcher. Matching starts on
initiation of the terminal stream operation either at the beginning of
this matcher's region, or, if the matcher has not since been reset, at
the first character not matched by a previous match.

If the matcher is to be used for further matching operations after
the terminal stream operation completes then it should be first reset.

This matcher's state should not be modified during execution of the
returned stream's pipeline. The returned stream's source

Spliterator

is

fail-fast

and will, on a best-effort
basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if such
modification is detected.

**Returns:** a sequential stream of match results.
**Since:** 9

- replaceFirst

```java
public
String
replaceFirst​(
String
replacement)
```

Replaces the first subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
pattern with the given replacement string.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for a match of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of the match are appended directly to the result string; the match
is replaced in the result by the replacement string. The replacement
string may contain references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

Given the regular expression

dog

, the input

"zzzdogzzzdogzzz"

, and the replacement string

"cat"

, an invocation of this method on a matcher for that
expression would yield the string

"zzzcatzzzdogzzz"

.

Invoking this method changes this matcher's state. If the matcher
is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
reset.

**Parameters:** replacement

- The replacement string
**Returns:** The string constructed by replacing the first matching
subsequence by the replacement string, substituting captured
subsequences as needed

- replaceFirst

```java
public
String
replaceFirst​(
Function
<
MatchResult
,​
String
> replacer)
```

Replaces the first subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
pattern with the result of applying the given replacer function to the
match result of this matcher corresponding to that subsequence.
Exceptions thrown by the replace function are relayed to the caller.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for a match of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of the match are appended directly to the result string; the match
is replaced in the result by the applying the replacer function that
returns a replacement string. The replacement string may contain
references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

Given the regular expression

dog

, the input

"zzzdogzzzdogzzz"

, and the function

mr -> mr.group().toUpperCase()

, an invocation of this method on
a matcher for that expression would yield the string

"zzzDOGzzzdogzzz"

.

Invoking this method changes this matcher's state. If the matcher
is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
reset.

The replacer function should not modify this matcher's state during
replacement. This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if such modification is
detected.

The state of the match result passed to the replacer function is
guaranteed to be constant only for the duration of the replacer function
call and only if the replacer function does not modify this matcher's
state.

**Implementation Note:** This implementation applies the replacer function to this matcher, which
is an instance of

MatchResult

.
**Parameters:** replacer

- The function to be applied to the match result of this matcher
that returns a replacement string.
**Returns:** The string constructed by replacing the first matching
subsequence with the result of applying the replacer function to
the matched subsequence, substituting captured subsequences as
needed.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the replacer function is null
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected, on a
best-effort basis, that the replacer function modified this
matcher's state
**Since:** 9

- region

```java
public
Matcher
region​(int start,
int end)
```

Sets the limits of this matcher's region. The region is the part of the
input sequence that will be searched to find a match. Invoking this
method resets the matcher, and then sets the region to start at the
index specified by the

start

parameter and end at the
index specified by the

end

parameter.

Depending on the transparency and anchoring being used (see

useTransparentBounds

and

useAnchoringBounds

), certain
constructs such as anchors may behave differently at or around the
boundaries of the region.

**Parameters:** start

- The index to start searching at (inclusive)
**Parameters:** end

- The index to end searching at (exclusive)
**Returns:** this matcher
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If start or end is less than zero, if
start is greater than the length of the input sequence, if
end is greater than the length of the input sequence, or if
start is greater than end.
**Since:** 1.5

- regionStart

```java
public int regionStart()
```

Reports the start index of this matcher's region. The
searches this matcher conducts are limited to finding matches
within

regionStart

(inclusive) and

regionEnd

(exclusive).

**Returns:** The starting point of this matcher's region
**Since:** 1.5

- regionEnd

```java
public int regionEnd()
```

Reports the end index (exclusive) of this matcher's region.
The searches this matcher conducts are limited to finding matches
within

regionStart

(inclusive) and

regionEnd

(exclusive).

**Returns:** the ending point of this matcher's region
**Since:** 1.5

- hasTransparentBounds

```java
public boolean hasTransparentBounds()
```

Queries the transparency of region bounds for this matcher.

This method returns

true

if this matcher uses

transparent

bounds,

false

if it uses

opaque

bounds.

See

useTransparentBounds

for a
description of transparent and opaque bounds.

By default, a matcher uses opaque region boundaries.

**Returns:** true

iff this matcher is using transparent bounds,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** useTransparentBounds(boolean)

- useTransparentBounds

```java
public
Matcher
useTransparentBounds​(boolean b)
```

Sets the transparency of region bounds for this matcher.

Invoking this method with an argument of

true

will set this
matcher to use

transparent

bounds. If the boolean
argument is

false

, then

opaque

bounds will be used.

Using transparent bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region are transparent to lookahead, lookbehind,
and boundary matching constructs. Those constructs can see beyond the
boundaries of the region to see if a match is appropriate.

Using opaque bounds, the boundaries of this matcher's
region are opaque to lookahead, lookbehind, and boundary matching
constructs that may try to see beyond them. Those constructs cannot
look past the boundaries so they will fail to match anything outside
of the region.

By default, a matcher uses opaque bounds.

**Parameters:** b

- a boolean indicating whether to use opaque or transparent
regions
**Returns:** this matcher
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** hasTransparentBounds()

- hasAnchoringBounds

```java
public boolean hasAnchoringBounds()
```

Queries the anchoring of region bounds for this matcher.

This method returns

true

if this matcher uses

anchoring

bounds,

false

otherwise.

See

useAnchoringBounds

for a
description of anchoring bounds.

By default, a matcher uses anchoring region boundaries.

**Returns:** true

iff this matcher is using anchoring bounds,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** useAnchoringBounds(boolean)

- useAnchoringBounds

```java
public
Matcher
useAnchoringBounds​(boolean b)
```

Sets the anchoring of region bounds for this matcher.

Invoking this method with an argument of

true

will set this
matcher to use

anchoring

bounds. If the boolean
argument is

false

, then

non-anchoring

bounds will be
used.

Using anchoring bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region match anchors such as ^ and $.

Without anchoring bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region will not match anchors such as ^ and $.

By default, a matcher uses anchoring region boundaries.

**Parameters:** b

- a boolean indicating whether or not to use anchoring bounds.
**Returns:** this matcher
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** hasAnchoringBounds()

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the string representation of this matcher. The
string representation of a

Matcher

contains information
that may be useful for debugging. The exact format is unspecified.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** The string representation of this matcher
**Since:** 1.5

- hitEnd

```java
public boolean hitEnd()
```

Returns true if the end of input was hit by the search engine in
the last match operation performed by this matcher.

When this method returns true, then it is possible that more input
would have changed the result of the last search.

**Returns:** true iff the end of input was hit in the last match; false
otherwise
**Since:** 1.5

- requireEnd

```java
public boolean requireEnd()
```

Returns true if more input could change a positive match into a
negative one.

If this method returns true, and a match was found, then more
input could cause the match to be lost. If this method returns false
and a match was found, then more input might change the match but the
match won't be lost. If a match was not found, then requireEnd has no
meaning.

**Returns:** true iff more input could change a positive match into a
negative one.
**Since:** 1.5

is equivalent to

m.

end()

.

**Specified by:** end

in interface

MatchResult
**Parameters:** group

- The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern

For a matcher

m

with input sequence

s

,
the expressions

m.

group()

and

s.

substring(

m.

start(),

m.

end())

are equivalent.

Note that some patterns, for example

, match the empty
string. This method will return the empty string when the pattern
successfully matches the empty string in the input.

**Specified by:** group

in interface

MatchResult
**Returns:** The (possibly empty) subsequence matched by the previous match,
in string form
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed

- group

s.

substring(

m.

start(

g

),

m.

end(

g

))

are equivalent.

Capturing groups

are indexed from left
to right, starting at one. Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
the expression

m.group(0)

is equivalent to

m.group()

.

If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match
any part of the input sequence, then

null

is returned. Note
that some groups, for example

or if the previous match operation failed
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If there is no capturing group in the pattern
with the given index

- group

```java
public
String
group​(
String
name)
```

Returns the input subsequence captured by the given

named-capturing group

during the
previous match operation.

If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match
any part of the input sequence, then

null

is returned. Note
that some groups, for example

- If there is no capturing group in the pattern
with the given name
**Since:** 1.7

- groupCount

```java
public int groupCount()
```

Returns the number of capturing groups in this matcher's pattern.

Group zero denotes the entire pattern by convention. It is not
included in this count.

Any non-negative integer smaller than or equal to the value
returned by this method is guaranteed to be a valid group index for
this matcher.

**Specified by:** groupCount

in interface

MatchResult
**Returns:** The number of capturing groups in this matcher's pattern

- matches

```java
public boolean matches()
```

Attempts to match the entire region against the pattern.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, the entire region sequence
matches this matcher's pattern

- find

```java
public boolean find()
```

Attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches
the pattern.

This method starts at the beginning of this matcher's region, or, if
a previous invocation of the method was successful and the matcher has
not since been reset, at the first character not matched by the previous
match.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, a subsequence of the input
sequence matches this matcher's pattern

- find

```java
public boolean find​(int start)
```

Resets this matcher and then attempts to find the next subsequence of
the input sequence that matches the pattern, starting at the specified
index.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods, and subsequent
invocations of the

find()

method will start at the first
character not matched by this match.

**Parameters:** start

- the index to start searching for a match
**Returns:** true

if, and only if, a subsequence of the input
sequence starting at the given index matches this matcher's
pattern
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If start is less than zero or if start is greater than the
length of the input sequence.

- lookingAt

```java
public boolean lookingAt()
```

Attempts to match the input sequence, starting at the beginning of the
region, against the pattern.

Like the

matches

method, this method always starts
at the beginning of the region; unlike that method, it does not
require that the entire region be matched.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, a prefix of the input
sequence matches this matcher's pattern

- quoteReplacement

```java
public static
String
quoteReplacement​(
String
s)
```

Returns a literal replacement

String

for the specified

String

.

This method produces a

String

that will work
as a literal replacement

s

in the

appendReplacement

method of the

Matcher

class.
The

String

produced will match the sequence of characters
in

s

treated as a literal sequence. Slashes ('\') and
dollar signs ('$') will be given no special meaning.

**Parameters:** s

- The string to be literalized
**Returns:** A literal string replacement
**Since:** 1.5

- appendReplacement

```java
public
Matcher
appendReplacement​(
StringBuffer
sb,

String
replacement)
```

Implements a non-terminal append-and-replace step.

This method performs the following actions:

- It reads characters from the input sequence, starting at the
append position, and appends them to the given string buffer. It
stops after reading the last character preceding the previous match,
that is, the character at index

start()

-

1

.
- It appends the given replacement string to the string buffer.
- It sets the append position of this matcher to the index of
the last character matched, plus one, that is, to

end()

.

The replacement string may contain references to subsequences
captured during the previous match: Each occurrence of

${

name

}

or

$

g

will be replaced by the result of evaluating the corresponding

group(name)

or

group(g)

respectively. For

$

g

,
the first number after the

$

is always treated as part of
the group reference. Subsequent numbers are incorporated into g if
they would form a legal group reference. Only the numerals '0'
through '9' are considered as potential components of the group
reference. If the second group matched the string

"foo"

, for
example, then passing the replacement string

"$2bar"

would
cause

"foobar"

to be appended to the string buffer. A dollar
sign (

$

) may be included as a literal in the replacement
string by preceding it with a backslash (

\$

).

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

This method is intended to be used in a loop together with the

appendTail

and

find

methods. The following code, for example, writes

one dog two dogs
in the yard

to the standard-output stream:

```java
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("cat");
Matcher m = p.matcher("one cat two cats in the yard");
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
while (m.find()) {
m.appendReplacement(sb, "dog");
}
m.appendTail(sb);
System.out.println(sb.toString());
```

**Parameters:** sb

- The target string buffer
**Parameters:** replacement

- The replacement string
**Returns:** This matcher
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the replacement string refers to a named-capturing
group that does not exist in the pattern
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If the replacement string refers to a capturing group
that does not exist in the pattern

- appendReplacement

```java
public
Matcher
appendReplacement​(
StringBuilder
sb,

String
replacement)
```

Implements a non-terminal append-and-replace step.

This method performs the following actions:

- It reads characters from the input sequence, starting at the
append position, and appends them to the given string builder. It
stops after reading the last character preceding the previous match,
that is, the character at index

start()

-

1

.
- It appends the given replacement string to the string builder.
- It sets the append position of this matcher to the index of
the last character matched, plus one, that is, to

end()

.

The replacement string may contain references to subsequences
captured during the previous match: Each occurrence of

$

g

will be replaced by the result of
evaluating

group

(

g

)

.
The first number after the

$

is always treated as part of
the group reference. Subsequent numbers are incorporated into g if
they would form a legal group reference. Only the numerals '0'
through '9' are considered as potential components of the group
reference. If the second group matched the string

"foo"

, for
example, then passing the replacement string

"$2bar"

would
cause

"foobar"

to be appended to the string builder. A dollar
sign (

$

) may be included as a literal in the replacement
string by preceding it with a backslash (

\$

).

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

This method is intended to be used in a loop together with the

appendTail

and

find

methods. The following code, for example, writes

one dog two dogs in the yard

to the standard-output stream:

```java
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("cat");
Matcher m = p.matcher("one cat two cats in the yard");
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
while (m.find()) {
m.appendReplacement(sb, "dog");
}
m.appendTail(sb);
System.out.println(sb.toString());
```

**Parameters:** sb

- The target string builder
**Parameters:** replacement

- The replacement string
**Returns:** This matcher
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the replacement string refers to a named-capturing
group that does not exist in the pattern
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If the replacement string refers to a capturing group
that does not exist in the pattern
**Since:** 9

- appendTail

```java
public
StringBuffer
appendTail​(
StringBuffer
sb)
```

Implements a terminal append-and-replace step.

This method reads characters from the input sequence, starting at
the append position, and appends them to the given string buffer. It is
intended to be invoked after one or more invocations of the

appendReplacement

method in
order to copy the remainder of the input sequence.

**Parameters:** sb

- The target string buffer
**Returns:** The target string buffer

- appendTail

```java
public
StringBuilder
appendTail​(
StringBuilder
sb)
```

Implements a terminal append-and-replace step.

This method reads characters from the input sequence, starting at
the append position, and appends them to the given string builder. It is
intended to be invoked after one or more invocations of the

appendReplacement

method in order to copy the remainder of the input
sequence.

**Parameters:** sb

- The target string builder
**Returns:** The target string builder
**Since:** 9

- replaceAll

```java
public
String
replaceAll​(
String
replacement)
```

Replaces every subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
pattern with the given replacement string.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for matches of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of any match are appended directly to the result string; each match
is replaced in the result by the replacement string. The replacement
string may contain references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

Given the regular expression

a*b

, the input

"aabfooaabfooabfoob"

, and the replacement string

"-"

, an invocation of this method on a matcher for that
expression would yield the string

"-foo-foo-foo-"

.

Invoking this method changes this matcher's state. If the matcher
is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
reset.

**Parameters:** replacement

- The replacement string
**Returns:** The string constructed by replacing each matching subsequence
by the replacement string, substituting captured subsequences
as needed

- replaceAll

```java
public
String
replaceAll​(
Function
<
MatchResult
,​
String
> replacer)
```

Replaces every subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
pattern with the result of applying the given replacer function to the
match result of this matcher corresponding to that subsequence.
Exceptions thrown by the function are relayed to the caller.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for matches of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of any match are appended directly to the result string; each match
is replaced in the result by the applying the replacer function that
returns a replacement string. Each replacement string may contain
references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
a replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

Given the regular expression

dog

, the input

"zzzdogzzzdogzzz"

, and the function

mr -> mr.group().toUpperCase()

, an invocation of this method on
a matcher for that expression would yield the string

"zzzDOGzzzDOGzzz"

.

Invoking this method changes this matcher's state. If the matcher
is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
reset.

The replacer function should not modify this matcher's state during
replacement. This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if such modification is
detected.

The state of each match result passed to the replacer function is
guaranteed to be constant only for the duration of the replacer function
call and only if the replacer function does not modify this matcher's
state.

**Implementation Note:** This implementation applies the replacer function to this matcher, which
is an instance of

MatchResult

.
**Parameters:** replacer

- The function to be applied to the match result of this matcher
that returns a replacement string.
**Returns:** The string constructed by replacing each matching subsequence
with the result of applying the replacer function to that
matched subsequence, substituting captured subsequences as
needed.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the replacer function is null
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected, on a
best-effort basis, that the replacer function modified this
matcher's state
**Since:** 9

- results

```java
public
Stream
<
MatchResult
> results()
```

Returns a stream of match results for each subsequence of the input
sequence that matches the pattern. The match results occur in the
same order as the matching subsequences in the input sequence.

Each match result is produced as if by

toMatchResult()

.

This method does not reset this matcher. Matching starts on
initiation of the terminal stream operation either at the beginning of
this matcher's region, or, if the matcher has not since been reset, at
the first character not matched by a previous match.

If the matcher is to be used for further matching operations after
the terminal stream operation completes then it should be first reset.

This matcher's state should not be modified during execution of the
returned stream's pipeline. The returned stream's source

Spliterator

is

fail-fast

and will, on a best-effort
basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if such
modification is detected.

**Returns:** a sequential stream of match results.
**Since:** 9

- replaceFirst

```java
public
String
replaceFirst​(
String
replacement)
```

Replaces the first subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
pattern with the given replacement string.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for a match of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of the match are appended directly to the result string; the match
is replaced in the result by the replacement string. The replacement
string may contain references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

Given the regular expression

dog

, the input

"zzzdogzzzdogzzz"

, and the replacement string

"cat"

, an invocation of this method on a matcher for that
expression would yield the string

"zzzcatzzzdogzzz"

.

Invoking this method changes this matcher's state. If the matcher
is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
reset.

**Parameters:** replacement

- The replacement string
**Returns:** The string constructed by replacing the first matching
subsequence by the replacement string, substituting captured
subsequences as needed

- replaceFirst

```java
public
String
replaceFirst​(
Function
<
MatchResult
,​
String
> replacer)
```

Replaces the first subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
pattern with the result of applying the given replacer function to the
match result of this matcher corresponding to that subsequence.
Exceptions thrown by the replace function are relayed to the caller.

This method first resets this matcher. It then scans the input
sequence looking for a match of the pattern. Characters that are not
part of the match are appended directly to the result string; the match
is replaced in the result by the applying the replacer function that
returns a replacement string. The replacement string may contain
references to captured subsequences as in the

appendReplacement

method.

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

Given the regular expression

dog

, the input

"zzzdogzzzdogzzz"

, and the function

mr -> mr.group().toUpperCase()

, an invocation of this method on
a matcher for that expression would yield the string

"zzzDOGzzzdogzzz"

.

Invoking this method changes this matcher's state. If the matcher
is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
reset.

The replacer function should not modify this matcher's state during
replacement. This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if such modification is
detected.

The state of the match result passed to the replacer function is
guaranteed to be constant only for the duration of the replacer function
call and only if the replacer function does not modify this matcher's
state.

**Implementation Note:** This implementation applies the replacer function to this matcher, which
is an instance of

MatchResult

.
**Parameters:** replacer

- The function to be applied to the match result of this matcher
that returns a replacement string.
**Returns:** The string constructed by replacing the first matching
subsequence with the result of applying the replacer function to
the matched subsequence, substituting captured subsequences as
needed.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the replacer function is null
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected, on a
best-effort basis, that the replacer function modified this
matcher's state
**Since:** 9

- region

```java
public
Matcher
region​(int start,
int end)
```

Sets the limits of this matcher's region. The region is the part of the
input sequence that will be searched to find a match. Invoking this
method resets the matcher, and then sets the region to start at the
index specified by the

start

parameter and end at the
index specified by the

end

parameter.

Depending on the transparency and anchoring being used (see

useTransparentBounds

and

useAnchoringBounds

), certain
constructs such as anchors may behave differently at or around the
boundaries of the region.

**Parameters:** start

- The index to start searching at (inclusive)
**Parameters:** end

- The index to end searching at (exclusive)
**Returns:** this matcher
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If start or end is less than zero, if
start is greater than the length of the input sequence, if
end is greater than the length of the input sequence, or if
start is greater than end.
**Since:** 1.5

- regionStart

```java
public int regionStart()
```

Reports the start index of this matcher's region. The
searches this matcher conducts are limited to finding matches
within

regionStart

(inclusive) and

regionEnd

(exclusive).

**Returns:** The starting point of this matcher's region
**Since:** 1.5

- regionEnd

```java
public int regionEnd()
```

Reports the end index (exclusive) of this matcher's region.
The searches this matcher conducts are limited to finding matches
within

regionStart

(inclusive) and

regionEnd

(exclusive).

**Returns:** the ending point of this matcher's region
**Since:** 1.5

- hasTransparentBounds

```java
public boolean hasTransparentBounds()
```

Queries the transparency of region bounds for this matcher.

This method returns

true

if this matcher uses

transparent

bounds,

false

if it uses

opaque

bounds.

See

useTransparentBounds

for a
description of transparent and opaque bounds.

By default, a matcher uses opaque region boundaries.

**Returns:** true

iff this matcher is using transparent bounds,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** useTransparentBounds(boolean)

- useTransparentBounds

```java
public
Matcher
useTransparentBounds​(boolean b)
```

Sets the transparency of region bounds for this matcher.

Invoking this method with an argument of

true

will set this
matcher to use

transparent

bounds. If the boolean
argument is

false

, then

opaque

bounds will be used.

Using transparent bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region are transparent to lookahead, lookbehind,
and boundary matching constructs. Those constructs can see beyond the
boundaries of the region to see if a match is appropriate.

Using opaque bounds, the boundaries of this matcher's
region are opaque to lookahead, lookbehind, and boundary matching
constructs that may try to see beyond them. Those constructs cannot
look past the boundaries so they will fail to match anything outside
of the region.

By default, a matcher uses opaque bounds.

**Parameters:** b

- a boolean indicating whether to use opaque or transparent
regions
**Returns:** this matcher
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** hasTransparentBounds()

- hasAnchoringBounds

```java
public boolean hasAnchoringBounds()
```

Queries the anchoring of region bounds for this matcher.

This method returns

true

if this matcher uses

anchoring

bounds,

false

otherwise.

See

useAnchoringBounds

for a
description of anchoring bounds.

By default, a matcher uses anchoring region boundaries.

**Returns:** true

iff this matcher is using anchoring bounds,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** useAnchoringBounds(boolean)

- useAnchoringBounds

```java
public
Matcher
useAnchoringBounds​(boolean b)
```

Sets the anchoring of region bounds for this matcher.

Invoking this method with an argument of

true

will set this
matcher to use

anchoring

bounds. If the boolean
argument is

false

, then

non-anchoring

bounds will be
used.

Using anchoring bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region match anchors such as ^ and $.

Without anchoring bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region will not match anchors such as ^ and $.

By default, a matcher uses anchoring region boundaries.

**Parameters:** b

- a boolean indicating whether or not to use anchoring bounds.
**Returns:** this matcher
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** hasAnchoringBounds()

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()

**Returns:** The string representation of this matcher
**Since:** 1.5

- hitEnd

```java
public boolean hitEnd()
```

Returns true if the end of input was hit by the search engine in
the last match operation performed by this matcher.

When this method returns true, then it is possible that more input
would have changed the result of the last search.

**Returns:** true iff the end of input was hit in the last match; false
otherwise
**Since:** 1.5

- requireEnd

```java
public boolean requireEnd()
```

Returns true if more input could change a positive match into a
negative one.

If this method returns true, and a match was found, then more
input could cause the match to be lost. If this method returns false
and a match was found, then more input might change the match but the
match won't be lost. If a match was not found, then requireEnd has no
meaning.

**Returns:** true iff more input could change a positive match into a
negative one.
**Since:** 1.5

#### lookingAt

public boolean lookingAt()

Attempts to match the input sequence, starting at the beginning of the
region, against the pattern.

Like the

matches

method, this method always starts
at the beginning of the region; unlike that method, it does not
require that the entire region be matched.

If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the

start

,

end

, and

group

methods.

for the specified

String

.

This method produces a

String

that will work
as a literal replacement

s

in the

appendReplacement

method of the

Matcher

class.
The

String

produced will match the sequence of characters
in

s

treated as a literal sequence. Slashes ('\') and
dollar signs ('$') will be given no special meaning.

**Parameters:** s

- The string to be literalized
**Returns:** A literal string replacement
**Since:** 1.5

appendReplacement

```java
public
Matcher
appendReplacement​(
StringBuffer
sb,

String
replacement)
```

Implements a non-terminal append-and-replace step.

This method performs the following actions:

- It reads characters from the input sequence, starting at the
append position, and appends them to the given string buffer. It
stops after reading the last character preceding the previous match,
that is, the character at index

start()

-

1

.
- It appends the given replacement string to the string buffer.
- It sets the append position of this matcher to the index of
the last character matched, plus one, that is, to

end()

.

The replacement string may contain references to subsequences
captured during the previous match: Each occurrence of

${

name

}

or

$

g

will be replaced by the result of evaluating the corresponding

group(name)

or

group(g)

respectively. For

$

g

,
the first number after the

$

is always treated as part of
the group reference. Subsequent numbers are incorporated into g if
they would form a legal group reference. Only the numerals '0'
through '9' are considered as potential components of the group
reference. If the second group matched the string

"foo"

, for
example, then passing the replacement string

"$2bar"

would
cause

"foobar"

to be appended to the string buffer. A dollar
sign (

$

) may be included as a literal in the replacement
string by preceding it with a backslash (

\$

).

Note that backslashes (

\

) and dollar signs (

$

) in
the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
string.

This method is intended to be used in a loop together with the

appendTail

and

find

methods. The following code, for example, writes

one dog two dogs
in the yard

to the standard-output stream:

```java
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("cat");
Matcher m = p.matcher("one cat two cats in the yard");
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
while (m.find()) {
m.appendReplacement(sb, "dog");
}
m.appendTail(sb);
System.out.println(sb.toString());
```

**Parameters:** sb

- The target string buffer
**Parameters:** replacement

- The replacement string
**Returns:** This matcher
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If no match has yet been attempted,
or if the previous match operation failed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the replacement string refers to a named-capturing
group that does not exist in the pattern
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If the replacement string refers to a capturing group
that does not exist in the pattern

By default, a matcher uses anchoring region boundaries.

useAnchoringBounds

```java
public
Matcher
useAnchoringBounds​(boolean b)
```

Sets the anchoring of region bounds for this matcher.

Invoking this method with an argument of

true

will set this
matcher to use

anchoring

bounds. If the boolean
argument is

false

, then

non-anchoring

bounds will be
used.

Using anchoring bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region match anchors such as ^ and $.

Without anchoring bounds, the boundaries of this
matcher's region will not match anchors such as ^ and $.

By default, a matcher uses anchoring region boundaries.

**Parameters:** b

- a boolean indicating whether or not to use anchoring bounds.
**Returns:** this matcher
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** hasAnchoringBounds()

toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the string representation of this matcher. The
string representation of a

Matcher

contains information
that may be useful for debugging. The exact format is unspecified.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** The string representation of this matcher
**Since:** 1.5

hitEnd

```java
public boolean hitEnd()
```

Returns true if the end of input was hit by the search engine in
the last match operation performed by this matcher.

When this method returns true, then it is possible that more input
would have changed the result of the last search.

**Returns:** true iff the end of input was hit in the last match; false
otherwise
**Since:** 1.5

#### hitEnd

public boolean hitEnd()

Returns true if the end of input was hit by the search engine in
the last match operation performed by this matcher.

When this method returns true, then it is possible that more input
would have changed the result of the last search.

When this method returns true, then it is possible that more input
would have changed the result of the last search.

requireEnd

```java
public boolean requireEnd()
```

Returns true if more input could change a positive match into a
negative one.

If this method returns true, and a match was found, then more
input could cause the match to be lost. If this method returns false
and a match was found, then more input might change the match but the
match won't be lost. If a match was not found, then requireEnd has no
meaning.

**Returns:** true iff more input could change a positive match into a
negative one.
**Since:** 1.5

#### requireEnd

public boolean requireEnd()

Returns true if more input could change a positive match into a
negative one.

If this method returns true, and a match was found, then more
input could cause the match to be lost. If this method returns false
and a match was found, then more input might change the match but the
match won't be lost. If a match was not found, then requireEnd has no
meaning.

If this method returns true, and a match was found, then more
input could cause the match to be lost. If this method returns false
