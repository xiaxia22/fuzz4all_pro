# Class RandomAccessFile

**Source:** `java.base\java\io\RandomAccessFile.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
RandomAccessFile

extends
Object

implements
DataOutput
,
DataInput
,
Closeable
```

Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a
random access file. A random access file behaves like a large
array of bytes stored in the file system. There is a kind of cursor,
or index into the implied array, called the

file pointer

;
input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
the file pointer past the bytes read. If the random access file is
created in read/write mode, then output operations are also available;
output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write
past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be
extended. The file pointer can be read by the

getFilePointer

method and set by the

seek

method.

It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that
if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been
read, an

EOFException

(which is a kind of

IOException

) is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for
any reason other than end-of-file, an

IOException

other
than

EOFException

is thrown. In particular, an

IOException

may be thrown if the stream has been closed.

### Constructor Details

#### public RandomAccessFile​(
String
name,

String
mode)
throws
FileNotFoundException

Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally
to write to, a file with the specified name. A new

FileDescriptor

object is created to represent the
connection to the file.

The

mode

argument specifies the access mode with which the
file is to be opened. The permitted values and their meanings are as
specified for the

RandomAccessFile(File,String)

constructor.

If there is a security manager, its

checkRead

method
is called with the

name

argument
as its argument to see if read access to the file is allowed.
If the mode allows writing, the security manager's

checkWrite

method
is also called with the

name

argument
as its argument to see if write access to the file is allowed.

**Parameters:**
- name

- the system-dependent filename
- mode

- the access

mode

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the mode argument is not equal
to one of

"r"

,

"rw"

,

"rws"

, or

"rwd"
- FileNotFoundException

- if the mode is

"r"

but the given string does not
denote an existing regular file, or if the mode begins with

"rw"

but the given string does not denote an
existing, writable regular file and a new regular file of
that name cannot be created, or if some other error occurs
while opening or creating the file
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file
or the mode is

"rw"

and the security manager's

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file

**See Also:**
- SecurityException

#### public RandomAccessFile​(
File
file,

String
mode)
throws
FileNotFoundException

Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally to
write to, the file specified by the

File

argument. A new

FileDescriptor

object is created to represent this file connection.

The

mode

argument specifies the access mode
in which the file is to be opened. The permitted values and their
meanings are:

Access mode permitted values and meanings

Value

Meaning

"r"

Open for reading only. Invoking any of the

write

methods of the resulting object will cause an

IOException

to be thrown.

"rw"

Open for reading and writing. If the file does not already
exist then an attempt will be made to create it.

"rws"

Open for reading and writing, as with

"rw"

, and also
require that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device.

"rwd"

Open for reading and writing, as with

"rw"

, and also
require that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device.

The

"rws"

and

"rwd"

modes work much like the

force(boolean)

method of
the

FileChannel

class, passing arguments of

true

and

false

, respectively, except that they always
apply to every I/O operation and are therefore often more efficient. If
the file resides on a local storage device then when an invocation of a
method of this class returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to
the file by that invocation will have been written to that device. This
is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the
event of a system crash. If the file does not reside on a local device
then no such guarantee is made.

The

"rwd"

mode can be used to reduce the number of I/O
operations performed. Using

"rwd"

only requires updates to the
file's content to be written to storage; using

"rws"

requires
updates to both the file's content and its metadata to be written, which
generally requires at least one more low-level I/O operation.

If there is a security manager, its

checkRead

method is
called with the pathname of the

file

argument as its
argument to see if read access to the file is allowed. If the mode
allows writing, the security manager's

checkWrite

method is
also called with the path argument to see if write access to the file is
allowed.

**Parameters:**
- file

- the file object
- mode

- the access mode, as described

above

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the mode argument is not equal
to one of

"r"

,

"rw"

,

"rws"

, or

"rwd"
- FileNotFoundException

- if the mode is

"r"

but the given file object does
not denote an existing regular file, or if the mode begins
with

"rw"

but the given file object does not denote
an existing, writable regular file and a new regular file of
that name cannot be created, or if some other error occurs
while opening or creating the file
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file
or the mode is

"rw"

and the security manager's

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file

this object's file-pointer offset as returned by the

getFilePointer

method. Changing this object's
file-pointer offset, whether explicitly or by reading or writing bytes,
will change the position of the channel, and vice versa. Changing the
file's length via this object will change the length seen via the file
channel, and vice versa.

#### public void seek​(long pos)
throws
IOException

Sets the file-pointer offset, measured from the beginning of this
file, at which the next read or write occurs. The offset may be
set beyond the end of the file. Setting the offset beyond the end
of the file does not change the file length. The file length will
change only by writing after the offset has been set beyond the end
of the file.

#### public final
String
readLine()
throws
IOException

Reads the next line of text from this file. This method successively
reads bytes from the file, starting at the current file pointer,
until it reaches a line terminator or the end
of the file. Each byte is converted into a character by taking the
byte's value for the lower eight bits of the character and setting the
high eight bits of the character to zero. This method does not,
therefore, support the full Unicode character set.

A line of text is terminated by a carriage-return character
(

'\r'

), a newline character (

'\n'

), a
carriage-return character immediately followed by a newline character,
or the end of the file. Line-terminating characters are discarded and
are not included as part of the string returned.

This method blocks until a newline character is read, a carriage
return and the byte following it are read (to see if it is a newline),
the end of the file is reached, or an exception is thrown.

**Specified by:**
- readLine

in interface

DataInput

**Returns:**
- the next line of text from this file, or null if end
of file is encountered before even one byte is read.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### public final
String
readUTF()
throws
IOException

Reads in a string from this file. The string has been encoded
using a

modified UTF-8

format.

The first two bytes are read, starting from the current file
pointer, as if by

readUnsignedShort

. This value gives the number of
following bytes that are in the encoded string, not
the length of the resulting string. The following bytes are then
interpreted as bytes encoding characters in the modified UTF-8 format
and are converted into characters.

This method blocks until all the bytes are read, the end of the
stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.

**Specified by:**
- readUTF

in interface

DataInput

**Returns:**
- a Unicode string.

**Throws:**
- EOFException

- if this file reaches the end before
reading all the bytes.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
- UTFDataFormatException

- if the bytes do not represent
valid modified UTF-8 encoding of a Unicode string.

**See Also:**
- readUnsignedShort()

modified UTF-8

encoding in a machine-independent manner.

First, two bytes are written to the file, starting at the
current file pointer, as if by the

writeShort

method giving the number of bytes to
follow. This value is the number of bytes actually written out,
not the length of the string. Following the length, each character
of the string is output, in sequence, using the modified UTF-8 encoding
for each character.

**Specified by:**

Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a
random access file. A random access file behaves like a large
array of bytes stored in the file system. There is a kind of cursor,
or index into the implied array, called the

file pointer

;
input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
the file pointer past the bytes read. If the random access file is
created in read/write mode, then output operations are also available;
output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write
past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be
extended. The file pointer can be read by the

getFilePointer

method and set by the

seek

method.

It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that
if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been
read, an

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- RandomAccessFile

```java
public RandomAccessFile​(
String
name,

String
mode)
throws
FileNotFoundException
```

Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally
to write to, a file with the specified name. A new

FileDescriptor

object is created to represent the
connection to the file.

The

mode

argument specifies the access mode with which the
file is to be opened. The permitted values and their meanings are as
specified for the

RandomAccessFile(File,String)

constructor.

If there is a security manager, its

checkRead

method
is called with the

name

argument
as its argument to see if read access to the file is allowed.
If the mode allows writing, the security manager's

checkWrite

method
is also called with the

name

argument
as its argument to see if write access to the file is allowed.

**Parameters:** name

- the system-dependent filename
**Parameters:** mode

- the access

mode
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the mode argument is not equal
to one of

"r"

,

"rw"

,

"rws"

, or

"rwd"
**Throws:** FileNotFoundException

- if the mode is

"r"

but the given string does not
denote an existing regular file, or if the mode begins with

"rw"

but the given string does not denote an
existing, writable regular file and a new regular file of
that name cannot be created, or if some other error occurs
while opening or creating the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file
or the mode is

"rw"

and the security manager's

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file
**See Also:** SecurityException

,

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

,

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

- RandomAccessFile

```java
public RandomAccessFile​(
File
file,

String
mode)
throws
FileNotFoundException
```

Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally to
write to, the file specified by the

File

argument. A new

FileDescriptor

object is created to represent this file connection.

The

mode

argument specifies the access mode
in which the file is to be opened. The permitted values and their
meanings are:

Access mode permitted values and meanings

Value

Meaning

"r"

Open for reading only. Invoking any of the

write

methods of the resulting object will cause an

IOException

to be thrown.

"rw"

Open for reading and writing. If the file does not already
exist then an attempt will be made to create it.

"rws"

Open for reading and writing, as with

"rw"

, and also
require that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device.

"rwd"

Open for reading and writing, as with

"rw"

, and also
require that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device.

The

"rws"

and

"rwd"

modes work much like the

force(boolean)

method of
the

FileChannel

class, passing arguments of

true

and

false

, respectively, except that they always
apply to every I/O operation and are therefore often more efficient. If
the file resides on a local storage device then when an invocation of a
method of this class returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to
the file by that invocation will have been written to that device. This
is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the
event of a system crash. If the file does not reside on a local device
then no such guarantee is made.

The

"rwd"

mode can be used to reduce the number of I/O
operations performed. Using

"rwd"

only requires updates to the
file's content to be written to storage; using

"rws"

requires
updates to both the file's content and its metadata to be written, which
generally requires at least one more low-level I/O operation.

If there is a security manager, its

checkRead

method is
called with the pathname of the

file

argument as its
argument to see if read access to the file is allowed. If the mode
allows writing, the security manager's

checkWrite

method is
also called with the path argument to see if write access to the file is
allowed.

**Parameters:** file

- the file object
**Parameters:** mode

- the access mode, as described

above
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the mode argument is not equal
to one of

"r"

,

"rw"

,

"rws"

, or

"rwd"
**Throws:** FileNotFoundException

- if the mode is

"r"

but the given file object does
not denote an existing regular file, or if the mode begins
with

"rw"

but the given file object does not denote
an existing, writable regular file and a new regular file of
that name cannot be created, or if some other error occurs
while opening or creating the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file
or the mode is

"rw"

and the security manager's

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getFD

```java
public final
FileDescriptor
getFD()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the opaque file descriptor object associated with this
stream.

**Returns:** the file descriptor object associated with this stream.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
**See Also:** FileDescriptor

- getChannel

```java
public final
FileChannel
getChannel()
```

Returns the unique

FileChannel

object associated with this file.

The

position

of the returned channel will always be equal to
this object's file-pointer offset as returned by the

getFilePointer

method. Changing this object's
file-pointer offset, whether explicitly or by reading or writing bytes,
will change the position of the channel, and vice versa. Changing the
file's length via this object will change the length seen via the file
channel, and vice versa.

**Returns:** the file channel associated with this file
**Since:** 1.4

- read

```java
public int read()
throws
IOException
```

Reads a byte of data from this file. The byte is returned as an
integer in the range 0 to 255 (

0x00-0x0ff

). This
method blocks if no input is yet available.

Although

RandomAccessFile

is not a subclass of

InputStream

, this method behaves in exactly the same
way as the

InputStream.read()

method of

InputStream

.

**Returns:** the next byte of data, or

-1

if the end of the
file has been reached.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs. Not thrown if
end-of-file has been reached.

- read

```java
public int read​(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException
```

Reads up to

len

bytes of data from this file into an
array of bytes. This method blocks until at least one byte of input
is available.

Although

RandomAccessFile

is not a subclass of

InputStream

, this method behaves in exactly the
same way as the

InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)

method of

InputStream

.

**Parameters:** b

- the buffer into which the data is read.
**Parameters:** off

- the start offset in array

b

at which the data is written.
**Parameters:** len

- the maximum number of bytes read.
**Returns:** the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end of
the file has been reached.
**Throws:** IOException

- If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than end of file, or if the random access file has been closed, or if
some other I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

b

is

null

.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If

off

is negative,

len

is negative, or

len

is greater than

b.length - off

- read

```java
public int read​(byte[] b)
throws
IOException
```

Reads up to

b.length

bytes of data from this file
into an array of bytes. This method blocks until at least one byte
of input is available.

Although

RandomAccessFile

is not a subclass of

same way as the

InputStream.read(byte[])

method of

InputStream

.

**Parameters:** b

- the buffer into which the data is read.
**Returns:** the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end of
this file has been reached.

n

bytes of input discarding the
skipped bytes.

This method may skip over some smaller number of bytes, possibly zero.
This may result from any of a number of conditions; reaching end of
file before

n

bytes have been skipped is only one
possibility. This method never throws an

EOFException

.
The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. If

- readLine

```java
public final
String
readLine()
throws
IOException
```

Reads the next line of text from this file. This method successively
reads bytes from the file, starting at the current file pointer,
until it reaches a line terminator or the end
of the file. Each byte is converted into a character by taking the
byte's value for the lower eight bits of the character and setting the
high eight bits of the character to zero. This method does not,
therefore, support the full Unicode character set.

A line of text is terminated by a carriage-return character
(

'\r'

), a newline character (

'\n'

), a
carriage-return character immediately followed by a newline character,
or the end of the file. Line-terminating characters are discarded and
are not included as part of the string returned.

This method blocks until a newline character is read, a carriage
return and the byte following it are read (to see if it is a newline),

format.

The first two bytes are read, starting from the current file
pointer, as if by

readUnsignedShort

. This value gives the number of
following bytes that are in the encoded string, not
the length of the resulting string. The following bytes are then
interpreted as bytes encoding characters in the modified UTF-8 format
and are converted into characters.

This method blocks until all the bytes are read, the end of the
stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.

Constructor Detail

- RandomAccessFile

```java
public RandomAccessFile​(
String
name,

String
mode)
throws
FileNotFoundException
```

Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally
to write to, a file with the specified name. A new

FileDescriptor

object is created to represent the
connection to the file.

The

mode

argument specifies the access mode with which the
file is to be opened. The permitted values and their meanings are as
specified for the

RandomAccessFile(File,String)

constructor.

If there is a security manager, its

checkRead

method
is called with the

name

argument
as its argument to see if read access to the file is allowed.
If the mode allows writing, the security manager's

checkWrite

method
is also called with the

name

argument
as its argument to see if write access to the file is allowed.

**Parameters:** name

- the system-dependent filename
**Parameters:** mode

- the access

mode
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the mode argument is not equal
to one of

"r"

,

"rw"

,

"rws"

, or

"rwd"
**Throws:** FileNotFoundException

- if the mode is

"r"

but the given string does not
denote an existing regular file, or if the mode begins with

"rw"

but the given string does not denote an
existing, writable regular file and a new regular file of
that name cannot be created, or if some other error occurs
while opening or creating the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file
or the mode is

"rw"

and the security manager's

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file

,

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

- RandomAccessFile

```java
public RandomAccessFile​(
File
file,

String
mode)
throws
FileNotFoundException
```

Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally to
write to, the file specified by the

File

argument. A new

FileDescriptor

object is created to represent this file connection.

The

mode

argument specifies the access mode
in which the file is to be opened. The permitted values and their
meanings are:

Access mode permitted values and meanings

Value

Meaning

"r"

Open for reading only. Invoking any of the

write

methods of the resulting object will cause an

IOException

to be thrown.

"rw"

Open for reading and writing. If the file does not already
exist then an attempt will be made to create it.

"rws"

Open for reading and writing, as with

"rw"

, and also
require that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device.

"rwd"

Open for reading and writing, as with

"rw"

, and also
require that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device.

The

"rws"

and

"rwd"

modes work much like the

force(boolean)

method of
the

FileChannel

class, passing arguments of

true

and

false

, respectively, except that they always
apply to every I/O operation and are therefore often more efficient. If
the file resides on a local storage device then when an invocation of a
method of this class returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to
the file by that invocation will have been written to that device. This
is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the
event of a system crash. If the file does not reside on a local device
then no such guarantee is made.

The

"rwd"

mode can be used to reduce the number of I/O
operations performed. Using

"rwd"

only requires updates to the
file's content to be written to storage; using

"rws"

requires
updates to both the file's content and its metadata to be written, which
generally requires at least one more low-level I/O operation.

If there is a security manager, its

checkRead

method is
called with the pathname of the

file

argument as its
argument to see if read access to the file is allowed. If the mode
allows writing, the security manager's

checkWrite

method is
also called with the path argument to see if write access to the file is
allowed.

**Parameters:** file

- the file object
**Parameters:** mode

- the access mode, as described

above
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the mode argument is not equal
to one of

"r"

,

"rw"

,

"rws"

, or

"rwd"
**Throws:** FileNotFoundException

- if the mode is

"r"

but the given file object does
not denote an existing regular file, or if the mode begins
with

"rw"

but the given file object does not denote
an existing, writable regular file and a new regular file of
that name cannot be created, or if some other error occurs
while opening or creating the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkRead

method denies read access to the file
or the mode is

"rw"

and the security manager's

checkWrite

method denies write access to the file

throws
FileNotFoundException
```

Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally to
write to, the file specified by the

File

argument. A new

FileDescriptor

object is created to represent this file connection.

The

mode

argument specifies the access mode
in which the file is to be opened. The permitted values and their
meanings are:

Access mode permitted values and meanings

Value

Meaning

"r"

Open for reading only. Invoking any of the

write

methods of the resulting object will cause an

IOException

to be thrown.

"rw"

Open for reading and writing. If the file does not already
exist then an attempt will be made to create it.

"rws"

Open for reading and writing, as with

"rw"

, and also
require that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device.

"rwd"

Open for reading and writing, as with

"rw"

, and also
require that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device.

The

"rws"

and

"rwd"

modes work much like the

force(boolean)

method of
the

FileChannel

class, passing arguments of

true

and

false

, respectively, except that they always
apply to every I/O operation and are therefore often more efficient. If
the file resides on a local storage device then when an invocation of a
method of this class returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to
the file by that invocation will have been written to that device. This
is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the
event of a system crash. If the file does not reside on a local device
then no such guarantee is made.

The

"rwd"

mode can be used to reduce the number of I/O
operations performed. Using

"rwd"

only requires updates to the
file's content to be written to storage; using

"rws"

requires
updates to both the file's content and its metadata to be written, which
generally requires at least one more low-level I/O operation.

If there is a security manager, its

checkRead

method is
called with the pathname of the

file

argument as its
argument to see if read access to the file is allowed. If the mode
allows writing, the security manager's

checkWrite

method is
also called with the path argument to see if write access to the file is
allowed.

**Parameters:** file

- the file object
**Parameters:** mode

- the access mode, as described

above
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the mode argument is not equal
to one of

"r"

,

n

bytes of input discarding the
skipped bytes.

This method may skip over some smaller number of bytes, possibly zero.
This may result from any of a number of conditions; reaching end of
file before

n

bytes have been skipped is only one
possibility. This method never throws an

EOFException

.
The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. If

n

is negative, no bytes are skipped.

throws
IOException
```

Sets the file-pointer offset, measured from the beginning of this
file, at which the next read or write occurs. The offset may be
set beyond the end of the file. Setting the offset beyond the end
of the file does not change the file length. The file length will
change only by writing after the offset has been set beyond the end
of the file.

four bytes.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
**See Also:** readInt()

,

Float.intBitsToFloat(int)

- readDouble

```java
public final double readDouble()
throws
IOException
```

Reads a

double

from this file. This method reads a

long

value, starting at the current file pointer,
as if by the

readLong

method
and then converts that

long

to a

double

using the

longBitsToDouble

method in
class

Double

.

This method blocks until the eight bytes are read, the end of the
stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.

**Specified by:** readDouble

in interface

DataInput
**Returns:** the next eight bytes of this file, interpreted as a

double

.
**Throws:** EOFException

- if this file reaches the end before reading
eight bytes.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
**See Also:** readLong()

,

Double.longBitsToDouble(long)

- readLine

```java
public final
String
readLine()
throws
IOException
```

Reads the next line of text from this file. This method successively
reads bytes from the file, starting at the current file pointer,
until it reaches a line terminator or the end
of the file. Each byte is converted into a character by taking the
byte's value for the lower eight bits of the character and setting the
high eight bits of the character to zero. This method does not,
therefore, support the full Unicode character set.

A line of text is terminated by a carriage-return character
(

'\r'

), a newline character (

'\n'

), a
carriage-return character immediately followed by a newline character,
or the end of the file. Line-terminating characters are discarded and
are not included as part of the string returned.

This method blocks until a newline character is read, a carriage
return and the byte following it are read (to see if it is a newline),
the end of the file is reached, or an exception is thrown.

**Specified by:** readLine

in interface

DataInput
**Returns:** the next line of text from this file, or null if end
of file is encountered before even one byte is read.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- readUTF

```java
public final
String
readUTF()
throws
IOException
```

Reads in a string from this file. The string has been encoded
using a

modified UTF-8

format.

The first two bytes are read, starting from the current file
pointer, as if by

readUnsignedShort

. This value gives the number of
following bytes that are in the encoded string, not
the length of the resulting string. The following bytes are then
interpreted as bytes encoding characters in the modified UTF-8 format
and are converted into characters.

This method blocks until all the bytes are read, the end of the
stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.

**Specified by:** readUTF

in interface

DataInput
**Returns:** a Unicode string.
**Throws:** EOFException

- if this file reaches the end before
reading all the bytes.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** UTFDataFormatException

- if the bytes do not represent
valid modified UTF-8 encoding of a Unicode string.
