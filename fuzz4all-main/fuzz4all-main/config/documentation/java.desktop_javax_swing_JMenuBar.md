# Class JMenuBar

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\JMenuBar.html`

### Class Description

```java
@JavaBean
(
defaultProperty
="UI",

description
="A container for holding and displaying menus.")
public class
JMenuBar

extends
JComponent

implements
Accessible
,
MenuElement
```

An implementation of a menu bar. You add

JMenu

objects to the
menu bar to construct a menu. When the user selects a

JMenu

object, its associated

JPopupMenu

is displayed, allowing the
user to select one of the

JMenuItems

on it.

For information and examples of using menu bars see

How to Use Menus

,
a section in

The Java Tutorial.

Warning:

Swing is not thread safe. For more
information see

Swing's Threading
Policy

.

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.
Please see

XMLEncoder

.

Warning:

By default, pressing the Tab key does not transfer focus from a

JMenuBar

which is added to a container together with other Swing
components, because the

focusTraversalKeysEnabled

property
of

JMenuBar

is set to

false

. To resolve this,
you should call the

JMenuBar.setFocusTraversalKeysEnabled(true)

method.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** ImageObserver
