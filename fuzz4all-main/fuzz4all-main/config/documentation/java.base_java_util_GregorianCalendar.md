# Class GregorianCalendar

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\GregorianCalendar.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
GregorianCalendar

extends
Calendar
```

GregorianCalendar

is a concrete subclass of

Calendar

and provides the standard calendar system
used by most of the world.

GregorianCalendar

is a hybrid calendar that
supports both the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems with the
support of a single discontinuity, which corresponds by default to
the Gregorian date when the Gregorian calendar was instituted
(October 15, 1582 in some countries, later in others). The cutover
date may be changed by the caller by calling

setGregorianChange()

.

Historically, in those countries which adopted the Gregorian calendar first,
October 4, 1582 (Julian) was thus followed by October 15, 1582 (Gregorian). This calendar models
this correctly. Before the Gregorian cutover,

GregorianCalendar

implements the Julian calendar. The only difference between the Gregorian
and the Julian calendar is the leap year rule. The Julian calendar specifies
leap years every four years, whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century
years which are not divisible by 400.

GregorianCalendar

implements

proleptic

Gregorian and
Julian calendars. That is, dates are computed by extrapolating the current
rules indefinitely far backward and forward in time. As a result,

GregorianCalendar

may be used for all years to generate
meaningful and consistent results. However, dates obtained using

GregorianCalendar

are historically accurate only from March 1, 4
AD onward, when modern Julian calendar rules were adopted. Before this date,
leap year rules were applied irregularly, and before 45 BC the Julian
calendar did not even exist.

Prior to the institution of the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Day was
March 25. To avoid confusion, this calendar always uses January 1. A manual
adjustment may be made if desired for dates that are prior to the Gregorian
changeover and which fall between January 1 and March 24.

Week Of Year and Week Year

Values calculated for the

WEEK_OF_YEAR

field range from 1 to 53. The first week of a
calendar year is the earliest seven day period starting on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

that contains at
least

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

days from that year. It thus depends
on the values of

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

,

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and the day of the week of January 1. Weeks
between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year
(exclusive) are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (except
for year(s) involved in the Julian-Gregorian transition).

The

getFirstDayOfWeek()

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

values are initialized using
locale-dependent resources when constructing a

GregorianCalendar

.

The week
determination is compatible

with the ISO 8601 standard when

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, which values are used in locales
where the standard is preferred. These values can explicitly be set by
calling

setFirstDayOfWeek()

and

setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

.

A

week year

is in sync with a

WEEK_OF_YEAR

cycle. All weeks between the first and last
weeks (inclusive) have the same

week year

value.
Therefore, the first and last days of a week year may have
different calendar year values.

For example, January 1, 1998 is a Thursday. If

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4 (ISO 8601 standard compatible
setting), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends
on January 4, 1998. The week year is 1998 for the last three days
of calendar year 1997. If, however,

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and
ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are
part of week 53 of 1997 and their week year is 1997.

Week Of Month

Values calculated for the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

field range from 0
to 6. Week 1 of a month (the days with

WEEK_OF_MONTH =
1

) is the earliest set of at least

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

contiguous days in that month,
ending on the day before

getFirstDayOfWeek()

. Unlike
week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need
not start on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and will not include days of
the previous month. Days of a month before week 1 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0.

For example, if

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, then the first week of
January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10. These days
have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1. Thursday, January 1 through
Saturday, January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0. If

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is changed to 3, then January 1
through January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1.

Default Fields Values

clear

method sets calendar field(s)
undefined.

GregorianCalendar

Date(Long.MAX_VALUE)

. To obtain a pure Gregorian calendar,
set the change date to

Date(Long.MIN_VALUE)

.

**Parameters:**
- date

- the given Gregorian cutover date.

---

#### public final

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Compares this

GregorianCalendar

to the specified

Object

. The result is

true

if and
only if the argument is a

GregorianCalendar

object
that represents the same time value (millisecond offset from
the

Epoch

) under the same

Calendar

parameters and Gregorian change date as
this object.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Calendar

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to compare with.

**Returns:**
- true

if this object is equal to

obj

;

false

otherwise.

GregorianCalendar

object.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Calendar

**Returns:**
- a hash code value for this object.

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public void add​(int field,
int amount)

Adds the specified (signed) amount of time to the given calendar field,
based on the calendar's rules.

Add rule 1

. The value of

field

after the call minus the value of

field

before the
call is

amount

, modulo any overflow that has occurred in

field

. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its
range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or
decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.

Add rule 2

. If a smaller field is expected to be
invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its
prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after

field

is changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close
as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a
smaller unit of time.

HOUR

is a smaller field than

DAY_OF_MONTH

. No adjustment is made to smaller fields
that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system
determines what fields are expected to be invariant.

**Specified by:**
- add

in class

Calendar

**Parameters:**
- field

- the calendar field.
- amount

- the amount of date or time to be added to the field.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

field

is

ZONE_OFFSET

,

DST_OFFSET

, or unknown,
or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
non-lenient mode.

**See Also:**
- Calendar.roll(int,int)

,

Calendar.set(int,int)

---

#### public void roll​(int field,
boolean up)

Adds or subtracts (up/down) a single unit of time on the given time
field without changing larger fields.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to December 31, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)

sets the calendar to January 31, 1999. The

YEAR

field is unchanged
because it is a larger field than

MONTH

.

**Specified by:**
- roll

in class

Calendar

**Parameters:**
- up

- indicates if the value of the specified calendar field is to be
rolled up or rolled down. Use

true

if rolling up,

false

otherwise.
- field

- the time field.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

field

is

ZONE_OFFSET

,

DST_OFFSET

, or unknown,
or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
non-lenient mode.

**See Also:**
- add(int,int)

,

Calendar.set(int,int)

---

#### public void roll​(int field,
int amount)

Adds a signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields.
A negative roll amount means to subtract from field without changing
larger fields. If the specified amount is 0, this method performs nothing.

This method calls

Calendar.complete()

before adding the
amount so that all the calendar fields are normalized. If there
is any calendar field having an out-of-range value in non-lenient mode, then an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.MONTH,
8)

sets the calendar to April 30,

1999

. Using a

GregorianCalendar

, the

DAY_OF_MONTH

field cannot
be 31 in the month April.

DAY_OF_MONTH

is set to the closest possible
value, 30. The

YEAR

field maintains the value of 1999 because it
is a larger field than

MONTH

.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to Sunday June 6, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)

sets the calendar to
Tuesday June 1, 1999, whereas calling

add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)

sets the calendar to
Sunday May 30, 1999. This is because the roll rule imposes an
additional constraint: The

MONTH

must not change when the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

is rolled. Taken together with add rule 1,
the resultant date must be between Tuesday June 1 and Saturday June
5. According to add rule 2, the

DAY_OF_WEEK

, an invariant
when changing the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

, is set to Tuesday, the
closest possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first day of the
week).

**Overrides:**
- roll

in class

Calendar

**Parameters:**
- field

- the calendar field.
- amount

- the signed amount to add to

field

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

field

is

ZONE_OFFSET

,

DST_OFFSET

, or unknown,
or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
non-lenient mode.

**See Also:**
- roll(int,boolean)

,

add(int,int)

---

#### public int getLeastMaximum​(int field)

Returns the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field
of this

GregorianCalendar

instance. The lowest
maximum value is defined as the smallest value returned by

getActualMaximum(int)

for any possible time value,
taking into consideration the current values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek

,

getGregorianChange

and

getTimeZone

methods.

**Specified by:**
- getLeastMaximum

in class

Calendar

**Parameters:**
- field

- the calendar field

**Returns:**
- the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field.

---

#### public int getActualMinimum​(int field)

Returns the minimum value that this calendar field could have,
taking into consideration the given time value and the current
values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek

,

getGregorianChange

and

getTimeZone

methods.

For example, if the Gregorian change date is January 10,
1970 and the date of this

GregorianCalendar

is
January 20, 1970, the actual minimum value of the

DAY_OF_MONTH

field is 10 because the previous date
of January 10, 1970 is December 27, 1996 (in the Julian
calendar). Therefore, December 28, 1969 to January 9, 1970
don't exist.

**Overrides:**
- getActualMinimum

in class

Calendar

**Parameters:**
- field

- the calendar field

**Returns:**
- the minimum of the given field for the time value of
this

GregorianCalendar

**See Also:**
- getMinimum(int)

---

#### public int getActualMaximum​(int field)

Returns the maximum value that this calendar field could have,
taking into consideration the given time value and the current
values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek

,

getGregorianChange

and

getTimeZone

methods.
For example, if the date of this instance is February 1, 2004,
the actual maximum value of the

DAY_OF_MONTH

field
is 29 because 2004 is a leap year, and if the date of this
instance is February 1, 2005, it's 28.

This method calculates the maximum value of

WEEK_OF_YEAR

based on the

YEAR

(calendar year) value, not the

week year

. Call

getWeeksInWeekYear()

to get the maximum value of

WEEK_OF_YEAR

in the week year of this

GregorianCalendar

.

**Overrides:**
- getActualMaximum

in class

Calendar

**Parameters:**
- field

- the calendar field

**Returns:**
- the maximum of the given field for the time value of
this

GregorianCalendar

---

#### public int getWeekYear()

Returns the

week year

represented by this

GregorianCalendar

. The dates in the weeks between 1 and the
maximum week number of the week year have the same week year value
that may be one year before or after the

YEAR

(calendar year) value.

This method calls

Calendar.complete()

before
calculating the week year.

**Overrides:**
- getWeekYear

in class

Calendar

**Returns:**
- the week year represented by this

GregorianCalendar

.
If the

ERA

value is

BC

, the year is
represented by 0 or a negative number: BC 1 is 0, BC 2
is -1, BC 3 is -2, and so on.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if any of the calendar fields is invalid in non-lenient mode.

Sets this

GregorianCalendar

to the date given by the
date specifiers -

weekYear

,

weekOfYear

, and

dayOfWeek

.

weekOfYear

follows the

WEEK_OF_YEAR

numbering

. The

dayOfWeek

value must be one of the

DAY_OF_WEEK

values:

SUNDAY

to

SATURDAY

.

Note that the numeric day-of-week representation differs from
the ISO 8601 standard, and that the

weekOfYear

numbering is compatible with the standard when

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4.

Unlike the

set

method, all of the calendar fields
and the instant of time value are calculated upon return.

If

weekOfYear

is out of the valid week-of-year
range in

weekYear

, the

weekYear

and

weekOfYear

values are adjusted in lenient
mode, or an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown in
non-lenient mode.

**Overrides:**
- setWeekDate

in class

Calendar

**Parameters:**
- weekYear

- the week year
- weekOfYear

- the week number based on

weekYear
- dayOfWeek

- the day of week value: one of the constants
for the

DAY_OF_WEEK

field:

SUNDAY

, ...,

SATURDAY

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if any of the given date specifiers is invalid,
or if any of the calendar fields are inconsistent
with the given date specifiers in non-lenient mode

#### public int getWeeksInWeekYear()

Returns the number of weeks in the

week year

represented by this

GregorianCalendar

.

For example, if this

GregorianCalendar

's date is
December 31, 2008 with

the ISO
8601 compatible setting

, this method will return 53 for the
period: December 29, 2008 to January 3, 2010 while

getActualMaximum(WEEK_OF_YEAR)

will return
52 for the period: December 31, 2007 to December 28, 2008.

**Overrides:**
- getWeeksInWeekYear

in class

Calendar

**Returns:**
- the number of weeks in the week year.

**See Also:**

#### protected void computeFields()

Converts the time value (millisecond offset from the

Epoch

) to calendar field values.
The time is

not

recomputed first; to recompute the time, then the fields, call the

complete

method.

**Specified by:**
- computeFields

in class

Calendar

**See Also:**
- Calendar.complete()

---

#### protected void computeTime()

Converts calendar field values to the time value (millisecond
offset from the

Epoch

).

**Specified by:**
- computeTime

in class

Calendar

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if any calendar fields are invalid.

**See Also:**

#### public
ZonedDateTime
toZonedDateTime()

Converts this object to a

ZonedDateTime

that represents
the same point on the time-line as this

GregorianCalendar

.

Since this object supports a Julian-Gregorian cutover date and

ZonedDateTime

does not, it is possible that the resulting year,
month and day will have different values. The result will represent the
correct date in the ISO calendar system, which will also be the same value
for Modified Julian Days.

**Returns:**
- a zoned date-time representing the same point on the time-line
as this gregorian calendar

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public static
GregorianCalendar
from​(
ZonedDateTime
zdt)

Obtains an instance of

GregorianCalendar

with the default locale
from a

ZonedDateTime

object.

Since

ZonedDateTime

does not support a Julian-Gregorian cutover
date and uses ISO calendar system, the return GregorianCalendar is a pure
Gregorian calendar and uses ISO 8601 standard for week definitions,
which has

MONDAY

as the

FirstDayOfWeek

and

4

as the value of the

MinimalDaysInFirstWeek

.

ZoneDateTime

can store points on the time-line further in the
future and further in the past than

GregorianCalendar

. In this
scenario, this method will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

exception.

**Parameters:**
- zdt

- the zoned date-time object to convert

**Returns:**
- the gregorian calendar representing the same point on the
time-line as the zoned date-time provided

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

zdt

is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the zoned date-time is too
large to represent as a

GregorianCalendar

**Since:**
- 1.8

GregorianCalendar

is a concrete subclass of

Calendar

and provides the standard calendar system
used by most of the world.

GregorianCalendar

is a hybrid calendar that
supports both the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems with the
support of a single discontinuity, which corresponds by default to
the Gregorian date when the Gregorian calendar was instituted
(October 15, 1582 in some countries, later in others). The cutover
date may be changed by the caller by calling

setGregorianChange()

.

Historically, in those countries which adopted the Gregorian calendar first,
October 4, 1582 (Julian) was thus followed by October 15, 1582 (Gregorian). This calendar models
this correctly. Before the Gregorian cutover,

GregorianCalendar

implements the Julian calendar. The only difference between the Gregorian
and the Julian calendar is the leap year rule. The Julian calendar specifies
leap years every four years, whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century
years which are not divisible by 400.

GregorianCalendar

implements

proleptic

Gregorian and
Julian calendars. That is, dates are computed by extrapolating the current
rules indefinitely far backward and forward in time. As a result,

GregorianCalendar

may be used for all years to generate
meaningful and consistent results. However, dates obtained using

GregorianCalendar

are historically accurate only from March 1, 4
AD onward, when modern Julian calendar rules were adopted. Before this date,
leap year rules were applied irregularly, and before 45 BC the Julian
calendar did not even exist.

Prior to the institution of the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Day was
March 25. To avoid confusion, this calendar always uses January 1. A manual
adjustment may be made if desired for dates that are prior to the Gregorian
changeover and which fall between January 1 and March 24.

Week Of Year and Week Year

Values calculated for the

WEEK_OF_YEAR

field range from 1 to 53. The first week of a
calendar year is the earliest seven day period starting on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

that contains at
least

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

days from that year. It thus depends
on the values of

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

,

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and the day of the week of January 1. Weeks
between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year
(exclusive) are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (except
for year(s) involved in the Julian-Gregorian transition).

The

getFirstDayOfWeek()

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

values are initialized using
locale-dependent resources when constructing a

GregorianCalendar

.

The week
determination is compatible

with the ISO 8601 standard when

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, which values are used in locales
where the standard is preferred. These values can explicitly be set by
calling

setFirstDayOfWeek()

and

setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

.

A

week year

is in sync with a

WEEK_OF_YEAR

cycle. All weeks between the first and last
weeks (inclusive) have the same

week year

value.
Therefore, the first and last days of a week year may have
different calendar year values.

For example, January 1, 1998 is a Thursday. If

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4 (ISO 8601 standard compatible
setting), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends
on January 4, 1998. The week year is 1998 for the last three days
of calendar year 1997. If, however,

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and
ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are
part of week 53 of 1997 and their week year is 1997.

Week Of Month

Values calculated for the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

field range from 0
to 6. Week 1 of a month (the days with

WEEK_OF_MONTH =
1

) is the earliest set of at least

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

contiguous days in that month,
ending on the day before

getFirstDayOfWeek()

. Unlike
week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need
not start on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and will not include days of
the previous month. Days of a month before week 1 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0.

For example, if

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, then the first week of
January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10. These days
have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1. Thursday, January 1 through
Saturday, January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0. If

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is changed to 3, then January 1
through January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1.

Default Fields Values

clear

ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are
part of week 53 of 1997 and their week year is 1997.

Week Of Month

Values calculated for the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

field range from 0
to 6. Week 1 of a month (the days with

WEEK_OF_MONTH =
1

) is the earliest set of at least

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

contiguous days in that month,
ending on the day before

getFirstDayOfWeek()

. Unlike
week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need
not start on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and will not include days of
the previous month. Days of a month before week 1 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0.

For example, if

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, then the first week of
January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10. These days
have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1. Thursday, January 1 through
Saturday, January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0. If

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

through January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1.

Historically, in those countries which adopted the Gregorian calendar first,
October 4, 1582 (Julian) was thus followed by October 15, 1582 (Gregorian). This calendar models
this correctly. Before the Gregorian cutover,

GregorianCalendar

implements the Julian calendar. The only difference between the Gregorian
and the Julian calendar is the leap year rule. The Julian calendar specifies
leap years every four years, whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century
years which are not divisible by 400.

GregorianCalendar

implements

proleptic

Gregorian and
Julian calendars. That is, dates are computed by extrapolating the current
rules indefinitely far backward and forward in time. As a result,

GregorianCalendar

may be used for all years to generate
meaningful and consistent results. However, dates obtained using

GregorianCalendar

are historically accurate only from March 1, 4
AD onward, when modern Julian calendar rules were adopted. Before this date,
leap year rules were applied irregularly, and before 45 BC the Julian
calendar did not even exist.

Prior to the institution of the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Day was
March 25. To avoid confusion, this calendar always uses January 1. A manual
adjustment may be made if desired for dates that are prior to the Gregorian
changeover and which fall between January 1 and March 24.

Week Of Year and Week Year

Values calculated for the

WEEK_OF_YEAR

field range from 1 to 53. The first week of a
calendar year is the earliest seven day period starting on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

that contains at
least

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

days from that year. It thus depends
on the values of

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

,

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and the day of the week of January 1. Weeks
between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year
(exclusive) are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (except
for year(s) involved in the Julian-Gregorian transition).

The

getFirstDayOfWeek()

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

values are initialized using
locale-dependent resources when constructing a

GregorianCalendar

.

The week
determination is compatible

with the ISO 8601 standard when

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, which values are used in locales
where the standard is preferred. These values can explicitly be set by
calling

setFirstDayOfWeek()

and

setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

.

A

week year

is in sync with a

WEEK_OF_YEAR

cycle. All weeks between the first and last
weeks (inclusive) have the same

week year

value.
Therefore, the first and last days of a week year may have
different calendar year values.

For example, January 1, 1998 is a Thursday. If

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4 (ISO 8601 standard compatible
setting), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends
on January 4, 1998. The week year is 1998 for the last three days
of calendar year 1997. If, however,

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and
ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are
part of week 53 of 1997 and their week year is 1997.

Week Of Month

Values calculated for the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

field range from 0
to 6. Week 1 of a month (the days with

WEEK_OF_MONTH =
1

) is the earliest set of at least

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

contiguous days in that month,
ending on the day before

getFirstDayOfWeek()

. Unlike
week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need
not start on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and will not include days of
the previous month. Days of a month before week 1 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0.

For example, if

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, then the first week of
January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10. These days
have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1. Thursday, January 1 through
Saturday, January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0. If

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is changed to 3, then January 1
through January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1.

between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year
(exclusive) are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (except
for year(s) involved in the Julian-Gregorian transition).

The

on January 4, 1998. The week year is 1998 for the last three days
of calendar year 1997. If, however,

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and
ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are
part of week 53 of 1997 and their week year is 1997.

Week Of Month

Values calculated for the

. Unlike
week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need
not start on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and will not include days of
the previous month. Days of a month before week 1 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0.

For example, if

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, then the first week of
January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10. These days
have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

#### Week Of Year and Week Year

Values calculated for the

WEEK_OF_YEAR

field range from 1 to 53. The first week of a
calendar year is the earliest seven day period starting on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

that contains at
least

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

days from that year. It thus depends
on the values of

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

,

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and the day of the week of January 1. Weeks
between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year
(exclusive) are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (except
for year(s) involved in the Julian-Gregorian transition).

The

getFirstDayOfWeek()

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

values are initialized using
locale-dependent resources when constructing a

GregorianCalendar

.

The week
determination is compatible

with the ISO 8601 standard when

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, which values are used in locales
where the standard is preferred. These values can explicitly be set by
calling

setFirstDayOfWeek()

and

setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

.

A

week year

is in sync with a

WEEK_OF_YEAR

cycle. All weeks between the first and last
weeks (inclusive) have the same

week year

value.
Therefore, the first and last days of a week year may have
different calendar year values.

For example, January 1, 1998 is a Thursday. If

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4 (ISO 8601 standard compatible
setting), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends
on January 4, 1998. The week year is 1998 for the last three days
of calendar year 1997. If, however,

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and
ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are
part of week 53 of 1997 and their week year is 1997.

Week Of Month

Values calculated for the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

field range from 0
to 6. Week 1 of a month (the days with

WEEK_OF_MONTH =
1

) is the earliest set of at least

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

contiguous days in that month,
ending on the day before

getFirstDayOfWeek()

. Unlike
week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need
not start on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and will not include days of
the previous month. Days of a month before week 1 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0.

For example, if

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, then the first week of
January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10. These days
have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1. Thursday, January 1 through
Saturday, January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0. If

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is changed to 3, then January 1
through January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1.

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4 (ISO 8601 standard compatible
setting), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends
on January 4, 1998. The week year is 1998 for the last three days
of calendar year 1997. If, however,

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and
ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are
part of week 53 of 1997 and their week year is 1997.

Week Of Month

Values calculated for the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

field range from 0
to 6. Week 1 of a month (the days with

WEEK_OF_MONTH =
1

) is the earliest set of at least

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

contiguous days in that month,
ending on the day before

getFirstDayOfWeek()

. Unlike
week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need
not start on

getFirstDayOfWeek()

, and will not include days of
the previous month. Days of a month before week 1 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0.

For example, if

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

SUNDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4, then the first week of
January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10. These days
have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1. Thursday, January 1 through
Saturday, January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 0. If

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is changed to 3, then January 1
through January 3 have a

WEEK_OF_MONTH

of 1.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- setGregorianChange

```java
public void setGregorianChange​(
Date
date)
```

Sets the

GregorianCalendar

change date. This is the point when the switch
from Julian dates to Gregorian dates occurred. Default is October 15,
1582 (Gregorian). Previous to this, dates will be in the Julian calendar.

To obtain a pure Julian calendar, set the change date to

Date(Long.MAX_VALUE)

. To obtain a pure Gregorian calendar,
set the change date to

Date(Long.MIN_VALUE)

.

**Parameters:** date

- the given Gregorian cutover date.

- getGregorianChange

```java
public final
Date
getGregorianChange()
```

Gets the Gregorian Calendar change date. This is the point when the
switch from Julian dates to Gregorian dates occurred. Default is
October 15, 1582 (Gregorian). Previous to this, dates will be in the Julian
calendar.

**Returns:** the Gregorian cutover date for this

GregorianCalendar

object.

- isLeapYear

```java
public boolean isLeapYear​(int year)
```

Determines if the given year is a leap year. Returns

true

if
the given year is a leap year. To specify BC year numbers,

1 - year number

must be given. For example, year BC 4 is
specified as -3.

**Parameters:** year

- the given year.
**Returns:** true

if the given year is a leap year;

false

otherwise.

- getCalendarType

```java
public
String
getCalendarType()
```

Returns

"gregory"

as the calendar type.

**Overrides:** getCalendarType

in class

Calendar
**Returns:** "gregory"
**Since:** 1.8
**See Also:** Locale extensions

,

Locale.Builder.setLocale(Locale)

,

Locale.Builder.setUnicodeLocaleKeyword(String, String)

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Compares this

GregorianCalendar

to the specified

Object

. The result is

true

if and
only if the argument is a

GregorianCalendar

object
that represents the same time value (millisecond offset from
the

Epoch

) under the same

Calendar

parameters and Gregorian change date as
this object.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** obj

- the object to compare with.
**Returns:** true

if this object is equal to

obj

;

false

otherwise.
**See Also:** Calendar.compareTo(Calendar)

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Generates the hash code for this

GregorianCalendar

object.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Calendar
**Returns:** a hash code value for this object.
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- add

```java
public void add​(int field,
int amount)
```

Adds the specified (signed) amount of time to the given calendar field,
based on the calendar's rules.

Add rule 1

. The value of

field

after the call minus the value of

field

before the
call is

amount

, modulo any overflow that has occurred in

field

. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its
range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or
decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.

Add rule 2

. If a smaller field is expected to be
invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its
prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after

field

is changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close
as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a
smaller unit of time.

HOUR

is a smaller field than

DAY_OF_MONTH

. No adjustment is made to smaller fields
that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system
determines what fields are expected to be invariant.

**Specified by:** add

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** field

- the calendar field.
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount of date or time to be added to the field.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

field

is

ZONE_OFFSET

,

DST_OFFSET

, or unknown,
or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
non-lenient mode.
**See Also:** Calendar.roll(int,int)

,

Calendar.set(int,int)

- roll

```java
public void roll​(int field,
boolean up)
```

Adds or subtracts (up/down) a single unit of time on the given time
field without changing larger fields.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to December 31, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)

sets the calendar to January 31, 1999. The

YEAR

field is unchanged
because it is a larger field than

MONTH

.

**Specified by:** roll

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** up

- indicates if the value of the specified calendar field is to be
rolled up or rolled down. Use

true

if rolling up,

false

otherwise.
**Parameters:** field

- the time field.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

field

is

ZONE_OFFSET

,

DST_OFFSET

, or unknown,
or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
non-lenient mode.
**See Also:** add(int,int)

,

Calendar.set(int,int)

- roll

```java
public void roll​(int field,
int amount)
```

Adds a signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields.
A negative roll amount means to subtract from field without changing
larger fields. If the specified amount is 0, this method performs nothing.

This method calls

Calendar.complete()

before adding the
amount so that all the calendar fields are normalized. If there
is any calendar field having an out-of-range value in non-lenient mode, then an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.MONTH,
8)

sets the calendar to April 30,

1999

. Using a

GregorianCalendar

, the

DAY_OF_MONTH

field cannot
be 31 in the month April.

DAY_OF_MONTH

is set to the closest possible
value, 30. The

YEAR

field maintains the value of 1999 because it
is a larger field than

MONTH

.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to Sunday June 6, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)

sets the calendar to
Tuesday June 1, 1999, whereas calling

add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)

sets the calendar to
Sunday May 30, 1999. This is because the roll rule imposes an
additional constraint: The

MONTH

must not change when the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

is rolled. Taken together with add rule 1,
the resultant date must be between Tuesday June 1 and Saturday June
5. According to add rule 2, the

DAY_OF_WEEK

, an invariant
when changing the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

, is set to Tuesday, the
closest possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first day of the
week).

**Overrides:** roll

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** field

- the calendar field.
**Parameters:** amount

- the signed amount to add to

field

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

field

is

ZONE_OFFSET

,

DST_OFFSET

, or unknown,
or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
non-lenient mode.

- getMinimum

```java
public int getMinimum​(int field)
```

Returns the minimum value for the given calendar field of this

GregorianCalendar

instance. The minimum value is
defined as the smallest value returned by the

get

method for any possible time value,
taking into consideration the current values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek

,

getGregorianChange

and

getTimeZone

methods.

**Specified by:** getMinimum

```

Returns the highest minimum value for the given calendar field
of this

GregorianCalendar

instance. The highest
minimum value is defined as the largest value returned by

getActualMinimum(int)

for any possible time value,
taking into consideration the current values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

,

getActualMaximum(int)

- getLeastMaximum

```java
public int getLeastMaximum​(int field)
```

Returns the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field
of this

GregorianCalendar

instance. The lowest
maximum value is defined as the smallest value returned by

getActualMaximum(int)

for any possible time value,
taking into consideration the current values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek

,

getGregorianChange

and

getTimeZone

methods.

**Specified by:** getLeastMaximum

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** field

- the calendar field
**Returns:** the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field.
**See Also:** getMinimum(int)

,

getMaximum(int)

,

getGreatestMinimum(int)

,

getActualMinimum(int)

,

getActualMaximum(int)

- getActualMinimum

```java
public int getActualMinimum​(int field)
```

Returns the minimum value that this calendar field could have,
taking into consideration the given time value and the current
values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek

,

getGregorianChange

and

getTimeZone

methods.

For example, if the Gregorian change date is January 10,
1970 and the date of this

GregorianCalendar

is
January 20, 1970, the actual minimum value of the

DAY_OF_MONTH

field is 10 because the previous date
of January 10, 1970 is December 27, 1996 (in the Julian
calendar). Therefore, December 28, 1969 to January 9, 1970
don't exist.

**Overrides:** getActualMinimum

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** field

- the calendar field
**Returns:** the minimum of the given field for the time value of
this

GregorianCalendar
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** getMinimum(int)

,

getMaximum(int)

,

getGreatestMinimum(int)

,

getLeastMaximum(int)

,

getActualMaximum(int)

- getActualMaximum

```java
public int getActualMaximum​(int field)
```

Returns the maximum value that this calendar field could have,
taking into consideration the given time value and the current
values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek

,

getGregorianChange

and

getTimeZone

methods.
For example, if the date of this instance is February 1, 2004,
the actual maximum value of the

DAY_OF_MONTH

field
is 29 because 2004 is a leap year, and if the date of this
instance is February 1, 2005, it's 28.

This method calculates the maximum value of

WEEK_OF_YEAR

based on the

YEAR

(calendar year) value, not the

week year

. Call

getWeeksInWeekYear()

to get the maximum value of

WEEK_OF_YEAR

in the week year of this

GregorianCalendar

.

**Overrides:** getActualMaximum

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** field

- the calendar field
**Returns:** the maximum of the given field for the time value of

- isWeekDateSupported

```java
public final boolean isWeekDateSupported()
```

Returns

true

indicating this

GregorianCalendar

supports week dates.

**Overrides:** isWeekDateSupported

in class

Calendar
**Returns:** true

(always)
**Since:** 1.7
**See Also:** getWeekYear()

setWeekDate(int,int,int)

,

getWeeksInWeekYear()

- getWeekYear

```java
public int getWeekYear()
```

Returns the

week year

represented by this

GregorianCalendar

. The dates in the weeks between 1 and the
maximum week number of the week year have the same week year value
that may be one year before or after the

YEAR

(calendar year) value.

This method calls

Calendar.complete()

before
calculating the week year.

**Overrides:** getWeekYear

in class

Calendar
**Returns:** the week year represented by this

GregorianCalendar

.
If the

ERA

value is

BC

, the year is
represented by 0 or a negative number: BC 1 is 0, BC 2
is -1, BC 3 is -2, and so on.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if any of the calendar fields is invalid in non-lenient mode.
**Since:** 1.7

- setWeekDate

```java
public void setWeekDate​(int weekYear,
int weekOfYear,
int dayOfWeek)
```

Sets this

GregorianCalendar

to the date given by the
date specifiers -

weekYear

,

weekOfYear

, and

dayOfWeek

.

weekOfYear

follows the

WEEK_OF_YEAR

numbering

. The

dayOfWeek

value must be one of the

DAY_OF_WEEK

values:

SUNDAY

to

SATURDAY

.

Note that the numeric day-of-week representation differs from
the ISO 8601 standard, and that the

weekOfYear

numbering is compatible with the standard when

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4.

Unlike the

set

method, all of the calendar fields
and the instant of time value are calculated upon return.

If

weekOfYear

is out of the valid week-of-year
range in

weekYear

, the

weekYear

and

weekOfYear

values are adjusted in lenient
mode, or an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown in
non-lenient mode.

**Overrides:** setWeekDate

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** weekYear

- the week year
**Parameters:** weekOfYear

- the week number based on

weekYear
**Parameters:** dayOfWeek

- the day of week value: one of the constants
for the

DAY_OF_WEEK

field:

SUNDAY

.

For example, if this

GregorianCalendar

's date is
December 31, 2008 with

the ISO

, this method will return 53 for the
period: December 29, 2008 to January 3, 2010 while

getActualMaximum(WEEK_OF_YEAR)

will return
52 for the period: December 31, 2007 to December 28, 2008.

```

Converts the time value (millisecond offset from the

Epoch

) to calendar field values.
The time is

not

recomputed first; to recompute the time, then the fields, call the

complete

method.

**Specified by:** computeFields

in class

Calendar
**See Also:** Calendar.complete()

- computeTime

```java
protected void computeTime()
```

Converts calendar field values to the time value (millisecond
offset from the

Epoch

).

**Specified by:** computeTime

Calendar
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if any calendar fields are invalid.
**See Also:** Calendar.complete()

- toZonedDateTime

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
toZonedDateTime()
```

Converts this object to a

ZonedDateTime

that represents
the same point on the time-line as this

GregorianCalendar

.

Since this object supports a Julian-Gregorian cutover date and

ZonedDateTime

does not, it is possible that the resulting year,
month and day will have different values. The result will represent the
correct date in the ISO calendar system, which will also be the same value
for Modified Julian Days.

**Returns:** a zoned date-time representing the same point on the time-line
as this gregorian calendar
**Since:** 1.8

- from

```java
public static
GregorianCalendar
from​(
ZonedDateTime
zdt)
```

Obtains an instance of

GregorianCalendar

with the default locale
from a

ZonedDateTime

object.

Since

ZonedDateTime

does not support a Julian-Gregorian cutover
date and uses ISO calendar system, the return GregorianCalendar is a pure
Gregorian calendar and uses ISO 8601 standard for week definitions,
which has

MONDAY

as the

FirstDayOfWeek

and

4

as the value of the

MinimalDaysInFirstWeek

.

ZoneDateTime

can store points on the time-line further in the
future and further in the past than

GregorianCalendar

. In this
scenario, this method will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

exception.

**Parameters:** zdt

- the zoned date-time object to convert
**Returns:** the gregorian calendar representing the same point on the
time-line as the zoned date-time provided
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

zdt

is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the zoned date-time is too
large to represent as a

GregorianCalendar
**Since:** 1.8

Method Detail

- setGregorianChange

```java
public void setGregorianChange​(
Date
date)
```

Sets the

GregorianCalendar

change date. This is the point when the switch
from Julian dates to Gregorian dates occurred. Default is October 15,
1582 (Gregorian). Previous to this, dates will be in the Julian calendar.

To obtain a pure Julian calendar, set the change date to

Date(Long.MAX_VALUE)

. To obtain a pure Gregorian calendar,
set the change date to

Date(Long.MIN_VALUE)

.

**Parameters:** date

- the given Gregorian cutover date.

- getGregorianChange

```java
public final
Date
getGregorianChange()
```

Gets the Gregorian Calendar change date. This is the point when the
switch from Julian dates to Gregorian dates occurred. Default is
October 15, 1582 (Gregorian). Previous to this, dates will be in the Julian
calendar.

**Returns:** the Gregorian cutover date for this

GregorianCalendar

object.

- isLeapYear

```java
public boolean isLeapYear​(int year)
```

Determines if the given year is a leap year. Returns

true

if
the given year is a leap year. To specify BC year numbers,

1 - year number

must be given. For example, year BC 4 is
specified as -3.

**Parameters:** year

- the given year.
**Returns:** true

if the given year is a leap year;

false

otherwise.

- getCalendarType

```java
public
String
getCalendarType()
```

Returns

"gregory"

as the calendar type.

**Overrides:** getCalendarType

in class

Calendar
**Returns:** "gregory"
**Since:** 1.8
**See Also:** Locale extensions

,

Locale.Builder.setLocale(Locale)

,

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Compares this

GregorianCalendar

to the specified

Object

. The result is

true

if and
only if the argument is a

GregorianCalendar

object
that represents the same time value (millisecond offset from
the

Epoch

) under the same

Calendar

parameters and Gregorian change date as
this object.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** obj

- the object to compare with.
**Returns:** true

if this object is equal to

obj

;

false

otherwise.
**See Also:** Calendar.compareTo(Calendar)

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Generates the hash code for this

GregorianCalendar

object.

**Overrides:** hashCode

**Returns:** a hash code value for this object.
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- add

```java
public void add​(int field,
int amount)
```

Adds the specified (signed) amount of time to the given calendar field,
based on the calendar's rules.

Add rule 1

. The value of

field

after the call minus the value of

field

before the
call is

amount

, modulo any overflow that has occurred in

field

. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its
range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or
decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.

Add rule 2

. If a smaller field is expected to be
invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its
prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after

field

is changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close
as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a
smaller unit of time.

HOUR

is a smaller field than

DAY_OF_MONTH

. No adjustment is made to smaller fields
that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system
determines what fields are expected to be invariant.

**Specified by:** add

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** field

- the calendar field.
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount of date or time to be added to the field.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

field

is

ZONE_OFFSET

,

DST_OFFSET

, or unknown,
or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
non-lenient mode.
**See Also:** Calendar.roll(int,int)

,

Calendar.set(int,int)

- roll

```java
public void roll​(int field,
boolean up)
```

Adds or subtracts (up/down) a single unit of time on the given time
field without changing larger fields.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to December 31, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)

sets the calendar to January 31, 1999. The

YEAR

field is unchanged
because it is a larger field than

MONTH

.

**Specified by:** roll

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** up

- indicates if the value of the specified calendar field is to be
rolled up or rolled down. Use

true

if rolling up,

false

otherwise.
**Parameters:** field

- the time field.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

field

is

ZONE_OFFSET

,

DST_OFFSET

, or unknown,
or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
non-lenient mode.
**See Also:** add(int,int)

,

Calendar.set(int,int)

- roll

```java
public void roll​(int field,
int amount)
```

Adds a signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields.
A negative roll amount means to subtract from field without changing
larger fields. If the specified amount is 0, this method performs nothing.

This method calls

Calendar.complete()

before adding the
amount so that all the calendar fields are normalized. If there
is any calendar field having an out-of-range value in non-lenient mode, then an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.MONTH,
8)

sets the calendar to April 30,

1999

. Using a

GregorianCalendar

, the

DAY_OF_MONTH

field cannot
be 31 in the month April.

DAY_OF_MONTH

is set to the closest possible
value, 30. The

YEAR

field maintains the value of 1999 because it
is a larger field than

MONTH

.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to Sunday June 6, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)

sets the calendar to
Tuesday June 1, 1999, whereas calling

add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)

sets the calendar to
Sunday May 30, 1999. This is because the roll rule imposes an
additional constraint: The

MONTH

must not change when the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

is rolled. Taken together with add rule 1,
the resultant date must be between Tuesday June 1 and Saturday June
5. According to add rule 2, the

DAY_OF_WEEK

, an invariant
when changing the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

, is set to Tuesday, the
closest possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first day of the
week).

**Overrides:** roll

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** field

- the calendar field.
**Parameters:** amount

- the signed amount to add to

field

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

field

is

ZONE_OFFSET

,

DST_OFFSET

, or unknown,
or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
non-lenient mode.

- getLeastMaximum

```java
public int getLeastMaximum​(int field)
```

Returns the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field
of this

GregorianCalendar

instance. The lowest
maximum value is defined as the smallest value returned by

getActualMaximum(int)

for any possible time value,
taking into consideration the current values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

,

getGregorianChange

and

getTimeZone

methods.

**Specified by:** getLeastMaximum

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** field

- the calendar field
**Returns:** the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field.

Returns the minimum value that this calendar field could have,
taking into consideration the given time value and the current
values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek

,

getGregorianChange

and

getTimeZone

methods.

For example, if the Gregorian change date is January 10,
1970 and the date of this

GregorianCalendar

is
January 20, 1970, the actual minimum value of the

DAY_OF_MONTH

field is 10 because the previous date
of January 10, 1970 is December 27, 1996 (in the Julian
calendar). Therefore, December 28, 1969 to January 9, 1970
don't exist.

**Overrides:** getActualMinimum

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** field

- the calendar field
**Returns:** the minimum of the given field for the time value of
this

GregorianCalendar
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** getMinimum(int)

,

getMaximum(int)

,

getGreatestMinimum(int)

,

```

Returns the maximum value that this calendar field could have,
taking into consideration the given time value and the current
values of the

getFirstDayOfWeek

,

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek

,

getGregorianChange

and

getTimeZone

methods.
For example, if the date of this instance is February 1, 2004,
the actual maximum value of the

DAY_OF_MONTH

field
is 29 because 2004 is a leap year, and if the date of this
instance is February 1, 2005, it's 28.

This method calculates the maximum value of

WEEK_OF_YEAR

based on the

YEAR

(calendar year) value, not the

week year

. Call

getWeeksInWeekYear()

to get the maximum value of

WEEK_OF_YEAR

in the week year of this

GregorianCalendar

.

**Overrides:** getActualMaximum

```

Returns

true

indicating this

GregorianCalendar

supports week dates.

**Overrides:** isWeekDateSupported

represented by this

GregorianCalendar

. The dates in the weeks between 1 and the
maximum week number of the week year have the same week year value
that may be one year before or after the

YEAR

(calendar year) value.

This method calls

Calendar.complete()

before
calculating the week year.

**Overrides:** getWeekYear

in class

Calendar
**Returns:** the week year represented by this

GregorianCalendar

int weekOfYear,
int dayOfWeek)
```

Sets this

GregorianCalendar

to the date given by the
date specifiers -

weekYear

,

weekOfYear

, and

dayOfWeek

.

weekOfYear

follows the

WEEK_OF_YEAR

numbering

. The

dayOfWeek

value must be one of the

DAY_OF_WEEK

values:

SUNDAY

to

SATURDAY

.

Note that the numeric day-of-week representation differs from
the ISO 8601 standard, and that the

weekOfYear

numbering is compatible with the standard when

getFirstDayOfWeek()

is

MONDAY

and

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

is 4.

Unlike the

set

method, all of the calendar fields
and the instant of time value are calculated upon return.

If

weekOfYear

is out of the valid week-of-year
range in

weekYear

, the

weekYear

and

weekOfYear

values are adjusted in lenient
mode, or an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown in
non-lenient mode.

**Overrides:** setWeekDate

The time is

not

recomputed first; to recompute the time, then the fields, call the

complete

method.

**Specified by:** computeFields

- toZonedDateTime

```java
public
ZonedDateTime
toZonedDateTime()
```

Converts this object to a

ZonedDateTime

that represents
the same point on the time-line as this

GregorianCalendar

.

Since this object supports a Julian-Gregorian cutover date and

ZonedDateTime

does not, it is possible that the resulting year,
month and day will have different values. The result will represent the
correct date in the ISO calendar system, which will also be the same value
for Modified Julian Days.

**Returns:** a zoned date-time representing the same point on the time-line
as this gregorian calendar
**Since:** 1.8

- from

```java
public static
GregorianCalendar
from​(
ZonedDateTime
zdt)
```

Obtains an instance of

GregorianCalendar

with the default locale
from a

ZonedDateTime

object.

Since

ZonedDateTime

does not support a Julian-Gregorian cutover
date and uses ISO calendar system, the return GregorianCalendar is a pure
Gregorian calendar and uses ISO 8601 standard for week definitions,
which has

MONDAY

as the

FirstDayOfWeek

and

4

as the value of the

MinimalDaysInFirstWeek

.

ZoneDateTime

can store points on the time-line further in the
future and further in the past than

GregorianCalendar

. In this
scenario, this method will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

exception.

**Parameters:** zdt

- the zoned date-time object to convert
**Returns:** the gregorian calendar representing the same point on the
time-line as the zoned date-time provided
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

zdt

is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the zoned date-time is too
large to represent as a

GregorianCalendar

before the
call is

amount

, modulo any overflow that has occurred in

field

. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its
range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or
decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.

Add rule 2

. If a smaller field is expected to be
invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its
prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after

field

is changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close
as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a
smaller unit of time.

HOUR

is a smaller field than

DAY_OF_MONTH

. No adjustment is made to smaller fields
that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system
determines what fields are expected to be invariant.

roll

```java
public void roll​(int field,
boolean up)
```

Adds or subtracts (up/down) a single unit of time on the given time
field without changing larger fields.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to December 31, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)

sets the calendar to January 31, 1999. The

YEAR

field is unchanged
because it is a larger field than

MONTH

.

**Specified by:** roll

in class

Calendar
**Parameters:** up

- indicates if the value of the specified calendar field is to be
rolled up or rolled down. Use

true

if rolling up,

false

otherwise.
**Parameters:** field

- the time field.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

field

is

ZONE_OFFSET

,

DST_OFFSET

, or unknown,
or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
non-lenient mode.
**See Also:** add(int,int)

#### roll

public void roll​(int field,
boolean up)

Adds or subtracts (up/down) a single unit of time on the given time
field without changing larger fields.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to December 31, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)

sets the calendar to January 31, 1999. The

YEAR

field is unchanged
because it is a larger field than

MONTH

.

roll

```java
public void roll​(int field,
int amount)
```

Adds a signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields.
A negative roll amount means to subtract from field without changing
larger fields. If the specified amount is 0, this method performs nothing.

This method calls

Calendar.complete()

before adding the
amount so that all the calendar fields are normalized. If there
is any calendar field having an out-of-range value in non-lenient mode, then an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.MONTH,
8)

sets the calendar to April 30,

1999

. Using a

GregorianCalendar

, the

DAY_OF_MONTH

field cannot
be 31 in the month April.

DAY_OF_MONTH

is set to the closest possible
value, 30. The

YEAR

field maintains the value of 1999 because it
is a larger field than

MONTH

.

Example

: Consider a

GregorianCalendar

originally set to Sunday June 6, 1999. Calling

roll(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)

sets the calendar to
Tuesday June 1, 1999, whereas calling

add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)

sets the calendar to
Sunday May 30, 1999. This is because the roll rule imposes an
additional constraint: The

MONTH

must not change when the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

is rolled. Taken together with add rule 1,
the resultant date must be between Tuesday June 1 and Saturday June
5. According to add rule 2, the

DAY_OF_WEEK

, an invariant
when changing the

WEEK_OF_MONTH

, is set to Tuesday, the
closest possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first day of the
week).

**Overrides:** roll

ZonedDateTime
toZonedDateTime()
```

Converts this object to a

ZonedDateTime

that represents
the same point on the time-line as this

GregorianCalendar

.

Since this object supports a Julian-Gregorian cutover date and

ZonedDateTime

does not, it is possible that the resulting year,
month and day will have different values. The result will represent the
correct date in the ISO calendar system, which will also be the same value
for Modified Julian Days.

**Returns:** a zoned date-time representing the same point on the time-line
as this gregorian calendar
**Since:** 1.8

from

```java
public static
GregorianCalendar
from​(
ZonedDateTime
zdt)
```

Obtains an instance of

GregorianCalendar

with the default locale
from a

ZonedDateTime

object.

Since

ZonedDateTime

does not support a Julian-Gregorian cutover
date and uses ISO calendar system, the return GregorianCalendar is a pure
Gregorian calendar and uses ISO 8601 standard for week definitions,
which has

MONDAY

as the

FirstDayOfWeek

and

4

as the value of the

MinimalDaysInFirstWeek

.

ZoneDateTime

can store points on the time-line further in the
future and further in the past than

GregorianCalendar

. In this
scenario, this method will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

exception.

**Parameters:** zdt

- the zoned date-time object to convert
**Returns:** the gregorian calendar representing the same point on the
time-line as the zoned date-time provided
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

zdt

is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the zoned date-time is too
large to represent as a

GregorianCalendar
**Since:** 1.8
