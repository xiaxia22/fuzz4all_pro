# Class SyncFactory

**Source:** `java.sql.rowset\javax\sql\rowset\spi\SyncFactory.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
SyncFactory

extends
Object
```

The Service Provider Interface (SPI) mechanism that generates

SyncProvider

instances to be used by disconnected

RowSet

objects.
The

SyncProvider

instances in turn provide the

javax.sql.RowSetReader

object the

RowSet

object
needs to populate itself with data and the

javax.sql.RowSetWriter

object it needs to
propagate changes to its
data back to the underlying data source.

Because the methods in the

SyncFactory

class are all static,
there is only one

SyncFactory

object
per Java VM at any one time. This ensures that there is a single source from which a

RowSet

implementation can obtain its

SyncProvider

implementation.

1.0 Overview

The

SyncFactory

class provides an internal registry of available
synchronization provider implementations (

SyncProvider

objects).
This registry may be queried to determine which
synchronization providers are available.
The following line of code gets an enumeration of the providers currently registered.

```java
java.util.Enumeration e = SyncFactory.getRegisteredProviders();
```

All standard

RowSet

implementations must provide at least two providers:

- an optimistic provider for use with a

CachedRowSet

implementation
or an implementation derived from it

an XML provider, which is used for reading and writing XML, such as with

WebRowSet

objects

Note that the JDBC RowSet Implementations include the

SyncProvider

implementations

RIOptimisticProvider

and

RIXmlProvider

,
which satisfy this requirement.

The

SyncFactory

class provides accessor methods to assist
applications in determining which synchronization providers are currently
registered with the

SyncFactory

.

Other methods let

RowSet

persistence providers be
registered or de-registered with the factory mechanism. This
allows additional synchronization provider implementations to be made
available to

RowSet

objects at run time.

Applications can apply a degree of filtering to determine the level of
synchronization that a

SyncProvider

implementation offers.
The following criteria determine whether a provider is
made available to a

RowSet

object:

- If a particular provider is specified by a

RowSet

object, and
the

SyncFactory

does not contain a reference to this provider,
a

SyncFactoryException

is thrown stating that the synchronization
provider could not be found.

If a

RowSet

implementation is instantiated with a specified
provider and the specified provider has been properly registered, the
requested provider is supplied. Otherwise a

SyncFactoryException

is thrown.

If a

RowSet

object does not specify a

SyncProvider

implementation and no additional

SyncProvider

implementations are available, the reference
implementation providers are supplied.

2.0 Registering

SyncProvider

Implementations

Both vendors and developers can register

SyncProvider

implementations using one of the following mechanisms.

- Using the command line

The name of the provider is supplied on the command line, which will add
the provider to the system properties.
For example:

```java
-Drowset.provider.classname=com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider
```

Using the Standard Properties File

The reference implementation is targeted
to ship with J2SE 1.5, which will include an additional resource file
that may be edited by hand. Here is an example of the properties file
included in the reference implementation:

```java
#Default JDBC RowSet sync providers listing
#

# Optimistic synchronization provider
rowset.provider.classname.0=com.sun.rowset.providers.RIOptimisticProvider
rowset.provider.vendor.0=Oracle Corporation
rowset.provider.version.0=1.0

# XML Provider using standard XML schema
rowset.provider.classname.1=com.sun.rowset.providers.RIXMLProvider
rowset.provider.vendor.1=Oracle Corporation
rowset.provider.version.1=1.0
```

The

SyncFactory

checks this file and registers the

SyncProvider

implementations that it contains. A
developer or vendor can add other implementations to this file.
For example, here is a possible addition:

```java
rowset.provider.classname.2=com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider
rowset.provider.vendor.2=Fred, Inc.
rowset.provider.version.2=1.0
```

Using a JNDI Context

Available providers can be registered on a JNDI
context, and the

SyncFactory

will attempt to load

SyncProvider

implementations from that JNDI context.
For example, the following code fragment registers a provider implementation
on a JNDI context. This is something a deployer would normally do. In this
example,

MyProvider

is being registered on a CosNaming
namespace, which is the namespace used by J2EE resources.

```java
import javax.naming.*;

Hashtable svrEnv = new Hashtable();
srvEnv.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "CosNaming");

Context ctx = new InitialContext(svrEnv);
com.fred.providers.MyProvider = new MyProvider();
ctx.rebind("providers/MyProvider", syncProvider);
```

Next, an application will register the JNDI context with the

SyncFactory

instance. This allows the

SyncFactory

to browse within the JNDI context looking for

SyncProvider

implementations.

```java
Hashtable appEnv = new Hashtable();
appEnv.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "CosNaming");
appEnv.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "iiop://hostname/providers");
Context ctx = new InitialContext(appEnv);

SyncFactory.registerJNDIContext(ctx);
```

If a

RowSet

object attempts to obtain a

MyProvider

object, the

SyncFactory

will try to locate it. First it searches
for it in the system properties, then it looks in the resource files, and
finally it checks the JNDI context that has been set. The

SyncFactory

instance verifies that the requested provider is a valid extension of the

SyncProvider

abstract class and then gives it to the

RowSet

object. In the following code fragment, a new

CachedRowSet

object is created and initialized with

env

, which contains the binding to

MyProvider

.

```java
Hashtable env = new Hashtable();
env.put(SyncFactory.ROWSET_SYNC_PROVIDER, "com.fred.providers.MyProvider");
CachedRowSet crs = new com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl(env);
```

Further details on these mechanisms are available in the

javax.sql.rowset.spi

package specification.

### Method Details

#### public static void registerProvider​(
String
providerID)
throws
SyncFactoryException

Adds the given synchronization provider to the factory register. Guidelines
are provided in the

SyncProvider

specification for the
required naming conventions for

SyncProvider

implementations.

Synchronization providers bound to a JNDI context can be
registered by binding a SyncProvider instance to a JNDI namespace.

```java
SyncProvider p = new MySyncProvider();
InitialContext ic = new InitialContext();
ic.bind ("jdbc/rowset/MySyncProvider", p);
```

Furthermore, an initial JNDI context should be set with the

SyncFactory

using the

setJNDIContext

method.
The

SyncFactory

leverages this context to search for
available

SyncProvider

objects bound to the JNDI
context and its child nodes.

**Parameters:**
- providerID

- A

String

object with the unique ID of the
synchronization provider being registered

RIOptimisticProvider

and

- If a particular provider is specified by a

the

SyncFactory

does not contain a reference to this provider,
a

SyncFactoryException

is thrown stating that the synchronization
provider could not be found.

If a

RowSet

implementation is instantiated with a specified
provider and the specified provider has been properly registered, the
requested provider is supplied. Otherwise a

SyncFactoryException

is thrown.

If a

RowSet

object does not specify a

SyncProvider

implementation and no additional

SyncProvider

implementations are available, the reference
implementation providers are supplied.

2.0 Registering

SyncProvider

Implementations

Both vendors and developers can register

SyncProvider

implementations using one of the following mechanisms.

- Using the command line

The name of the provider is supplied on the command line, which will add
the provider to the system properties.
For example:

```java
-Drowset.provider.classname=com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider
```

Using the Standard Properties File

The reference implementation is targeted
to ship with J2SE 1.5, which will include an additional resource file
that may be edited by hand. Here is an example of the properties file
included in the reference implementation:

```java
#Default JDBC RowSet sync providers listing
#

# Optimistic synchronization provider
rowset.provider.classname.0=com.sun.rowset.providers.RIOptimisticProvider
rowset.provider.vendor.0=Oracle Corporation
rowset.provider.version.0=1.0

# XML Provider using standard XML schema
rowset.provider.classname.1=com.sun.rowset.providers.RIXMLProvider
rowset.provider.vendor.1=Oracle Corporation
rowset.provider.version.1=1.0
```

The

SyncFactory

checks this file and registers the

SyncProvider

implementations that it contains. A
developer or vendor can add other implementations to this file.
For example, here is a possible addition:

```java
rowset.provider.classname.2=com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider
rowset.provider.vendor.2=Fred, Inc.
rowset.provider.version.2=1.0
```

Using a JNDI Context

Available providers can be registered on a JNDI

For example, the following code fragment registers a provider implementation
on a JNDI context. This is something a deployer would normally do. In this
example,

MyProvider

is being registered on a CosNaming
namespace, which is the namespace used by J2EE resources.

```java

srvEnv.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "CosNaming");

Context ctx = new InitialContext(svrEnv);
com.fred.providers.MyProvider = new MyProvider();
ctx.rebind("providers/MyProvider", syncProvider);
```

Next, an application will register the JNDI context with the

SyncFactory

instance. This allows the

SyncFactory

to browse within the JNDI context looking for

SyncProvider

implementations.

```java
Hashtable appEnv = new Hashtable();
appEnv.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "CosNaming");
appEnv.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "iiop://hostname/providers");
Context ctx = new InitialContext(appEnv);

SyncFactory.registerJNDIContext(ctx);
```

If a

RowSet

object attempts to obtain a

MyProvider

object, the

SyncFactory

will try to locate it. First it searches
for it in the system properties, then it looks in the resource files, and
finally it checks the JNDI context that has been set. The

SyncFactory

instance verifies that the requested provider is a valid extension of the

SyncProvider

abstract class and then gives it to the

RowSet

object. In the following code fragment, a new

CachedRowSet

object is created and initialized with

env

, which contains the binding to

MyProvider

.

```java
Hashtable env = new Hashtable();
env.put(SyncFactory.ROWSET_SYNC_PROVIDER, "com.fred.providers.MyProvider");
CachedRowSet crs = new com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl(env);
```

Further details on these mechanisms are available in the

javax.sql.rowset.spi

package specification.

#### 1.0 Overview

java.util.Enumeration e = SyncFactory.getRegisteredProviders();

an optimistic provider for use with a

CachedRowSet

implementation
or an implementation derived from it

an XML provider, which is used for reading and writing XML, such as with

WebRowSet

objects

The

SyncFactory

class provides accessor methods to assist
applications in determining which synchronization providers are currently
registered with the

SyncFactory

.

Other methods let

RowSet

persistence providers be
registered or de-registered with the factory mechanism. This
allows additional synchronization provider implementations to be made
available to

RowSet

objects at run time.

Applications can apply a degree of filtering to determine the level of
synchronization that a

SyncProvider

implementation offers.
The following criteria determine whether a provider is
made available to a

RowSet

object:

- If a particular provider is specified by a

RowSet

object, and
the

SyncFactory

does not contain a reference to this provider,
a

SyncFactoryException

is thrown stating that the synchronization
provider could not be found.

If a

RowSet

implementation is instantiated with a specified
provider and the specified provider has been properly registered, the
requested provider is supplied. Otherwise a

SyncFactoryException

is thrown.

If a

RowSet

object does not specify a

SyncProvider

implementation and no additional

SyncProvider

implementations are available, the reference
implementation providers are supplied.

2.0 Registering

SyncProvider

Implementations

Both vendors and developers can register

SyncProvider

implementations using one of the following mechanisms.

- Using the command line

The name of the provider is supplied on the command line, which will add
the provider to the system properties.
For example:

```java
-Drowset.provider.classname=com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider
```

Using the Standard Properties File

The reference implementation is targeted
to ship with J2SE 1.5, which will include an additional resource file
that may be edited by hand. Here is an example of the properties file
included in the reference implementation:

```java
#Default JDBC RowSet sync providers listing
#

# Optimistic synchronization provider
rowset.provider.classname.0=com.sun.rowset.providers.RIOptimisticProvider
rowset.provider.vendor.0=Oracle Corporation
rowset.provider.version.0=1.0

# XML Provider using standard XML schema
rowset.provider.classname.1=com.sun.rowset.providers.RIXMLProvider
rowset.provider.vendor.1=Oracle Corporation
rowset.provider.version.1=1.0
```

The

SyncFactory

checks this file and registers the

SyncProvider

implementations that it contains. A
developer or vendor can add other implementations to this file.
For example, here is a possible addition:

```java
rowset.provider.classname.2=com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider
rowset.provider.vendor.2=Fred, Inc.
rowset.provider.version.2=1.0
```

Using a JNDI Context

Available providers can be registered on a JNDI
context, and the

SyncFactory

will attempt to load

SyncProvider

implementations from that JNDI context.
For example, the following code fragment registers a provider implementation
on a JNDI context. This is something a deployer would normally do. In this
example,

MyProvider

is being registered on a CosNaming
namespace, which is the namespace used by J2EE resources.

```java
import javax.naming.*;

Hashtable svrEnv = new Hashtable();
srvEnv.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "CosNaming");

Context ctx = new InitialContext(svrEnv);
com.fred.providers.MyProvider = new MyProvider();
ctx.rebind("providers/MyProvider", syncProvider);
```

Next, an application will register the JNDI context with the

SyncFactory

instance. This allows the

SyncFactory

to browse within the JNDI context looking for

SyncProvider

implementations.

```java
Hashtable appEnv = new Hashtable();
appEnv.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "CosNaming");
appEnv.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "iiop://hostname/providers");
Context ctx = new InitialContext(appEnv);

SyncFactory.registerJNDIContext(ctx);
```

If a

RowSet

object attempts to obtain a

MyProvider

object, the

SyncFactory

will try to locate it. First it searches
for it in the system properties, then it looks in the resource files, and
finally it checks the JNDI context that has been set. The

SyncFactory

instance verifies that the requested provider is a valid extension of the

SyncProvider

abstract class and then gives it to the

RowSet

object. In the following code fragment, a new

CachedRowSet

object is created and initialized with

env

, which contains the binding to

MyProvider

.

```java
Hashtable env = new Hashtable();
env.put(SyncFactory.ROWSET_SYNC_PROVIDER, "com.fred.providers.MyProvider");
CachedRowSet crs = new com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl(env);
```

Further details on these mechanisms are available in the

javax.sql.rowset.spi

package specification.

Other methods let

RowSet

persistence providers be
registered or de-registered with the factory mechanism. This
allows additional synchronization provider implementations to be made
available to

RowSet

The following criteria determine whether a provider is
made available to a

- If a particular provider is specified by a

the

SyncFactory

a

SyncFactoryException

is thrown stating that the synchronization
provider could not be found.

If a

RowSet

implementation is instantiated with a specified
provider and the specified provider has been properly registered, the
requested provider is supplied. Otherwise a

SyncFactoryException

is thrown.

If a

object does not specify a

SyncProvider

implementation and no additional

SyncProvider

implementations are available, the reference
implementation providers are supplied.

# XML Provider using standard XML schema
rowset.provider.classname.1=com.sun.rowset.providers.RIXMLProvider
rowset.provider.vendor.1=Oracle Corporation
rowset.provider.version.1=1.0
```

The

SyncFactory

checks this file and registers the

For example, here is a possible addition:

```java

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- registerProvider

```java
public static void registerProvider​(
String
providerID)
throws
SyncFactoryException
```

Adds the given synchronization provider to the factory register. Guidelines
are provided in the

SyncProvider

specification for the
required naming conventions for

SyncProvider

implementations.

Synchronization providers bound to a JNDI context can be
registered by binding a SyncProvider instance to a JNDI namespace.

```java
SyncProvider p = new MySyncProvider();
InitialContext ic = new InitialContext();
ic.bind ("jdbc/rowset/MySyncProvider", p);
```

Furthermore, an initial JNDI context should be set with the

SyncFactory

using the

setJNDIContext

method.
The

SyncFactory

leverages this context to search for
available

SyncProvider

objects bound to the JNDI
context and its child nodes.

**Parameters:** providerID

- A

String

object with the unique ID of the
synchronization provider being registered
