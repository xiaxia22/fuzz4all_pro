# Class JCheckBoxMenuItem

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\JCheckBoxMenuItem.html`

### Class Description

```java
@JavaBean
(
description
="A menu item which can be selected or deselected.")
public class
JCheckBoxMenuItem

extends
JMenuItem

implements
SwingConstants
,
Accessible
```

A menu item that can be selected or deselected. If selected, the menu
item typically appears with a checkmark next to it. If unselected or
deselected, the menu item appears without a checkmark. Like a regular
menu item, a check box menu item can have either text or a graphic
icon associated with it, or both.

Either

isSelected

/

setSelected

or

getState

/

setState

can be used
to determine/specify the menu item's selection state. The
preferred methods are

isSelected

and

setSelected

, which work for all menus and buttons.
The

getState

and

setState

methods exist for
compatibility with other component sets.

Menu items can be configured, and to some degree controlled, by

Action

s. Using an

Action

with a menu item has many benefits beyond directly
configuring a menu item. Refer to

Swing Components Supporting

Action

for more
details, and you can find more information in

How
to Use Actions

, a section in

The Java Tutorial

.

Some times it is required to select several check box menu items from a menu.
In this case it is useful that clicking on one check box menu item does not
close the menu. Such behavior can be controlled either by client

JComponent.putClientProperty(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)

or the Look and Feel

UIManager.put(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)

property named

"CheckBoxMenuItem.doNotCloseOnMouseClick"

. The default value is

false

. Setting the property to

true

prevents the menu from
closing when it is clicked by the mouse. If the client property is set its
value is always used; otherwise the L&F property is queried.
Note: some

L&F

s may ignore this property. All built-in

L&F

s
inherit this behaviour.
