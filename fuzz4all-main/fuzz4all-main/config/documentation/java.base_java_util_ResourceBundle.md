# Class ResourceBundle

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\ResourceBundle.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
ResourceBundle

extends
Object
```

Resource bundles contain locale-specific objects. When your program needs a
locale-specific resource, a

String

for example, your program can
load it from the resource bundle that is appropriate for the current user's
locale. In this way, you can write program code that is largely independent
of the user's locale isolating most, if not all, of the locale-specific
information in resource bundles.

This allows you to write programs that can:

- be easily localized, or translated, into different languages

handle multiple locales at once

be easily modified later to support even more locales

Resource bundles belong to families whose members share a common base
name, but whose names also have additional components that identify
their locales. For example, the base name of a family of resource
bundles might be "MyResources". The family should have a default
resource bundle which simply has the same name as its family -
"MyResources" - and will be used as the bundle of last resort if a
specific locale is not supported. The family can then provide as
many locale-specific members as needed, for example a German one
named "MyResources_de".

Each resource bundle in a family contains the same items, but the items have
been translated for the locale represented by that resource bundle.
For example, both "MyResources" and "MyResources_de" may have a

String

that's used on a button for canceling operations.
In "MyResources" the

String

may contain "Cancel" and in
"MyResources_de" it may contain "Abbrechen".

If there are different resources for different countries, you
can make specializations: for example, "MyResources_de_CH" contains objects for
the German language (de) in Switzerland (CH). If you want to only
modify some of the resources
in the specialization, you can do so.

When your program needs a locale-specific object, it loads
the

ResourceBundle

class using the

getBundle

method:

```java
ResourceBundle myResources =
ResourceBundle.getBundle("MyResources", currentLocale);
```

Resource bundles contain key/value pairs. The keys uniquely
identify a locale-specific object in the bundle. Here's an
example of a

ListResourceBundle

that contains
two key/value pairs:

```java
public class MyResources extends ListResourceBundle {
protected Object[][] getContents() {
return new Object[][] {
// LOCALIZE THE SECOND STRING OF EACH ARRAY (e.g., "OK")
{"OkKey", "OK"},
{"CancelKey", "Cancel"},
// END OF MATERIAL TO LOCALIZE
};
}
}
```

Keys are always

String

s.
In this example, the keys are "OkKey" and "CancelKey".
In the above example, the values
are also

String

s--"OK" and "Cancel"--but
they don't have to be. The values can be any type of object.

You retrieve an object from resource bundle using the appropriate
getter method. Because "OkKey" and "CancelKey"
are both strings, you would use

getString

to retrieve them:

```java
button1 = new Button(myResources.getString("OkKey"));
button2 = new Button(myResources.getString("CancelKey"));
```

The getter methods all require the key as an argument and return
the object if found. If the object is not found, the getter method
throws a

MissingResourceException

.

Besides

getString

,

ResourceBundle

also provides
a method for getting string arrays,

getStringArray

,
as well as a generic

getObject

method for any other
type of object. When using

getObject

, you'll
have to cast the result to the appropriate type. For example:

```java
int[] myIntegers = (int[]) myResources.getObject("intList");
```

The Java Platform provides two subclasses of

ResourceBundle

,

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

,
that provide a fairly simple way to create resources.
As you saw briefly in a previous example,

ListResourceBundle

manages its resource as a list of key/value pairs.

PropertyResourceBundle

uses a properties file to manage
its resources.

If

ListResourceBundle

or

PropertyResourceBundle

do not suit your needs, you can write your own

ResourceBundle

subclass. Your subclasses must override two methods:

handleGetObject

and

getKeys()

.

The implementation of a

ResourceBundle

subclass must be thread-safe
if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads. The default implementations
of the non-abstract methods in this class, and the methods in the direct
known concrete subclasses

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

are thread-safe.

Resource Bundles and Named Modules

Resource bundles can be deployed in modules in the following ways:

Resource bundles together with an application

Resource bundles can be deployed together with an application in the same
module. In that case, the resource bundles are loaded
by code in the module by calling the

getBundle(String)

or

getBundle(String, Locale)

method.

Resource bundles as service providers

Resource bundles can be deployed in one or more

service provider modules

and they can be located using

ServiceLoader

.
A

service

interface or class must be
defined. The caller module declares that it uses the service, the service
provider modules declare that they provide implementations of the service.
Refer to

ResourceBundleProvider

for developing resource bundle
services and deploying resource bundle providers.
The module obtaining the resource bundle can be a resource bundle
provider itself; in which case this module only locates the resource bundle
via service provider mechanism.

A

resource bundle provider

can
provide resource bundles in any format such XML which replaces the need
of

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Resource bundles in other modules and class path

Resource bundles in a named module may be

encapsulated

so that
it cannot be located by code in other modules. Resource bundles
in unnamed modules and class path are open for any module to access.
Resource bundle follows the resource encapsulation rules as specified
in

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

.

The

getBundle

factory methods with no

Control

parameter
locate and load resource bundles from

service providers

.
It may continue the search as if calling

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

to find the named resource from a given module and calling

ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)

; refer to
the specification of the

getBundle

method for details.
Only non-encapsulated resource bundles of "

java.class

"
or "

java.properties

" format are searched.

If the caller module is a

resource bundle provider

, it does not fall back to the
class loader search.

Resource bundles in automatic modules

A common format of resource bundles is in

.properties

file format. Typically

.properties

resource bundles
are packaged in a JAR file. Resource bundle only JAR file can be readily
deployed as an

automatic module

. For example, if the JAR file contains the
entry "

p/q/Foo_ja.properties

" and no

.class

entry,
when resolved and defined as an automatic module, no package is derived
for this module. This allows resource bundles in

.properties

format packaged in one or more JAR files that may contain entries
in the same directory and can be resolved successfully as
automatic modules.

ResourceBundle.Control

The

ResourceBundle.Control

class provides information necessary
to perform the bundle loading process by the

getBundle

factory methods that take a

ResourceBundle.Control

instance. You can implement your own subclass in order to enable
non-standard resource bundle formats, change the search strategy, or
define caching parameters. Refer to the descriptions of the class and the

getBundle

factory method for details.

ResourceBundle.Control

is designed for an application deployed
in an unnamed module, for example to support resource bundles in
non-standard formats or package localized resources in a non-traditional
convention.

ResourceBundleProvider

is the replacement for

ResourceBundle.Control

when migrating to modules.

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown when a factory
method that takes the

ResourceBundle.Control

parameter is called.

For the

getBundle

factory

methods that take no

ResourceBundle.Control

instance, their

default behavior

of resource bundle loading
can be modified with custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations.
If any of the
providers provides a

ResourceBundle.Control

for the given base name, that

ResourceBundle.Control

will be used instead of the default

ResourceBundle.Control

. If there is
more than one service provider for supporting the same base name,
the first one returned from

ServiceLoader

will be used.
A custom

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation is ignored by named modules.

Cache Management

Resource bundle instances created by the

getBundle

factory
methods are cached by default, and the factory methods return the same
resource bundle instance multiple times if it has been
cached.

getBundle

clients may clear the cache, manage the
lifetime of cached resource bundle instances using time-to-live values,
or specify not to cache resource bundle instances. Refer to the
descriptions of the

getBundle

factory method

,

clearCache

,

ResourceBundle.Control.getTimeToLive

, and

ResourceBundle.Control.needsReload

for details.

Example

The following is a very simple example of a

ResourceBundle

subclass,

MyResources

, that manages two resources (for a larger number of
resources you would probably use a

Map

).
Notice that you don't need to supply a value if
a "parent-level"

ResourceBundle

handles the same
key with the same value (as for the okKey below).

```java
// default (English language, United States)
public class MyResources extends ResourceBundle {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
if (key.equals("okKey")) return "Ok";
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Cancel";
return null;
}

public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
return Collections.enumeration(keySet());
}

// Overrides handleKeySet() so that the getKeys() implementation
// can rely on the keySet() value.
protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("okKey", "cancelKey"));
}
}

// German language
public class MyResources_de extends MyResources {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
// don't need okKey, since parent level handles it.
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Abbrechen";
return null;
}

protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("cancelKey"));
}
}
```

You do not have to restrict yourself to using a single family of

ResourceBundle

s. For example, you could have a set of bundles for
exception messages,

ExceptionResources

(

ExceptionResources_fr

,

ExceptionResources_de

, ...),
and one for widgets,

WidgetResource

(

WidgetResources_fr

,

WidgetResources_de

, ...); breaking up the resources however you like.

#### public static
ResourceBundle
getBundle​(
String
baseName,

Locale
targetLocale,

Module
module)

Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name and locale
on behalf of the specified module.

Resource bundles in named modules may be encapsulated. When
the resource bundle is loaded from a

service provider

, the caller module
must have an appropriate

uses

clause in its

module descriptor

to declare that the module uses of

ResourceBundleProvider

for the named resource bundle.
Otherwise, it will load the resource bundles that are local in the
given module as if calling

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

or that are visible to the class loader of the given module
as if calling

ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)

.
When the resource bundle is loaded from the specified module, it is
subject to the encapsulation rules specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.

If the given

module

is an unnamed module, then this method is
equivalent to calling

getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, module.getClassLoader()

to load
resource bundles that are visible to the class loader of the given
unnamed module. Custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations, if present, will only be invoked if the specified
module is an unnamed module.

**Parameters:**
- baseName

- the base name of the resource bundle,
a fully qualified class name
- targetLocale

- the locale for which a resource bundle is desired
- module

- the module for which the resource bundle is searched

**Returns:**
- a resource bundle for the given base name and locale in the module

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

baseName

,

targetLocale

, or

module

is

null
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller is not the specified
module and doesn't have

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")
- MissingResourceException

- if no resource bundle for the specified base name and locale can
be found in the specified

module

#### public static
ResourceBundle
getBundle​(
String
baseName,

Locale
locale,

ClassLoader
loader)

Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name, locale, and class
loader.

When this method is called from a named module and the given
loader is the class loader of the caller module, this is equivalent
to calling:

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, callerModule)
```

otherwise, this is equivalent to calling:

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, loader, control)
```

where

control

is the default instance of

ResourceBundle.Control

unless
a

Control

instance is provided by

ResourceBundleControlProvider

SPI. Refer to the
description of

modifying the default
behavior

. The following describes the default behavior.

Resource Bundle Search and Loading Strategy

getBundle

uses the base name, the specified locale, and
the default locale (obtained from

Locale.getDefault

) to generate a sequence of

candidate bundle names

. If the specified
locale's language, script, country, and variant are all empty strings,
then the base name is the only candidate bundle name. Otherwise, a list
of candidate locales is generated from the attribute values of the
specified locale (language, script, country and variant) and appended to
the base name. Typically, this will look like the following:

```java
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language
```

Candidate bundle names where the final component is an empty string
are omitted, along with the underscore. For example, if country is an
empty string, the second and the fifth candidate bundle names above
would be omitted. Also, if script is an empty string, the candidate names
including script are omitted. For example, a locale with language "de"
and variant "JAVA" will produce candidate names with base name
"MyResource" below.

```java
MyResource_de__JAVA
MyResource_de
```

In the case that the variant contains one or more underscores ('_'), a
sequence of bundle names generated by truncating the last underscore and
the part following it is inserted after a candidate bundle name with the
original variant. For example, for a locale with language "en", script
"Latn, country "US" and variant "WINDOWS_VISTA", and bundle base name
"MyResource", the list of candidate bundle names below is generated:

```java
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_Latn_US
MyResource_en_Latn
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_US
MyResource_en
```

Note:

For some

Locale

s, the list of
candidate bundle names contains extra names, or the order of bundle names
is slightly modified. See the description of the default implementation
of

getCandidateLocales

for details.

getBundle

then iterates over the candidate bundle names
to find the first one for which it can

instantiate

an actual
resource bundle. It uses the default controls'

getFormats

method, which generates two bundle names for each generated
name, the first a class name and the second a properties file name. For
each candidate bundle name, it attempts to create a resource bundle:

- First, it attempts to load a class using the generated class name.
If such a class can be found and loaded using the specified class
loader, is assignment compatible with ResourceBundle, is accessible from
ResourceBundle, and can be instantiated,

getBundle

creates a
new instance of this class and uses it as the

result resource
bundle

.

Otherwise,

getBundle

attempts to locate a property
resource file using the generated properties file name. It generates a
path name from the candidate bundle name by replacing all "." characters
with "/" and appending the string ".properties". It attempts to find a
"resource" with this name using

ClassLoader.getResource

. (Note that a "resource" in the sense of

getResource

has nothing to do with the contents of a
resource bundle, it is just a container of data, such as a file.) If it
finds a "resource", it attempts to create a new

PropertyResourceBundle

instance from its contents. If successful, this
instance becomes the

result resource bundle

.

This continues until a result resource bundle is instantiated or the
list of candidate bundle names is exhausted. If no matching resource
bundle is found, the default control's

getFallbackLocale

method is called, which returns the current default
locale. A new sequence of candidate locale names is generated using this
locale and searched again, as above.

If still no result bundle is found, the base name alone is looked up. If
this still fails, a

MissingResourceException

is thrown.

Once a result resource bundle has been found,
its

parent chain

is instantiated

. If the result bundle already
has a parent (perhaps because it was returned from a cache) the chain is
complete.

Otherwise,

getBundle

examines the remainder of the
candidate locale list that was used during the pass that generated the
result resource bundle. (As before, candidate bundle names where the
final component is an empty string are omitted.) When it comes to the
end of the candidate list, it tries the plain bundle name. With each of the
candidate bundle names it attempts to instantiate a resource bundle (first
looking for a class and then a properties file, as described above).

Whenever it succeeds, it calls the previously instantiated resource
bundle's

setParent

method
with the new resource bundle. This continues until the list of names
is exhausted or the current bundle already has a non-null parent.

Once the parent chain is complete, the bundle is returned.

Note:

getBundle

caches instantiated resource
bundles and might return the same resource bundle instance multiple times.

Note:

The

baseName

argument should be a fully
qualified class name. However, for compatibility with earlier versions,
Java SE Runtime Environments do not verify this, and so it is
possible to access

PropertyResourceBundle

s by specifying a
path name (using "/") instead of a fully qualified class name (using
".").

Example:

The following class and property files are provided:

- MyResources.class

MyResources.properties

MyResources_fr.properties

MyResources_fr_CH.class

MyResources_fr_CH.properties

MyResources_en.properties

MyResources_es_ES.class

The contents of all files are valid (that is, public non-abstract
subclasses of

ResourceBundle

for the ".class" files,
syntactically correct ".properties" files). The default locale is

Locale("en", "GB")

.

Calling

getBundle

with the locale arguments below will
instantiate resource bundles as follows:

getBundle() locale to resource bundle mapping

Locale

Resource bundle

Locale("fr", "CH")

MyResources_fr_CH.class, parent MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("fr", "FR")

MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("de", "DE")

MyResources_en.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("en", "US")

MyResources_en.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("es", "ES")

MyResources_es_ES.class, parent MyResources.class

The file MyResources_fr_CH.properties is never used because it is
hidden by the MyResources_fr_CH.class. Likewise, MyResources.properties
is also hidden by MyResources.class.

**Parameters:**
- baseName

- the base name of the resource bundle, a fully qualified class name
- locale

- the locale for which a resource bundle is desired
- loader

- the class loader from which to load the resource bundle

**Returns:**
- a resource bundle for the given base name and locale

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

baseName

,

locale

, or

loader

is

null
- MissingResourceException

- if no resource bundle for the specified base name can be found

**See Also:**
- Resource Bundles and Named Modules

**Since:**
- 1.2

**API Note:**
- If the caller module is a named module and the given

loader

is the caller module's class loader, this method is
equivalent to

getBundle(baseName, locale)

; otherwise, it may not
find resource bundles from named modules.
Use

getBundle(String, Locale, Module)

to load resource bundles
on behalf on a specific module instead.

. If the requested resource bundle instance is
found in the cache and the time-to-live periods of the instance and
all of its parent instances have not expired, the instance is returned
to the caller. Otherwise, this factory method proceeds with the
loading process below.
- The

control.getFormats

method is called to get resource bundle formats
to produce bundle or resource names. The strings

"java.class"

and

"java.properties"

designate class-based and

property

-based resource bundles, respectively. Other strings
starting with

"java."

are reserved for future extensions
and must not be used for application-defined formats. Other strings
designate application-defined formats.
- The

control.getCandidateLocales

method is called with the target
locale to get a list of

candidate

Locale

s

for
which resource bundles are searched.
- The

control.newBundle

method is called to
instantiate a

ResourceBundle

for the base bundle name, a
candidate locale, and a format. (Refer to the note on the cache
lookup below.) This step is iterated over all combinations of the
candidate locales and formats until the

newBundle

method
returns a

ResourceBundle

instance or the iteration has
used up all the combinations. For example, if the candidate locales
are

Locale("de", "DE")

,

Locale("de")

and

Locale("")

and the formats are

"java.class"

and

"java.properties"

, then the following is the
sequence of locale-format combinations to be used to call

control.newBundle

.

locale-format combinations for newBundle

Index

Locale

format

1

Locale("de", "DE")

java.class

2

Locale("de", "DE")

java.properties

3

Locale("de")

java.class

4

Locale("de")

java.properties

5

Locale("")

java.class

6

Locale("")

java.properties
- If the previous step has found no resource bundle, proceed to
Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is a base bundle (a bundle
for

Locale("")

), and the candidate locale list only contained

Locale("")

, return the bundle to the caller. If a bundle
has been found that is a base bundle, but the candidate locale list
contained locales other than Locale(""), put the bundle on hold and
proceed to Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is not a base
bundle, proceed to Step 7.
- The

control.getFallbackLocale

method is called to get a fallback
locale (alternative to the current target locale) to try further
finding a resource bundle. If the method returns a non-null locale,
it becomes the next target locale and the loading process starts over
from Step 3. Otherwise, if a base bundle was found and put on hold in
a previous Step 5, it is returned to the caller now. Otherwise, a
MissingResourceException is thrown.
- At this point, we have found a resource bundle that's not the
base bundle. If this bundle set its parent during its instantiation,
it is returned to the caller. Otherwise, its

parent chain

is
instantiated based on the list of candidate locales from which it was
found. Finally, the bundle is returned to the caller.

During the resource bundle loading process above, this factory
method looks up the cache before calling the

control.newBundle

method. If the time-to-live period of the
resource bundle found in the cache has expired, the factory method
calls the

control.needsReload

method to determine whether the resource bundle needs to be reloaded.
If reloading is required, the factory method calls

control.newBundle

to reload the resource bundle. If

control.newBundle

returns

null

, the factory
method puts a dummy resource bundle in the cache as a mark of
nonexistent resource bundles in order to avoid lookup overhead for
subsequent requests. Such dummy resource bundles are under the same
expiration control as specified by

control

.

All resource bundles loaded are cached by default. Refer to

control.getTimeToLive

for details.

The following is an example of the bundle loading process with the
default

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation.

Conditions:

- Base bundle name:

foo.bar.Messages

Requested

Locale

:

Locale.ITALY

Default

Locale

:

Locale.FRENCH

Available resource bundles:

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties

and

foo/bar/Messages.properties

First,

getBundle

tries loading a resource bundle in
the following sequence.

- class

foo.bar.Messages_it_IT

file

foo/bar/Messages_it_IT.properties

class

foo.bar.Messages_it

file

foo/bar/Messages_it.properties

class

foo.bar.Messages

file

foo/bar/Messages.properties

At this point,

getBundle

finds

foo/bar/Messages.properties

, which is put on hold
because it's the base bundle.

getBundle

calls

control.getFallbackLocale("foo.bar.Messages", Locale.ITALY)

which
returns

Locale.FRENCH

. Next,

getBundle

tries loading a bundle in the following sequence.

- class

foo.bar.Messages_fr
- file

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties
- class

foo.bar.Messages
- file

foo/bar/Messages.properties

getBundle

finds

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties

and creates a

ResourceBundle

instance. Then,

getBundle

sets up its parent chain from the list of the candidate locales. Only

foo/bar/Messages.properties

is found in the list and

getBundle

creates a

ResourceBundle

instance
that becomes the parent of the instance for

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties

.

**Parameters:**

Resource bundles contain locale-specific objects. When your program needs a
locale-specific resource, a

String

for example, your program can
load it from the resource bundle that is appropriate for the current user's
locale. In this way, you can write program code that is largely independent
of the user's locale isolating most, if not all, of the locale-specific
information in resource bundles.

This allows you to write programs that can:

- be easily localized, or translated, into different languages

handle multiple locales at once

be easily modified later to support even more locales

Resource bundles belong to families whose members share a common base
name, but whose names also have additional components that identify
their locales. For example, the base name of a family of resource
bundles might be "MyResources". The family should have a default
resource bundle which simply has the same name as its family -
"MyResources" - and will be used as the bundle of last resort if a
specific locale is not supported. The family can then provide as
many locale-specific members as needed, for example a German one
named "MyResources_de".

Each resource bundle in a family contains the same items, but the items have
been translated for the locale represented by that resource bundle.
For example, both "MyResources" and "MyResources_de" may have a

String

that's used on a button for canceling operations.
In "MyResources" the

String

may contain "Cancel" and in
"MyResources_de" it may contain "Abbrechen".

If there are different resources for different countries, you
can make specializations: for example, "MyResources_de_CH" contains objects for
the German language (de) in Switzerland (CH). If you want to only
modify some of the resources
in the specialization, you can do so.

When your program needs a locale-specific object, it loads
the

ResourceBundle

class using the

getBundle

method:

```java
ResourceBundle myResources =
ResourceBundle.getBundle("MyResources", currentLocale);
```

Resource bundles contain key/value pairs. The keys uniquely
identify a locale-specific object in the bundle. Here's an
example of a

ListResourceBundle

that contains
two key/value pairs:

```java
public class MyResources extends ListResourceBundle {
protected Object[][] getContents() {
return new Object[][] {
// LOCALIZE THE SECOND STRING OF EACH ARRAY (e.g., "OK")
{"OkKey", "OK"},
{"CancelKey", "Cancel"},
// END OF MATERIAL TO LOCALIZE
};
}
}
```

Keys are always

String

s.
In this example, the keys are "OkKey" and "CancelKey".
In the above example, the values
are also

String

s--"OK" and "Cancel"--but
they don't have to be. The values can be any type of object.

You retrieve an object from resource bundle using the appropriate
getter method. Because "OkKey" and "CancelKey"
are both strings, you would use

getString

to retrieve them:

```java
button1 = new Button(myResources.getString("OkKey"));
button2 = new Button(myResources.getString("CancelKey"));
```

The getter methods all require the key as an argument and return
the object if found. If the object is not found, the getter method
throws a

MissingResourceException

.

Besides

getString

,

ResourceBundle

also provides
a method for getting string arrays,

getStringArray

,
as well as a generic

getObject

method for any other
type of object. When using

getObject

, you'll
have to cast the result to the appropriate type. For example:

```java
int[] myIntegers = (int[]) myResources.getObject("intList");
```

The Java Platform provides two subclasses of

ResourceBundle

,

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

,
that provide a fairly simple way to create resources.
As you saw briefly in a previous example,

ListResourceBundle

manages its resource as a list of key/value pairs.

PropertyResourceBundle

uses a properties file to manage
its resources.

If

ListResourceBundle

or

PropertyResourceBundle

do not suit your needs, you can write your own

ResourceBundle

subclass. Your subclasses must override two methods:

handleGetObject

and

getKeys()

.

The implementation of a

ResourceBundle

subclass must be thread-safe
if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads. The default implementations
of the non-abstract methods in this class, and the methods in the direct
known concrete subclasses

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

are thread-safe.

Resource Bundles and Named Modules

Resource bundles can be deployed in modules in the following ways:

Resource bundles together with an application

Resource bundles can be deployed together with an application in the same
module. In that case, the resource bundles are loaded
by code in the module by calling the

getBundle(String)

or

getBundle(String, Locale)

method.

Resource bundles as service providers

Resource bundles can be deployed in one or more

service provider modules

and they can be located using

ServiceLoader

.
A

service

interface or class must be
defined. The caller module declares that it uses the service, the service
provider modules declare that they provide implementations of the service.
Refer to

ResourceBundleProvider

for developing resource bundle
services and deploying resource bundle providers.
The module obtaining the resource bundle can be a resource bundle
provider itself; in which case this module only locates the resource bundle
via service provider mechanism.

A

resource bundle provider

can
provide resource bundles in any format such XML which replaces the need
of

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Resource bundles in other modules and class path

Resource bundles in a named module may be

encapsulated

so that
it cannot be located by code in other modules. Resource bundles
in unnamed modules and class path are open for any module to access.
Resource bundle follows the resource encapsulation rules as specified
in

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

.

The

getBundle

factory methods with no

Control

parameter
locate and load resource bundles from

service providers

.
It may continue the search as if calling

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

to find the named resource from a given module and calling

ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)

; refer to
the specification of the

getBundle

method for details.
Only non-encapsulated resource bundles of "

java.class

"
or "

java.properties

" format are searched.

If the caller module is a

resource bundle provider

, it does not fall back to the
class loader search.

Resource bundles in automatic modules

A common format of resource bundles is in

.properties

file format. Typically

.properties

resource bundles
are packaged in a JAR file. Resource bundle only JAR file can be readily
deployed as an

automatic module

. For example, if the JAR file contains the
entry "

p/q/Foo_ja.properties

" and no

.class

entry,
when resolved and defined as an automatic module, no package is derived
for this module. This allows resource bundles in

.properties

format packaged in one or more JAR files that may contain entries
in the same directory and can be resolved successfully as
automatic modules.

ResourceBundle.Control

The

ResourceBundle.Control

class provides information necessary
to perform the bundle loading process by the

getBundle

factory methods that take a

ResourceBundle.Control

instance. You can implement your own subclass in order to enable
non-standard resource bundle formats, change the search strategy, or
define caching parameters. Refer to the descriptions of the class and the

getBundle

factory method for details.

ResourceBundle.Control

is designed for an application deployed
in an unnamed module, for example to support resource bundles in
non-standard formats or package localized resources in a non-traditional
convention.

ResourceBundleProvider

is the replacement for

ResourceBundle.Control

when migrating to modules.

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown when a factory
method that takes the

ResourceBundle.Control

parameter is called.

For the

getBundle

factory

methods that take no

ResourceBundle.Control

instance, their

default behavior

of resource bundle loading
can be modified with custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations.
If any of the
providers provides a

ResourceBundle.Control

for the given base name, that

ResourceBundle.Control

will be used instead of the default

ResourceBundle.Control

. If there is
more than one service provider for supporting the same base name,
the first one returned from

ServiceLoader

will be used.
A custom

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation is ignored by named modules.

Cache Management

Resource bundle instances created by the

getBundle

factory
methods are cached by default, and the factory methods return the same
resource bundle instance multiple times if it has been
cached.

getBundle

clients may clear the cache, manage the
lifetime of cached resource bundle instances using time-to-live values,
or specify not to cache resource bundle instances. Refer to the
descriptions of the

getBundle

factory method

,

clearCache

,

ResourceBundle.Control.getTimeToLive

, and

ResourceBundle.Control.needsReload

for details.

Example

The following is a very simple example of a

ResourceBundle

subclass,

MyResources

, that manages two resources (for a larger number of
resources you would probably use a

Map

).
Notice that you don't need to supply a value if
a "parent-level"

ResourceBundle

handles the same
key with the same value (as for the okKey below).

```java
// default (English language, United States)
public class MyResources extends ResourceBundle {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
if (key.equals("okKey")) return "Ok";
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Cancel";
return null;
}

public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
return Collections.enumeration(keySet());
}

// Overrides handleKeySet() so that the getKeys() implementation
// can rely on the keySet() value.
protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("okKey", "cancelKey"));
}
}

// German language
public class MyResources_de extends MyResources {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
// don't need okKey, since parent level handles it.
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Abbrechen";
return null;
}

protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("cancelKey"));
}
}
```

You do not have to restrict yourself to using a single family of

ResourceBundle

s. For example, you could have a set of bundles for
exception messages,

ExceptionResources

(

ExceptionResources_fr

,

ExceptionResources_de

, ...),
and one for widgets,

WidgetResource

(

WidgetResources_fr

,

WidgetResources_de

, ...); breaking up the resources however you like.

return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("cancelKey"));
}
}
```

You do not have to restrict yourself to using a single family of

ResourceBundle

s. For example, you could have a set of bundles for
exception messages,

ExceptionResources

(

ExceptionResources_fr

,

ExceptionResources_de

, ...),
and one for widgets,

WidgetResource

(

WidgetResources_fr

,

WidgetResources_de

, ...); breaking up the resources however you like.

This allows you to write programs that can:

- be easily localized, or translated, into different languages

handle multiple locales at once

be easily modified later to support even more locales

Resource bundles belong to families whose members share a common base
name, but whose names also have additional components that identify
their locales. For example, the base name of a family of resource
bundles might be "MyResources". The family should have a default
resource bundle which simply has the same name as its family -
"MyResources" - and will be used as the bundle of last resort if a
specific locale is not supported. The family can then provide as
many locale-specific members as needed, for example a German one
named "MyResources_de".

Each resource bundle in a family contains the same items, but the items have
been translated for the locale represented by that resource bundle.
For example, both "MyResources" and "MyResources_de" may have a

String

that's used on a button for canceling operations.
In "MyResources" the

String

may contain "Cancel" and in
"MyResources_de" it may contain "Abbrechen".

If there are different resources for different countries, you
can make specializations: for example, "MyResources_de_CH" contains objects for
the German language (de) in Switzerland (CH). If you want to only
modify some of the resources
in the specialization, you can do so.

When your program needs a locale-specific object, it loads
the

ResourceBundle

class using the

getBundle

method:

```java
ResourceBundle myResources =
ResourceBundle.getBundle("MyResources", currentLocale);
```

Resource bundles contain key/value pairs. The keys uniquely
identify a locale-specific object in the bundle. Here's an
example of a

ListResourceBundle

that contains
two key/value pairs:

```java
public class MyResources extends ListResourceBundle {
protected Object[][] getContents() {
return new Object[][] {
// LOCALIZE THE SECOND STRING OF EACH ARRAY (e.g., "OK")
{"OkKey", "OK"},
{"CancelKey", "Cancel"},
// END OF MATERIAL TO LOCALIZE
};
}
}
```

Keys are always

String

s.
In this example, the keys are "OkKey" and "CancelKey".
In the above example, the values
are also

String

s--"OK" and "Cancel"--but
they don't have to be. The values can be any type of object.

You retrieve an object from resource bundle using the appropriate
getter method. Because "OkKey" and "CancelKey"
are both strings, you would use

getString

to retrieve them:

```java
button1 = new Button(myResources.getString("OkKey"));
button2 = new Button(myResources.getString("CancelKey"));
```

The getter methods all require the key as an argument and return
the object if found. If the object is not found, the getter method
throws a

MissingResourceException

.

Besides

getString

,

ResourceBundle

also provides
a method for getting string arrays,

getStringArray

,
as well as a generic

getObject

method for any other
type of object. When using

getObject

, you'll
have to cast the result to the appropriate type. For example:

```java
int[] myIntegers = (int[]) myResources.getObject("intList");
```

The Java Platform provides two subclasses of

ResourceBundle

,

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

,
that provide a fairly simple way to create resources.
As you saw briefly in a previous example,

ListResourceBundle

manages its resource as a list of key/value pairs.

PropertyResourceBundle

uses a properties file to manage
its resources.

If

ListResourceBundle

or

PropertyResourceBundle

do not suit your needs, you can write your own

ResourceBundle

subclass. Your subclasses must override two methods:

handleGetObject

and

getKeys()

.

The implementation of a

ResourceBundle

subclass must be thread-safe
if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads. The default implementations
of the non-abstract methods in this class, and the methods in the direct
known concrete subclasses

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

are thread-safe.

Resource Bundles and Named Modules

Resource bundles can be deployed in modules in the following ways:

Resource bundles together with an application

Resource bundles can be deployed together with an application in the same
module. In that case, the resource bundles are loaded
by code in the module by calling the

getBundle(String)

or

getBundle(String, Locale)

method.

Resource bundles as service providers

Resource bundles can be deployed in one or more

service provider modules

and they can be located using

ServiceLoader

.
A

service

interface or class must be
defined. The caller module declares that it uses the service, the service
provider modules declare that they provide implementations of the service.
Refer to

ResourceBundleProvider

for developing resource bundle
services and deploying resource bundle providers.
The module obtaining the resource bundle can be a resource bundle
provider itself; in which case this module only locates the resource bundle
via service provider mechanism.

A

resource bundle provider

can
provide resource bundles in any format such XML which replaces the need
of

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Resource bundles in other modules and class path

Resource bundles in a named module may be

encapsulated

so that
it cannot be located by code in other modules. Resource bundles
in unnamed modules and class path are open for any module to access.
Resource bundle follows the resource encapsulation rules as specified
in

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

.

The

getBundle

factory methods with no

Control

parameter
locate and load resource bundles from

service providers

.
It may continue the search as if calling

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

to find the named resource from a given module and calling

ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)

; refer to
the specification of the

getBundle

method for details.
Only non-encapsulated resource bundles of "

java.class

"
or "

java.properties

" format are searched.

If the caller module is a

resource bundle provider

, it does not fall back to the
class loader search.

Resource bundles in automatic modules

A common format of resource bundles is in

.properties

file format. Typically

.properties

resource bundles
are packaged in a JAR file. Resource bundle only JAR file can be readily
deployed as an

automatic module

. For example, if the JAR file contains the
entry "

p/q/Foo_ja.properties

" and no

.class

entry,
when resolved and defined as an automatic module, no package is derived
for this module. This allows resource bundles in

.properties

format packaged in one or more JAR files that may contain entries
in the same directory and can be resolved successfully as
automatic modules.

ResourceBundle.Control

The

ResourceBundle.Control

class provides information necessary
to perform the bundle loading process by the

getBundle

factory methods that take a

ResourceBundle.Control

instance. You can implement your own subclass in order to enable
non-standard resource bundle formats, change the search strategy, or
define caching parameters. Refer to the descriptions of the class and the

getBundle

factory method for details.

ResourceBundle.Control

is designed for an application deployed
in an unnamed module, for example to support resource bundles in
non-standard formats or package localized resources in a non-traditional
convention.

ResourceBundleProvider

is the replacement for

ResourceBundle.Control

when migrating to modules.

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown when a factory
method that takes the

ResourceBundle.Control

parameter is called.

For the

getBundle

factory

methods that take no

ResourceBundle.Control

instance, their

default behavior

of resource bundle loading
can be modified with custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations.
If any of the
providers provides a

ResourceBundle.Control

for the given base name, that

ResourceBundle.Control

will be used instead of the default

ResourceBundle.Control

. If there is
more than one service provider for supporting the same base name,
the first one returned from

ServiceLoader

will be used.
A custom

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation is ignored by named modules.

Cache Management

Resource bundle instances created by the

getBundle

factory
methods are cached by default, and the factory methods return the same
resource bundle instance multiple times if it has been
cached.

getBundle

clients may clear the cache, manage the
lifetime of cached resource bundle instances using time-to-live values,
or specify not to cache resource bundle instances. Refer to the
descriptions of the

getBundle

factory method

,

clearCache

,

ResourceBundle.Control.getTimeToLive

, and

ResourceBundle.Control.needsReload

for details.

Example

The following is a very simple example of a

ResourceBundle

subclass,

MyResources

, that manages two resources (for a larger number of
resources you would probably use a

Map

).
Notice that you don't need to supply a value if
a "parent-level"

ResourceBundle

handles the same
key with the same value (as for the okKey below).

```java
// default (English language, United States)
public class MyResources extends ResourceBundle {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
if (key.equals("okKey")) return "Ok";
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Cancel";
return null;
}

public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
return Collections.enumeration(keySet());
}

// Overrides handleKeySet() so that the getKeys() implementation
// can rely on the keySet() value.
protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("okKey", "cancelKey"));
}
}

// German language
public class MyResources_de extends MyResources {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
// don't need okKey, since parent level handles it.
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Abbrechen";
return null;
}

protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("cancelKey"));
}
}
```

in the specialization, you can do so.

When your program needs a locale-specific object, it loads
the

ResourceBundle

class using the

getBundle

method:

```java
ResourceBundle myResources =
ResourceBundle.getBundle("MyResources", currentLocale);
```

Resource bundles contain key/value pairs. The keys uniquely
identify a locale-specific object in the bundle. Here's an
example of a

ListResourceBundle

that contains
two key/value pairs:

```java
public class MyResources extends ListResourceBundle {
protected Object[][] getContents() {
return new Object[][] {
// LOCALIZE THE SECOND STRING OF EACH ARRAY (e.g., "OK")
{"OkKey", "OK"},
{"CancelKey", "Cancel"},
// END OF MATERIAL TO LOCALIZE
};
}
}
```

Keys are always

String

s.
In this example, the keys are "OkKey" and "CancelKey".
In the above example, the values
are also

String

s--"OK" and "Cancel"--but
they don't have to be. The values can be any type of object.

You retrieve an object from resource bundle using the appropriate
getter method. Because "OkKey" and "CancelKey"
are both strings, you would use

getString

to retrieve them:

```java
button1 = new Button(myResources.getString("OkKey"));
button2 = new Button(myResources.getString("CancelKey"));
```

The getter methods all require the key as an argument and return
the object if found. If the object is not found, the getter method
throws a

MissingResourceException

.

Besides

getString

,

ResourceBundle

also provides
a method for getting string arrays,

getStringArray

,
as well as a generic

getObject

method for any other
type of object. When using

getObject

, you'll
have to cast the result to the appropriate type. For example:

```java
int[] myIntegers = (int[]) myResources.getObject("intList");
```

The Java Platform provides two subclasses of

ResourceBundle

,

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

,
that provide a fairly simple way to create resources.
As you saw briefly in a previous example,

ListResourceBundle

manages its resource as a list of key/value pairs.

PropertyResourceBundle

uses a properties file to manage
its resources.

If

ListResourceBundle

or

PropertyResourceBundle

do not suit your needs, you can write your own

ResourceBundle

subclass. Your subclasses must override two methods:

handleGetObject

and

getKeys()

.

The implementation of a

ResourceBundle

subclass must be thread-safe
if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads. The default implementations
of the non-abstract methods in this class, and the methods in the direct
known concrete subclasses

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

are thread-safe.

Resource Bundles and Named Modules

Resource bundles can be deployed in modules in the following ways:

Resource bundles together with an application

Resource bundles can be deployed together with an application in the same
module. In that case, the resource bundles are loaded
by code in the module by calling the

getBundle(String)

or

getBundle(String, Locale)

method.

Resource bundles as service providers

Resource bundles can be deployed in one or more

service provider modules

and they can be located using

ServiceLoader

.
A

service

interface or class must be
defined. The caller module declares that it uses the service, the service
provider modules declare that they provide implementations of the service.
Refer to

ResourceBundleProvider

for developing resource bundle
services and deploying resource bundle providers.
The module obtaining the resource bundle can be a resource bundle
provider itself; in which case this module only locates the resource bundle
via service provider mechanism.

A

resource bundle provider

can
provide resource bundles in any format such XML which replaces the need
of

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Resource bundles in other modules and class path

Resource bundles in a named module may be

encapsulated

so that
it cannot be located by code in other modules. Resource bundles
in unnamed modules and class path are open for any module to access.
Resource bundle follows the resource encapsulation rules as specified
in

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

.

The

getBundle

factory methods with no

Control

parameter
locate and load resource bundles from

service providers

.
It may continue the search as if calling

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

to find the named resource from a given module and calling

ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)

; refer to
the specification of the

getBundle

method for details.
Only non-encapsulated resource bundles of "

java.class

"
or "

java.properties

" format are searched.

If the caller module is a

resource bundle provider

, it does not fall back to the
class loader search.

Resource bundles in automatic modules

A common format of resource bundles is in

.properties

file format. Typically

.properties

resource bundles
are packaged in a JAR file. Resource bundle only JAR file can be readily
deployed as an

automatic module

. For example, if the JAR file contains the
entry "

p/q/Foo_ja.properties

" and no

.class

entry,
when resolved and defined as an automatic module, no package is derived
for this module. This allows resource bundles in

.properties

format packaged in one or more JAR files that may contain entries
in the same directory and can be resolved successfully as
automatic modules.

ResourceBundle.Control

The

ResourceBundle.Control

class provides information necessary
to perform the bundle loading process by the

getBundle

factory methods that take a

ResourceBundle.Control

instance. You can implement your own subclass in order to enable
non-standard resource bundle formats, change the search strategy, or
define caching parameters. Refer to the descriptions of the class and the

getBundle

factory method for details.

ResourceBundle.Control

is designed for an application deployed
in an unnamed module, for example to support resource bundles in
non-standard formats or package localized resources in a non-traditional
convention.

ResourceBundleProvider

is the replacement for

ResourceBundle.Control

when migrating to modules.

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown when a factory
method that takes the

ResourceBundle.Control

parameter is called.

For the

getBundle

factory

methods that take no

ResourceBundle.Control

instance, their

default behavior

of resource bundle loading
can be modified with custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations.
If any of the
providers provides a

ResourceBundle.Control

for the given base name, that

ResourceBundle.Control

will be used instead of the default

ResourceBundle.Control

. If there is
more than one service provider for supporting the same base name,
the first one returned from

ServiceLoader

will be used.
A custom

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation is ignored by named modules.

Cache Management

Resource bundle instances created by the

getBundle

factory
methods are cached by default, and the factory methods return the same
resource bundle instance multiple times if it has been
cached.

getBundle

clients may clear the cache, manage the
lifetime of cached resource bundle instances using time-to-live values,
or specify not to cache resource bundle instances. Refer to the
descriptions of the

getBundle

factory method

,

clearCache

,

ResourceBundle.Control.getTimeToLive

, and

ResourceBundle.Control.needsReload

for details.

Example

The following is a very simple example of a

ResourceBundle

subclass,

MyResources

, that manages two resources (for a larger number of
resources you would probably use a

Map

).
Notice that you don't need to supply a value if
a "parent-level"

ResourceBundle

handles the same
key with the same value (as for the okKey below).

```java
// default (English language, United States)
public class MyResources extends ResourceBundle {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
if (key.equals("okKey")) return "Ok";
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Cancel";
return null;
}

public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
return Collections.enumeration(keySet());
}

// Overrides handleKeySet() so that the getKeys() implementation
// can rely on the keySet() value.
protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("okKey", "cancelKey"));
}
}

// German language
public class MyResources_de extends MyResources {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
// don't need okKey, since parent level handles it.
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Abbrechen";
return null;
}

protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("cancelKey"));
}
}
```

You do not have to restrict yourself to using a single family of

ResourceBundle

s. For example, you could have a set of bundles for
exception messages,

ExceptionResources

(

ExceptionResources_fr

,

ExceptionResources_de

, ...),
and one for widgets,

WidgetResource

(

WidgetResources_fr

,

WidgetResources_de

, ...); breaking up the resources however you like.

When your program needs a locale-specific object, it loads
the

ResourceBundle

class using the

getBundle

method:

```java
ResourceBundle myResources =
ResourceBundle.getBundle("MyResources", currentLocale);
```

Resource bundles contain key/value pairs. The keys uniquely
identify a locale-specific object in the bundle. Here's an
example of a

ListResourceBundle

that contains
two key/value pairs:

```java
public class MyResources extends ListResourceBundle {
protected Object[][] getContents() {
return new Object[][] {
// LOCALIZE THE SECOND STRING OF EACH ARRAY (e.g., "OK")
{"OkKey", "OK"},
{"CancelKey", "Cancel"},
// END OF MATERIAL TO LOCALIZE
};
}
}
```

Keys are always

String

s.
In this example, the keys are "OkKey" and "CancelKey".
In the above example, the values
are also

String

s--"OK" and "Cancel"--but
they don't have to be. The values can be any type of object.

You retrieve an object from resource bundle using the appropriate
getter method. Because "OkKey" and "CancelKey"
are both strings, you would use

getString

to retrieve them:

```java
button1 = new Button(myResources.getString("OkKey"));
button2 = new Button(myResources.getString("CancelKey"));
```

The getter methods all require the key as an argument and return
the object if found. If the object is not found, the getter method
throws a

MissingResourceException

.

Besides

getString

,

ResourceBundle

also provides
a method for getting string arrays,

getStringArray

,
as well as a generic

getObject

method for any other
type of object. When using

getObject

, you'll
have to cast the result to the appropriate type. For example:

```java
int[] myIntegers = (int[]) myResources.getObject("intList");
```

The Java Platform provides two subclasses of

ResourceBundle

,

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

,
that provide a fairly simple way to create resources.
As you saw briefly in a previous example,

ListResourceBundle

manages its resource as a list of key/value pairs.

PropertyResourceBundle

uses a properties file to manage
its resources.

If

ListResourceBundle

or

PropertyResourceBundle

do not suit your needs, you can write your own

ResourceBundle

subclass. Your subclasses must override two methods:

handleGetObject

and

getKeys()

.

The implementation of a

ResourceBundle

subclass must be thread-safe
if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads. The default implementations
of the non-abstract methods in this class, and the methods in the direct
known concrete subclasses

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

are thread-safe.

Resource Bundles and Named Modules

Resource bundles can be deployed in modules in the following ways:

Resource bundles together with an application

Resource bundles can be deployed together with an application in the same
module. In that case, the resource bundles are loaded
by code in the module by calling the

getBundle(String)

or

getBundle(String, Locale)

method.

Resource bundles as service providers

Resource bundles can be deployed in one or more

service provider modules

and they can be located using

ServiceLoader

.
A

service

interface or class must be
defined. The caller module declares that it uses the service, the service
provider modules declare that they provide implementations of the service.
Refer to

ResourceBundleProvider

for developing resource bundle
services and deploying resource bundle providers.
The module obtaining the resource bundle can be a resource bundle
provider itself; in which case this module only locates the resource bundle
via service provider mechanism.

A

resource bundle provider

can
provide resource bundles in any format such XML which replaces the need
of

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Resource bundles in other modules and class path

Resource bundles in a named module may be

encapsulated

so that
it cannot be located by code in other modules. Resource bundles
in unnamed modules and class path are open for any module to access.
Resource bundle follows the resource encapsulation rules as specified
in

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

.

The

getBundle

factory methods with no

Control

parameter
locate and load resource bundles from

service providers

.
It may continue the search as if calling

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

to find the named resource from a given module and calling

ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)

; refer to
the specification of the

getBundle

method for details.
Only non-encapsulated resource bundles of "

java.class

"
or "

java.properties

" format are searched.

If the caller module is a

resource bundle provider

, it does not fall back to the
class loader search.

Resource bundles in automatic modules

A common format of resource bundles is in

.properties

file format. Typically

.properties

resource bundles
are packaged in a JAR file. Resource bundle only JAR file can be readily
deployed as an

automatic module

. For example, if the JAR file contains the
entry "

p/q/Foo_ja.properties

" and no

.class

entry,
when resolved and defined as an automatic module, no package is derived
for this module. This allows resource bundles in

.properties

format packaged in one or more JAR files that may contain entries
in the same directory and can be resolved successfully as
automatic modules.

ResourceBundle.Control

The

ResourceBundle.Control

class provides information necessary
to perform the bundle loading process by the

getBundle

factory methods that take a

ResourceBundle.Control

instance. You can implement your own subclass in order to enable
non-standard resource bundle formats, change the search strategy, or
define caching parameters. Refer to the descriptions of the class and the

getBundle

factory method for details.

ResourceBundle.Control

is designed for an application deployed
in an unnamed module, for example to support resource bundles in
non-standard formats or package localized resources in a non-traditional
convention.

ResourceBundleProvider

is the replacement for

ResourceBundle.Control

when migrating to modules.

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown when a factory
method that takes the

ResourceBundle.Control

parameter is called.

For the

getBundle

factory

methods that take no

ResourceBundle.Control

instance, their

default behavior

of resource bundle loading
can be modified with custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations.
If any of the
providers provides a

ResourceBundle.Control

for the given base name, that

ResourceBundle.Control

will be used instead of the default

ResourceBundle.Control

. If there is
more than one service provider for supporting the same base name,
the first one returned from

ServiceLoader

will be used.
A custom

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation is ignored by named modules.

Cache Management

Resource bundle instances created by the

getBundle

factory
methods are cached by default, and the factory methods return the same
resource bundle instance multiple times if it has been
cached.

getBundle

clients may clear the cache, manage the
lifetime of cached resource bundle instances using time-to-live values,
or specify not to cache resource bundle instances. Refer to the
descriptions of the

getBundle

factory method

,

clearCache

,

ResourceBundle.Control.getTimeToLive

, and

ResourceBundle.Control.needsReload

for details.

Example

The following is a very simple example of a

ResourceBundle

subclass,

MyResources

, that manages two resources (for a larger number of
resources you would probably use a

Map

).
Notice that you don't need to supply a value if
a "parent-level"

ResourceBundle

handles the same
key with the same value (as for the okKey below).

```java
// default (English language, United States)
public class MyResources extends ResourceBundle {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
if (key.equals("okKey")) return "Ok";
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Cancel";
return null;
}

public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
return Collections.enumeration(keySet());
}

// Overrides handleKeySet() so that the getKeys() implementation
// can rely on the keySet() value.
protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("okKey", "cancelKey"));
}
}

// German language
public class MyResources_de extends MyResources {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
// don't need okKey, since parent level handles it.
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Abbrechen";
return null;
}

protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("cancelKey"));
}
}
```

You do not have to restrict yourself to using a single family of

ResourceBundle

s. For example, you could have a set of bundles for
exception messages,

ExceptionResources

(

ExceptionResources_fr

,

ExceptionResources_de

, ...),
and one for widgets,

WidgetResource

(

WidgetResources_fr

,

WidgetResources_de

, ...); breaking up the resources however you like.

ResourceBundle myResources =
ResourceBundle.getBundle("MyResources", currentLocale);

Resource bundles contain key/value pairs. The keys uniquely
identify a locale-specific object in the bundle. Here's an
example of a

ListResourceBundle

that contains
two key/value pairs:

```java
public class MyResources extends ListResourceBundle {
protected Object[][] getContents() {
return new Object[][] {
// LOCALIZE THE SECOND STRING OF EACH ARRAY (e.g., "OK")
{"OkKey", "OK"},
{"CancelKey", "Cancel"},
// END OF MATERIAL TO LOCALIZE
};
}
}
```

Keys are always

String

s.
In this example, the keys are "OkKey" and "CancelKey".
In the above example, the values
are also

String

s--"OK" and "Cancel"--but
they don't have to be. The values can be any type of object.

You retrieve an object from resource bundle using the appropriate
getter method. Because "OkKey" and "CancelKey"
are both strings, you would use

getString

to retrieve them:

```java
button1 = new Button(myResources.getString("OkKey"));
button2 = new Button(myResources.getString("CancelKey"));
```

The getter methods all require the key as an argument and return
the object if found. If the object is not found, the getter method
throws a

MissingResourceException

.

getString

,

ResourceBundle

also provides
a method for getting string arrays,

getStringArray

,
as well as a generic

getObject

method for any other
type of object. When using

in the same directory and can be resolved successfully as
automatic modules.

ResourceBundle.Control

The

ResourceBundle.Control

class provides information necessary
to perform the bundle loading process by the

getBundle

factory methods that take a

ResourceBundle.Control

instance. You can implement your own subclass in order to enable
non-standard resource bundle formats, change the search strategy, or
define caching parameters. Refer to the descriptions of the class and the

ResourceBundle.Control

is designed for an application deployed

non-standard formats or package localized resources in a non-traditional
convention.

ResourceBundleProvider

is the replacement for

ResourceBundle.Control

when migrating to modules.

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown when a factory
method that takes the

ResourceBundle.Control

parameter is called.

For the

getBundle

factory

methods that take no

ResourceBundle.Control

instance, their

default behavior

of resource bundle loading
can be modified with custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations.
If any of the
providers provides a

Resource bundles in automatic modules

A common format of resource bundles is in

.properties

file format. Typically

.properties

resource bundles
are packaged in a JAR file. Resource bundle only JAR file can be readily
deployed as an

automatic module

. For example, if the JAR file contains the
entry "

p/q/Foo_ja.properties

" and no

.class

entry,
when resolved and defined as an automatic module, no package is derived
for this module. This allows resource bundles in

.properties

format packaged in one or more JAR files that may contain entries
in the same directory and can be resolved successfully as
automatic modules.

ResourceBundle.Control

The

ResourceBundle.Control

class provides information necessary
to perform the bundle loading process by the

getBundle

factory methods that take a

ResourceBundle.Control

instance. You can implement your own subclass in order to enable
non-standard resource bundle formats, change the search strategy, or
define caching parameters. Refer to the descriptions of the class and the

getBundle

factory method for details.

ResourceBundle.Control

is designed for an application deployed
in an unnamed module, for example to support resource bundles in
non-standard formats or package localized resources in a non-traditional
convention.

ResourceBundleProvider

is the replacement for

ResourceBundle.Control

when migrating to modules.

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown when a factory
method that takes the

ResourceBundle.Control

parameter is called.

For the

getBundle

factory

methods that take no

ResourceBundle.Control

instance, their

default behavior

of resource bundle loading
can be modified with custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations.
If any of the
providers provides a

ResourceBundle.Control

for the given base name, that

ResourceBundle.Control

will be used instead of the default

ResourceBundle.Control

. If there is
more than one service provider for supporting the same base name,
the first one returned from

ServiceLoader

will be used.
A custom

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation is ignored by named modules.

Cache Management

Resource bundle instances created by the

getBundle

factory
methods are cached by default, and the factory methods return the same
resource bundle instance multiple times if it has been
cached.

getBundle

clients may clear the cache, manage the
lifetime of cached resource bundle instances using time-to-live values,
or specify not to cache resource bundle instances. Refer to the
descriptions of the

getBundle

factory method

,

clearCache

,

ResourceBundle.Control.getTimeToLive

, and

ResourceBundle.Control.needsReload

for details.

Example

The following is a very simple example of a

ResourceBundle

subclass,

MyResources

, that manages two resources (for a larger number of
resources you would probably use a

Map

).
Notice that you don't need to supply a value if
a "parent-level"

ResourceBundle

handles the same
key with the same value (as for the okKey below).

```java
// default (English language, United States)
public class MyResources extends ResourceBundle {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
if (key.equals("okKey")) return "Ok";
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Cancel";
return null;
}

public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
return Collections.enumeration(keySet());
}

// Overrides handleKeySet() so that the getKeys() implementation
// can rely on the keySet() value.
protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("okKey", "cancelKey"));
}
}

// German language
public class MyResources_de extends MyResources {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
// don't need okKey, since parent level handles it.
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Abbrechen";
return null;
}

protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("cancelKey"));
}
}
```

You do not have to restrict yourself to using a single family of

ResourceBundle

s. For example, you could have a set of bundles for
exception messages,

ExceptionResources

(

ExceptionResources_fr

,

ExceptionResources_de

, ...),
and one for widgets,

WidgetResource

(

WidgetResources_fr

,

WidgetResources_de

, ...); breaking up the resources however you like.

button1 = new Button(myResources.getString("OkKey"));
button2 = new Button(myResources.getString("CancelKey"));

Besides

getString

,

ResourceBundle

also provides
a method for getting string arrays,

getStringArray

,
as well as a generic

getObject

method for any other
type of object. When using

getObject

, you'll
have to cast the result to the appropriate type. For example:

```java
int[] myIntegers = (int[]) myResources.getObject("intList");
```

The Java Platform provides two subclasses of

ResourceBundle

,

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

,
that provide a fairly simple way to create resources.
As you saw briefly in a previous example,

ListResourceBundle

manages its resource as a list of key/value pairs.

PropertyResourceBundle

uses a properties file to manage
its resources.

If

ListResourceBundle

or

PropertyResourceBundle

do not suit your needs, you can write your own

ResourceBundle

subclass. Your subclasses must override two methods:

handleGetObject

and

getKeys()

.

The implementation of a

ResourceBundle

subclass must be thread-safe
if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads. The default implementations
of the non-abstract methods in this class, and the methods in the direct
known concrete subclasses

ListResourceBundle

and

PropertyResourceBundle

are thread-safe.

Resource Bundles and Named Modules

Resource bundles can be deployed in modules in the following ways:

Resource bundles together with an application

Resource bundles can be deployed together with an application in the same
module. In that case, the resource bundles are loaded
by code in the module by calling the

getBundle(String)

or

getBundle(String, Locale)

method.

Resource bundles as service providers

Resource bundles can be deployed in one or more

service provider modules

and they can be located using

ServiceLoader

.
A

service

interface or class must be
defined. The caller module declares that it uses the service, the service
provider modules declare that they provide implementations of the service.
Refer to

ResourceBundleProvider

for developing resource bundle
services and deploying resource bundle providers.
The module obtaining the resource bundle can be a resource bundle
provider itself; in which case this module only locates the resource bundle
via service provider mechanism.

A

resource bundle provider

can
provide resource bundles in any format such XML which replaces the need
of

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Resource bundles in other modules and class path

Resource bundles in a named module may be

encapsulated

so that
it cannot be located by code in other modules. Resource bundles
in unnamed modules and class path are open for any module to access.
Resource bundle follows the resource encapsulation rules as specified
in

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

.

The

getBundle

factory methods with no

Control

parameter
locate and load resource bundles from

service providers

.
It may continue the search as if calling

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

to find the named resource from a given module and calling

ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)

; refer to
the specification of the

getBundle

method for details.
Only non-encapsulated resource bundles of "

java.class

"
or "

java.properties

" format are searched.

If the caller module is a

resource bundle provider

, it does not fall back to the
class loader search.

Resource bundles in automatic modules

A common format of resource bundles is in

.properties

file format. Typically

.properties

resource bundles

for this module. This allows resource bundles in

.properties

in the same directory and can be resolved successfully as
automatic modules.

ResourceBundle.Control

The

ResourceBundle.Control

class provides information necessary
to perform the bundle loading process by the

getBundle

factory methods that take a

ResourceBundle.Control

instance. You can implement your own subclass in order to enable
non-standard resource bundle formats, change the search strategy, or

method that takes the

ResourceBundle.Control

parameter is called.

For the

getBundle

factory

methods that take no

ResourceBundle.Control

instance, their

default behavior

of resource bundle loading
can be modified with custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations.
If any of the
providers provides a

ResourceBundle.Control

will be used instead of the default

ResourceBundle.Control

ResourceBundle.Control

The

ResourceBundle.Control

class provides information necessary
to perform the bundle loading process by the

getBundle

factory methods that take a

ResourceBundle.Control

instance. You can implement your own subclass in order to enable
non-standard resource bundle formats, change the search strategy, or

key with the same value (as for the okKey below).

```java
// default (English language, United States)
public class MyResources extends ResourceBundle {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
if (key.equals("okKey")) return "Ok";
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Cancel";
return null;
}

public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
return Collections.enumeration(keySet());
}

// Overrides handleKeySet() so that the getKeys() implementation
// can rely on the keySet() value.
protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("okKey", "cancelKey"));
}
}

// German language
public class MyResources_de extends MyResources {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
// don't need okKey, since parent level handles it.
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Abbrechen";
return null;
}

protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("cancelKey"));
}
}
```

You do not have to restrict yourself to using a single family of

ResourceBundle

s. For example, you could have a set of bundles for
exception messages,

ExceptionResources

(

ExceptionResources_fr

,

ExceptionResources_de

, ...),
and one for widgets,

WidgetResource

(

WidgetResources_fr

,

WidgetResources_de

, ...); breaking up the resources however you like.

#### Resource bundles as service providers

A

resource bundle provider

can
provide resource bundles in any format such XML which replaces the need
of

ResourceBundle.Control

.

Resource bundles in other modules and class path

Resource bundles in a named module may be

encapsulated

so that
it cannot be located by code in other modules. Resource bundles
in unnamed modules and class path are open for any module to access.
Resource bundle follows the resource encapsulation rules as specified
in

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

.

The

getBundle

factory methods with no

Control

parameter
locate and load resource bundles from

service providers

.
It may continue the search as if calling

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

to find the named resource from a given module and calling

ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)

; refer to
the specification of the

getBundle

method for details.
Only non-encapsulated resource bundles of "

java.class

"
or "

java.properties

" format are searched.

If the caller module is a

resource bundle provider

, it does not fall back to the
class loader search.

Resource bundles in automatic modules

A common format of resource bundles is in

.properties

file format. Typically

.properties

resource bundles
are packaged in a JAR file. Resource bundle only JAR file can be readily
deployed as an

automatic module

. For example, if the JAR file contains the
entry "

p/q/Foo_ja.properties

" and no

.class

entry,
when resolved and defined as an automatic module, no package is derived
for this module. This allows resource bundles in

.properties

format packaged in one or more JAR files that may contain entries
in the same directory and can be resolved successfully as
automatic modules.

ResourceBundle.Control

The

ResourceBundle.Control

class provides information necessary
to perform the bundle loading process by the

getBundle

factory methods that take a

ResourceBundle.Control

instance. You can implement your own subclass in order to enable
non-standard resource bundle formats, change the search strategy, or
define caching parameters. Refer to the descriptions of the class and the

getBundle

factory method for details.

ResourceBundle.Control

is designed for an application deployed
in an unnamed module, for example to support resource bundles in
non-standard formats or package localized resources in a non-traditional
convention.

ResourceBundleProvider

is the replacement for

ResourceBundle.Control

when migrating to modules.

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown when a factory
method that takes the

ResourceBundle.Control

parameter is called.

For the

getBundle

factory

methods that take no

ResourceBundle.Control

instance, their

default behavior

of resource bundle loading
can be modified with custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations.
If any of the
providers provides a

ResourceBundle.Control

for the given base name, that

ResourceBundle.Control

will be used instead of the default

ResourceBundle.Control

. If there is
more than one service provider for supporting the same base name,
the first one returned from

ServiceLoader

will be used.
A custom

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation is ignored by named modules.

Cache Management

Resource bundle instances created by the

getBundle

factory
methods are cached by default, and the factory methods return the same
resource bundle instance multiple times if it has been
cached.

getBundle

clients may clear the cache, manage the
lifetime of cached resource bundle instances using time-to-live values,
or specify not to cache resource bundle instances. Refer to the
descriptions of the

getBundle

factory method

,

clearCache

,

ResourceBundle.Control.getTimeToLive

, and

ResourceBundle.Control.needsReload

for details.

Example

The following is a very simple example of a

ResourceBundle

subclass,

MyResources

, that manages two resources (for a larger number of
resources you would probably use a

Map

).
Notice that you don't need to supply a value if
a "parent-level"

ResourceBundle

handles the same
key with the same value (as for the okKey below).

```java
// default (English language, United States)
public class MyResources extends ResourceBundle {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
if (key.equals("okKey")) return "Ok";
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Cancel";
return null;
}

public Enumeration<String> getKeys() {
return Collections.enumeration(keySet());
}

// Overrides handleKeySet() so that the getKeys() implementation
// can rely on the keySet() value.
protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("okKey", "cancelKey"));
}
}

// German language
public class MyResources_de extends MyResources {
public Object handleGetObject(String key) {
// don't need okKey, since parent level handles it.
if (key.equals("cancelKey")) return "Abbrechen";
return null;
}

protected Set<String> handleKeySet() {
return new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("cancelKey"));
}
}
```

You do not have to restrict yourself to using a single family of

ResourceBundle

s. For example, you could have a set of bundles for
exception messages,

ExceptionResources

(

ExceptionResources_fr

,

ExceptionResources_de

, ...),

Resource Bundles and Named Modules

- getBundle

```java
public static
ResourceBundle
getBundle​(
String
baseName,

Locale
targetLocale,

Module
module)
```

Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name and locale
on behalf of the specified module.

Resource bundles in named modules may be encapsulated. When
the resource bundle is loaded from a

service provider

, the caller module
must have an appropriate

uses

clause in its

module descriptor

to declare that the module uses of

ResourceBundleProvider

for the named resource bundle.
Otherwise, it will load the resource bundles that are local in the
given module as if calling

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

or that are visible to the class loader of the given module
as if calling

ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)

.
When the resource bundle is loaded from the specified module, it is
subject to the encapsulation rules specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.

If the given

module

is an unnamed module, then this method is
equivalent to calling

getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, module.getClassLoader()

to load
resource bundles that are visible to the class loader of the given
unnamed module. Custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations, if present, will only be invoked if the specified
module is an unnamed module.

**Parameters:** baseName

- the base name of the resource bundle,
a fully qualified class name
**Parameters:** targetLocale

- the locale for which a resource bundle is desired
**Parameters:** module

- the module for which the resource bundle is searched
**Returns:** a resource bundle for the given base name and locale in the module
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

baseName

,

targetLocale

, or

module

is

null
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and the caller is not the specified
module and doesn't have

RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")
**Throws:** MissingResourceException

```

Returns a resource bundle using the specified base name, target
locale and control, and the caller's class loader. Calling this
method is equivalent to calling

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, this.getClass().getClassLoader(),
control),
```

except that

getClassLoader()

is run with the security
privileges of

ResourceBundle

. See

getBundle

for the

.

**Parameters:** baseName

- the base name of the resource bundle, a fully qualified
class name
**Parameters:** targetLocale

- the locale for which a resource bundle is desired
**Parameters:** control

control

is performed as
needed.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

**Since:** 1.6

- getBundle

```java
public static
ResourceBundle
getBundle​(
String
baseName,

Locale
locale,

ClassLoader
loader)
```

Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name, locale, and class
loader.

When this method is called from a named module and the given
loader is the class loader of the caller module, this is equivalent
to calling:

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, callerModule)
```

otherwise, this is equivalent to calling:

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, loader, control)
```

where

control

is the default instance of

ResourceBundle.Control

unless
a

Control

instance is provided by

ResourceBundleControlProvider

SPI. Refer to the
description of

modifying the default
behavior

. The following describes the default behavior.

Resource Bundle Search and Loading Strategy

getBundle

uses the base name, the specified locale, and
the default locale (obtained from

Locale.getDefault

) to generate a sequence of

candidate bundle names

. If the specified
locale's language, script, country, and variant are all empty strings,
then the base name is the only candidate bundle name. Otherwise, a list
of candidate locales is generated from the attribute values of the
specified locale (language, script, country and variant) and appended to
the base name. Typically, this will look like the following:

```java
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language
```

Candidate bundle names where the final component is an empty string
are omitted, along with the underscore. For example, if country is an
empty string, the second and the fifth candidate bundle names above
would be omitted. Also, if script is an empty string, the candidate names
including script are omitted. For example, a locale with language "de"
and variant "JAVA" will produce candidate names with base name
"MyResource" below.

```java
MyResource_de__JAVA
MyResource_de
```

In the case that the variant contains one or more underscores ('_'), a
sequence of bundle names generated by truncating the last underscore and
the part following it is inserted after a candidate bundle name with the
original variant. For example, for a locale with language "en", script
"Latn, country "US" and variant "WINDOWS_VISTA", and bundle base name
"MyResource", the list of candidate bundle names below is generated:

```java
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_Latn_US
MyResource_en_Latn
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_US
MyResource_en
```

Note:

For some

Locale

s, the list of
candidate bundle names contains extra names, or the order of bundle names
is slightly modified. See the description of the default implementation
of

getCandidateLocales

for details.

getBundle

then iterates over the candidate bundle names
to find the first one for which it can

instantiate

an actual
resource bundle. It uses the default controls'

getFormats

method, which generates two bundle names for each generated
name, the first a class name and the second a properties file name. For
each candidate bundle name, it attempts to create a resource bundle:

- First, it attempts to load a class using the generated class name.
If such a class can be found and loaded using the specified class
loader, is assignment compatible with ResourceBundle, is accessible from
ResourceBundle, and can be instantiated,

getBundle

creates a
new instance of this class and uses it as the

result resource
bundle

.

Otherwise,

getBundle

attempts to locate a property
resource file using the generated properties file name. It generates a
path name from the candidate bundle name by replacing all "." characters
with "/" and appending the string ".properties". It attempts to find a
"resource" with this name using

ClassLoader.getResource

. (Note that a "resource" in the sense of

getResource

has nothing to do with the contents of a
resource bundle, it is just a container of data, such as a file.) If it
finds a "resource", it attempts to create a new

PropertyResourceBundle

instance from its contents. If successful, this
instance becomes the

result resource bundle

.

This continues until a result resource bundle is instantiated or the
list of candidate bundle names is exhausted. If no matching resource
bundle is found, the default control's

getFallbackLocale

method is called, which returns the current default
locale. A new sequence of candidate locale names is generated using this
locale and searched again, as above.

If still no result bundle is found, the base name alone is looked up. If
this still fails, a

MissingResourceException

is thrown.

Once a result resource bundle has been found,
its

parent chain

is instantiated

. If the result bundle already
has a parent (perhaps because it was returned from a cache) the chain is
complete.

Otherwise,

getBundle

examines the remainder of the
candidate locale list that was used during the pass that generated the
result resource bundle. (As before, candidate bundle names where the
final component is an empty string are omitted.) When it comes to the
end of the candidate list, it tries the plain bundle name. With each of the
candidate bundle names it attempts to instantiate a resource bundle (first
looking for a class and then a properties file, as described above).

Whenever it succeeds, it calls the previously instantiated resource
bundle's

setParent

method
with the new resource bundle. This continues until the list of names
is exhausted or the current bundle already has a non-null parent.

Once the parent chain is complete, the bundle is returned.

Note:

getBundle

caches instantiated resource
bundles and might return the same resource bundle instance multiple times.

Note:

The

baseName

argument should be a fully
qualified class name. However, for compatibility with earlier versions,
Java SE Runtime Environments do not verify this, and so it is
possible to access

PropertyResourceBundle

s by specifying a
path name (using "/") instead of a fully qualified class name (using
".").

Example:

The following class and property files are provided:

- MyResources.class

MyResources.properties

MyResources_fr.properties

MyResources_fr_CH.class

MyResources_fr_CH.properties

MyResources_en.properties

MyResources_es_ES.class

The contents of all files are valid (that is, public non-abstract
subclasses of

ResourceBundle

for the ".class" files,
syntactically correct ".properties" files). The default locale is

Locale("en", "GB")

.

Calling

getBundle

with the locale arguments below will
instantiate resource bundles as follows:

getBundle() locale to resource bundle mapping

Locale

Resource bundle

Locale("fr", "CH")

MyResources_fr_CH.class, parent MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("fr", "FR")

MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("de", "DE")

MyResources_en.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("en", "US")

MyResources_en.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("es", "ES")

MyResources_es_ES.class, parent MyResources.class

The file MyResources_fr_CH.properties is never used because it is
hidden by the MyResources_fr_CH.class. Likewise, MyResources.properties
is also hidden by MyResources.class.

**API Note:** If the caller module is a named module and the given

loader

is the caller module's class loader, this method is
equivalent to

getBundle(baseName, locale)

; otherwise, it may not
find resource bundles from named modules.
Use

getBundle(String, Locale, Module)

to load resource bundles
on behalf on a specific module instead.
**Parameters:** baseName

- the base name of the resource bundle, a fully qualified class name
**Parameters:** locale

- the locale for which a resource bundle is desired
**Parameters:** loader

- the class loader from which to load the resource bundle
**Returns:** a resource bundle for the given base name and locale
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

baseName

,

locale

, or

loader

is

null
**Throws:** MissingResourceException

- if no resource bundle for the specified base name can be found
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Resource Bundles and Named Modules

- getBundle

```java
public static
ResourceBundle
getBundle​(
String
baseName,

Locale
targetLocale,

ClassLoader
loader,

ResourceBundle.Control
control)
```

Returns a resource bundle using the specified base name, target
locale, class loader and control. Unlike the

getBundle

factory methods with no

control

argument, the given

control

specifies how to locate and instantiate resource
bundles. Conceptually, the bundle loading process with the given

control

is performed in the following steps.

- This factory method looks up the resource bundle in the cache for
the specified

baseName

,

targetLocale

and

loader

. If the requested resource bundle instance is
found in the cache and the time-to-live periods of the instance and
all of its parent instances have not expired, the instance is returned
to the caller. Otherwise, this factory method proceeds with the
loading process below.
- The

control.getFormats

method is called to get resource bundle formats
to produce bundle or resource names. The strings

"java.class"

and

"java.properties"

designate class-based and

property

-based resource bundles, respectively. Other strings
starting with

"java."

are reserved for future extensions
and must not be used for application-defined formats. Other strings
designate application-defined formats.
- The

control.getCandidateLocales

method is called with the target
locale to get a list of

candidate

Locale

s

for
which resource bundles are searched.
- The

control.newBundle

method is called to
instantiate a

ResourceBundle

for the base bundle name, a
candidate locale, and a format. (Refer to the note on the cache
lookup below.) This step is iterated over all combinations of the
candidate locales and formats until the

newBundle

method
returns a

ResourceBundle

instance or the iteration has
used up all the combinations. For example, if the candidate locales
are

Locale("de", "DE")

,

Locale("de")

and

Locale("")

and the formats are

"java.class"

and

"java.properties"

, then the following is the
sequence of locale-format combinations to be used to call

control.newBundle

.

locale-format combinations for newBundle

Index

Locale

format

1

Locale("de", "DE")

java.class

2

Locale("de", "DE")

java.properties

3

Locale("de")

java.class

4

Locale("de")

java.properties

5

Locale("")

java.class

6

Locale("")

java.properties
- If the previous step has found no resource bundle, proceed to
Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is a base bundle (a bundle
for

Locale("")

), and the candidate locale list only contained

Locale("")

, return the bundle to the caller. If a bundle
has been found that is a base bundle, but the candidate locale list
contained locales other than Locale(""), put the bundle on hold and
proceed to Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is not a base
bundle, proceed to Step 7.
- The

control.getFallbackLocale

method is called to get a fallback
locale (alternative to the current target locale) to try further
finding a resource bundle. If the method returns a non-null locale,
it becomes the next target locale and the loading process starts over
from Step 3. Otherwise, if a base bundle was found and put on hold in
a previous Step 5, it is returned to the caller now. Otherwise, a
MissingResourceException is thrown.
- At this point, we have found a resource bundle that's not the
base bundle. If this bundle set its parent during its instantiation,
it is returned to the caller. Otherwise, its

parent chain

is
instantiated based on the list of candidate locales from which it was
found. Finally, the bundle is returned to the caller.

During the resource bundle loading process above, this factory
method looks up the cache before calling the

control.newBundle

method. If the time-to-live period of the
resource bundle found in the cache has expired, the factory method
calls the

control.needsReload

method to determine whether the resource bundle needs to be reloaded.
If reloading is required, the factory method calls

control.newBundle

to reload the resource bundle. If

control.newBundle

returns

null

, the factory
method puts a dummy resource bundle in the cache as a mark of
nonexistent resource bundles in order to avoid lookup overhead for
subsequent requests. Such dummy resource bundles are under the same
expiration control as specified by

control

.

All resource bundles loaded are cached by default. Refer to

control.getTimeToLive

for details.

The following is an example of the bundle loading process with the
default

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation.

Conditions:

- Base bundle name:

foo.bar.Messages

Requested

Locale

:

Locale.ITALY

Default

Locale

:

Locale.FRENCH

Available resource bundles:

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties

and

foo/bar/Messages.properties

First,

getBundle

tries loading a resource bundle in
the following sequence.

- class

foo.bar.Messages_it_IT

file

foo/bar/Messages_it_IT.properties

class

foo.bar.Messages_it

file

foo/bar/Messages_it.properties

class

foo.bar.Messages

file

foo/bar/Messages.properties

At this point,

getBundle

finds

foo/bar/Messages.properties

, which is put on hold
because it's the base bundle.

getBundle

calls

control.getFallbackLocale("foo.bar.Messages", Locale.ITALY)

which
returns

Locale.FRENCH

. Next,

getBundle

tries loading a bundle in the following sequence.

- class

foo.bar.Messages_fr
- file

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties
- class

foo.bar.Messages
- file

foo/bar/Messages.properties

getBundle

finds

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties

and creates a

ResourceBundle

instance. Then,

getBundle

sets up its parent chain from the list of the candidate locales. Only

foo/bar/Messages.properties

is found in the list and

getBundle

creates a

ResourceBundle

instance
that becomes the parent of the instance for

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties

.

```java
public static
ResourceBundle
getBundle​(
String
baseName,

Module
module)
```

Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name and locale
on behalf of the specified module.

Resource bundles in named modules may be encapsulated. When
the resource bundle is loaded from a

service provider

, the caller module
must have an appropriate

uses

clause in its

module descriptor

to declare that the module uses of

ResourceBundleProvider

for the named resource bundle.
Otherwise, it will load the resource bundles that are local in the
given module as if calling

Module.getResourceAsStream(String)

or that are visible to the class loader of the given module
as if calling

ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)

.
When the resource bundle is loaded from the specified module, it is
subject to the encapsulation rules specified by

Module.getResourceAsStream

.

If the given

module

is an unnamed module, then this method is
equivalent to calling

getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, module.getClassLoader()

to load
resource bundles that are visible to the class loader of the given
unnamed module. Custom

ResourceBundleControlProvider

implementations, if present, will only be invoked if the specified
module is an unnamed module.

**Parameters:** baseName

- the base name of the resource bundle,
a fully qualified class name
**Parameters:** targetLocale

- the locale for which a resource bundle is desired
**Parameters:** module

- the module for which the resource bundle is searched
**Returns:** a resource bundle for the given base name and locale in the module

- getBundle

```java
public static
ResourceBundle
getBundle​(
String
baseName,

Locale
locale,

ClassLoader
loader)
```

Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name, locale, and class
loader.

When this method is called from a named module and the given
loader is the class loader of the caller module, this is equivalent
to calling:

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, callerModule)
```

otherwise, this is equivalent to calling:

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, loader, control)
```

where

control

is the default instance of

ResourceBundle.Control

unless
a

Control

instance is provided by

ResourceBundleControlProvider

SPI. Refer to the
description of

modifying the default
behavior

. The following describes the default behavior.

Resource Bundle Search and Loading Strategy

getBundle

uses the base name, the specified locale, and
the default locale (obtained from

Locale.getDefault

) to generate a sequence of

candidate bundle names

. If the specified
locale's language, script, country, and variant are all empty strings,
then the base name is the only candidate bundle name. Otherwise, a list
of candidate locales is generated from the attribute values of the
specified locale (language, script, country and variant) and appended to
the base name. Typically, this will look like the following:

```java
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language
```

Candidate bundle names where the final component is an empty string
are omitted, along with the underscore. For example, if country is an
empty string, the second and the fifth candidate bundle names above
would be omitted. Also, if script is an empty string, the candidate names
including script are omitted. For example, a locale with language "de"
and variant "JAVA" will produce candidate names with base name
"MyResource" below.

```java
MyResource_de__JAVA
MyResource_de
```

In the case that the variant contains one or more underscores ('_'), a
sequence of bundle names generated by truncating the last underscore and
the part following it is inserted after a candidate bundle name with the
original variant. For example, for a locale with language "en", script
"Latn, country "US" and variant "WINDOWS_VISTA", and bundle base name
"MyResource", the list of candidate bundle names below is generated:

```java
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_Latn_US
MyResource_en_Latn
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_US
MyResource_en
```

Note:

For some

Locale

s, the list of
candidate bundle names contains extra names, or the order of bundle names
is slightly modified. See the description of the default implementation
of

getCandidateLocales

for details.

getBundle

then iterates over the candidate bundle names
to find the first one for which it can

instantiate

an actual
resource bundle. It uses the default controls'

getFormats

method, which generates two bundle names for each generated
name, the first a class name and the second a properties file name. For
each candidate bundle name, it attempts to create a resource bundle:

- First, it attempts to load a class using the generated class name.
If such a class can be found and loaded using the specified class
loader, is assignment compatible with ResourceBundle, is accessible from
ResourceBundle, and can be instantiated,

getBundle

creates a
new instance of this class and uses it as the

result resource
bundle

.

Otherwise,

getBundle

attempts to locate a property
resource file using the generated properties file name. It generates a
path name from the candidate bundle name by replacing all "." characters
with "/" and appending the string ".properties". It attempts to find a
"resource" with this name using

ClassLoader.getResource

. (Note that a "resource" in the sense of

getResource

has nothing to do with the contents of a
resource bundle, it is just a container of data, such as a file.) If it
finds a "resource", it attempts to create a new

PropertyResourceBundle

instance from its contents. If successful, this
instance becomes the

result resource bundle

.

This continues until a result resource bundle is instantiated or the
list of candidate bundle names is exhausted. If no matching resource
bundle is found, the default control's

getFallbackLocale

method is called, which returns the current default
locale. A new sequence of candidate locale names is generated using this
locale and searched again, as above.

If still no result bundle is found, the base name alone is looked up. If
this still fails, a

MissingResourceException

is thrown.

Once a result resource bundle has been found,
its

parent chain

is instantiated

. If the result bundle already
has a parent (perhaps because it was returned from a cache) the chain is
complete.

Otherwise,

getBundle

examines the remainder of the
candidate locale list that was used during the pass that generated the
result resource bundle. (As before, candidate bundle names where the
final component is an empty string are omitted.) When it comes to the
end of the candidate list, it tries the plain bundle name. With each of the
candidate bundle names it attempts to instantiate a resource bundle (first
looking for a class and then a properties file, as described above).

Whenever it succeeds, it calls the previously instantiated resource
bundle's

setParent

method
with the new resource bundle. This continues until the list of names
is exhausted or the current bundle already has a non-null parent.

Once the parent chain is complete, the bundle is returned.

Note:

getBundle

caches instantiated resource
bundles and might return the same resource bundle instance multiple times.

Note:

The

baseName

argument should be a fully
qualified class name. However, for compatibility with earlier versions,
Java SE Runtime Environments do not verify this, and so it is
possible to access

PropertyResourceBundle

s by specifying a
path name (using "/") instead of a fully qualified class name (using
".").

Example:

The following class and property files are provided:

- MyResources.class

MyResources.properties

MyResources_fr.properties

MyResources_fr_CH.class

MyResources_fr_CH.properties

MyResources_en.properties

MyResources_es_ES.class

The contents of all files are valid (that is, public non-abstract
subclasses of

ResourceBundle

for the ".class" files,
syntactically correct ".properties" files). The default locale is

Locale("en", "GB")

.

Calling

getBundle

with the locale arguments below will
instantiate resource bundles as follows:

getBundle() locale to resource bundle mapping

Locale

Resource bundle

Locale("fr", "CH")

MyResources_fr_CH.class, parent MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("fr", "FR")

MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("de", "DE")

MyResources_en.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("en", "US")

MyResources_en.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("es", "ES")

MyResources_es_ES.class, parent MyResources.class

The file MyResources_fr_CH.properties is never used because it is
hidden by the MyResources_fr_CH.class. Likewise, MyResources.properties
is also hidden by MyResources.class.

**API Note:** If the caller module is a named module and the given

loader

is the caller module's class loader, this method is
equivalent to

getBundle(baseName, locale)

; otherwise, it may not
find resource bundles from named modules.
Use

getBundle(String, Locale, Module)

to load resource bundles
on behalf on a specific module instead.
**Parameters:** baseName

- the base name of the resource bundle, a fully qualified class name
**Parameters:** locale

- the locale for which a resource bundle is desired
**Parameters:** loader

- the class loader from which to load the resource bundle
**Returns:** a resource bundle for the given base name and locale
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

baseName

,

locale

, or

loader

is

null
**Throws:** MissingResourceException

- if no resource bundle for the specified base name can be found
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Resource Bundles and Named Modules

- getBundle

```java
public static
ResourceBundle
getBundle​(
String
baseName,

Locale
targetLocale,

ClassLoader
loader,

ResourceBundle.Control
control)
```

Returns a resource bundle using the specified base name, target
locale, class loader and control. Unlike the

getBundle

factory methods with no

control

argument, the given

control

specifies how to locate and instantiate resource
bundles. Conceptually, the bundle loading process with the given

control

is performed in the following steps.

- This factory method looks up the resource bundle in the cache for
the specified

baseName

,

targetLocale

and

loader

. If the requested resource bundle instance is
found in the cache and the time-to-live periods of the instance and
all of its parent instances have not expired, the instance is returned
to the caller. Otherwise, this factory method proceeds with the
loading process below.
- The

control.getFormats

method is called to get resource bundle formats
to produce bundle or resource names. The strings

"java.class"

and

"java.properties"

designate class-based and

property

-based resource bundles, respectively. Other strings
starting with

"java."

are reserved for future extensions
and must not be used for application-defined formats. Other strings
designate application-defined formats.
- The

control.getCandidateLocales

method is called with the target
locale to get a list of

candidate

Locale

s

for
which resource bundles are searched.
- The

control.newBundle

method is called to
instantiate a

ResourceBundle

for the base bundle name, a
candidate locale, and a format. (Refer to the note on the cache
lookup below.) This step is iterated over all combinations of the
candidate locales and formats until the

newBundle

method
returns a

ResourceBundle

instance or the iteration has
used up all the combinations. For example, if the candidate locales
are

Locale("de", "DE")

,

Locale("de")

and

Locale("")

and the formats are

"java.class"

and

"java.properties"

, then the following is the
sequence of locale-format combinations to be used to call

control.newBundle

.

locale-format combinations for newBundle

Index

Locale

format

1

Locale("de", "DE")

java.class

2

Locale("de", "DE")

java.properties

3

Locale("de")

java.class

4

Locale("de")

java.properties

5

Locale("")

java.class

6

Locale("")

java.properties
- If the previous step has found no resource bundle, proceed to
Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is a base bundle (a bundle
for

Locale("")

), and the candidate locale list only contained

Locale("")

, return the bundle to the caller. If a bundle
has been found that is a base bundle, but the candidate locale list
contained locales other than Locale(""), put the bundle on hold and
proceed to Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is not a base
bundle, proceed to Step 7.
- The

control.getFallbackLocale

method is called to get a fallback
locale (alternative to the current target locale) to try further
finding a resource bundle. If the method returns a non-null locale,
it becomes the next target locale and the loading process starts over
from Step 3. Otherwise, if a base bundle was found and put on hold in
a previous Step 5, it is returned to the caller now. Otherwise, a
MissingResourceException is thrown.
- At this point, we have found a resource bundle that's not the
base bundle. If this bundle set its parent during its instantiation,
it is returned to the caller. Otherwise, its

parent chain

is
instantiated based on the list of candidate locales from which it was
found. Finally, the bundle is returned to the caller.

During the resource bundle loading process above, this factory
method looks up the cache before calling the

control.newBundle

method. If the time-to-live period of the
resource bundle found in the cache has expired, the factory method
calls the

control.needsReload

method to determine whether the resource bundle needs to be reloaded.
If reloading is required, the factory method calls

control.newBundle

to reload the resource bundle. If

control.newBundle

returns

null

, the factory
method puts a dummy resource bundle in the cache as a mark of
nonexistent resource bundles in order to avoid lookup overhead for
subsequent requests. Such dummy resource bundles are under the same
expiration control as specified by

control

.

All resource bundles loaded are cached by default. Refer to

control.getTimeToLive

for details.

The following is an example of the bundle loading process with the
default

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation.

Conditions:

- Base bundle name:

foo.bar.Messages

Requested

Locale

:

Locale.ITALY

Default

Locale

:

Locale.FRENCH

Available resource bundles:

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties

and

foo/bar/Messages.properties

First,

getBundle

tries loading a resource bundle in
the following sequence.

- class

foo.bar.Messages_it_IT

file

foo/bar/Messages_it_IT.properties

class

foo.bar.Messages_it

file

foo/bar/Messages_it.properties

class

foo.bar.Messages

file

foo/bar/Messages.properties

At this point,

getBundle

finds

foo/bar/Messages.properties

, which is put on hold
because it's the base bundle.

getBundle

calls

control.getFallbackLocale("foo.bar.Messages", Locale.ITALY)

which
returns

Locale.FRENCH

. Next,

getBundle

tries loading a bundle in the following sequence.

- class

foo.bar.Messages_fr
- file

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties
- class

foo.bar.Messages
- file

foo/bar/Messages.properties

getBundle

finds

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties

and creates a

ResourceBundle

instance. Then,

getBundle

sets up its parent chain from the list of the candidate locales. Only

foo/bar/Messages.properties

is found in the list and

getBundle

creates a

ResourceBundle

instance
that becomes the parent of the instance for

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties

.

```

Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name, locale, and class
loader.

When this method is called from a named module and the given
loader is the class loader of the caller module, this is equivalent
to calling:

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, callerModule)
```

otherwise, this is equivalent to calling:

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, loader, control)
```

where

control

is the default instance of

ResourceBundle.Control

unless
a

Control

instance is provided by

ResourceBundleControlProvider

SPI. Refer to the
description of

modifying the default
behavior

. The following describes the default behavior.

Resource Bundle Search and Loading Strategy

getBundle

uses the base name, the specified locale, and
the default locale (obtained from

Locale.getDefault

) to generate a sequence of

candidate bundle names

. If the specified
locale's language, script, country, and variant are all empty strings,
then the base name is the only candidate bundle name. Otherwise, a list
of candidate locales is generated from the attribute values of the
specified locale (language, script, country and variant) and appended to
the base name. Typically, this will look like the following:

```java
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language
```

Candidate bundle names where the final component is an empty string
are omitted, along with the underscore. For example, if country is an
empty string, the second and the fifth candidate bundle names above
would be omitted. Also, if script is an empty string, the candidate names
including script are omitted. For example, a locale with language "de"
and variant "JAVA" will produce candidate names with base name
"MyResource" below.

```java
MyResource_de__JAVA
MyResource_de
```

In the case that the variant contains one or more underscores ('_'), a
sequence of bundle names generated by truncating the last underscore and
the part following it is inserted after a candidate bundle name with the
original variant. For example, for a locale with language "en", script
"Latn, country "US" and variant "WINDOWS_VISTA", and bundle base name
"MyResource", the list of candidate bundle names below is generated:

```java
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_Latn_US
MyResource_en_Latn
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_US
MyResource_en
```

Note:

For some

Locale

s, the list of
candidate bundle names contains extra names, or the order of bundle names
is slightly modified. See the description of the default implementation
of

getCandidateLocales

for details.

getBundle

then iterates over the candidate bundle names
to find the first one for which it can

instantiate

an actual
resource bundle. It uses the default controls'

getFormats

method, which generates two bundle names for each generated
name, the first a class name and the second a properties file name. For
each candidate bundle name, it attempts to create a resource bundle:

- First, it attempts to load a class using the generated class name.
If such a class can be found and loaded using the specified class
loader, is assignment compatible with ResourceBundle, is accessible from
ResourceBundle, and can be instantiated,

getBundle

creates a
new instance of this class and uses it as the

result resource
bundle

.

Otherwise,

getBundle

attempts to locate a property
resource file using the generated properties file name. It generates a
path name from the candidate bundle name by replacing all "." characters
with "/" and appending the string ".properties". It attempts to find a
"resource" with this name using

ClassLoader.getResource

. (Note that a "resource" in the sense of

getResource

has nothing to do with the contents of a
resource bundle, it is just a container of data, such as a file.) If it
finds a "resource", it attempts to create a new

PropertyResourceBundle

instance from its contents. If successful, this
instance becomes the

result resource bundle

.

This continues until a result resource bundle is instantiated or the
list of candidate bundle names is exhausted. If no matching resource
bundle is found, the default control's

getFallbackLocale

method is called, which returns the current default
locale. A new sequence of candidate locale names is generated using this
locale and searched again, as above.

If still no result bundle is found, the base name alone is looked up. If
this still fails, a

MissingResourceException

is thrown.

Once a result resource bundle has been found,
its

parent chain

is instantiated

. If the result bundle already
has a parent (perhaps because it was returned from a cache) the chain is
complete.

Otherwise,

getBundle

examines the remainder of the
candidate locale list that was used during the pass that generated the
result resource bundle. (As before, candidate bundle names where the
final component is an empty string are omitted.) When it comes to the
end of the candidate list, it tries the plain bundle name. With each of the
candidate bundle names it attempts to instantiate a resource bundle (first
looking for a class and then a properties file, as described above).

Whenever it succeeds, it calls the previously instantiated resource
bundle's

setParent

method
with the new resource bundle. This continues until the list of names
is exhausted or the current bundle already has a non-null parent.

Once the parent chain is complete, the bundle is returned.

Note:

getBundle

caches instantiated resource
bundles and might return the same resource bundle instance multiple times.

Note:

The

baseName

argument should be a fully
qualified class name. However, for compatibility with earlier versions,
Java SE Runtime Environments do not verify this, and so it is
possible to access

PropertyResourceBundle

s by specifying a
path name (using "/") instead of a fully qualified class name (using
".").

Example:

The following class and property files are provided:

- MyResources.class

MyResources.properties

MyResources_fr.properties

MyResources_fr_CH.class

MyResources_fr_CH.properties

MyResources_en.properties

MyResources_es_ES.class

The contents of all files are valid (that is, public non-abstract
subclasses of

ResourceBundle

for the ".class" files,
syntactically correct ".properties" files). The default locale is

Locale("en", "GB")

.

Calling

getBundle

with the locale arguments below will
instantiate resource bundles as follows:

getBundle() locale to resource bundle mapping

Locale

Resource bundle

Locale("fr", "CH")

MyResources_fr_CH.class, parent MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("fr", "FR")

MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("de", "DE")

MyResources_en.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("en", "US")

MyResources_en.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("es", "ES")

MyResources_es_ES.class, parent MyResources.class

The file MyResources_fr_CH.properties is never used because it is
hidden by the MyResources_fr_CH.class. Likewise, MyResources.properties
is also hidden by MyResources.class.

**API Note:** If the caller module is a named module and the given

loader

is the caller module's class loader, this method is
equivalent to

getBundle(baseName, locale)

; otherwise, it may not
find resource bundles from named modules.
Use

getBundle(String, Locale, Module)

to load resource bundles
on behalf on a specific module instead.
**Parameters:** baseName

- the base name of the resource bundle, a fully qualified class name
**Parameters:** locale

- the locale for which a resource bundle is desired
**Parameters:** loader

**Returns:** a resource bundle for the given base name and locale

When this method is called from a named module and the given
loader is the class loader of the caller module, this is equivalent
to calling:

```java

otherwise, this is equivalent to calling:

where

control

is the default instance of

unless
a

description of

. The following describes the default behavior.

Resource Bundle Search and Loading Strategy

getBundle

uses the base name, the specified locale, and
the default locale (obtained from

Locale.getDefault

) to generate a sequence of

candidate bundle names

. If the specified
locale's language, script, country, and variant are all empty strings,
then the base name is the only candidate bundle name. Otherwise, a list
of candidate locales is generated from the attribute values of the

the base name. Typically, this will look like the following:

```java

baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language
```

Candidate bundle names where the final component is an empty string
are omitted, along with the underscore. For example, if country is an
empty string, the second and the fifth candidate bundle names above
would be omitted. Also, if script is an empty string, the candidate names
including script are omitted. For example, a locale with language "de"
and variant "JAVA" will produce candidate names with base name
"MyResource" below.

In the case that the variant contains one or more underscores ('_'), a
sequence of bundle names generated by truncating the last underscore and
the part following it is inserted after a candidate bundle name with the
original variant. For example, for a locale with language "en", script
"Latn, country "US" and variant "WINDOWS_VISTA", and bundle base name
"MyResource", the list of candidate bundle names below is generated:

```java
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_Latn_US
MyResource_en_Latn
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_US
MyResource_en
```

Note:

For some

Locale

s, the list of
candidate bundle names contains extra names, or the order of bundle names
is slightly modified. See the description of the default implementation
of

getCandidateLocales

for details.

getBundle

then iterates over the candidate bundle names
to find the first one for which it can

instantiate

an actual
resource bundle. It uses the default controls'

getFormats

method, which generates two bundle names for each generated
name, the first a class name and the second a properties file name. For
each candidate bundle name, it attempts to create a resource bundle:

- First, it attempts to load a class using the generated class name.
If such a class can be found and loaded using the specified class
loader, is assignment compatible with ResourceBundle, is accessible from
ResourceBundle, and can be instantiated,

getBundle

creates a
new instance of this class and uses it as the

result resource
bundle

.

Otherwise,

getBundle

attempts to locate a property
resource file using the generated properties file name. It generates a
path name from the candidate bundle name by replacing all "." characters
with "/" and appending the string ".properties". It attempts to find a
"resource" with this name using

ClassLoader.getResource

. (Note that a "resource" in the sense of

getResource

has nothing to do with the contents of a
resource bundle, it is just a container of data, such as a file.) If it
finds a "resource", it attempts to create a new

PropertyResourceBundle

instance from its contents. If successful, this
instance becomes the

result resource bundle

.

This continues until a result resource bundle is instantiated or the
list of candidate bundle names is exhausted. If no matching resource
bundle is found, the default control's

getFallbackLocale

method is called, which returns the current default
locale. A new sequence of candidate locale names is generated using this
locale and searched again, as above.

If still no result bundle is found, the base name alone is looked up. If
this still fails, a

MissingResourceException

is thrown.

Once a result resource bundle has been found,
its

parent chain

is instantiated

. If the result bundle already
has a parent (perhaps because it was returned from a cache) the chain is
complete.

Otherwise,

getBundle

examines the remainder of the
candidate locale list that was used during the pass that generated the
result resource bundle. (As before, candidate bundle names where the
final component is an empty string are omitted.) When it comes to the
end of the candidate list, it tries the plain bundle name. With each of the
candidate bundle names it attempts to instantiate a resource bundle (first
looking for a class and then a properties file, as described above).

Whenever it succeeds, it calls the previously instantiated resource
bundle's

setParent

method
with the new resource bundle. This continues until the list of names
is exhausted or the current bundle already has a non-null parent.

Once the parent chain is complete, the bundle is returned.

Note:

getBundle

caches instantiated resource
bundles and might return the same resource bundle instance multiple times.

Note:

The

baseName

argument should be a fully
qualified class name. However, for compatibility with earlier versions,
Java SE Runtime Environments do not verify this, and so it is
possible to access

PropertyResourceBundle

s by specifying a
path name (using "/") instead of a fully qualified class name (using
".").

Example:

The following class and property files are provided:

- MyResources.class

MyResources.properties

MyResources_fr.properties

MyResources_fr_CH.class

MyResources_fr_CH.properties

MyResources_en.properties

MyResources_es_ES.class

The contents of all files are valid (that is, public non-abstract
subclasses of

ResourceBundle

for the ".class" files,
syntactically correct ".properties" files). The default locale is

Locale("en", "GB")

.

Calling

getBundle

with the locale arguments below will
instantiate resource bundles as follows:

getBundle() locale to resource bundle mapping

Locale

Resource bundle

Locale("fr", "CH")

MyResources_fr_CH.class, parent MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("fr", "FR")

MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("de", "DE")

MyResources_en.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("en", "US")

MyResources_en.properties, parent MyResources.class

Locale("es", "ES")

MyResources_es_ES.class, parent MyResources.class

The file MyResources_fr_CH.properties is never used because it is
hidden by the MyResources_fr_CH.class. Likewise, MyResources.properties
is also hidden by MyResources.class.

When this method is called from a named module and the given
loader is the class loader of the caller module, this is equivalent
to calling:

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, callerModule)
```

otherwise, this is equivalent to calling:

```java
getBundle(baseName, targetLocale, loader, control)
```

where

control

is the default instance of

ResourceBundle.Control

unless
a

Control

instance is provided by

ResourceBundleControlProvider

SPI. Refer to the
description of

modifying the default
behavior

. The following describes the default behavior.

Resource Bundle Search and Loading Strategy

getBundle

uses the base name, the specified locale, and
the default locale (obtained from

Locale.getDefault

) to generate a sequence of

candidate bundle names

. If the specified
locale's language, script, country, and variant are all empty strings,
then the base name is the only candidate bundle name. Otherwise, a list
of candidate locales is generated from the attribute values of the
specified locale (language, script, country and variant) and appended to
the base name. Typically, this will look like the following:

```java
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country + "_" + variant
baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country
baseName + "_" + language
```

Candidate bundle names where the final component is an empty string
are omitted, along with the underscore. For example, if country is an
empty string, the second and the fifth candidate bundle names above
would be omitted. Also, if script is an empty string, the candidate names
including script are omitted. For example, a locale with language "de"
and variant "JAVA" will produce candidate names with base name
"MyResource" below.

```java
MyResource_de__JAVA
MyResource_de
```

In the case that the variant contains one or more underscores ('_'), a
sequence of bundle names generated by truncating the last underscore and
the part following it is inserted after a candidate bundle name with the
original variant. For example, for a locale with language "en", script
"Latn, country "US" and variant "WINDOWS_VISTA", and bundle base name
"MyResource", the list of candidate bundle names below is generated:

```java
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_Latn_US
MyResource_en_Latn
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS
MyResource_en_US
MyResource_en
```

then iterates over the candidate bundle names
to find the first one for which it can

an actual

loader, is assignment compatible with ResourceBundle, is accessible from
ResourceBundle, and can be instantiated,

getBundle

creates a

.

Otherwise,

getBundle

attempts to locate a property
resource file using the generated properties file name. It generates a
path name from the candidate bundle name by replacing all "." characters
with "/" and appending the string ".properties". It attempts to find a
"resource" with this name using

finds a "resource", it attempts to create a new

PropertyResourceBundle

instance from its contents. If successful, this
instance becomes the

result resource bundle

.

This continues until a result resource bundle is instantiated or the
list of candidate bundle names is exhausted. If no matching resource
bundle is found, the default control's

getFallbackLocale

method is called, which returns the current default
locale. A new sequence of candidate locale names is generated using this
locale and searched again, as above.

If still no result bundle is found, the base name alone is looked up. If
this still fails, a

MissingResourceException

is thrown.

Once a result resource bundle has been found,
its

parent chain

is instantiated

. If the result bundle already
has a parent (perhaps because it was returned from a cache) the chain is
complete.

Otherwise,

getBundle

examines the remainder of the
candidate locale list that was used during the pass that generated the
result resource bundle. (As before, candidate bundle names where the
final component is an empty string are omitted.) When it comes to the
end of the candidate list, it tries the plain bundle name. With each of the
candidate bundle names it attempts to instantiate a resource bundle (first

Whenever it succeeds, it calls the previously instantiated resource
bundle's

setParent

method
with the new resource bundle. This continues until the list of names
is exhausted or the current bundle already has a non-null parent.

Once the parent chain is complete, the bundle is returned.

Note:

getBundle

caches instantiated resource
bundles and might return the same resource bundle instance multiple times.

Note:

The

Java SE Runtime Environments do not verify this, and so it is

getBundle

then iterates over the candidate bundle names
to find the first one for which it can

instantiate

an actual
resource bundle. It uses the default controls'

getFormats

method, which generates two bundle names for each generated
name, the first a class name and the second a properties file name. For
each candidate bundle name, it attempts to create a resource bundle:

- First, it attempts to load a class using the generated class name.
If such a class can be found and loaded using the specified class
loader, is assignment compatible with ResourceBundle, is accessible from
ResourceBundle, and can be instantiated,

getBundle

creates a
new instance of this class and uses it as the

result resource
bundle

.

Otherwise,

getBundle

attempts to locate a property
resource file using the generated properties file name. It generates a
path name from the candidate bundle name by replacing all "." characters
with "/" and appending the string ".properties". It attempts to find a
"resource" with this name using

ClassLoader.getResource

. (Note that a "resource" in the sense of

getResource

has nothing to do with the contents of a
resource bundle, it is just a container of data, such as a file.) If it
finds a "resource", it attempts to create a new

PropertyResourceBundle

instance from its contents. If successful, this
instance becomes the

result resource bundle

.

This continues until a result resource bundle is instantiated or the
list of candidate bundle names is exhausted. If no matching resource
bundle is found, the default control's

getFallbackLocale

method is called, which returns the current default
locale. A new sequence of candidate locale names is generated using this
locale and searched again, as above.

If still no result bundle is found, the base name alone is looked up. If
this still fails, a

MissingResourceException

is thrown.

Once a result resource bundle has been found,
its

parent chain

is instantiated

. If the result bundle already
has a parent (perhaps because it was returned from a cache) the chain is
complete.

Otherwise,

getBundle

examines the remainder of the
candidate locale list that was used during the pass that generated the
result resource bundle. (As before, candidate bundle names where the
final component is an empty string are omitted.) When it comes to the
end of the candidate list, it tries the plain bundle name. With each of the
candidate bundle names it attempts to instantiate a resource bundle (first
looking for a class and then a properties file, as described above).

Whenever it succeeds, it calls the previously instantiated resource
bundle's

setParent

method
with the new resource bundle. This continues until the list of names
is exhausted or the current bundle already has a non-null parent.

Once the parent chain is complete, the bundle is returned.

Note:

getBundle

caches instantiated resource
bundles and might return the same resource bundle instance multiple times.

Note:

The

baseName

argument should be a fully
qualified class name. However, for compatibility with earlier versions,
Java SE Runtime Environments do not verify this, and so it is
possible to access

PropertyResourceBundle

s by specifying a
path name (using "/") instead of a fully qualified class name (using
".").

getBundle

```java
public static
ResourceBundle
getBundle​(
String
baseName,

Locale
targetLocale,

ClassLoader
loader,

ResourceBundle.Control
control)
```

Returns a resource bundle using the specified base name, target
locale, class loader and control. Unlike the

getBundle

factory methods with no

control

argument, the given

control

specifies how to locate and instantiate resource
bundles. Conceptually, the bundle loading process with the given

control

is performed in the following steps.

- This factory method looks up the resource bundle in the cache for
the specified

baseName

,

targetLocale

and

loader

. If the requested resource bundle instance is
found in the cache and the time-to-live periods of the instance and
all of its parent instances have not expired, the instance is returned
to the caller. Otherwise, this factory method proceeds with the
loading process below.
- The

control.getFormats

method is called to get resource bundle formats
to produce bundle or resource names. The strings

"java.class"

and

"java.properties"

designate class-based and

property

-based resource bundles, respectively. Other strings
starting with

"java."

are reserved for future extensions
and must not be used for application-defined formats. Other strings
designate application-defined formats.
- The

control.getCandidateLocales

method is called with the target
locale to get a list of

candidate

Locale

s

for
which resource bundles are searched.
- The

control.newBundle

method is called to
instantiate a

ResourceBundle

for the base bundle name, a
candidate locale, and a format. (Refer to the note on the cache
lookup below.) This step is iterated over all combinations of the
candidate locales and formats until the

newBundle

method
returns a

ResourceBundle

instance or the iteration has
used up all the combinations. For example, if the candidate locales
are

Locale("de", "DE")

,

Locale("de")

and

Locale("")

and the formats are

"java.class"

and

"java.properties"

, then the following is the
sequence of locale-format combinations to be used to call

control.newBundle

.

- If the previous step has found no resource bundle, proceed to
Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is a base bundle (a bundle
for

Locale("")

), and the candidate locale list only contained

Locale("")

, return the bundle to the caller. If a bundle
has been found that is a base bundle, but the candidate locale list
contained locales other than Locale(""), put the bundle on hold and
proceed to Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is not a base
bundle, proceed to Step 7.
- The

control.getFallbackLocale

method is called to get a fallback
locale (alternative to the current target locale) to try further
finding a resource bundle. If the method returns a non-null locale,
it becomes the next target locale and the loading process starts over
from Step 3. Otherwise, if a base bundle was found and put on hold in
a previous Step 5, it is returned to the caller now. Otherwise, a
MissingResourceException is thrown.
- At this point, we have found a resource bundle that's not the
base bundle. If this bundle set its parent during its instantiation,
it is returned to the caller. Otherwise, its

parent chain

is
instantiated based on the list of candidate locales from which it was
found. Finally, the bundle is returned to the caller.

During the resource bundle loading process above, this factory
method looks up the cache before calling the

control.newBundle

method. If the time-to-live period of the
resource bundle found in the cache has expired, the factory method
calls the

control.needsReload

method to determine whether the resource bundle needs to be reloaded.
If reloading is required, the factory method calls

control.newBundle

to reload the resource bundle. If

control.newBundle

returns

null

, the factory
method puts a dummy resource bundle in the cache as a mark of
nonexistent resource bundles in order to avoid lookup overhead for
subsequent requests. Such dummy resource bundles are under the same
expiration control as specified by

control

.

All resource bundles loaded are cached by default. Refer to

control.getTimeToLive

for details.

The following is an example of the bundle loading process with the
default

ResourceBundle.Control

implementation.

#### getBundle

public static

ResourceBundle

getBundle​(

String

baseName,

Locale

targetLocale,

ClassLoader

loader,

ResourceBundle.Control

control)

Returns a resource bundle using the specified base name, target
locale, class loader and control. Unlike the

getBundle

factory methods with no

control

argument, the given

control

specifies how to locate and instantiate resource
bundles. Conceptually, the bundle loading process with the given

control

is performed in the following steps.

- This factory method looks up the resource bundle in the cache for
the specified

baseName

,

targetLocale

and

loader

. If the requested resource bundle instance is
found in the cache and the time-to-live periods of the instance and
all of its parent instances have not expired, the instance is returned
to the caller. Otherwise, this factory method proceeds with the
loading process below.
- The

control.getFormats

method is called to get resource bundle formats
to produce bundle or resource names. The strings

"java.class"

and

"java.properties"

designate class-based and

property

-based resource bundles, respectively. Other strings
starting with

"java."

are reserved for future extensions
and must not be used for application-defined formats. Other strings
designate application-defined formats.
- The

control.getCandidateLocales

method is called with the target
locale to get a list of

candidate

Locale

s

for
which resource bundles are searched.
- The

control.newBundle

method is called to
instantiate a

ResourceBundle

for the base bundle name, a
candidate locale, and a format. (Refer to the note on the cache
lookup below.) This step is iterated over all combinations of the
candidate locales and formats until the

newBundle

method
returns a

ResourceBundle

instance or the iteration has
used up all the combinations. For example, if the candidate locales
are

Locale("de", "DE")

,

Locale("de")

and

Locale("")

and the formats are

"java.class"

and

"java.properties"

, then the following is the
sequence of locale-format combinations to be used to call

control.newBundle

.

), and the candidate locale list only contained

Locale("")

, return the bundle to the caller. If a bundle
has been found that is a base bundle, but the candidate locale list
contained locales other than Locale(""), put the bundle on hold and
proceed to Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is not a base
bundle, proceed to Step 7.
- The

control.getFallbackLocale

method is called to get a fallback
locale (alternative to the current target locale) to try further
finding a resource bundle. If the method returns a non-null locale,
it becomes the next target locale and the loading process starts over
from Step 3. Otherwise, if a base bundle was found and put on hold in

MissingResourceException is thrown.
- At this point, we have found a resource bundle that's not the

During the resource bundle loading process above, this factory
method looks up the cache before calling the

getBundle

finds

foo/bar/Messages.properties

is found in the list and

getBundle

creates a

ResourceBundle

instance
that becomes the parent of the instance for

foo/bar/Messages_fr.properties

.

This factory method looks up the resource bundle in the cache for
the specified

baseName

,

targetLocale

and

loader

. If the requested resource bundle instance is
found in the cache and the time-to-live periods of the instance and
all of its parent instances have not expired, the instance is returned
to the caller. Otherwise, this factory method proceeds with the
loading process below.

The

designate application-defined formats.

The

control.getCandidateLocales

method is called with the target
locale to get a list of

for
which resource bundles are searched.

The

method is called to
instantiate a

ResourceBundle

for the base bundle name, a
candidate locale, and a format. (Refer to the note on the cache
lookup below.) This step is iterated over all combinations of the
candidate locales and formats until the

newBundle

method

are

Locale("de", "DE")

,

Locale("de")

If the previous step has found no resource bundle, proceed to
Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is a base bundle (a bundle
for

), and the candidate locale list only contained

Locale("")

, return the bundle to the caller. If a bundle
has been found that is a base bundle, but the candidate locale list
contained locales other than Locale(""), put the bundle on hold and
proceed to Step 6. If a bundle has been found that is not a base
bundle, proceed to Step 7.

The

control.getFallbackLocale

method is called to get a fallback
locale (alternative to the current target locale) to try further
finding a resource bundle. If the method returns a non-null locale,
it becomes the next target locale and the loading process starts over
from Step 3. Otherwise, if a base bundle was found and put on hold in
a previous Step 5, it is returned to the caller now. Otherwise, a
