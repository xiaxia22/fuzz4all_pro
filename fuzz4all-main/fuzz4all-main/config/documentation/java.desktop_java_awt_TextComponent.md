# Class TextComponent

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\TextComponent.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
TextComponent

extends
Component

implements
Accessible
```

The

TextComponent

class is the superclass of
any component that allows the editing of some text.

A text component embodies a string of text. The

TextComponent

class defines a set of methods
that determine whether or not this text is editable. If the
component is editable, it defines another set of methods
that supports a text insertion caret.

In addition, the class defines methods that are used
to maintain a current

selection

from the text.
The text selection, a substring of the component's text,
is the target of editing operations. It is also referred
to as the

selected text

.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** ImageObserver

,

MenuContainer

,

### Method Details

#### public void enableInputMethods​(boolean enable)

Enables or disables input method support for this text component. If input
method support is enabled and the text component also processes key events,
incoming events are offered to the current input method and will only be
processed by the component or dispatched to its listeners if the input method
does not consume them. Whether and how input method support for this text
component is enabled or disabled by default is implementation dependent.

**Overrides:**
- enableInputMethods

in class

Component

**Parameters:**
- enable

- true to enable, false to disable

**See Also:**
- Component.processKeyEvent(java.awt.event.KeyEvent)

**Since:**

**Since:**
- 1.0

---

#### public void setEditable​(boolean b)

Sets the flag that determines whether or not this
text component is editable.

If the flag is set to

true

, this text component
becomes user editable. If the flag is set to

false

,
the user cannot change the text of this text component.
By default, non-editable text components have a background color
of SystemColor.control. This default can be overridden by
calling setBackground.

**Parameters:**
- b

- a flag indicating whether this text component
is user editable.

**See Also:**
- isEditable()

**Since:**
- 1.0

---

#### public
Color
getBackground()

Gets the background color of this text component.

By default, non-editable text components have a background color
of SystemColor.control. This default can be overridden by
calling setBackground.

**Overrides:**
- getBackground

in class

Component

**Returns:**
- This text component's background color.
If this text component does not have a background color,
the background color of its parent is returned.

**See Also:**
- setBackground(Color)

**Since:**

---

#### public int getSelectionStart()

Gets the start position of the selected text in
this text component.

**Returns:**
- the start position of the selected text

**See Also:**
- setSelectionStart(int)

,

getSelectionEnd()

---

#### public void setSelectionStart​(int selectionStart)

Sets the selection start for this text component to
the specified position. The new start point is constrained
to be at or before the current selection end. It also
cannot be set to less than zero, the beginning of the
component's text.
If the caller supplies a value for

selectionStart

that is out of bounds, the method enforces these constraints
silently, and without failure.

**Parameters:**
- selectionStart

- the start position of the
selected text

**See Also:**
- getSelectionStart()

,

setSelectionEnd(int)

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### public int getSelectionEnd()

Gets the end position of the selected text in
this text component.

**Returns:**
- the end position of the selected text

**See Also:**
- setSelectionEnd(int)

,

getSelectionStart()

---

#### public void setSelectionEnd​(int selectionEnd)

Sets the selection end for this text component to
the specified position. The new end point is constrained
to be at or after the current selection start. It also
cannot be set beyond the end of the component's text.
If the caller supplies a value for

selectionEnd

that is out of bounds, the method enforces these constraints
silently, and without failure.

**Parameters:**
- selectionEnd

- the end position of the
selected text

**See Also:**
- getSelectionEnd()

,

setSelectionStart(int)

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### public void select​(int selectionStart,
int selectionEnd)

Selects the text between the specified start and end positions.

This method sets the start and end positions of the
selected text, enforcing the restriction that the start position
must be greater than or equal to zero. The end position must be
greater than or equal to the start position, and less than or
equal to the length of the text component's text. The
character positions are indexed starting with zero.
The length of the selection is

endPosition

-

startPosition

, so the
character at

endPosition

is not selected.
If the start and end positions of the selected text are equal,
all text is deselected.

If the caller supplies values that are inconsistent or out of
bounds, the method enforces these constraints silently, and
without failure. Specifically, if the start position or end
position is greater than the length of the text, it is reset to
equal the text length. If the start position is less than zero,
it is reset to zero, and if the end position is less than the
start position, it is reset to the start position.

**Parameters:**
- selectionStart

- the zero-based index of the first
character (

char

value) to be selected
- selectionEnd

- the zero-based end position of the
text to be selected; the character (

char

value) at

selectionEnd

is not selected

**See Also:**
- setSelectionStart(int)

,

setSelectionEnd(int)

,

selectAll()

---

#### public void selectAll()

Selects all the text in this text component.

**See Also:**
- select(int, int)

---

#### public void setCaretPosition​(int position)

Sets the position of the text insertion caret.
The caret position is constrained to be between 0
and the last character of the text, inclusive.
If the passed-in value is greater than this range,
the value is set to the last character (or 0 if
the

TextComponent

contains no text)
and no error is returned. If the passed-in value is
less than 0, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

**Parameters:**
- position

- the position of the text insertion caret

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

position

is less than zero

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### public int getCaretPosition()

```

A list of listeners that will receive events from this object.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- enableInputMethods

```java
public void enableInputMethods​(boolean enable)
```

Enables or disables input method support for this text component. If input
method support is enabled and the text component also processes key events,
incoming events are offered to the current input method and will only be
processed by the component or dispatched to its listeners if the input method
does not consume them. Whether and how input method support for this text
component is enabled or disabled by default is implementation dependent.

**Overrides:** enableInputMethods

in class

Component
**Parameters:** enable

- true to enable, false to disable
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Component.processKeyEvent(java.awt.event.KeyEvent)

- addNotify

```java
public void addNotify()
```

Makes this Component displayable by connecting it to a
native screen resource.
This method is called internally by the toolkit and should
not be called directly by programs.

**Overrides:** addNotify

in class

Component
**See Also:** removeNotify()

- removeNotify

```java
public void removeNotify()
```

Removes the

TextComponent

's peer.
The peer allows us to modify the appearance of the

TextComponent

without changing its
functionality.

**Overrides:** removeNotify

in class

Component
**See Also:** Component.isDisplayable()

,

Component.addNotify()

- setText

```java
public void setText​(
String
t)
```

Sets the text that is presented by this
text component to be the specified text.

**Parameters:** t

- the new text;
if this parameter is

null

then
the text is set to the empty string ""
**See Also:** getText()

- getText

```java
public
String
getText()
```

Returns the text that is presented by this text component.
By default, this is an empty string.

**Returns:** the value of this

TextComponent

```

Indicates whether or not this text component is editable.

**Returns:** true

if this text component is
editable;

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** setEditable(boolean)

- setEditable

```java
public void setEditable​(boolean b)
```

Sets the flag that determines whether or not this
text component is editable.

If the flag is set to

true

, this text component
becomes user editable. If the flag is set to

false

,
the user cannot change the text of this text component.
By default, non-editable text components have a background color
of SystemColor.control. This default can be overridden by
calling setBackground.

**Parameters:** b

- a flag indicating whether this text component
is user editable.
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** isEditable()

- getBackground

```java
public
Color
getBackground()
```

Gets the background color of this text component.

By default, non-editable text components have a background color
of SystemColor.control. This default can be overridden by
calling setBackground.

**Overrides:** getBackground

in class

Component
**Returns:** This text component's background color.
If this text component does not have a background color,
the background color of its parent is returned.
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** setBackground(Color)

- setBackground

```java
public void setBackground​(
Color
c)
```

Sets the background color of this text component.

**Overrides:** setBackground

in class

Component
**Parameters:** c

- The color to become this text component's color.
If this parameter is null then this text component
will inherit the background color of its parent.
**Since:** 1.0
**See Also:** getBackground()

- getSelectionStart

```java
public int getSelectionStart()
```

Gets the start position of the selected text in
this text component.

**Returns:** the start position of the selected text
**See Also:** setSelectionStart(int)

,

getSelectionEnd()

- setSelectionStart

```java
public void setSelectionStart​(int selectionStart)
```

Sets the selection start for this text component to
the specified position. The new start point is constrained
to be at or before the current selection end. It also
cannot be set to less than zero, the beginning of the
component's text.
If the caller supplies a value for

selectionStart

that is out of bounds, the method enforces these constraints
silently, and without failure.

**Parameters:** selectionStart

- the start position of the
selected text
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** getSelectionStart()

,

setSelectionEnd(int)

- getSelectionEnd

```java
public int getSelectionEnd()
```

Gets the end position of the selected text in
this text component.

**Returns:** the end position of the selected text
**See Also:** setSelectionEnd(int)

,

getSelectionStart()

- setSelectionEnd

```java
public void setSelectionEnd​(int selectionEnd)
```

Sets the selection end for this text component to
the specified position. The new end point is constrained
to be at or after the current selection start. It also
cannot be set beyond the end of the component's text.
If the caller supplies a value for

selectionEnd

that is out of bounds, the method enforces these constraints
silently, and without failure.

**Parameters:** selectionEnd

- the end position of the
selected text
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** getSelectionEnd()

,

setSelectionStart(int)

- select

```java
public void select​(int selectionStart,
int selectionEnd)
```

Selects the text between the specified start and end positions.

This method sets the start and end positions of the
selected text, enforcing the restriction that the start position
must be greater than or equal to zero. The end position must be
greater than or equal to the start position, and less than or
equal to the length of the text component's text. The
character positions are indexed starting with zero.
The length of the selection is

endPosition

-

startPosition

, so the
character at

endPosition

is not selected.
If the start and end positions of the selected text are equal,
all text is deselected.

If the caller supplies values that are inconsistent or out of
bounds, the method enforces these constraints silently, and
without failure. Specifically, if the start position or end
position is greater than the length of the text, it is reset to
equal the text length. If the start position is less than zero,
it is reset to zero, and if the end position is less than the
start position, it is reset to the start position.

**Parameters:** selectionStart

- the zero-based index of the first
character (

char

value) to be selected
**Parameters:** selectionEnd

- the zero-based end position of the
text to be selected; the character (

char

value) at

selectionEnd

is not selected
**See Also:** setSelectionStart(int)

,

setSelectionEnd(int)

,

selectAll()

- selectAll

```java
public void selectAll()
```

Selects all the text in this text component.

**See Also:** select(int, int)

- setCaretPosition

```java
public void setCaretPosition​(int position)
```

Sets the position of the text insertion caret.
The caret position is constrained to be between 0
and the last character of the text, inclusive.
If the passed-in value is greater than this range,
the value is set to the last character (or 0 if
the

TextComponent

contains no text)
and no error is returned. If the passed-in value is
less than 0, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

**Parameters:** position

- the position of the text insertion caret
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

position

is less than zero
**Since:** 1.1

- getCaretPosition

```java
public int getCaretPosition()
```

Returns the position of the text insertion caret.
The caret position is constrained to be between 0
and the last character of the text, inclusive.
If the text or caret have not been set, the default
caret position is 0.

**Returns:** the position of the text insertion caret
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** setCaretPosition(int)

- addTextListener

```java
public void addTextListener​(
TextListener
l)
```

Listener.class

.
For example, you can query a

TextComponent t

for its text listeners with the following code:

```java
TextListener[] tls = (TextListener[])(t.getListeners(TextListener.class));
```

If no such listeners exist, this method returns an empty array.

**Overrides:** getListeners

in class

Component
**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the listeners
**Parameters:** listenerType

- the type of listeners requested; this parameter
should specify an interface that descends from

java.util.EventListener
