# Class SplashScreen

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\SplashScreen.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
SplashScreen

extends
Object
```

The splash screen can be displayed at application startup, before the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts. The splash screen is displayed as an
undecorated window containing an image. You can use GIF, JPEG, or PNG files
for the image. Animation is supported for the GIF format, while transparency
is supported both for GIF and PNG. The window is positioned at the center
of the screen. The position on multi-monitor systems is not specified. It is
platform and implementation dependent. The splash screen window is closed
automatically as soon as the first window is displayed by Swing/AWT (may be
also closed manually using the Java API, see below).

If your application is packaged in a jar file, you can use the
"SplashScreen-Image" option in a manifest file to show a splash screen.
Place the image in the jar archive and specify the path in the option.
The path should not have a leading slash.

For example, in the

manifest.mf

file:

```java
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: Test
SplashScreen-Image: filename.gif
```

If the Java implementation provides the command-line interface and you run
your application by using the command line or a shortcut, use the Java
application launcher option to show a splash screen. The Oracle reference
implementation allows you to specify the splash screen image location with
the

-splash:

option.

For example:

```java
java -splash:filename.gif Test
```

HiDPI scaled image is also supported.
Unscaled image name i.e. filename.gif should be passed in

manifest.mf

/

-splash:

option for all image types irrespective of
HiDPI and Non-HiDPI.
Following is the naming convention for scaled images.
Screen scale 1.25: filename@125pct.gif
Screen scale 1.50: filename@150pct.gif
Screen scale 2: filename@200pct.gif and filename@2x.gif both are supported
Screen scale 2.50: filename@250pct.gif
Screen scale 3: filename@300pct.gif and filename@3x.gif both are supported
The command line interface has higher precedence over the manifest
setting.

The splash screen will be displayed as faithfully as possible to present the
whole splash screen image given the limitations of the target platform and
display.

It is implied that the specified image is presented on the screen "as is",
i.e. preserving the exact color values as specified in the image file. Under
certain circumstances, though, the presented image may differ, e.g. when
applying color dithering to present a 32 bits per pixel (bpp) image on a 16
or 8 bpp screen. The native platform display configuration may also affect
the colors of the displayed image (e.g. color profiles, etc.)

The

SplashScreen

class provides the API for controlling the splash
screen. This class may be used to close the splash screen, change the splash
screen image, get the splash screen native window position/size, and paint
in the splash screen. It cannot be used to create the splash screen. You
should use the options provided by the Java implementation for that.

This class cannot be instantiated. Only a single instance of this class
can exist, and it may be obtained by using the

getSplashScreen()

static method. In case the splash screen has not been created at
application startup via the command line or manifest file option,
the

getSplashScreen

method returns

null

.

**Since:** 1.6

### Method Details

#### public static
SplashScreen
getSplashScreen()

Returns the

SplashScreen

object used for
Java startup splash screen control on systems that support display.

**Returns:**
- the

SplashScreen

instance, or

null

if there is
none or it has already been closed

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the splash screen feature is not
supported by the current toolkit
- HeadlessException

- if

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns true

---

#### public void setImageURL​(
URL
imageURL)
throws
NullPointerException
,

IOException
,

IllegalStateException

Changes the splash screen image. The new image is loaded from the
specified URL; GIF, JPEG and PNG image formats are supported.
The method returns after the image has finished loading and the window
has been updated.
The splash screen window is resized according to the size of
the image and is centered on the screen.

**Parameters:**
- imageURL

- the non-

null

URL for the new
splash screen image

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

imageURL

is

null
- IOException

- if there was an error while loading the image
- IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been
closed

---

#### public
URL
getImageURL()
throws
IllegalStateException

Returns the current splash screen image.

**Returns:**
- URL for the current splash screen image file

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed

---

#### public
Rectangle
getBounds()
throws
IllegalStateException

Returns the bounds of the splash screen window as a

Rectangle

.
This may be useful if, for example, you want to replace the splash
screen with your window at the same location.

You cannot control the size or position of the splash screen.
The splash screen size is adjusted automatically when the image changes.

The image may contain transparent areas, and thus the reported bounds may
be larger than the visible splash screen image on the screen.

**Returns:**
- a

Rectangle

containing the splash screen bounds

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed

---

#### public
Dimension
getSize()
throws
IllegalStateException

Returns the size of the splash screen window as a

Dimension

.
This may be useful if, for example,
you want to draw on the splash screen overlay surface.

You cannot control the size or position of the splash screen.
The splash screen size is adjusted automatically when the image changes.

The image may contain transparent areas, and thus the reported size may
be larger than the visible splash screen image on the screen.

**Returns:**
- a

Dimension

object indicating the splash screen size

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed

---

#### public
Graphics2D
createGraphics()
throws
IllegalStateException

Creates a graphics context (as a

Graphics2D

object) for the splash
screen overlay image, which allows you to draw over the splash screen.
Note that you do not draw on the main image but on the image that is
displayed over the main image using alpha blending. Also note that drawing
on the overlay image does not necessarily update the contents of splash
screen window. You should call

update()

on the

SplashScreen

when you want the splash screen to be
updated immediately.

The pixel (0, 0) in the coordinate space of the graphics context
corresponds to the origin of the splash screen native window bounds (see

getBounds()

).

**Returns:**
- graphics context for the splash screen overlay surface

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed

---

#### public void update()
throws
IllegalStateException

Updates the splash window with current contents of the overlay image.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the overlay image does not exist;
for example, if

createGraphics

has never been called,
or if the splash screen has already been closed

---

#### public void close()
throws
IllegalStateException

Hides the splash screen, closes the window, and releases all associated
resources.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed

---

#### public boolean isVisible()

Determines whether the splash screen is visible. The splash screen may
be hidden using

close()

, it is also hidden automatically when
the first AWT/Swing window is made visible.

Note that the native platform may delay presenting the splash screen
native window on the screen. The return value of

true

for this
method only guarantees that the conditions to hide the splash screen
window have not occurred yet.

**Returns:**
- true if the splash screen is visible (has not been closed yet),
false otherwise

If your application is packaged in a jar file, you can use the
"SplashScreen-Image" option in a manifest file to show a splash screen.
Place the image in the jar archive and specify the path in the option.
The path should not have a leading slash.

For example, in the

manifest.mf

```java
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: Test
SplashScreen-Image: filename.gif
```

If the Java implementation provides the command-line interface and you run
your application by using the command line or a shortcut, use the Java
application launcher option to show a splash screen. The Oracle reference
implementation allows you to specify the splash screen image location with
the

-splash:

option.

For example:

```java
java -splash:filename.gif Test
```

IllegalStateException
```

Hides the splash screen, closes the window, and releases all associated
resources.

**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed

- isVisible

```java
public boolean isVisible()
```

Determines whether the splash screen is visible. The splash screen may
be hidden using

close()

, it is also hidden automatically when
the first AWT/Swing window is made visible.

Note that the native platform may delay presenting the splash screen
native window on the screen. The return value of

true

for this
method only guarantees that the conditions to hide the splash screen
window have not occurred yet.

**Returns:** true if the splash screen is visible (has not been closed yet),
false otherwise

Method Detail

- getSplashScreen

```java
public static
SplashScreen
getSplashScreen()
```

Returns the

SplashScreen

object used for
Java startup splash screen control on systems that support display.

**Returns:** the

SplashScreen

instance, or

null

if there is
none or it has already been closed
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the splash screen feature is not
supported by the current toolkit
**Throws:** HeadlessException

- if

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns true

- setImageURL

```java
public void setImageURL​(
URL
imageURL)
throws
NullPointerException
,

IOException
,

IllegalStateException
```

Changes the splash screen image. The new image is loaded from the
specified URL; GIF, JPEG and PNG image formats are supported.
The method returns after the image has finished loading and the window
has been updated.
The splash screen window is resized according to the size of
the image and is centered on the screen.

**Parameters:** imageURL

- the non-

null

URL for the new
splash screen image
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

imageURL

is

null
**Throws:** IOException

- if there was an error while loading the image
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been
closed

- getImageURL

```java
public
URL
getImageURL()
throws
IllegalStateException
```

Returns the current splash screen image.

**Returns:** URL for the current splash screen image file
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed

- getBounds

```java
public
Rectangle
getBounds()
throws
IllegalStateException
```

Returns the bounds of the splash screen window as a

Rectangle

.
This may be useful if, for example, you want to replace the splash
screen with your window at the same location.

You cannot control the size or position of the splash screen.
The splash screen size is adjusted automatically when the image changes.

The image may contain transparent areas, and thus the reported bounds may
be larger than the visible splash screen image on the screen.

**Returns:** a

Rectangle

containing the splash screen bounds
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed

- getSize

```java
public
Dimension
getSize()
throws
IllegalStateException
```

Returns the size of the splash screen window as a

Dimension

.
This may be useful if, for example,
you want to draw on the splash screen overlay surface.

You cannot control the size or position of the splash screen.
The splash screen size is adjusted automatically when the image changes.

The image may contain transparent areas, and thus the reported size may
be larger than the visible splash screen image on the screen.

**Returns:** a

Dimension

object indicating the splash screen size
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed

- createGraphics

```java
public
Graphics2D
createGraphics()
throws
IllegalStateException
```

Creates a graphics context (as a

Graphics2D

object) for the splash
screen overlay image, which allows you to draw over the splash screen.
Note that you do not draw on the main image but on the image that is
displayed over the main image using alpha blending. Also note that drawing
on the overlay image does not necessarily update the contents of splash
screen window. You should call

update()

on the

SplashScreen

when you want the splash screen to be
updated immediately.

The pixel (0, 0) in the coordinate space of the graphics context
corresponds to the origin of the splash screen native window bounds (see

getBounds()

).

**Returns:** graphics context for the splash screen overlay surface
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed

- update

```java
public void update()
throws
IllegalStateException
```

Updates the splash window with current contents of the overlay image.

**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the overlay image does not exist;
for example, if

createGraphics

has never been called,
or if the splash screen has already been closed

- close

```java
public void close()
throws
IllegalStateException
```

Hides the splash screen, closes the window, and releases all associated
resources.

**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the splash screen has already been closed
