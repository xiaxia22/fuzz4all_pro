# Interface GuardingTypeConverterFactory

**Source:** `jdk.dynalink\jdk\dynalink\linker\GuardingTypeConverterFactory.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
GuardingTypeConverterFactory
```

Optional interface that can be implemented by

GuardingDynamicLinker

implementations to provide language-specific type conversion capabilities.
Note that if you implement this interface, you will very likely want to
implement

ConversionComparator

interface too, as your additional
language-specific conversions, in absence of a strategy for prioritizing
these conversions, will cause more ambiguity for

BeansLinker

in
selecting the correct overload when trying to link to an overloaded Java
method.

### Method Details

#### GuardedInvocation
convertToType​(
Class
<?> sourceType,

Class
<?> targetType,

Supplier
<
MethodHandles.Lookup
> lookupSupplier)
throws
Exception

Returns a guarded type conversion that receives a value of the specified
source type and returns a value converted to the specified target type.
Value types can be either primitives or reference types, including
interfaces, so you can even provide converters for converting your
language's objects to Java interfaces and classes by generating adapters
for them.

The type of the invocation is

(sourceType)→targetType

, while the
type of the guard is

(sourceType)→boolean

. You are allowed to
return unconditional invocations (with no guard) if the source type is
specific to your runtime and your runtime only.

Note that this method will never be invoked for

method
invocation conversions

as those can be automatically applied by

MethodHandle.asType(MethodType)

.
An implementation can assume it is never requested to produce a
converter for those conversions. If a language runtime needs to customize
method invocation conversions, it should

set an autoconversion strategy in the dynamic linker factory

instead.

Dynalink is at liberty to either cache some of the returned converters
or to repeatedly request the converter factory to create the same
conversion.

**Parameters:**
- sourceType

- source type
- targetType

- the target type.
- lookupSupplier

- a supplier for retrieving the lookup of the class
on whose behalf a type converter is requested. When a converter is
requested as part of linking an

invokedynamic

instruction the
supplier will return the lookup passed to the bootstrap method, otherwise
if the method is invoked from within a

LinkerServices.getWithLookup(Supplier, jdk.dynalink.SecureLookupSupplier)

it will delegate to the secure lookup supplier. In any other case,
it will return the public lookup. A typical case where the lookup might
be needed is when the converter creates a Java adapter class on the fly
(e.g. to convert some object from the dynamic language into a Java
interface for interoperability). Invoking the

Supplier.get()

method on the passed supplier will be subject to the same security checks
as

SecureLookupSupplier.getLookup()

. An implementation should avoid
retrieving the lookup if it is not needed so as to avoid the expense of

AccessController.doPrivileged

call.

**Returns:**
- a guarded invocation that can take an object (if it passes guard)
and return another object that is its representation coerced into the
target type. In case the factory is certain it is unable to handle a
conversion, it can return null. In case the factory is certain that it
can always handle the conversion, it can return an unconditional
invocation (one whose guard is null).

**Throws:**
- Exception

- if there was an error during creation of the converter
