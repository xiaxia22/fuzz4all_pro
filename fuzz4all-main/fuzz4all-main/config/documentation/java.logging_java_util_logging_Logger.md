# Class Logger

**Source:** `java.logging\java\util\logging\Logger.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Logger

extends
Object
```

A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific
system or application component. Loggers are normally named,
using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names
can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on
the package name or class name of the logged component, such
as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create
"anonymous" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace.

Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger
factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or
return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that
the Logger returned by one of the

getLogger

factory methods
may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the
Logger is not kept.

Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler
objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of
destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc.

Each Logger keeps track of a "parent" Logger, which is its
nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace.

Each Logger has a "Level" associated with it. This reflects
a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's
level is set to

null

, then its effective level is inherited
from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its
parent, and so on up the tree.

The log level can be configured based on the properties from the
logging configuration file, as described in the description
of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed
by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is
changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child
logger that has

null

as its level will inherit its
effective level from its parent.

On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap
check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the
effective log level of the logger. If the request level is
lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately.

After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate
a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a
Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the
record should be published. If that passes it will then publish
the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also
publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree.

Each Logger may have a

ResourceBundle

associated with it.
The

ResourceBundle

may be specified by name, using the

getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)

factory
method, or by value - using the

setResourceBundle

method.
This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages.
If a Logger does not have its own

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle
name, then it will inherit the

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle name
from its parent, recursively up the tree.

Most of the logger output methods take a "msg" argument. This
msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key.
During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization

ResourceBundle

and if the

ResourceBundle

has a mapping for
the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value.
Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use
java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so
for example a format string "{0} {1}" would format two parameters
as strings.

A set of methods alternatively take a "msgSupplier" instead of a "msg"
argument. These methods take a

Supplier

<String>

function
which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message
actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating
unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to
log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version,
the code would look like:

```java
class DiagnosisMessages {
static String systemHealthStatus() {
// collect system health information
...
}
}
...
logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());
```

With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when
the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as
below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is
enabled.

```java
logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);
```

When looking for a

ResourceBundle

, the logger will first look at
whether a bundle was specified using

setResourceBundle

, and then
only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the

getLogger

factory method.
If no

ResourceBundle

or no resource bundle name is found,
then it will use the nearest

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle
name inherited from its parent tree.

When a

ResourceBundle

was inherited or specified through the

setResourceBundle

method, then
that

ResourceBundle

will be used. Otherwise if the logger only
has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name
will be mapped to a

ResourceBundle

object, using the default Locale
at the time of logging.

When mapping resource bundle names to

ResourceBundle

objects, the logger will first try to use the
Thread's

context class
loader

to map the given resource bundle name to a

ResourceBundle

.
If the thread context class loader is

null

, it will try the

system class loader

instead. If the

ResourceBundle

is still not found, it will use the
class loader of the first caller of the

getLogger

factory method.

Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of
the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter.

Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed
until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink.

The logging methods are grouped in five main categories:

- There are a set of "log" methods that take a log level, a message
string, and optionally some parameters to the message string.

There are a set of "logp" methods (for "log precise") that are
like the "log" methods, but also take an explicit source class name
and method name.

There are a set of "logrb" method (for "log with resource bundle")
that are like the "logp" method, but also take an explicit resource
bundle object for use in localizing the log message.

There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the
"entering" methods), method returns (the "exiting" methods) and
throwing exceptions (the "throwing" methods).

Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the
very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a
simple string at a given log level. These methods are named
after the standard Level names ("severe", "warning", "info", etc.)
and take a single argument, a message string.

For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and
method name, the Logging framework will make a "best effort"
to determine which class and method called into the logging method.
However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred
information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!).
Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when
JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible
to reliably locate the calling class and method.

All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe.

Subclassing Information:

Note that a LogManager class may
provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in
the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they
are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should
take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and
should delegate operations such as "isLoggable" and "log(LogRecord)"
to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging
output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method.
All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this
log(LogRecord) method.

### Field Details

#### public static final
String
GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME

GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME is a name for the global logger.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### @Deprecated

public static final
Logger
global

The "global" Logger object is provided as a convenience to developers
who are making casual use of the Logging package. Developers
who are making serious use of the logging package (for example
in products) should create and use their own Logger objects,
with appropriate names, so that logging can be controlled on a
suitable per-Logger granularity. Developers also need to keep a
strong reference to their Logger objects to prevent them from
being garbage collected.

---

### Constructor Details

#### protected Logger​(
String
name,

String
resourceBundleName)

Protected method to construct a logger for a named subsystem.

The logger will be initially configured with a null Level
and with useParentHandlers set to true.

**Parameters:**
- name

- A name for the logger. This should
be a dot-separated name and should normally
be based on the package name or class name
of the subsystem, such as java.net
or javax.swing. It may be null for anonymous Loggers.
- resourceBundleName

- name of ResourceBundle to be used for localizing
messages for this logger. May be null if none
of the messages require localization.

**Throws:**
- MissingResourceException

- if the resourceBundleName is non-null and
no corresponding resource can be found.

---

### Method Details

#### public static final
Logger
getGlobal()

Return global logger object with the name Logger.GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME.

**Returns:**
- global logger object

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public static
Logger
getLogger​(
String
name)

Find or create a logger for a named subsystem. If a logger has
already been created with the given name it is returned. Otherwise
a new logger is created.

If a new logger is created its log level will be configured
based on the LogManager configuration and it will be configured
to also send logging output to its parent's Handlers. It will
be registered in the LogManager global namespace.

Note: The LogManager may only retain a weak reference to the newly
created Logger. It is important to understand that a previously
created Logger with the given name may be garbage collected at any
time if there is no strong reference to the Logger. In particular,
this means that two back-to-back calls like

getLogger("MyLogger").log(...)

may use different Logger
objects named "MyLogger" if there is no strong reference to the
Logger named "MyLogger" elsewhere in the program.

**Parameters:**
- name

- A name for the logger. This should
be a dot-separated name and should normally
be based on the package name or class name
of the subsystem, such as java.net
or javax.swing

**Returns:**
- a suitable Logger

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the name is null.

---

#### public static
Logger
getLogger​(
String
name,

String
resourceBundleName)

Find or create a logger for a named subsystem. If a logger has
already been created with the given name it is returned. Otherwise
a new logger is created.

If a new logger is created its log level will be configured
based on the LogManager and it will be configured to also send logging
output to its parent's Handlers. It will be registered in
the LogManager global namespace.

Note: The LogManager may only retain a weak reference to the newly
created Logger. It is important to understand that a previously
created Logger with the given name may be garbage collected at any
time if there is no strong reference to the Logger. In particular,
this means that two back-to-back calls like

getLogger("MyLogger", ...).log(...)

may use different Logger
objects named "MyLogger" if there is no strong reference to the
Logger named "MyLogger" elsewhere in the program.

If the named Logger already exists and does not yet have a
localization resource bundle then the given resource bundle
name is used. If the named Logger already exists and has
a different resource bundle name then an IllegalArgumentException
is thrown.

**Parameters:**
- name

- A name for the logger. This should
be a dot-separated name and should normally
be based on the package name or class name
of the subsystem, such as java.net
or javax.swing
- resourceBundleName

- name of ResourceBundle to be used for localizing
messages for this logger. May be

null

if none of the messages require localization.

**Returns:**
- a suitable Logger

**Throws:**
- MissingResourceException

- if the resourceBundleName is non-null and
no corresponding resource can be found.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the Logger already exists and uses
a different resource bundle name; or if

resourceBundleName

is

null

but the named
logger has a resource bundle set.
- NullPointerException

- if the name is null.

---

#### public static
Logger
getAnonymousLogger()

Create an anonymous Logger. The newly created Logger is not
registered in the LogManager namespace. There will be no
access checks on updates to the logger.

This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets.
Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private
by the creating class. This removes the need for normal security
checks, which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update
the control state of the Logger. For example an applet can do
a setLevel or an addHandler on an anonymous Logger.

Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured
to have the root logger ("") as its parent. This means that
by default it inherits its effective level and handlers
from the root logger. Changing its parent via the

setParent

method
will still require the security permission specified by that method.

**Returns:**
- a newly created private Logger

---

**Parameters:**
- resourceBundleName

- name of ResourceBundle to be used for localizing
messages for this logger.
May be null if none of the messages require localization.

**Returns:**
- a newly created private Logger

**Throws:**
- MissingResourceException

- if the resourceBundleName is non-null and
no corresponding resource can be found.

#### public
ResourceBundle
getResourceBundle()

Retrieve the localization resource bundle for this
logger.
This method will return a

ResourceBundle

that was either
set by the

setResourceBundle

method or

mapped from the
the resource bundle name

set via the

getLogger

factory
method for the current default locale.

Note that if the result is

null

, then the Logger will use a resource
bundle or resource bundle name inherited from its parent.

**Returns:**
- localization bundle (may be

null

)

---

#### public
String
getResourceBundleName()

Retrieve the localization resource bundle name for this
logger.
This is either the name specified through the

getLogger

factory method,
or the

base name

of the
ResourceBundle set through

setResourceBundle

method.

Note that if the result is

null

, then the Logger will use a resource
bundle or resource bundle name inherited from its parent.

**Returns:**
- localization bundle name (may be

null

)

---

#### public void setFilter​(
Filter
newFilter)
throws
SecurityException

Set a filter to control output on this Logger.

After passing the initial "level" check, the Logger will
call this Filter to check if a log record should really
be published.

**Parameters:**
- newFilter

- a filter object (may be null)

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists,
this logger is not anonymous, and the caller
does not have LoggingPermission("control").

Get the current filter for this Logger.

**Returns:**
- a filter object (may be null)

---

#### public void log​(

This method returns the nearest extant parent in the namespace.
Thus if a Logger is called "a.b.c.d", and a Logger called "a.b"
has been created but no logger "a.b.c" exists, then a call of
getParent on the Logger "a.b.c.d" will return the Logger "a.b".

The result will be null if it is called on the root Logger
in the namespace.

**Returns:**
- nearest existing parent Logger

---

**Parameters:**
- parent

- the new parent logger

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

java.lang.Object

- java.util.logging.Logger

java.util.logging.Logger

```java
public class
Logger

extends
Object
```

A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific
system or application component. Loggers are normally named,
using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names
can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on
the package name or class name of the logged component, such
as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create
"anonymous" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace.

Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger
factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or
return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that
the Logger returned by one of the

getLogger

factory methods
may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the
Logger is not kept.

Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler
objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of
destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc.

Each Logger keeps track of a "parent" Logger, which is its
nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace.

Each Logger has a "Level" associated with it. This reflects
a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's
level is set to

null

, then its effective level is inherited
from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its
parent, and so on up the tree.

The log level can be configured based on the properties from the
logging configuration file, as described in the description
of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed
by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is
changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child
logger that has

null

as its level will inherit its
effective level from its parent.

On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap
check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the
effective log level of the logger. If the request level is
lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately.

After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate
a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a
Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the
record should be published. If that passes it will then publish
the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also
publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree.

Each Logger may have a

ResourceBundle

associated with it.
The

ResourceBundle

may be specified by name, using the

getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)

factory
method, or by value - using the

setResourceBundle

method.
This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages.
If a Logger does not have its own

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle
name, then it will inherit the

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle name
from its parent, recursively up the tree.

Most of the logger output methods take a "msg" argument. This
msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key.
During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization

ResourceBundle

and if the

ResourceBundle

has a mapping for
the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value.
Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use
java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so
for example a format string "{0} {1}" would format two parameters
as strings.

A set of methods alternatively take a "msgSupplier" instead of a "msg"
argument. These methods take a

Supplier

<String>

function
which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message
actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating
unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to
log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version,
the code would look like:

```java
class DiagnosisMessages {
static String systemHealthStatus() {
// collect system health information
...
}
}
...
logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());
```

With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when
the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as
below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is
enabled.

```java
logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);
```

When looking for a

ResourceBundle

, the logger will first look at
whether a bundle was specified using

setResourceBundle

, and then
only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the

getLogger

factory method.
If no

ResourceBundle

or no resource bundle name is found,
then it will use the nearest

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle
name inherited from its parent tree.

When a

ResourceBundle

was inherited or specified through the

setResourceBundle

method, then
that

ResourceBundle

will be used. Otherwise if the logger only
has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name
will be mapped to a

ResourceBundle

object, using the default Locale
at the time of logging.

When mapping resource bundle names to

ResourceBundle

objects, the logger will first try to use the
Thread's

context class
loader

to map the given resource bundle name to a

ResourceBundle

.
If the thread context class loader is

null

, it will try the

system class loader

instead. If the

ResourceBundle

is still not found, it will use the
class loader of the first caller of the

getLogger

factory method.

Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of
the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter.

Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed
until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink.

The logging methods are grouped in five main categories:

- There are a set of "log" methods that take a log level, a message
string, and optionally some parameters to the message string.

There are a set of "logp" methods (for "log precise") that are
like the "log" methods, but also take an explicit source class name
and method name.

There are a set of "logrb" method (for "log with resource bundle")
that are like the "logp" method, but also take an explicit resource
bundle object for use in localizing the log message.

There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the
"entering" methods), method returns (the "exiting" methods) and
throwing exceptions (the "throwing" methods).

Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the
very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a
simple string at a given log level. These methods are named
after the standard Level names ("severe", "warning", "info", etc.)
and take a single argument, a message string.

For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and
method name, the Logging framework will make a "best effort"
to determine which class and method called into the logging method.
However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred
information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!).
Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when
JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible
to reliably locate the calling class and method.

All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe.

Subclassing Information:

Note that a LogManager class may
provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in
the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they
are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should
take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and
should delegate operations such as "isLoggable" and "log(LogRecord)"
to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging
output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method.
All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this
log(LogRecord) method.

There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the
"entering" methods), method returns (the "exiting" methods) and
throwing exceptions (the "throwing" methods).

Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the
very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a
simple string at a given log level. These methods are named
after the standard Level names ("severe", "warning", "info", etc.)
and take a single argument, a message string.

For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and
method name, the Logging framework will make a "best effort"
to determine which class and method called into the logging method.
However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred
information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!).
Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when
JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible
to reliably locate the calling class and method.

All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe.

Subclassing Information:

Note that a LogManager class may
provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in
the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they
are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should
take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and
should delegate operations such as "isLoggable" and "log(LogRecord)"
to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging
output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method.
All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this
log(LogRecord) method.

Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger
factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or
return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that
the Logger returned by one of the

getLogger

factory methods
may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the
Logger is not kept.

Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler
objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of
destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc.

Each Logger keeps track of a "parent" Logger, which is its
nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace.

Each Logger has a "Level" associated with it. This reflects
a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's
level is set to

null

, then its effective level is inherited
from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its
parent, and so on up the tree.

The log level can be configured based on the properties from the
logging configuration file, as described in the description
of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed
by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is
changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child
logger that has

null

as its level will inherit its
effective level from its parent.

On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap
check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the
effective log level of the logger. If the request level is
lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately.

After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate
a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a
Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the
record should be published. If that passes it will then publish
the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also
publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree.

Each Logger may have a

ResourceBundle

associated with it.
The

ResourceBundle

may be specified by name, using the

getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)

factory
method, or by value - using the

setResourceBundle

method.
This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages.
If a Logger does not have its own

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle
name, then it will inherit the

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle name
from its parent, recursively up the tree.

Most of the logger output methods take a "msg" argument. This
msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key.
During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization

ResourceBundle

and if the

ResourceBundle

has a mapping for
the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value.
Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use
java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so
for example a format string "{0} {1}" would format two parameters
as strings.

A set of methods alternatively take a "msgSupplier" instead of a "msg"
argument. These methods take a

Supplier

<String>

function
which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message
actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating
unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to
log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version,
the code would look like:

```java
class DiagnosisMessages {
static String systemHealthStatus() {
// collect system health information
...
}
}
...
logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());
```

With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when
the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as
below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is
enabled.

```java
logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);
```

When looking for a

ResourceBundle

, the logger will first look at
whether a bundle was specified using

setResourceBundle

, and then
only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the

getLogger

factory method.
If no

ResourceBundle

or no resource bundle name is found,
then it will use the nearest

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle
name inherited from its parent tree.

When a

ResourceBundle

was inherited or specified through the

setResourceBundle

method, then
that

ResourceBundle

will be used. Otherwise if the logger only
has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name
will be mapped to a

ResourceBundle

object, using the default Locale
at the time of logging.

When mapping resource bundle names to

ResourceBundle

objects, the logger will first try to use the
Thread's

context class
loader

to map the given resource bundle name to a

ResourceBundle

.
If the thread context class loader is

null

, it will try the

system class loader

instead. If the

ResourceBundle

is still not found, it will use the
class loader of the first caller of the

getLogger

factory method.

Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of
the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter.

Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed
until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink.

The logging methods are grouped in five main categories:

- There are a set of "log" methods that take a log level, a message
string, and optionally some parameters to the message string.

There are a set of "logp" methods (for "log precise") that are
like the "log" methods, but also take an explicit source class name
and method name.

There are a set of "logrb" method (for "log with resource bundle")
that are like the "logp" method, but also take an explicit resource
bundle object for use in localizing the log message.

There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the
"entering" methods), method returns (the "exiting" methods) and
throwing exceptions (the "throwing" methods).

The log level can be configured based on the properties from the

of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed
by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is
changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child
logger that has

null

as its level will inherit its
effective level from its parent.

On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap
check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the

With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when
the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as
below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is
enabled.

```java
logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);
```

When looking for a

ResourceBundle

, the logger will first look at
whether a bundle was specified using

setResourceBundle

, and then
only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the

getLogger

factory method.
If no

ResourceBundle

or no resource bundle name is found,
then it will use the nearest

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle
name inherited from its parent tree.

When a

ResourceBundle

was inherited or specified through the

setResourceBundle

method, then
that

ResourceBundle

will be used. Otherwise if the logger only
has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name
will be mapped to a

ResourceBundle

object, using the default Locale
at the time of logging.

When mapping resource bundle names to

ResourceBundle

objects, the logger will first try to use the
Thread's

context class
loader

to map the given resource bundle name to a

ResourceBundle

.
If the thread context class loader is

null

, it will try the

system class loader

instead. If the

ResourceBundle

is still not found, it will use the
class loader of the first caller of the

getLogger

factory method.

Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of
the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter.

Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed
until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink.

The logging methods are grouped in five main categories:

- There are a set of "log" methods that take a log level, a message
string, and optionally some parameters to the message string.

There are a set of "logp" methods (for "log precise") that are
like the "log" methods, but also take an explicit source class name
and method name.

There are a set of "logrb" method (for "log with resource bundle")
that are like the "logp" method, but also take an explicit resource
bundle object for use in localizing the log message.

There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the
"entering" methods), method returns (the "exiting" methods) and
throwing exceptions (the "throwing" methods).

Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the
very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a
simple string at a given log level. These methods are named
after the standard Level names ("severe", "warning", "info", etc.)
and take a single argument, a message string.

For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and
method name, the Logging framework will make a "best effort"
to determine which class and method called into the logging method.
However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred
information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!).
Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when
JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible
to reliably locate the calling class and method.

All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe.

Subclassing Information:

Note that a LogManager class may
provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in
the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they
are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should
take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and
should delegate operations such as "isLoggable" and "log(LogRecord)"
to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging
output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method.
All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this
log(LogRecord) method.

On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap
check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the
effective log level of the logger. If the request level is
lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately.

After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate
a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a
Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the
record should be published. If that passes it will then publish
the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also
publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree.

Each Logger may have a

ResourceBundle

associated with it.
The

ResourceBundle

may be specified by name, using the

getLogger(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)

factory
method, or by value - using the

setResourceBundle

method.
This bundle will be used for localizing logging messages.
If a Logger does not have its own

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle
name, then it will inherit the

ResourceBundle

or resource bundle name
from its parent, recursively up the tree.

Most of the logger output methods take a "msg" argument. This
msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key.
During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization

ResourceBundle

and if the

ResourceBundle

has a mapping for
the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value.
Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use
java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so
for example a format string "{0} {1}" would format two parameters
as strings.

A set of methods alternatively take a "msgSupplier" instead of a "msg"
argument. These methods take a

Supplier

<String>

function
which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message
actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating
unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to
log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version,
the code would look like:

```java
class DiagnosisMessages {
static String systemHealthStatus() {
// collect system health information
...
}
}
...
logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());
```

With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when
the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as
below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is
enabled.

```java
logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);
```

When looking for a

ResourceBundle

, the logger will first look at
whether a bundle was specified using

setResourceBundle

, and then
only whether a resource bundle name was specified through the

getLogger

factory method.
If no

then it will use the nearest

name inherited from its parent tree.

ResourceBundle

method, then
that

ResourceBundle

has or inherited a resource bundle name, then that resource bundle name
will be mapped to a

ResourceBundle

object, using the default Locale
at the time of logging.

When mapping resource bundle names to

ResourceBundle

objects, the logger will first try to use the
Thread's

context class
loader

to map the given resource bundle name to a

ResourceBundle

.
If the thread context class loader is

null

instead. If the

ResourceBundle

is still not found, it will use the
class loader of the first caller of the

- There are a set of "log" methods that take a log level, a message
string, and optionally some parameters to the message string.

There are a set of "logp" methods (for "log precise") that are
like the "log" methods, but also take an explicit source class name
and method name.

There are a set of "logrb" method (for "log with resource bundle")
that are like the "logp" method, but also take an explicit resource
bundle object for use in localizing the log message.

There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the
"entering" methods), method returns (the "exiting" methods) and
throwing exceptions (the "throwing" methods).

Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the
very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a
simple string at a given log level. These methods are named
after the standard Level names ("severe", "warning", "info", etc.)
and take a single argument, a message string.

For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and
method name, the Logging framework will make a "best effort"
to determine which class and method called into the logging method.
However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred
information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!).
Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when
JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible
to reliably locate the calling class and method.

All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe.

Subclassing Information:

Note that a LogManager class may
provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in
the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they
are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should
take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and
should delegate operations such as "isLoggable" and "log(LogRecord)"
to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging
output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method.
All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this
log(LogRecord) method.

Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of
the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter.

Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed
until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink.

#### Methods declared in class java.lang. Object

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME

```java
public static final
String
GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME
```

GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME is a name for the global logger.

**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** Constant Field Values

- global

```java
@Deprecated

public static final
Logger
global
```

Deprecated.

Initialization of this field is prone to deadlocks.
The field must be initialized by the Logger class initialization
which may cause deadlocks with the LogManager class initialization.
In such cases two class initialization wait for each other to complete.
The preferred way to get the global logger object is via the call

Logger.getGlobal()

.
For compatibility with old JDK versions where the

Logger.getGlobal()

is not available use the call

Logger.getLogger(Logger.GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME)

or

Logger.getLogger("global")

.

The "global" Logger object is provided as a convenience to developers
who are making casual use of the Logging package. Developers
who are making serious use of the logging package (for example
in products) should create and use their own Logger objects,
with appropriate names, so that logging can be controlled on a
suitable per-Logger granularity. Developers also need to keep a
strong reference to their Logger objects to prevent them from
being garbage collected.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- Logger

```java
protected Logger​(
String
name,

String
resourceBundleName)
```

Protected method to construct a logger for a named subsystem.

The logger will be initially configured with a null Level
and with useParentHandlers set to true.

**Parameters:** name

- A name for the logger. This should
be a dot-separated name and should normally
be based on the package name or class name
of the subsystem, such as java.net
or javax.swing. It may be null for anonymous Loggers.
**Parameters:** resourceBundleName

- name of ResourceBundle to be used for localizing
messages for this logger. May be null if none
of the messages require localization.
**Throws:** MissingResourceException

- if the resourceBundleName is non-null and
no corresponding resource can be found.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getGlobal

```java
public static final
Logger
getGlobal()
```

Return global logger object with the name Logger.GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME.

**Returns:** global logger object
**Since:** 1.7

- getLogger

```java
public static
Logger
getLogger​(
String
name)
```

Find or create a logger for a named subsystem. If a logger has
already been created with the given name it is returned. Otherwise
a new logger is created.

If a new logger is created its log level will be configured
based on the LogManager configuration and it will be configured
to also send logging output to its parent's Handlers. It will
be registered in the LogManager global namespace.

Note: The LogManager may only retain a weak reference to the newly
created Logger. It is important to understand that a previously
created Logger with the given name may be garbage collected at any
time if there is no strong reference to the Logger. In particular,
this means that two back-to-back calls like

getLogger("MyLogger").log(...)

may use different Logger
objects named "MyLogger" if there is no strong reference to the
Logger named "MyLogger" elsewhere in the program.

**Parameters:** name

- A name for the logger. This should
be a dot-separated name and should normally
be based on the package name or class name
of the subsystem, such as java.net
or javax.swing
**Returns:** a suitable Logger
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the name is null.

- getLogger

```java
public static
Logger
getLogger​(
String
name,

String
resourceBundleName)
```

Find or create a logger for a named subsystem. If a logger has
already been created with the given name it is returned. Otherwise
a new logger is created.

If a new logger is created its log level will be configured
based on the LogManager and it will be configured to also send logging
output to its parent's Handlers. It will be registered in
the LogManager global namespace.

Note: The LogManager may only retain a weak reference to the newly
created Logger. It is important to understand that a previously
created Logger with the given name may be garbage collected at any
time if there is no strong reference to the Logger. In particular,
this means that two back-to-back calls like

getLogger("MyLogger", ...).log(...)

may use different Logger
objects named "MyLogger" if there is no strong reference to the
Logger named "MyLogger" elsewhere in the program.

If the named Logger already exists and does not yet have a
localization resource bundle then the given resource bundle
name is used. If the named Logger already exists and has
a different resource bundle name then an IllegalArgumentException
is thrown.

**Parameters:** name

- A name for the logger. This should
be a dot-separated name and should normally
be based on the package name or class name
of the subsystem, such as java.net
or javax.swing
**Parameters:** resourceBundleName

- name of ResourceBundle to be used for localizing
messages for this logger. May be

null

if none of the messages require localization.
**Returns:** a suitable Logger
**Throws:** MissingResourceException

- if the resourceBundleName is non-null and
no corresponding resource can be found.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the Logger already exists and uses
a different resource bundle name; or if

resourceBundleName

is

null

but the named
logger has a resource bundle set.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the name is null.

- getAnonymousLogger

```java
public static
Logger
getAnonymousLogger()
```

Create an anonymous Logger. The newly created Logger is not
registered in the LogManager namespace. There will be no
access checks on updates to the logger.

This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets.
Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private
by the creating class. This removes the need for normal security
checks, which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update
the control state of the Logger. For example an applet can do
a setLevel or an addHandler on an anonymous Logger.

Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured
to have the root logger ("") as its parent. This means that
by default it inherits its effective level and handlers
from the root logger. Changing its parent via the

setParent

method
will still require the security permission specified by that method.

**Returns:** a newly created private Logger

- getAnonymousLogger

```java
public static
Logger
getAnonymousLogger​(
String
resourceBundleName)
```

Create an anonymous Logger. The newly created Logger is not
registered in the LogManager namespace. There will be no
access checks on updates to the logger.

This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets.
Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private
by the creating class. This removes the need for normal security
checks, which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update
the control state of the Logger. For example an applet can do
a setLevel or an addHandler on an anonymous Logger.

Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured
to have the root logger ("") as its parent. This means that
by default it inherits its effective level and handlers
from the root logger. Changing its parent via the

setParent

method
will still require the security permission specified by that method.

**Parameters:** resourceBundleName

- name of ResourceBundle to be used for localizing
messages for this logger.
May be null if none of the messages require localization.
**Returns:** a newly created private Logger
**Throws:** MissingResourceException

- if the resourceBundleName is non-null and
no corresponding resource can be found.

- getResourceBundle

```java
public
ResourceBundle
getResourceBundle()
```

Retrieve the localization resource bundle for this
logger.
This method will return a

ResourceBundle

that was either
set by the

setResourceBundle

method or

mapped from the
the resource bundle name

set via the

getLogger

factory
method for the current default locale.

Note that if the result is

null

, then the Logger will use a resource
bundle or resource bundle name inherited from its parent.

**Returns:** localization bundle (may be

null

)

- getResourceBundleName

```java
public
String
getResourceBundleName()
```

Retrieve the localization resource bundle name for this
logger.
This is either the name specified through the

getLogger

factory method,
or the

base name

of the
ResourceBundle set through

setResourceBundle

method.

Note that if the result is

null

, then the Logger will use a resource
bundle or resource bundle name inherited from its parent.

**Returns:** localization bundle name (may be

null

)

- setFilter

```java
public void setFilter​(
Filter
newFilter)
throws
SecurityException
```

Set a filter to control output on this Logger.

After passing the initial "level" check, the Logger will
call this Filter to check if a log record should really
be published.

**Parameters:** newFilter

- a filter object (may be null)
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists,
this logger is not anonymous, and the caller
does not have LoggingPermission("control").

- getFilter

```java
public
Filter
getFilter()
```

Get the current filter for this Logger.

**Returns:** a filter object (may be null)

- log

```java
public void log​(
LogRecord
record)
```

Log a LogRecord.

All the other logging methods in this class call through
this method to actually perform any logging. Subclasses can
override this single method to capture all log activity.

**Parameters:** record

- the LogRecord to be published

- log

```java
public void log​(
Level
level,

String
msg)
```

Log a message, with no arguments.

This method returns the nearest extant parent in the namespace.
Thus if a Logger is called "a.b.c.d", and a Logger called "a.b"
has been created but no logger "a.b.c" exists, then a call of
getParent on the Logger "a.b.c.d" will return the Logger "a.b".

The result will be null if it is called on the root Logger
in the namespace.

**Returns:** nearest existing parent Logger

- setParent

```java
public void setParent​(
Logger
parent)
```

Set the parent for this Logger. This method is used by
the LogManager to update a Logger when the namespace changes.

It should not be called from application code.

**Parameters:** parent

- the new parent logger
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

```java
public static final
Logger
getGlobal()
```

Return global logger object with the name Logger.GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME.

**Returns:** global logger object
**Since:** 1.7

- getLogger

```java
public static
Logger
getLogger​(
String
name)
```

Find or create a logger for a named subsystem. If a logger has
already been created with the given name it is returned. Otherwise
a new logger is created.

If a new logger is created its log level will be configured
based on the LogManager configuration and it will be configured
to also send logging output to its parent's Handlers. It will
be registered in the LogManager global namespace.

Note: The LogManager may only retain a weak reference to the newly
created Logger. It is important to understand that a previously
created Logger with the given name may be garbage collected at any
time if there is no strong reference to the Logger. In particular,
this means that two back-to-back calls like

getLogger("MyLogger").log(...)

may use different Logger
objects named "MyLogger" if there is no strong reference to the
Logger named "MyLogger" elsewhere in the program.

**Parameters:** name

- A name for the logger. This should
be a dot-separated name and should normally
be based on the package name or class name
of the subsystem, such as java.net
or javax.swing
**Returns:** a suitable Logger
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the name is null.

- getLogger

```java
public static
Logger
getLogger​(
String
name,

String
resourceBundleName)
```

Find or create a logger for a named subsystem. If a logger has
already been created with the given name it is returned. Otherwise
a new logger is created.

If a new logger is created its log level will be configured
based on the LogManager and it will be configured to also send logging
output to its parent's Handlers. It will be registered in
the LogManager global namespace.

Note: The LogManager may only retain a weak reference to the newly
created Logger. It is important to understand that a previously
created Logger with the given name may be garbage collected at any
time if there is no strong reference to the Logger. In particular,
this means that two back-to-back calls like

getLogger("MyLogger", ...).log(...)

may use different Logger
objects named "MyLogger" if there is no strong reference to the
Logger named "MyLogger" elsewhere in the program.

If the named Logger already exists and does not yet have a
localization resource bundle then the given resource bundle
name is used. If the named Logger already exists and has
a different resource bundle name then an IllegalArgumentException
is thrown.

**Parameters:** name

- A name for the logger. This should
be a dot-separated name and should normally
be based on the package name or class name
of the subsystem, such as java.net
or javax.swing
**Parameters:** resourceBundleName

- name of ResourceBundle to be used for localizing
messages for this logger. May be

null

if none of the messages require localization.

no corresponding resource can be found.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the Logger already exists and uses
a different resource bundle name; or if

resourceBundleName

is

null

but the named
logger has a resource bundle set.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the name is null.

- getAnonymousLogger

```java
public static
Logger
getAnonymousLogger()
```

Create an anonymous Logger. The newly created Logger is not
registered in the LogManager namespace. There will be no
access checks on updates to the logger.

This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets.
Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private
by the creating class. This removes the need for normal security
checks, which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update
the control state of the Logger. For example an applet can do
a setLevel or an addHandler on an anonymous Logger.

Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured
to have the root logger ("") as its parent. This means that
by default it inherits its effective level and handlers
from the root logger. Changing its parent via the

setParent

method
will still require the security permission specified by that method.

**Returns:** a newly created private Logger

- getAnonymousLogger

```java
public static
Logger
getAnonymousLogger​(
String
resourceBundleName)
```

Create an anonymous Logger. The newly created Logger is not
registered in the LogManager namespace. There will be no
access checks on updates to the logger.

This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets.
Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private
by the creating class. This removes the need for normal security
checks, which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update
the control state of the Logger. For example an applet can do
a setLevel or an addHandler on an anonymous Logger.

Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured
to have the root logger ("") as its parent. This means that
by default it inherits its effective level and handlers
from the root logger. Changing its parent via the

setParent

method
will still require the security permission specified by that method.

**Parameters:** resourceBundleName

- name of ResourceBundle to be used for localizing
messages for this logger.
May be null if none of the messages require localization.
**Returns:** a newly created private Logger
**Throws:** MissingResourceException

- if the resourceBundleName is non-null and
no corresponding resource can be found.

- getResourceBundle

```java
public
ResourceBundle
getResourceBundle()
```

Retrieve the localization resource bundle for this
logger.
This method will return a

ResourceBundle

that was either
set by the

setResourceBundle

method or

mapped from the
the resource bundle name

set via the

getLogger

factory
method for the current default locale.

Note that if the result is

null

, then the Logger will use a resource
bundle or resource bundle name inherited from its parent.

**Returns:** localization bundle (may be

null

)

- getResourceBundleName

```java
public
String
getResourceBundleName()
```

Retrieve the localization resource bundle name for this
logger.
This is either the name specified through the

getLogger

factory method,
or the

base name

of the
ResourceBundle set through

setResourceBundle

method.

Note that if the result is

null

, then the Logger will use a resource
bundle or resource bundle name inherited from its parent.

**Returns:** localization bundle name (may be

null

)

- setFilter

```java
public void setFilter​(
Filter
newFilter)
throws
SecurityException
```

Set a filter to control output on this Logger.

After passing the initial "level" check, the Logger will
call this Filter to check if a log record should really
be published.

**Parameters:** newFilter

- a filter object (may be null)
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists,
this logger is not anonymous, and the caller
does not have LoggingPermission("control").

- getFilter

```java
public
Filter
getFilter()
```

Get the current filter for this Logger.

**Returns:** a filter object (may be null)

SecurityException
```

Set the log level specifying which message levels will be
logged by this logger. Message levels lower than this
value will be discarded. The level value Level.OFF
can be used to turn off logging.

If the new level is null, it means that this node should
inherit its level from its nearest ancestor with a specific
(non-null) level value.

**Parameters:** newLevel

- the new value for the log level (may be null)
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists,
this logger is not anonymous, and the caller
does not have LoggingPermission("control").

- getLevel

```java
public
Level
getLevel()
```

Get the log Level that has been specified for this Logger.
The result may be null, which means that this logger's
effective level will be inherited from its parent.

**Returns:** this Logger's level

- isLoggable

```java
public boolean isLoggable​(
Level
level)
```

Check if a message of the given level would actually be logged
by this logger. This check is based on the Loggers effective level,
which may be inherited from its parent.

**Parameters:** level

- a message logging level
**Returns:** true if the given message level is currently being logged.

- getName

```java
public
String
getName()
```

Get the name for this logger.

- addHandler

```java
public void addHandler​(
Handler
handler)
throws
SecurityException
```

Add a log Handler to receive logging messages.

By default, Loggers also send their output to their parent logger.
Typically the root Logger is configured with a set of Handlers
that essentially act as default handlers for all loggers.

**Parameters:** handler

- a logging Handler
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists,
this logger is not anonymous, and the caller
does not have LoggingPermission("control").

- removeHandler

```java
public void removeHandler​(
Handler
handler)
throws
SecurityException
```

Remove a log Handler.

Returns silently if the given Handler is not found or is null

**Parameters:** handler

- a logging Handler
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists,
this logger is not anonymous, and the caller
does not have LoggingPermission("control").

- getHandlers

```java
public
Handler
[] getHandlers()
```

Get the Handlers associated with this logger.

**Returns:** an array of all registered Handlers

- setUseParentHandlers

```java
public void setUseParentHandlers​(boolean useParentHandlers)
```

Specify whether or not this logger should send its output
to its parent Logger. This means that any LogRecords will
also be written to the parent's Handlers, and potentially
to its parent, recursively up the namespace.

**Parameters:** useParentHandlers

- true if output is to be sent to the
logger's parent.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists,
this logger is not anonymous, and the caller
does not have LoggingPermission("control").

- getUseParentHandlers

```java
public boolean getUseParentHandlers()
```

Discover whether or not this logger is sending its output
to its parent logger.

**Returns:** true if output is to be sent to the logger's parent

Sets a resource bundle on this logger.
All messages will be logged using the given resource bundle for its
specific

locale

.

**Parameters:** bundle

- The resource bundle that this logger shall use.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the given bundle is

null

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the given bundle doesn't have a

base name

,
or if this logger already has a resource bundle set but
the given bundle has a different base name.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists,
this logger is not anonymous, and the caller
does not have LoggingPermission("control").
**Since:** 1.8

- getParent

```java
public
Logger
getParent()
```

Return the parent for this Logger.

This method returns the nearest extant parent in the namespace.
Thus if a Logger is called "a.b.c.d", and a Logger called "a.b"
has been created but no logger "a.b.c" exists, then a call of
getParent on the Logger "a.b.c.d" will return the Logger "a.b".

The result will be null if it is called on the root Logger
in the namespace.

**Returns:** nearest existing parent Logger

- setParent

```java
public void setParent​(
Logger
parent)
```

Set the parent for this Logger. This method is used by
the LogManager to update a Logger when the namespace changes.

It should not be called from application code.

**Parameters:** parent

- the new parent logger
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

getLogger

```java
public static
Logger
getLogger​(
String
name)
```

Find or create a logger for a named subsystem. If a logger has
already been created with the given name it is returned. Otherwise
a new logger is created.

If a new logger is created its log level will be configured
based on the LogManager configuration and it will be configured
to also send logging output to its parent's Handlers. It will
be registered in the LogManager global namespace.

Note: The LogManager may only retain a weak reference to the newly
created Logger. It is important to understand that a previously
created Logger with the given name may be garbage collected at any
time if there is no strong reference to the Logger. In particular,
this means that two back-to-back calls like

getLogger("MyLogger").log(...)

may use different Logger
objects named "MyLogger" if there is no strong reference to the
Logger named "MyLogger" elsewhere in the program.

**Parameters:** name

- A name for the logger. This should
be a dot-separated name and should normally
be based on the package name or class name
of the subsystem, such as java.net
or javax.swing
**Returns:** a suitable Logger
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the name is null.

getAnonymousLogger

```java
public static
Logger
getAnonymousLogger()
```

Create an anonymous Logger. The newly created Logger is not
registered in the LogManager namespace. There will be no
access checks on updates to the logger.

This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets.
Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private
by the creating class. This removes the need for normal security
checks, which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update
the control state of the Logger. For example an applet can do
a setLevel or an addHandler on an anonymous Logger.

Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured
to have the root logger ("") as its parent. This means that
by default it inherits its effective level and handlers
from the root logger. Changing its parent via the

setParent

method
will still require the security permission specified by that method.

**Returns:** a newly created private Logger

has been created but no logger "a.b.c" exists, then a call of
getParent on the Logger "a.b.c.d" will return the Logger "a.b".

The result will be null if it is called on the root Logger
in the namespace.
