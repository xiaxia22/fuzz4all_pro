# Class JRootPane

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\JRootPane.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
JRootPane

extends
JComponent

implements
Accessible
```

A lightweight container used behind the scenes by

JFrame

,

JDialog

,

JWindow

,

JApplet

, and

JInternalFrame

.
For task-oriented information on functionality provided by root panes
see

How to Use Root Panes

,
a section in

The Java Tutorial

.

The following image shows the relationships between
the classes that use root panes.

The "heavyweight" components (those that delegate to a peer, or native
component on the host system) are shown with a darker, heavier box. The four
heavyweight JFC/Swing containers (

JFrame

,

JDialog

,

JWindow

, and

JApplet

) are
shown in relation to the AWT classes they extend.
These four components are the
only heavyweight containers in the Swing library. The lightweight container

JInternalFrame

is also shown.
All five of these JFC/Swing containers implement the

RootPaneContainer

interface,
and they all delegate their operations to a

JRootPane

(shown with a little "handle" on top).

Note:

The

JComponent

method

getRootPane

can be used to obtain the

JRootPane

that contains
a given component.

Example

The diagram at right shows the structure of a

JRootPane

.
A

JRootpane

is made up of a

glassPane

,
an optional

menuBar

, and a

contentPane

.
(The

JLayeredPane

manages the

menuBar

and the

contentPane

.)
The

glassPane

sits over the top of everything,
where it is in a position to intercept mouse movements.
Since the

glassPane

(like the

contentPane

)
can be an arbitrary component, it is also possible to set up the

glassPane

for drawing. Lines and images on the

glassPane

can then range
over the frames underneath without being limited by their boundaries.

Although the

menuBar

component is optional,
the

layeredPane

,

contentPane

,
and

glassPane

always exist.
Attempting to set them to

null

generates an exception.

To add components to the

JRootPane

(other than the
optional menu bar), you add the object to the

contentPane

of the

JRootPane

, like this:

```java
rootPane.getContentPane().add(child);
```

The same principle holds true for setting layout managers, removing
components, listing children, etc. All these methods are invoked on
the

contentPane

instead of on the

JRootPane

.

Note:

The default layout manager for the

contentPane

is
a

BorderLayout

manager. However, the

JRootPane

uses a custom

LayoutManager

.
So, when you want to change the layout manager for the components you added
to a

JRootPane

, be sure to use code like this:

```java
rootPane.getContentPane().setLayout(new BoxLayout());
```

If a

JMenuBar

component is set on the

JRootPane

,
it is positioned along the upper edge of the frame.
The

contentPane

is adjusted in location and size to
fill the remaining area.
(The

JMenuBar

and the

contentPane

are added to the

layeredPane

component at the

JLayeredPane.FRAME_CONTENT_LAYER

layer.)

The

layeredPane

is the parent of all children in the

JRootPane

-- both as the direct parent of the menu and
the grandparent of all components added to the

contentPane

.
It is an instance of

JLayeredPane

,
which provides the ability to add components at several layers.
This capability is very useful when working with menu popups,
dialog boxes, and dragging -- situations in which you need to place
a component on top of all other components in the pane.

The

glassPane

sits on top of all other components in the

JRootPane

.
That provides a convenient place to draw above all other components,
and makes it possible to intercept mouse events,
which is useful both for dragging and for drawing.
Developers can use

setVisible

on the

glassPane

to control when the

glassPane

displays over the other children.
By default the

glassPane

is not visible.

The custom

LayoutManager

used by

JRootPane

ensures that:

- The

glassPane

fills the entire viewable
area of the

JRootPane

(bounds - insets).

The

layeredPane

fills the entire viewable area of the

JRootPane

. (bounds - insets)

The

menuBar

is positioned at the upper edge of the

layeredPane

.

The

contentPane

fills the entire viewable area,
minus the

menuBar

, if present.

Any other views in the

JRootPane

view hierarchy are ignored.

If you replace the

LayoutManager

of the

JRootPane

,
you are responsible for managing all of these views.
So ordinarily you will want to be sure that you
change the layout manager for the

contentPane

rather than
for the

JRootPane

itself!

The painting architecture of Swing requires an opaque

JComponent

to exist in the containment hierarchy above all other components. This is
typically provided by way of the content pane. If you replace the content
pane, it is recommended that you make the content pane opaque
by way of

setOpaque(true)

. Additionally, if the content pane
overrides

paintComponent

, it
will need to completely fill in the background in an opaque color in

paintComponent

.

Swing is not thread safe. For more

Policy

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™

#### public void setJMenuBar​(
JMenuBar
menu)

Adds or changes the menu bar used in the layered pane.

**Parameters:**
- menu

- the

JMenuBar

to add

---

#### @Deprecated

public void setMenuBar​(
JMenuBar
menu)

Specifies the menu bar value.

**Parameters:**
- menu

- the

JMenuBar

to add.

---

#### public
JMenuBar
getJMenuBar()

Returns the menu bar from the layered pane.

**Returns:**
- the

JMenuBar

used in the pane

---

#### @Deprecated

public
JMenuBar
getMenuBar()

Returns the menu bar value.

**Returns:**
- the

JMenuBar

used in the pane

---

#### public void setContentPane​(
Container
content)

Sets the content pane -- the container that holds the components
parented by the root pane.

Swing's painting architecture requires an opaque

JComponent

in the containment hierarchy. This is typically provided by the
content pane. If you replace the content pane it is recommended you
replace it with an opaque

JComponent

.

**Parameters:**
- content

- the

Container

to use for component-contents

**Throws:**
- IllegalComponentStateException

- (a runtime
exception) if the content pane parameter is

null

---

#### public
Container
getContentPane()

Returns the content pane -- the container that holds the components
parented by the root pane.

**Returns:**
- the

Container

that holds the component-contents

---

#### public void setLayeredPane​(
JLayeredPane
layered)

Sets the layered pane for the root pane. The layered pane
typically holds a content pane and an optional

JMenuBar

.

**Parameters:**
- layered

- the

JLayeredPane

to use

**Throws:**
- IllegalComponentStateException

- (a runtime
exception) if the layered pane parameter is

null

---

#### public
JLayeredPane
getLayeredPane()

Gets the layered pane used by the root pane. The layered pane
typically holds a content pane and an optional

JMenuBar

.

**Returns:**
- the

JLayeredPane

currently in use

---

#### public void setGlassPane​(
Component
glass)

Sets a specified

Component

to be the glass pane for this
root pane. The glass pane should normally be a lightweight,
transparent component, because it will be made visible when
ever the root pane needs to grab input events.

The new glass pane's visibility is changed to match that of
the current glass pane. An implication of this is that care
must be taken when you want to replace the glass pane and
make it visible. Either of the following will work:

```java
root.setGlassPane(newGlassPane);
newGlassPane.setVisible(true);
```

or:

```java
root.getGlassPane().setVisible(true);
root.setGlassPane(newGlassPane);
```

**Parameters:**
- glass

- the

Component

to use as the glass pane
for this

JRootPane

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the

glass

parameter is

null

---

#### public
Component
getGlassPane()

Returns the current glass pane for this

JRootPane

.

**Returns:**
- the current glass pane

**See Also:**
- setGlassPane(java.awt.Component)

---

#### public boolean isValidateRoot()

If a descendant of this

JRootPane

calls

revalidate

, validate from here on down.

Deferred requests to layout a component and its descendents again.
For example, calls to

revalidate

, are pushed upwards to
either a

JRootPane

or a

JScrollPane

because both classes override

isValidateRoot

to return true.

**Overrides:**
- isValidateRoot

in class

JComponent

**Returns:**
- true

**See Also:**
- JComponent.isValidateRoot()

,

Container.isValidateRoot()

---

#### public boolean isOptimizedDrawingEnabled()

The

glassPane

and

contentPane

have the same bounds, which means

JRootPane

does not tiles its children and this should return false.
On the other hand, the

glassPane

is normally not visible, and so this can return true if the

glassPane

isn't visible. Therefore, the
return value here depends upon the visibility of the

glassPane

.

**Overrides:**
- isOptimizedDrawingEnabled

in class

JComponent

**Returns:**
- true if this component's children don't overlap

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
description
="The button activated by default in this root pane")
public void setDefaultButton​(
JButton
defaultButton)

Sets the

defaultButton

property,
which determines the current default button for this

JRootPane

.
The default button is the button which will be activated
when a UI-defined activation event (typically the

Enter

key)
occurs in the root pane regardless of whether or not the button
has keyboard focus (unless there is another component within
the root pane which consumes the activation event,
such as a

JTextPane

).
For default activation to work, the button must be an enabled
descendent of the root pane when activation occurs.
To remove a default button from this root pane, set this
property to

null

.

**Parameters:**
- defaultButton

- the

JButton

which is to be the default button

**See Also:**
- JButton.isDefaultButton()

---

#### public
JButton
getDefaultButton()

Returns the value of the

defaultButton

property.

**Returns:**
- the

JButton

which is currently the default button

**See Also:**
- setDefaultButton(javax.swing.JButton)

---

#### protected void addImpl​(
Component
comp,

Object
constraints,
int index)

Overridden to enforce the position of the glass component as
the zero child.

**Overrides:**
- addImpl

in class

Container

**Parameters:**
- comp

- the component to be enhanced
- constraints

- the constraints to be respected
- index

- the index

**See Also:**
- Container.add(Component)

,

Container.add(Component, int)

,

Container.add(Component, java.lang.Object)

,

Container.invalidate()

,

LayoutManager

,

LayoutManager2

---

#### protected
String
paramString()

Returns a string representation of this

JRootPane

.
This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes,
and the content and format of the returned string may vary between
implementations. The returned string may be empty but may not
be

null

.

**Overrides:**
- paramString

in class

JComponent

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this

JRootPane

.

---

#### public
AccessibleContext
getAccessibleContext()

Gets the

AccessibleContext

associated with this

JRootPane

. For root panes, the

AccessibleContext

takes the form of an

AccessibleJRootPane

.
A new

AccessibleJRootPane

instance is created if necessary.

**Specified by:**
- getAccessibleContext

in interface

Accessible

**Overrides:**
- getAccessibleContext

in class

Component

**Returns:**
- an

AccessibleJRootPane

that serves as the

AccessibleContext

of this

JRootPane

JRootPane

.
A

JRootpane

is made up of a

glassPane

,
an optional

menuBar

, and a

contentPane

.
(The

JLayeredPane

manages the

menuBar

and the

contentPane

.)
The

glassPane

sits over the top of everything,
where it is in a position to intercept mouse movements.
Since the

glassPane

(like the

contentPane

)
can be an arbitrary component, it is also possible to set up the

glassPane

for drawing. Lines and images on the

glassPane

can then range
over the frames underneath without being limited by their boundaries.

Although the

menuBar

component is optional,
the

layeredPane

,

contentPane

,
and

glassPane

always exist.
Attempting to set them to

null

generates an exception.

To add components to the

JRootPane

(other than the
optional menu bar), you add the object to the

contentPane

of the

JRootPane

, like this:

```java
rootPane.getContentPane().add(child);
```

The same principle holds true for setting layout managers, removing
components, listing children, etc. All these methods are invoked on
the

contentPane

instead of on the

JRootPane

.

Note:

The default layout manager for the

contentPane

is
a

BorderLayout

manager. However, the

JRootPane

uses a custom

LayoutManager

.
So, when you want to change the layout manager for the components you added
to a

JRootPane

, be sure to use code like this:

```java
rootPane.getContentPane().setLayout(new BoxLayout());
```

If a

JMenuBar

component is set on the

JRootPane

,
it is positioned along the upper edge of the frame.
The

contentPane

is adjusted in location and size to
fill the remaining area.
(The

JMenuBar

and the

contentPane

are added to the

layeredPane

component at the

JLayeredPane.FRAME_CONTENT_LAYER

layer.)

The

layeredPane

is the parent of all children in the

JRootPane

-- both as the direct parent of the menu and
the grandparent of all components added to the

contentPane

.
It is an instance of

JLayeredPane

,
which provides the ability to add components at several layers.
This capability is very useful when working with menu popups,
dialog boxes, and dragging -- situations in which you need to place
a component on top of all other components in the pane.

The

glassPane

sits on top of all other components in the

JRootPane

.
That provides a convenient place to draw above all other components,
and makes it possible to intercept mouse events,
which is useful both for dragging and for drawing.
Developers can use

setVisible

on the

glassPane

to control when the

glassPane

displays over the other children.
By default the

glassPane

is not visible.

The custom

LayoutManager

used by

JRootPane

ensures that:

- The

glassPane

fills the entire viewable
area of the

JRootPane

(bounds - insets).

The

layeredPane

fills the entire viewable area of the

JRootPane

. (bounds - insets)

The

menuBar

is positioned at the upper edge of the

layeredPane

.

The

contentPane

fills the entire viewable area,
minus the

menuBar

, if present.

Any other views in the

JRootPane

view hierarchy are ignored.

If you replace the

LayoutManager

of the

JRootPane

,
you are responsible for managing all of these views.
So ordinarily you will want to be sure that you
change the layout manager for the

contentPane

rather than
for the

JRootPane

itself!

The painting architecture of Swing requires an opaque

JComponent

to exist in the containment hierarchy above all other components. This is
typically provided by way of the content pane. If you replace the content
pane, it is recommended that you make the content pane opaque
by way of

setOpaque(true)

. Additionally, if the content pane
overrides

paintComponent

, it
will need to completely fill in the background in an opaque color in

paintComponent

.

The following image shows the relationships between
the classes that use root panes.

The "heavyweight" components (those that delegate to a peer, or native
component on the host system) are shown with a darker, heavier box. The four
heavyweight JFC/Swing containers (

JFrame

,

JDialog

,

JWindow

, and

JApplet

) are
shown in relation to the AWT classes they extend.
These four components are the
only heavyweight containers in the Swing library. The lightweight container

JInternalFrame

is also shown.
All five of these JFC/Swing containers implement the

RootPaneContainer

interface,
and they all delegate their operations to a

JRootPane

(shown with a little "handle" on top).

Note:

The

JComponent

method

getRootPane

can be used to obtain the

JRootPane

that contains
a given component.

- setJMenuBar

```java
public void setJMenuBar​(
JMenuBar
menu)
```

Adds or changes the menu bar used in the layered pane.

**Parameters:** menu

- the

JMenuBar

to add

- setMenuBar

```java
@Deprecated

public void setMenuBar​(
JMenuBar
menu)
```

Deprecated.

As of Swing version 1.0.3
replaced by

setJMenuBar(JMenuBar menu)

.

Specifies the menu bar value.

**Parameters:** menu

- the

JMenuBar

to add.

- getJMenuBar

```java
public
JMenuBar
getJMenuBar()
```

Returns the menu bar from the layered pane.

**Returns:** the

JMenuBar

used in the pane

- getMenuBar

```java
@Deprecated

public
JMenuBar
getMenuBar()
```

Deprecated.

As of Swing version 1.0.3
replaced by

getJMenuBar()

.

Returns the menu bar value.

**Returns:** the

JMenuBar

used in the pane

- setContentPane

```java
public void setContentPane​(
Container
content)
```

Sets the content pane -- the container that holds the components
parented by the root pane.

Swing's painting architecture requires an opaque

JComponent

in the containment hierarchy. This is typically provided by the
content pane. If you replace the content pane it is recommended you
replace it with an opaque

JComponent

.

**Parameters:** content

- the

Container

to use for component-contents
**Throws:** IllegalComponentStateException

- (a runtime
exception) if the content pane parameter is

null

- getContentPane

```java
public
Container
getContentPane()
```

Returns the content pane -- the container that holds the components
parented by the root pane.

**Returns:** the

Container

that holds the component-contents

- setLayeredPane

```java
public void setLayeredPane​(
JLayeredPane
layered)
```

Sets the layered pane for the root pane. The layered pane
typically holds a content pane and an optional

JMenuBar

.

**Parameters:** layered

- the

JLayeredPane

to use
**Throws:** IllegalComponentStateException

- (a runtime
exception) if the layered pane parameter is

null

- getLayeredPane

```java
public
JLayeredPane
getLayeredPane()
```

Gets the layered pane used by the root pane. The layered pane
typically holds a content pane and an optional

JMenuBar

.

**Returns:** the

JLayeredPane

currently in use

- setGlassPane

```java
public void setGlassPane​(
Component
glass)
```

Sets a specified

Component

to be the glass pane for this
root pane. The glass pane should normally be a lightweight,
transparent component, because it will be made visible when
ever the root pane needs to grab input events.

The new glass pane's visibility is changed to match that of
the current glass pane. An implication of this is that care
must be taken when you want to replace the glass pane and
make it visible. Either of the following will work:

```java
root.setGlassPane(newGlassPane);
newGlassPane.setVisible(true);
```

or:

```java
root.getGlassPane().setVisible(true);
root.setGlassPane(newGlassPane);
```

**Parameters:** glass

- the

Component

to use as the glass pane
for this

JRootPane
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the

glass

parameter is

null

- getGlassPane

```java
public
Component
getGlassPane()
```

Returns the current glass pane for this

JRootPane

.

**Returns:** the current glass pane
**See Also:** setGlassPane(java.awt.Component)

- isValidateRoot

```java
public boolean isValidateRoot()
```

If a descendant of this

JRootPane

calls

revalidate

, validate from here on down.

Deferred requests to layout a component and its descendents again.
For example, calls to

revalidate

, are pushed upwards to
either a

JRootPane

or a

JScrollPane

because both classes override

isValidateRoot

to return true.

**Overrides:** isValidateRoot

in class

JComponent
**Returns:** true
**See Also:** JComponent.isValidateRoot()

,

Container.isValidateRoot()

- isOptimizedDrawingEnabled

```java
public boolean isOptimizedDrawingEnabled()
```

The

glassPane

and

contentPane

have the same bounds, which means

JRootPane

does not tiles its children and this should return false.
On the other hand, the

glassPane

is normally not visible, and so this can return true if the

glassPane

isn't visible. Therefore, the
return value here depends upon the visibility of the

glassPane

.

**Overrides:** isOptimizedDrawingEnabled

in class

JComponent
**Returns:** true if this component's children don't overlap

- setDefaultButton

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="The button activated by default in this root pane")
public void setDefaultButton​(
JButton
defaultButton)
```

Sets the

defaultButton

property,
which determines the current default button for this

JRootPane

.
The default button is the button which will be activated
when a UI-defined activation event (typically the

Enter

key)
occurs in the root pane regardless of whether or not the button
has keyboard focus (unless there is another component within
the root pane which consumes the activation event,
such as a

JTextPane

).
For default activation to work, the button must be an enabled
descendent of the root pane when activation occurs.
To remove a default button from this root pane, set this
property to

null

JMenuBar

used in the pane

- setContentPane

```java
public void setContentPane​(
Container
content)
```

Sets the content pane -- the container that holds the components
parented by the root pane.

Swing's painting architecture requires an opaque

JComponent

in the containment hierarchy. This is typically provided by the
content pane. If you replace the content pane it is recommended you
replace it with an opaque

JComponent

.

**Parameters:** content

- the

Container

to use for component-contents
**Throws:** IllegalComponentStateException

- (a runtime
exception) if the content pane parameter is

null

- getContentPane

```java
public
Container
getContentPane()
```

Returns the content pane -- the container that holds the components
parented by the root pane.

**Returns:** the

Container

that holds the component-contents

- setLayeredPane

```java
public void setLayeredPane​(
JLayeredPane

```

Sets the layered pane for the root pane. The layered pane
typically holds a content pane and an optional

JMenuBar

.

**Parameters:** layered

- the

JLayeredPane

to use
**Throws:** IllegalComponentStateException

- (a runtime
exception) if the layered pane parameter is

null

- getLayeredPane

```java
public
JLayeredPane
getLayeredPane()
```

Gets the layered pane used by the root pane. The layered pane
typically holds a content pane and an optional

JMenuBar

.

**Returns:** the

JLayeredPane

currently in use

- setGlassPane

```java
public void setGlassPane​(
Component
glass)
```

Sets a specified

Component

to be the glass pane for this
root pane. The glass pane should normally be a lightweight,
transparent component, because it will be made visible when
ever the root pane needs to grab input events.

The new glass pane's visibility is changed to match that of
the current glass pane. An implication of this is that care
must be taken when you want to replace the glass pane and
make it visible. Either of the following will work:

```java
root.setGlassPane(newGlassPane);
newGlassPane.setVisible(true);
```

or:

```java
root.getGlassPane().setVisible(true);
root.setGlassPane(newGlassPane);
```

**Parameters:** glass

- the

Component

to use as the glass pane
for this

JRootPane
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the

glass

parameter is

null

- getGlassPane

```java
public
Component
getGlassPane()
```

Returns the current glass pane for this

JRootPane

.

**Returns:** the current glass pane
**See Also:** setGlassPane(java.awt.Component)

- isValidateRoot

```java
public boolean isValidateRoot()
```

If a descendant of this

JRootPane

calls

revalidate

, validate from here on down.

Deferred requests to layout a component and its descendents again.
For example, calls to

revalidate

, are pushed upwards to
either a

JRootPane

or a

JScrollPane

because both classes override

isValidateRoot

to return true.

**Overrides:** isValidateRoot

in class

JComponent
**Returns:** true
**See Also:** JComponent.isValidateRoot()

,

Container.isValidateRoot()

- isOptimizedDrawingEnabled

```java
public boolean isOptimizedDrawingEnabled()
```

The

glassPane

and

contentPane

have the same bounds, which means

JRootPane

does not tiles its children and this should return false.
On the other hand, the

glassPane

is normally not visible, and so this can return true if the

glassPane

isn't visible. Therefore, the
return value here depends upon the visibility of the

glassPane

.

**Overrides:** isOptimizedDrawingEnabled

in class

JComponent
**Returns:** true if this component's children don't overlap

- setDefaultButton

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="The button activated by default in this root pane")
public void setDefaultButton​(
JButton
defaultButton)
```

Sets the

defaultButton

property,
which determines the current default button for this

JRootPane

.
The default button is the button which will be activated
when a UI-defined activation event (typically the

Enter

key)
occurs in the root pane regardless of whether or not the button
has keyboard focus (unless there is another component within
the root pane which consumes the activation event,
such as a

JTextPane

).
For default activation to work, the button must be an enabled
descendent of the root pane when activation occurs.
To remove a default button from this root pane, set this
property to

null

.

**Parameters:** defaultButton

- the

JButton

which is to be the default button
**See Also:** JButton.isDefaultButton()

- getDefaultButton

```java
public
JButton
getDefaultButton()
```

Returns the value of the

defaultButton

property.

**Returns:** the

JButton

which is currently the default button
**See Also:** setDefaultButton(javax.swing.JButton)

protected void addImpl​(
Component
comp,

Object
constraints,
int index)
```

Overridden to enforce the position of the glass component as
the zero child.

**Overrides:** addImpl

in class

Container
**Parameters:** comp

- the component to be enhanced
**Parameters:** constraints

- the constraints to be respected

setGlassPane

```java
public void setGlassPane​(
Component
glass)
```

Sets a specified

Component

to be the glass pane for this
root pane. The glass pane should normally be a lightweight,
transparent component, because it will be made visible when
ever the root pane needs to grab input events.

The new glass pane's visibility is changed to match that of
the current glass pane. An implication of this is that care
must be taken when you want to replace the glass pane and
make it visible. Either of the following will work:

```java
root.setGlassPane(newGlassPane);
newGlassPane.setVisible(true);
```

or:

```java
root.getGlassPane().setVisible(true);
root.setGlassPane(newGlassPane);
```

**Parameters:** glass

- the

Component

to use as the glass pane
for this

JRootPane
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the

glass

parameter is

null

isOptimizedDrawingEnabled

```java
public boolean isOptimizedDrawingEnabled()
```

The

glassPane

and

contentPane

have the same bounds, which means

JRootPane

does not tiles its children and this should return false.
On the other hand, the

glassPane

is normally not visible, and so this can return true if the

glassPane

isn't visible. Therefore, the
return value here depends upon the visibility of the

glassPane

.

**Overrides:** isOptimizedDrawingEnabled

```java
@BeanProperty
(
description
="The button activated by default in this root pane")
public void setDefaultButton​(
JButton
defaultButton)
```

Sets the

defaultButton

property,
which determines the current default button for this

JRootPane

.
The default button is the button which will be activated
when a UI-defined activation event (typically the

Enter

key)
occurs in the root pane regardless of whether or not the button
has keyboard focus (unless there is another component within
the root pane which consumes the activation event,
such as a

JTextPane

).
For default activation to work, the button must be an enabled
descendent of the root pane when activation occurs.
To remove a default button from this root pane, set this
property to

null

.
