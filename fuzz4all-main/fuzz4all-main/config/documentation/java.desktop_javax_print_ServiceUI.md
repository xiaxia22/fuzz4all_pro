# Class ServiceUI

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\print\ServiceUI.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ServiceUI

extends
Object
```

This class is a collection of UI convenience methods which provide a
graphical user dialog for browsing print services looked up through the Java
Print Service API.

The dialogs follow a standard pattern of acting as a continue/cancel option
for a user as well as allowing the user to select the print service to use
and specify choices such as paper size and number of copies.

The dialogs are designed to work with pluggable print services though the
public APIs of those print services.

If a print service provides any vendor extensions these may be made
accessible to the user through a vendor supplied tab panel

Component

.
Such a vendor extension is encouraged to use Swing! and to support its
accessibility APIs. The vendor extensions should return the settings as part
of the

AttributeSet

. Applications which want to preserve the user
settings should use those settings to specify the print job. Note that this
class is not referenced by any other part of the Java Print Service and may
not be included in profiles which cannot depend on the presence of the AWT
packages.

attributes)
throws
HeadlessException

Presents a dialog to the user for selecting a print service (printer). It
is displayed at the location specified by the application and is modal.
If the specification is invalid or would make the dialog not visible it
will be displayed at a location determined by the implementation. The
dialog blocks its calling thread and is application modal.

The dialog may include a tab panel with custom UI lazily obtained from
the

PrintService

's

ServiceUIFactory

when the

PrintService

is browsed. The dialog will attempt to locate a

MAIN_UIROLE

first as a

JComponent

, then as a

Panel

. If there is no

ServiceUIFactory

or no matching
role the custom tab will be empty or not visible.

The dialog returns the print service selected by the user if the user
OK's the dialog and

null

if the user cancels the dialog.

An application must pass in an array of print services to browse. The
array must be

non-null

and non-empty. Typically an application
will pass in only

PrintServices

capable of printing a particular
document flavor.

An application may pass in a

PrintService

to be initially
displayed. A

non-null

parameter must be included in the array of
browsable services. If this parameter is

null

a service is chosen
by the implementation.

An application may optionally pass in the flavor to be printed. If this
is

non-null

choices presented to the user can be better validated
against those supported by the services. An application must pass in a

PrintRequestAttributeSet

for returning user choices. On calling
the

PrintRequestAttributeSet

may be empty, or may contain
application-specified values.

These are used to set the initial settings for the initially displayed
print service. Values which are not supported by the print service are
ignored. As the user browses print services, attributes and values are
copied to the new display. If a user browses a print service which does
not support a particular attribute-value, the default for that service is
used as the new value to be copied.

If the user cancels the dialog, the returned attributes will not reflect
any changes made by the user.

A typical basic usage of this method may be:

```java
PrintService[] services = PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServices(
DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.JPEG, null);
PrintRequestAttributeSet attributes = new HashPrintRequestAttributeSet();
if (services.length > 0) {
PrintService service = ServiceUI.printDialog(null, 50, 50,
services, services[0],
null,
attributes);
if (service != null) {
... print ...
}
}
```

**Parameters:**
- gc

- used to select screen,

null

means primary or default
screen
- x

- location of dialog including border in screen coordinates
relative to the origin of

gc
- y

- location of dialog including border in screen coordinates
relative to the origin of

gc
- services

- to be browsable, must be

non-null
- defaultService

- initial

PrintService

to display
- flavor

- the flavor to be printed, or

null
- attributes

- on input is the initial application supplied
preferences. This cannot be

null

but may be empty. On
output the attributes reflect changes made by the user.

**Returns:**
- print service selected by the user, or

null

if the user
cancelled the dialog

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true
- IllegalArgumentException

- if services is

null

or empty, or
attributes is

null

, or the initial

PrintService

is not in the list of browsable services

An application may optionally pass in the flavor to be printed. If this
is

non-null

choices presented to the user can be better validated
against those supported by the services. An application must pass in a

PrintRequestAttributeSet

for returning user choices. On calling
the

PrintRequestAttributeSet

may be empty, or may contain
application-specified values.

These are used to set the initial settings for the initially displayed
print service. Values which are not supported by the print service are
ignored. As the user browses print services, attributes and values are
copied to the new display. If a user browses a print service which does
not support a particular attribute-value, the default for that service is
used as the new value to be copied.

If the user cancels the dialog, the returned attributes will not reflect
any changes made by the user.

A typical basic usage of this method may be:

```java
PrintService[] services = PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServices(
DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.JPEG, null);
PrintRequestAttributeSet attributes = new HashPrintRequestAttributeSet();
if (services.length > 0) {
PrintService service = ServiceUI.printDialog(null, 50, 50,
services, services[0],
null,
attributes);
if (service != null) {
... print ...
}
}
```

An application may pass in a

PrintService

to be initially
displayed. A

non-null

parameter must be included in the array of
browsable services. If this parameter is

null

a service is chosen
by the implementation.
