# Class ParagraphView

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\text\ParagraphView.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ParagraphView

extends
FlowView

implements
TabExpander
```

View of a simple line-wrapping paragraph that supports
multiple fonts, colors, components, icons, etc. It is
basically a vertical box with a margin around it. The
contents of the box are a bunch of rows which are special
horizontal boxes. This view creates a collection of
views that represent the child elements of the paragraph
element. Each of these views are placed into a row
directly if they will fit, otherwise the

breakView

method is called to try and carve the view into pieces
that fit.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** SwingConstants

,

.
The child views of the paragraph are rows which
have been used to arrange pieces of the

Views

that represent the child elements. This methods returns
the view responsible for the child element index
(prior to breaking). These are the Views that were
produced from a factory (to represent the child
elements) and used for layout.

#### protected boolean flipEastAndWestAtEnds​(int position,

Position.Bias
bias)

Determines in which direction the next view lays.
Consider the

View

at index n.
Typically the

View

s are layed out
from left to right, so that the

View

to the EAST will be at index n + 1, and the

View

to the WEST will be at index n - 1.
In certain situations, such as with bidirectional text,
it is possible that the

View

to EAST is not
at index n + 1, but rather at index n - 1,
or that the

View

to the WEST is not at
index n - 1, but index n + 1. In this case this method
would return true, indicating the

View

s are
layed out in descending order.

This will return true if the text is layed out right
to left at position, otherwise false.

**Overrides:**
- flipEastAndWestAtEnds

in class

BoxView

**Parameters:**
- position

- position into the model
- bias

- either

Position.Bias.Forward

or

#### protected
View
createRow()

Create a

View

that should be used to hold a
a row's worth of children in a flow.

**Specified by:**
- createRow

in class

FlowView

**Returns:**
- the new

View

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public float nextTabStop​(float x,
int tabOffset)

Returns the next tab stop position given a reference position.
This view implements the tab coordinate system, and calls

getTabbedSpan

on the logical children in the process
of layout to determine the desired span of the children. The
logical children can delegate their tab expansion upward to
the paragraph which knows how to expand tabs.

LabelView

is an example of a view that delegates
its tab expansion needs upward to the paragraph.

This is implemented to try and locate a

TabSet

in the paragraph element's attribute set. If one can be
found, its settings will be used, otherwise a default expansion
will be provided. The base location for tab expansion
is the left inset from the paragraphs most recent allocation
(which is what the layout of the children is based upon).

**Specified by:**
- nextTabStop

in interface

TabExpander

**Parameters:**
- x

- the X reference position
- tabOffset

- the position within the text stream
that the tab occurred at >= 0

**Returns:**
- the trailing end of the tab expansion >= 0

**See Also:**
- TabSet

**Returns:**
- the

TabSet

---

#### protected float getPartialSize​(int startOffset,
int endOffset)

Returns the size used by the views between

startOffset

and

endOffset

.
This uses

getPartialView

to calculate the
size if the child view implements the

TabableView

interface. If a
size is needed and a

View

does not implement
the

TabableView

interface,
the

preferredSpan

will be used.

**Parameters:**
- startOffset

- the starting document offset >= 0
- endOffset

- the ending document offset >= startOffset

**Returns:**
- the size >= 0

---

#### protected int findOffsetToCharactersInString​(char[] string,

axis. This is implemented to give the alignment to the
center of the first row along the y axis, and the default
along the x axis.

**Overrides:**
- getAlignment

in class

BoxView

**Parameters:**
- axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS

**Returns:**
- the desired alignment. This should be a value
between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive, where 0 indicates alignment at the
origin and 1.0 indicates alignment to the full span
away from the origin. An alignment of 0.5 would be the
center of the view.

---

#### public
View
breakView​(int axis,
float len,

Shape
a)
