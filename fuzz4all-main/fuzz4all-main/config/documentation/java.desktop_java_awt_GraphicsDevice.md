# Class GraphicsDevice

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\GraphicsDevice.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
GraphicsDevice

extends
Object
```

The

GraphicsDevice

class describes the graphics devices
that might be available in a particular graphics environment. These
include screen and printer devices. Note that there can be many screens
and many printers in an instance of

GraphicsEnvironment

. Each
graphics device has one or more

GraphicsConfiguration

objects
associated with it. These objects specify the different configurations
in which the

GraphicsDevice

can be used.

In a multi-screen environment, the

GraphicsConfiguration

objects can be used to render components on multiple screens. The
following code sample demonstrates how to create a

JFrame

object for each

GraphicsConfiguration

on each screen
device in the

GraphicsEnvironment

:

```java
GraphicsEnvironment ge = GraphicsEnvironment.
getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();
GraphicsDevice[] gs = ge.getScreenDevices();
for (int j = 0; j < gs.length; j++) {
GraphicsDevice gd = gs[j];
GraphicsConfiguration[] gc =
gd.getConfigurations();
for (int i=0; i < gc.length; i++) {
JFrame f = new
JFrame(gs[j].getDefaultConfiguration());
Canvas c = new Canvas(gc[i]);
Rectangle gcBounds = gc[i].getBounds();
int xoffs = gcBounds.x;
int yoffs = gcBounds.y;
f.getContentPane().add(c);
f.setLocation((i*50)+xoffs, (i*60)+yoffs);
f.show();
}
}
```

#### public abstract
String
getIDstring()

Returns the identification string associated with this

GraphicsDevice

.

A particular program might use more than one

GraphicsDevice

in a

GraphicsEnvironment

.
This method returns a

String

identifying a
particular

GraphicsDevice

in the local

GraphicsEnvironment

. Although there is
no public method to set this

String

, a programmer can
use the

String

for debugging purposes. Vendors of
the Java™ Runtime Environment can
format the return value of the

String

. To determine
how to interpret the value of the

String

, contact the
vendor of your Java Runtime. To find out who the vendor is, from
your program, call the

getProperty

method of the
System class with "java.vendor".

**Returns:**
- a

String

that is the identification
of this

GraphicsDevice

.

---

#### public abstract
GraphicsConfiguration
[] getConfigurations()

Returns all of the

GraphicsConfiguration

objects associated with this

GraphicsDevice

.

**Returns:**
- an array of

GraphicsConfiguration

objects that are associated with this

GraphicsDevice

.

---

#### public abstract
GraphicsConfiguration
getDefaultConfiguration()

Returns the default

GraphicsConfiguration

associated with this

GraphicsDevice

.

**Returns:**
- the default

GraphicsConfiguration

of this

GraphicsDevice

.

---

#### public
GraphicsConfiguration
getBestConfiguration​(
GraphicsConfigTemplate
gct)

Returns the "best" configuration possible that passes the
criteria defined in the

GraphicsConfigTemplate

.

**Parameters:**
- gct

- the

GraphicsConfigTemplate

object
used to obtain a valid

GraphicsConfiguration

**Returns:**
- a

GraphicsConfiguration

that passes
the criteria defined in the specified

GraphicsConfigTemplate

.

**See Also:**
- GraphicsConfigTemplate

---

#### public boolean isFullScreenSupported()

Returns

true

if this

GraphicsDevice

supports full-screen exclusive mode.
If a SecurityManager is installed, its

checkPermission

method will be called
with

AWTPermission("fullScreenExclusive")

.

isFullScreenSupported

returns true only if
that permission is granted.

**Returns:**
- whether full-screen exclusive mode is available for
this graphics device

**See Also:**
- AWTPermission

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public void setFullScreenWindow​(
Window
w)

Enter full-screen mode, or return to windowed mode. The entered
full-screen mode may be either exclusive or simulated. Exclusive
mode is only available if

isFullScreenSupported

returns

true

.

Exclusive mode implies:

- Windows cannot overlap the full-screen window. All other application
windows will always appear beneath the full-screen window in the Z-order.

There can be only one full-screen window on a device at any time,
so calling this method while there is an existing full-screen Window
will cause the existing full-screen window to
return to windowed mode.

Input method windows are disabled. It is advisable to call

Component.enableInputMethods(false)

to make a component
a non-client of the input method framework.

The simulated full-screen mode places and resizes the window to the maximum
possible visible area of the screen. However, the native windowing system
may modify the requested geometry-related data, so that the

Window

object
is placed and sized in a way that corresponds closely to the desktop settings.

When entering full-screen mode, if the window to be used as a
full-screen window is not visible, this method will make it visible.
It will remain visible when returning to windowed mode.

When entering full-screen mode, all the translucency effects are reset for
the window. Its shape is set to

null

, the opacity value is set to
1.0f, and the background color alpha is set to 255 (completely opaque).
These values are not restored when returning to windowed mode.

It is unspecified and platform-dependent how decorated windows operate
in full-screen mode. For this reason, it is recommended to turn off
the decorations in a

Frame

or

Dialog

object by using the

setUndecorated

method.

When returning to windowed mode from an exclusive full-screen window,
any display changes made by calling

setDisplayMode

are
automatically restored to their original state.

**Parameters:**
- w

- a window to use as the full-screen window;

null

if returning to windowed mode. Some platforms expect the
fullscreen window to be a top-level component (i.e., a

Frame

);
therefore it is preferable to use a

Frame

here rather than a

Window

.

**See Also:**
- isFullScreenSupported()

,

getFullScreenWindow()

,

setDisplayMode(java.awt.DisplayMode)

,

Component.enableInputMethods(boolean)

,

Component.setVisible(boolean)

,

Frame.setUndecorated(boolean)

,

Dialog.setUndecorated(boolean)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public
Window
getFullScreenWindow()

Returns the

Window

object representing the
full-screen window if the device is in full-screen mode.

**Returns:**
- the full-screen window, or

null

if the device is
not in full-screen mode.

**See Also:**
- setFullScreenWindow(Window)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public boolean isDisplayChangeSupported()

Returns

true

if this

GraphicsDevice

supports low-level display changes.
On some platforms low-level display changes may only be allowed in
full-screen exclusive mode (i.e., if

isFullScreenSupported()

returns

true

and the application has already entered
full-screen mode using

setFullScreenWindow(java.awt.Window)

).

**Returns:**
- whether low-level display changes are supported for this
graphics device.

**See Also:**
- isFullScreenSupported()

,

setDisplayMode(java.awt.DisplayMode)

,

setFullScreenWindow(java.awt.Window)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public void setDisplayMode​(
DisplayMode
dm)

Sets the display mode of this graphics device. This is only allowed
if

isDisplayChangeSupported()

returns

true

and may
require first entering full-screen exclusive mode using

setFullScreenWindow(java.awt.Window)

providing that full-screen exclusive mode is
supported (i.e.,

isFullScreenSupported()

returns

true

).

The display mode must be one of the display modes returned by

getDisplayModes()

, with one exception: passing a display mode
with

DisplayMode.REFRESH_RATE_UNKNOWN

refresh rate will result in
selecting a display mode from the list of available display modes with
matching width, height and bit depth.
However, passing a display mode with

DisplayMode.BIT_DEPTH_MULTI

for bit depth is only allowed if such mode exists in the list returned by

getDisplayModes()

.

Example code:

```java
Frame frame;
DisplayMode newDisplayMode;
GraphicsDevice gd;
// create a Frame, select desired DisplayMode from the list of modes
// returned by gd.getDisplayModes() ...

if (gd.isFullScreenSupported()) {
gd.setFullScreenWindow(frame);
} else {
// proceed in non-full-screen mode
frame.setSize(...);
frame.setLocation(...);
frame.setVisible(true);
}

if (gd.isDisplayChangeSupported()) {
gd.setDisplayMode(newDisplayMode);
}
```

**Parameters:**
- dm

- The new display mode of this graphics device.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the

DisplayMode

supplied is

null

, or is not available in the array returned
by

getDisplayModes
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if

isDisplayChangeSupported

returns

false

**See Also:**
- getDisplayMode()

,

getDisplayModes()

,

isDisplayChangeSupported()

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public
DisplayMode
getDisplayMode()

Returns the current display mode of this

GraphicsDevice

.
The returned display mode is allowed to have a refresh rate

DisplayMode.REFRESH_RATE_UNKNOWN

if it is indeterminate.
Likewise, the returned display mode is allowed to have a bit depth

DisplayMode.BIT_DEPTH_MULTI

if it is indeterminate or if multiple
bit depths are supported.

**Returns:**
- the current display mode of this graphics device.

**See Also:**
- setDisplayMode(DisplayMode)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public
DisplayMode
[] getDisplayModes()

Returns all display modes available for this

GraphicsDevice

.
The returned display modes are allowed to have a refresh rate

DisplayMode.REFRESH_RATE_UNKNOWN

if it is indeterminate.
Likewise, the returned display modes are allowed to have a bit depth

DisplayMode.BIT_DEPTH_MULTI

if it is indeterminate or if multiple
bit depths are supported.

**Returns:**
- all of the display modes available for this graphics device.

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public int getAvailableAcceleratedMemory()

This method returns the number of bytes available in
accelerated memory on this device.
Some images are created or cached
in accelerated memory on a first-come,
first-served basis. On some operating systems,
this memory is a finite resource. Calling this method
and scheduling the creation and flushing of images carefully may
enable applications to make the most efficient use of
that finite resource.

Note that the number returned is a snapshot of how much
memory is available; some images may still have problems
being allocated into that memory. For example, depending
on operating system, driver, memory configuration, and
thread situations, the full extent of the size reported
may not be available for a given image. There are further
inquiry methods on the

ImageCapabilities

object
associated with a VolatileImage that can be used to determine
whether a particular VolatileImage has been created in accelerated
memory.

**Returns:**
- number of bytes available in accelerated memory.
A negative return value indicates that the amount of accelerated memory
on this GraphicsDevice is indeterminate.

**See Also:**
- Image.flush()

,

ImageCapabilities.isAccelerated()

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public boolean isWindowTranslucencySupported​(
GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency
translucencyKind)

Returns whether the given level of translucency is supported by
this graphics device.

**Parameters:**
- translucencyKind

- a kind of translucency support

**Returns:**
- whether the given translucency kind is supported

**Since:**
- 1.7

.

Exclusive mode implies:

- Windows cannot overlap the full-screen window. All other application
windows will always appear beneath the full-screen window in the Z-order.

There can be only one full-screen window on a device at any time,
so calling this method while there is an existing full-screen Window
will cause the existing full-screen window to
return to windowed mode.

Input method windows are disabled. It is advisable to call

Component.enableInputMethods(false)

to make a component
a non-client of the input method framework.

The simulated full-screen mode places and resizes the window to the maximum
possible visible area of the screen. However, the native windowing system
may modify the requested geometry-related data, so that the

Window

object
is placed and sized in a way that corresponds closely to the desktop settings.

When entering full-screen mode, if the window to be used as a
full-screen window is not visible, this method will make it visible.
It will remain visible when returning to windowed mode.

When entering full-screen mode, all the translucency effects are reset for
the window. Its shape is set to

null

, the opacity value is set to
1.0f, and the background color alpha is set to 255 (completely opaque).
These values are not restored when returning to windowed mode.

It is unspecified and platform-dependent how decorated windows operate
in full-screen mode. For this reason, it is recommended to turn off
the decorations in a

Frame

or

Dialog

object by using the

setUndecorated

method.

When returning to windowed mode from an exclusive full-screen window,
any display changes made by calling

setDisplayMode

are
automatically restored to their original state.

**Parameters:** w

- a window to use as the full-screen window;

null

if returning to windowed mode. Some platforms expect the
fullscreen window to be a top-level component (i.e., a

Frame

);
therefore it is preferable to use a

Frame

here rather than a

Window

.

true

and may
require first entering full-screen exclusive mode using

setFullScreenWindow(java.awt.Window)

providing that full-screen exclusive mode is
supported (i.e.,

isFullScreenSupported()

returns

true

).

The display mode must be one of the display modes returned by

getDisplayModes()

, with one exception: passing a display mode
with

DisplayMode.REFRESH_RATE_UNKNOWN

refresh rate will result in
selecting a display mode from the list of available display modes with
matching width, height and bit depth.
However, passing a display mode with

DisplayMode.BIT_DEPTH_MULTI

for bit depth is only allowed if such mode exists in the list returned by

getDisplayModes()

.

Example code:

```java
Frame frame;
DisplayMode newDisplayMode;
GraphicsDevice gd;
// create a Frame, select desired DisplayMode from the list of modes
// returned by gd.getDisplayModes() ...

if (gd.isFullScreenSupported()) {
gd.setFullScreenWindow(frame);

- getAvailableAcceleratedMemory

```java
public int getAvailableAcceleratedMemory()
```

This method returns the number of bytes available in
accelerated memory on this device.
Some images are created or cached
in accelerated memory on a first-come,
first-served basis. On some operating systems,
this memory is a finite resource. Calling this method
and scheduling the creation and flushing of images carefully may
enable applications to make the most efficient use of
that finite resource.

Note that the number returned is a snapshot of how much
memory is available; some images may still have problems
being allocated into that memory. For example, depending
on operating system, driver, memory configuration, and
thread situations, the full extent of the size reported
may not be available for a given image. There are further
inquiry methods on the

ImageCapabilities

object
associated with a VolatileImage that can be used to determine
whether a particular VolatileImage has been created in accelerated
memory.

**Returns:** number of bytes available in accelerated memory.
A negative return value indicates that the amount of accelerated memory
on this GraphicsDevice is indeterminate.

- Windows cannot overlap the full-screen window. All other application
windows will always appear beneath the full-screen window in the Z-order.

There can be only one full-screen window on a device at any time,
so calling this method while there is an existing full-screen Window
will cause the existing full-screen window to
return to windowed mode.

Input method windows are disabled. It is advisable to call

Component.enableInputMethods(false)

to make a component
a non-client of the input method framework.

The simulated full-screen mode places and resizes the window to the maximum
possible visible area of the screen. However, the native windowing system
may modify the requested geometry-related data, so that the

Window

object
is placed and sized in a way that corresponds closely to the desktop settings.

When entering full-screen mode, if the window to be used as a
full-screen window is not visible, this method will make it visible.
It will remain visible when returning to windowed mode.

When entering full-screen mode, all the translucency effects are reset for
the window. Its shape is set to

null

, the opacity value is set to
1.0f, and the background color alpha is set to 255 (completely opaque).
These values are not restored when returning to windowed mode.

It is unspecified and platform-dependent how decorated windows operate
in full-screen mode. For this reason, it is recommended to turn off
the decorations in a

Frame

or

Dialog

object by using the

setUndecorated

method.

When returning to windowed mode from an exclusive full-screen window,
any display changes made by calling

setDisplayMode

are
automatically restored to their original state.

getAvailableAcceleratedMemory

```java
public int getAvailableAcceleratedMemory()
```

This method returns the number of bytes available in
accelerated memory on this device.
Some images are created or cached
in accelerated memory on a first-come,
first-served basis. On some operating systems,
this memory is a finite resource. Calling this method
and scheduling the creation and flushing of images carefully may
enable applications to make the most efficient use of
that finite resource.

Note that the number returned is a snapshot of how much
memory is available; some images may still have problems
being allocated into that memory. For example, depending
on operating system, driver, memory configuration, and
thread situations, the full extent of the size reported
may not be available for a given image. There are further
inquiry methods on the

ImageCapabilities

object
associated with a VolatileImage that can be used to determine
whether a particular VolatileImage has been created in accelerated
memory.

**Returns:** number of bytes available in accelerated memory.
A negative return value indicates that the amount of accelerated memory
on this GraphicsDevice is indeterminate.
**Since:** 1.4
