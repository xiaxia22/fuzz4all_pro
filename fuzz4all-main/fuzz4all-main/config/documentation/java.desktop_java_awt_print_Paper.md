# Class Paper

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\print\Paper.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Paper

extends
Object

implements
Cloneable
```

The

Paper

class describes the physical characteristics of
a piece of paper.

When creating a

Paper

object, it is the application's
responsibility to ensure that the paper size and the imageable area
are compatible. For example, if the paper size is changed from
11 x 17 to 8.5 x 11, the application might need to reduce the
imageable area so that whatever is printed fits on the page.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Cloneable
