# Interface MethodHandleInfo

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\invoke\MethodHandleInfo.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
MethodHandleInfo
```

A symbolic reference obtained by cracking a direct method handle
into its consitutent symbolic parts.
To crack a direct method handle, call

Lookup.revealDirect

.

Direct Method Handles

A

direct method handle

represents a method, constructor, or field without
any intervening argument bindings or other transformations.
The method, constructor, or field referred to by a direct method handle is called
its

underlying member

.
Direct method handles may be obtained in any of these ways:

- By executing an

ldc

instruction on a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

constant.
(See the Java Virtual Machine Specification, sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.)

By calling one of the

Lookup Factory Methods

,
such as

Lookup.findVirtual

,
to resolve a symbolic reference into a method handle.
A symbolic reference consists of a class, name string, and type.

By calling the factory method

Lookup.unreflect

or

Lookup.unreflectSpecial

to convert a

Method

into a method handle.

By calling the factory method

Lookup.unreflectConstructor

to convert a

Constructor

into a method handle.

By calling the factory method

Lookup.unreflectGetter

or

Lookup.unreflectSetter

to convert a

Field

into a method handle.

Restrictions on Cracking

Given a suitable

Lookup

object, it is possible to crack any direct method handle
to recover a symbolic reference for the underlying method, constructor, or field.
Cracking must be done via a

Lookup

object equivalent to that which created
the target method handle, or which has enough access permissions to recreate
an equivalent method handle.

If the underlying method is

caller sensitive

,
the direct method handle will have been "bound" to a particular caller class, the

lookup class

of the lookup object used to create it.
Cracking this method handle with a different lookup class will fail
even if the underlying method is public (like

Class.forName

).

The requirement of lookup object matching provides a "fast fail" behavior
for programs which may otherwise trust erroneous revelation of a method
handle with symbolic information (or caller binding) from an unexpected scope.
Use

MethodHandles.reflectAs(java.lang.Class<T>, java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle)

to override this limitation.

Reference kinds

The

Lookup Factory Methods

correspond to all major use cases for methods, constructors, and fields.
These use cases may be distinguished using small integers as follows:

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### int getReferenceKind()

Returns the reference kind of the cracked method handle, which in turn
determines whether the method handle's underlying member was a constructor, method, or field.
See the

table above

for definitions.

**Returns:**
- the integer code for the kind of reference used to access the underlying member

---

#### Class
<?> getDeclaringClass()

Returns the class in which the cracked method handle's underlying member was defined.

**Returns:**
- the declaring class of the underlying member

---

#### String
getName()

Returns the name of the cracked method handle's underlying member.
This is

"<init>"

if the underlying member was a constructor,
else it is a simple method name or field name.

**Returns:**
- the simple name of the underlying member

---

#### MethodType
getMethodType()

Returns the nominal type of the cracked symbolic reference, expressed as a method type.
If the reference is to a constructor, the return type will be

void

.
If it is to a non-static method, the method type will not mention the

this

parameter.
If it is to a field and the requested access is to read the field,
the method type will have no parameters and return the field type.
If it is to a field and the requested access is to write the field,
the method type will have one parameter of the field type and return

void

.

Note that original direct method handle may include a leading

this

parameter,
or (in the case of a constructor) will replace the

void

return type
with the constructed class.
The nominal type does not include any

this

parameter,
and (in the case of a constructor) will return

void

.

**Returns:**
- the type of the underlying member, expressed as a method type

---

#### <T extends
Member
> T reflectAs​(
Class
<T> expected,

MethodHandles.Lookup
lookup)

Reflects the underlying member as a method, constructor, or field object.
If the underlying member is public, it is reflected as if by

getMethod

,

getConstructor

, or

getField

.
Otherwise, it is reflected as if by

getDeclaredMethod

,

getDeclaredConstructor

, or

getDeclaredField

.
The underlying member must be accessible to the given lookup object.

**Parameters:**
- expected

- a class object representing the desired result type

T
- lookup

- the lookup object that created this MethodHandleInfo, or one with equivalent access privileges

**Returns:**
- a reference to the method, constructor, or field object

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the member is not of the expected type
- NullPointerException

- if either argument is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the underlying member is not accessible to the given lookup object

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the desired type of the result, either

Member

or a subtype

---

#### int getModifiers()

Returns the access modifiers of the underlying member.

**Returns:**
- the Java language modifiers for underlying member,
or -1 if the member cannot be accessed

**See Also:**
- Modifier

,

reflectAs(java.lang.Class<T>, java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup)

---

#### default boolean isVarArgs()

Determines if the underlying member was a variable arity method or constructor.
Such members are represented by method handles that are varargs collectors.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the underlying member was declared with variable arity.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This produces a result equivalent to:

```java
getReferenceKind() >= REF_invokeVirtual && Modifier.isTransient(getModifiers())
```

---

#### static
String
referenceKindToString​(int referenceKind)

Returns the descriptive name of the given reference kind,
as defined in the

table above

.
The conventional prefix "REF_" is omitted.

**Parameters:**
- referenceKind

- an integer code for a kind of reference used to access a class member

**Returns:**
- a mixed-case string such as

"getField"

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the argument is not a valid

reference kind number

---

#### static
String
toString​(int kind,

Class
<?> defc,

String
name,

MethodType
type)

Returns a string representation for a

MethodHandleInfo

,
given the four parts of its symbolic reference.
This is defined to be of the form

"RK C.N:MT"

, where

RK

is the

reference kind string

for

kind

,

C

is the

name

of

defc

N

is the

name

, and

MT

is the

type

.
These four values may be obtained from the

reference kind

,

declaring class

,

member name

,
and

method type

of a

MethodHandleInfo

object.

**Parameters:**
- kind

- the

reference kind

part of the symbolic reference
- defc

- the

declaring class

part of the symbolic reference
- name

- the

member name

part of the symbolic reference
- type

- the

method type

part of the symbolic reference

**Returns:**
- a string of the form

"RK C.N:MT"

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the first argument is not a valid

reference kind number
- NullPointerException

- if any reference argument is

null

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This produces a result equivalent to:

```java
String.format("%s %s.%s:%s", referenceKindToString(kind), defc.getName(), name, type)
```
