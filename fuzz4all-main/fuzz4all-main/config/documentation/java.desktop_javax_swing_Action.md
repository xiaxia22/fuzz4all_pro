# Interface Action

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\Action.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Action

extends
ActionListener
```

The

Action

interface provides a useful extension to the

ActionListener

interface in cases where the same functionality may be accessed by
several controls.

In addition to the

actionPerformed

method defined by the

ActionListener

interface, this interface allows the
application to define, in a single place:

- One or more text strings that describe the function. These strings
can be used, for example, to display the flyover text for a button
or to set the text in a menu item.

One or more icons that depict the function. These icons can be used
for the images in a menu control, or for composite entries in a more
sophisticated user interface.

The enabled/disabled state of the functionality. Instead of having
to separately disable the menu item and the toolbar button, the
application can disable the function that implements this interface.
All components which are registered as listeners for the state change
then know to disable event generation for that item and to modify the
display accordingly.

This interface can be added to an existing class or used to create an
adapter (typically, by subclassing

AbstractAction

).
The

Action

object
can then be added to multiple

Action

-aware containers
and connected to

Action

-capable
components. The GUI controls can then be activated or
deactivated all at once by invoking the

Action

object's

setEnabled

method.

Note that

Action

implementations tend to be more expensive
in terms of storage than a typical

ActionListener

,
which does not offer the benefits of centralized control of
functionality and broadcast of property changes. For this reason,
you should take care to only use

Action

s where their benefits
are desired, and use simple

ActionListener

s elsewhere.

Swing Components Supporting

Action

Many of Swing's components have an

Action

property. When
an

Action

is set on a component, the following things
happen:

- The

Action

is added as an

ActionListener

to
the component.

The component configures some of its properties to match the

Action

.

The component installs a

PropertyChangeListener

on the

Action

so that the component can change its properties
to reflect changes in the

Action

's properties.

The following table describes the properties used by

Swing

components that support

Actions

.
In the table,

button

refers to any

AbstractButton

subclass, which includes not only

JButton

but also classes such as

JMenuItem

. Unless otherwise stated, a

null

property value in an

Action

(or a

Action

that is

null

) results in the
button's corresponding property being set to

null

.

If you do not want the text of the button to mirror that of the

Action

, set the property

hideActionText

to

.
If

hideActionText

is

true

, setting the

Action

changes the text of the button to

null

and any changes to

NAME

are ignored.

hideActionText

is useful for tool bar
buttons that typically only show an

Icon

.

JToolBar.add(Action)

sets the property to

true

if the

Action

has a non-

null

value for

LARGE_ICON_KEY

or

SMALL_ICON

.

displayedMnemonicIndex

All buttons

DISPLAYED_MNEMONIC_INDEX_KEY

If the value of

DISPLAYED_MNEMONIC_INDEX_KEY

is beyond the
bounds of the text, it is ignored. When

setAction

is called, if
the value from the

Action

is

null

, the displayed mnemonic
index is not updated. In any subsequent changes to

DISPLAYED_MNEMONIC_INDEX_KEY

,

null

is treated as -1.

All buttons except of

JCheckBox

,

JToggleButton

and

JRadioButton

.

either

LARGE_ICON_KEY

or

SMALL_ICON

The

JMenuItem

subclasses only use

SMALL_ICON

. All
other buttons will use

LARGE_ICON_KEY

; if the value is

null

they use

SMALL_ICON

.

subclasses, with the exception of

JMenu

.

ACCELERATOR_KEY

selected

JToggleButton

,

JCheckBox

,

JRadioButton

,

JCheckBoxMenuItem

and

JRadioButtonMenuItem

SELECTED_KEY

Components that honor this property only use the value if it is

non-null

. For example, if you set an

Action

that has a

null

value for

SELECTED_KEY

on a

JToggleButton

,
the

JToggleButton

will not update it's selected state in any way.
Similarly, any time the

JToggleButton

's selected state changes it
will only set the value back on the

Action

if the

Action

has a

non-null

value for

SELECTED_KEY

.

Components that honor this property keep their selected state in sync with
this property. When the same

Action

is used with multiple
components, all the components keep their selected state in sync with this
property. Mutually exclusive buttons, such as

JToggleButton

s in a

ButtonGroup

, force only one of the buttons to be selected. As
such, do not use the same

Action

that defines a value for the

SELECTED_KEY

property with multiple mutually exclusive buttons.

JPopupMenu

,

JToolBar

and

JMenu

all provide convenience methods for creating a component and setting the

Action

on the corresponding component. Refer to each of
these classes for more information.

Action

uses

PropertyChangeListener

to
inform listeners the

Action

has changed. The beans
specification indicates that a

null

property name can
be used to indicate multiple values have changed. By default Swing
components that take an

Action

do not handle such a
change. To indicate that Swing should treat

null

according to the beans specification set the system property

swing.actions.reconfigureOnNull

to the

String

value

true

.

String
DEFAULT

Not currently used.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final
String
NAME

The key used for storing the

String

name
for the action, used for a menu or button.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final
String
SHORT_DESCRIPTION

The key used for storing a short

String

description for the action, used for tooltip text.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final
String
LONG_DESCRIPTION

The key used for storing a longer

String

description for the action, could be used for context-sensitive help.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final
String
SMALL_ICON

The key used for storing a small

Icon

, such
as

ImageIcon

. This is typically used with
menus such as

JMenuItem

.

If the same

Action

is used with menus and buttons you'll
typically specify both a

SMALL_ICON

and a

LARGE_ICON_KEY

. The menu will use the

SMALL_ICON

and the button will use the

LARGE_ICON_KEY

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final
String
ACTION_COMMAND_KEY

The key used to determine the command

String

for the

ActionEvent

that will be created when an

Action

is going to be notified as the result of
residing in a

Keymap

associated with a

JComponent

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### static final
String
ACCELERATOR_KEY

The key used for storing a

KeyStroke

to be used as the
accelerator for the action.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### static final
String
MNEMONIC_KEY

The key used for storing an

Integer

that corresponds to
one of the

KeyEvent

key codes. The value is
commonly used to specify a mnemonic. For example:

myAction.putValue(Action.MNEMONIC_KEY, KeyEvent.VK_A)

sets the mnemonic of

myAction

to 'a', while

myAction.putValue(Action.MNEMONIC_KEY, KeyEvent.getExtendedKeyCodeForChar('ф'))

sets the mnemonic of

myAction

to Cyrillic letter "Ef".

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### static final
String
SELECTED_KEY

The key used for storing a

Boolean

that corresponds
to the selected state. This is typically used only for components
that have a meaningful selection state. For example,

JRadioButton

and

JCheckBox

make use of
this but instances of

JMenu

don't.

This property differs from the others in that it is both read
by the component and set by the component. For example,
if an

Action

is attached to a

JCheckBox

the selected state of the

JCheckBox

will be set from
that of the

Action

. If the user clicks on the

JCheckBox

the selected state of the

JCheckBox

and

the

Action

will

both

be updated.

Note: the value of this field is prefixed with 'Swing' to
avoid possible collisions with existing

Actions

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### static final
String
DISPLAYED_MNEMONIC_INDEX_KEY

The key used for storing an

Integer

that corresponds
to the index in the text (identified by the

NAME

property) that the decoration for a mnemonic should be rendered at. If
the value of this property is greater than or equal to the length of
the text, it will treated as -1.

Note: the value of this field is prefixed with 'Swing' to
avoid possible collisions with existing

Actions

.

#### static final
String
LARGE_ICON_KEY

The key used for storing an

Icon

. This is typically
used by buttons, such as

JButton

and

JToggleButton

.

If the same

Action

is used with menus and buttons you'll
typically specify both a

SMALL_ICON

and a

LARGE_ICON_KEY

. The menu will use the

SMALL_ICON

and the button the

LARGE_ICON_KEY

.

Note: the value of this field is prefixed with 'Swing' to
avoid possible collisions with existing

Actions

.

Action

property. When
an

Action

is set on a component, the following things
happen:

- The

Action

is added as an

ActionListener

to
the component.

The component configures some of its properties to match the

Action

.

The component installs a

PropertyChangeListener

on the

Action

so that the component can change its properties
to reflect changes in the

Action

's properties.

The following table describes the properties used by

Swing

components that support

Actions

.
In the table,

button

refers to any

AbstractButton

subclass, which includes not only

JButton

but also classes such as

JMenuItem

. Unless otherwise stated, a

null

property value in an

Action

(or a

Action

that is

null

) results in the
button's corresponding property being set to

null

.

changes the text of the button to

hideActionText

is useful for tool bar
buttons that typically only show an

is treated as -1.

SELECTED_KEY

Components that honor this property only use the value if it is

non-null

. For example, if you set an

Action

that has a

null

value for

SELECTED_KEY

on a

JToggleButton

,
the

JToggleButton

will not update it's selected state in any way.
Similarly, any time the

JToggleButton

's selected state changes it
will only set the value back on the

Action

if the

Action

has a

non-null

value for

SELECTED_KEY

.

Components that honor this property keep their selected state in sync with
this property. When the same

Action

is used with multiple
components, all the components keep their selected state in sync with this
property. Mutually exclusive buttons, such as

JToggleButton

s in a

ButtonGroup

, force only one of the buttons to be selected. As
such, do not use the same

Action

that defines a value for the

SELECTED_KEY

property with multiple mutually exclusive buttons.

JPopupMenu

,

JToolBar

and

JMenu

all provide convenience methods for creating a component and setting the

Action

on the corresponding component. Refer to each of
these classes for more information.

Action

uses

PropertyChangeListener

to
inform listeners the

Action

has changed. The beans
specification indicates that a

null

property name can
be used to indicate multiple values have changed. By default Swing
components that take an

Action

do not handle such a
change. To indicate that Swing should treat

null

according to the beans specification set the system property

swing.actions.reconfigureOnNull

to the

String

value

true

.

One or more text strings that describe the function. These strings
can be used, for example, to display the flyover text for a button
or to set the text in a menu item.

One or more icons that depict the function. These icons can be used
for the images in a menu control, or for composite entries in a more
sophisticated user interface.

The enabled/disabled state of the functionality. Instead of having
to separately disable the menu item and the toolbar button, the
application can disable the function that implements this interface.
All components which are registered as listeners for the state change
then know to disable event generation for that item and to modify the
display accordingly.

This interface can be added to an existing class or used to create an
adapter (typically, by subclassing

AbstractAction

).
The

Action

object
can then be added to multiple

Action

-aware containers
and connected to

Action

-capable
components. The GUI controls can then be activated or
deactivated all at once by invoking the

Action

object's

setEnabled

method.

Note that

Action

implementations tend to be more expensive
in terms of storage than a typical

ActionListener

,
which does not offer the benefits of centralized control of
functionality and broadcast of property changes. For this reason,
you should take care to only use

Action

s where their benefits
are desired, and use simple

ActionListener

s elsewhere.
