### Method Details

#### MethodHandle
asType​(
MethodHandle
handle,

MethodType
fromType)

Similar to

MethodHandle.asType(MethodType)

except it also hooks
in method handles produced by all available

GuardingTypeConverterFactory

implementations, providing for
language-specific type coercing of parameters. It will apply

MethodHandle.asType(MethodType)

for all primitive-to-primitive,
wrapper-to-primitive, primitive-to-wrapper conversions as well as for all
upcasts. For all other conversions, it'll insert

MethodHandles.filterArguments(MethodHandle, int, MethodHandle...)

with composite filters provided by

GuardingTypeConverterFactory

implementations.

**Parameters:**
- handle

- target method handle
- fromType

- the types of source arguments

**Returns:**
- a method handle that is a suitable combination of

MethodHandle.asType(MethodType)

,

MethodHandles.filterArguments(MethodHandle, int, MethodHandle...)

,
and

MethodHandles.filterReturnValue(MethodHandle, MethodHandle)

with

GuardingTypeConverterFactory

-produced type converters as
filters.

---

#### default
MethodHandle
asTypeLosslessReturn​(
MethodHandle
handle,

MethodType
fromType)

Similar to

asType(MethodHandle, MethodType)

except it treats
return value type conversion specially. It only converts the return type
of the method handle when it can be done using a conversion that loses
neither precision nor magnitude, otherwise it leaves it unchanged. These
are the only return value conversions that should be performed by
individual language-specific linkers, and

pre-link transformer of the dynamic linker

should implement the strategy
for dealing with potentially lossy return type conversions in a manner
specific to the language runtime where the call site is located.

**Parameters:**
- handle

- target method handle
- fromType

- the types of source arguments

**Returns:**
- a method handle that is a suitable combination of

MethodHandle.asType(MethodType)

, and

MethodHandles.filterArguments(MethodHandle, int, MethodHandle...)

with

GuardingTypeConverterFactory

-produced type converters as filters.

---

#### MethodHandle
getTypeConverter​(
Class
<?> sourceType,

Class
<?> targetType)

Given a source and target type, returns a method handle that converts
between them. Never returns null; in worst case it will return an
identity conversion (that might fail for some values at runtime). You
rarely need to use this method directly and should mostly rely on

asType(MethodHandle, MethodType)

instead. This method is needed
when you need to reuse existing type conversion machinery outside the
context of processing a link request.

**Parameters:**
- sourceType

- the type to convert from
- targetType

- the type to convert to

**Returns:**
- a method handle performing the conversion.

---

#### boolean canConvert​(
Class
<?> from,

Class
<?> to)

Returns true if there might exist a conversion between the requested
types (either an automatic JVM conversion, or one provided by any
available

GuardingTypeConverterFactory

), or false if there
definitely does not exist a conversion between the requested types. Note
that returning true does not guarantee that the conversion will succeed
at runtime for all values (especially if the "from" or "to" types are
sufficiently generic), but returning false guarantees that it would fail.

**Parameters:**
- from

- the source type for the conversion
- to

- the target type for the conversion

**Returns:**
- true if there can be a conversion, false if there can not.

---

#### GuardedInvocation
getGuardedInvocation​(
LinkRequest
linkRequest)
throws
Exception

Creates a guarded invocation delegating back to the

DynamicLinker

that exposes this linker services object. The dynamic linker will then
itself delegate the linking to all of its managed

GuardingDynamicLinker

s including potentially this one if no
linker responds earlier, so beware of infinite recursion. You'll
typically craft the link request so that it will be different than the
one you are currently trying to link.

**Parameters:**
- linkRequest

- a request for linking the invocation

**Returns:**
- a guarded invocation linked by some of the guarding dynamic
linkers managed by the top-level dynamic linker. Can be null if no
available linker is able to link the invocation. You will typically use
the elements of the returned invocation to compose your own invocation.

**Throws:**
- Exception

- in case the top-level linker throws an exception

---

#### ConversionComparator.Comparison
compareConversion​(
Class
<?> sourceType,

Class
<?> targetType1,

Class
<?> targetType2)

Determines which of the two type conversions from a source type to the
two target types is preferred. This is used for dynamic overloaded method
resolution. If the source type is convertible to exactly one target type
with a method invocation conversion, it is chosen, otherwise available

ConversionComparator

s are consulted.

**Parameters:**
- sourceType

- the source type.
- targetType1

- one potential target type
- targetType2

- another potential target type.

**Returns:**
- one of Comparison constants that establish which – if any
– of the target types is preferable for the conversion.

---

#### MethodHandle
filterInternalObjects​(
MethodHandle
target)

Modifies the method handle so that any parameters that can receive
potentially internal language runtime objects will have a filter added on
them to prevent them from escaping, potentially by wrapping them. It can
also potentially add an unwrapping filter to the return value. Basically
transforms the method handle using the transformer configured by

DynamicLinkerFactory.setInternalObjectsFilter(MethodHandleTransformer)

.

**Parameters:**
- target

- the target method handle

**Returns:**
- a method handle with parameters and/or return type potentially
filtered for wrapping and unwrapping.

---

#### <T> T getWithLookup​(
Supplier
<T> operation,

SecureLookupSupplier
lookupSupplier)

Executes an operation within the context of a particular

MethodHandles.Lookup

lookup object. Normally, methods on

LinkerServices

are invoked as part of the linking mechanism in
which case Dynalink internally maintains a per-thread current lookup
(the one belonging to the descriptor of the call site being linked). This
lookup can be retrieved by any

GuardingTypeConverterFactory

involved in linking if it needs to generate lookup-sensitive converters.
However, linker services' methods can be invoked outside the linking
process too when implementing invocation-time dispatch schemes, invoking
conversions at runtime, etc. If it becomes necessary to use any type
converter in this situation, and it needs a lookup, it will normally only
get

MethodHandles.publicLookup()

as the thread is not engaged in
a linking operation. If there is a way to meaningfully associate the
operation to the context of some caller class, consider performing it
within an invocation of this method and passing a full-strength lookup
for that class, as it will associate that lookup with the current thread
for the duration of the operation. Note that since you are passing a

SecureLookupSupplier

, any invoked type converter factories will
still need to hold the necessary runtime permission to be able to get the
lookup should they need it.

**Parameters:**
- operation

- the operation to execute in context of the specified lookup.
- lookupSupplier

- secure supplier of the lookup

**Returns:**
- the return value of the action

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if either action or lookupSupplier are null.

**See Also:**
- GuardingTypeConverterFactory.convertToType(Class, Class, Supplier)

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the type of the return value provided by the passed-in supplier.

**Returns:** a method handle that is a suitable combination of

MethodHandle.asType(MethodType)

, and

MethodHandles.filterArguments(MethodHandle, int, MethodHandle...)

with

GuardingTypeConverterFactory

-produced type converters as filters.

#### asTypeLosslessReturn

default

MethodHandle

asTypeLosslessReturn​(

MethodHandle

handle,

MethodType

fromType)

Similar to

asType(MethodHandle, MethodType)

except it treats
return value type conversion specially. It only converts the return type
of the method handle when it can be done using a conversion that loses
neither precision nor magnitude, otherwise it leaves it unchanged. These
are the only return value conversions that should be performed by
individual language-specific linkers, and

pre-link transformer of the dynamic linker

should implement the strategy
for dealing with potentially lossy return type conversions in a manner
specific to the language runtime where the call site is located.

getTypeConverter

```java
MethodHandle
getTypeConverter​(
Class
<?> sourceType,

Class
<?> targetType)
```

Given a source and target type, returns a method handle that converts
between them. Never returns null; in worst case it will return an
identity conversion (that might fail for some values at runtime). You
rarely need to use this method directly and should mostly rely on

asType(MethodHandle, MethodType)

instead. This method is needed
when you need to reuse existing type conversion machinery outside the
context of processing a link request.

**Parameters:** sourceType

- the type to convert from
**Parameters:** targetType

- the type to convert to
**Returns:** a method handle performing the conversion.

canConvert

```java
boolean canConvert​(
Class
<?> from,

Class
<?> to)
```

Returns true if there might exist a conversion between the requested
types (either an automatic JVM conversion, or one provided by any
available

GuardingTypeConverterFactory

), or false if there
definitely does not exist a conversion between the requested types. Note
that returning true does not guarantee that the conversion will succeed
at runtime for all values (especially if the "from" or "to" types are
sufficiently generic), but returning false guarantees that it would fail.

**Parameters:** from

- the source type for the conversion
**Parameters:** to

- the target type for the conversion
**Returns:** true if there can be a conversion, false if there can not.

getGuardedInvocation

```java
GuardedInvocation
getGuardedInvocation​(
LinkRequest
linkRequest)
throws
Exception
```

Creates a guarded invocation delegating back to the

DynamicLinker

that exposes this linker services object. The dynamic linker will then
itself delegate the linking to all of its managed

GuardingDynamicLinker

s including potentially this one if no
linker responds earlier, so beware of infinite recursion. You'll
typically craft the link request so that it will be different than the
one you are currently trying to link.

**Parameters:** linkRequest

- a request for linking the invocation
**Returns:** a guarded invocation linked by some of the guarding dynamic
linkers managed by the top-level dynamic linker. Can be null if no
available linker is able to link the invocation. You will typically use
the elements of the returned invocation to compose your own invocation.
**Throws:** Exception

- in case the top-level linker throws an exception

compareConversion

```java
ConversionComparator.Comparison
compareConversion​(
Class
<?> sourceType,

Class
<?> targetType1,

Class
<?> targetType2)
```

Determines which of the two type conversions from a source type to the
two target types is preferred. This is used for dynamic overloaded method
resolution. If the source type is convertible to exactly one target type
with a method invocation conversion, it is chosen, otherwise available

ConversionComparator

s are consulted.

**Parameters:** sourceType

- the source type.
**Parameters:** targetType1

- one potential target type
**Parameters:** targetType2

- another potential target type.
**Returns:** one of Comparison constants that establish which – if any
– of the target types is preferable for the conversion.

filterInternalObjects

```java
MethodHandle
filterInternalObjects​(
MethodHandle
target)
```

Modifies the method handle so that any parameters that can receive
potentially internal language runtime objects will have a filter added on
them to prevent them from escaping, potentially by wrapping them. It can
also potentially add an unwrapping filter to the return value. Basically
transforms the method handle using the transformer configured by

DynamicLinkerFactory.setInternalObjectsFilter(MethodHandleTransformer)

.

**Parameters:** target

- the target method handle
**Returns:** a method handle with parameters and/or return type potentially
filtered for wrapping and unwrapping.

getWithLookup

```java
<T> T getWithLookup​(
Supplier
<T> operation,

SecureLookupSupplier
lookupSupplier)
```

Executes an operation within the context of a particular

MethodHandles.Lookup

lookup object. Normally, methods on

LinkerServices

are invoked as part of the linking mechanism in
which case Dynalink internally maintains a per-thread current lookup
(the one belonging to the descriptor of the call site being linked). This
lookup can be retrieved by any

GuardingTypeConverterFactory

involved in linking if it needs to generate lookup-sensitive converters.
However, linker services' methods can be invoked outside the linking
process too when implementing invocation-time dispatch schemes, invoking
conversions at runtime, etc. If it becomes necessary to use any type
converter in this situation, and it needs a lookup, it will normally only
get

MethodHandles.publicLookup()

as the thread is not engaged in
a linking operation. If there is a way to meaningfully associate the
operation to the context of some caller class, consider performing it
within an invocation of this method and passing a full-strength lookup
for that class, as it will associate that lookup with the current thread
for the duration of the operation. Note that since you are passing a

SecureLookupSupplier

, any invoked type converter factories will
still need to hold the necessary runtime permission to be able to get the
lookup should they need it.

**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the return value provided by the passed-in supplier.
**Parameters:** operation

- the operation to execute in context of the specified lookup.
**Parameters:** lookupSupplier

- secure supplier of the lookup
**Returns:** the return value of the action
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if either action or lookupSupplier are null.
**See Also:** GuardingTypeConverterFactory.convertToType(Class, Class, Supplier)
