# Class ReplicateScaleFilter

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\ReplicateScaleFilter.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ReplicateScaleFilter

extends
ImageFilter
```

An ImageFilter class for scaling images using the simplest algorithm.
This class extends the basic ImageFilter Class to scale an existing
image and provide a source for a new image containing the resampled
image. The pixels in the source image are sampled to produce pixels
for an image of the specified size by replicating rows and columns of
pixels to scale up or omitting rows and columns of pixels to scale
down.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource
object to produce scaled versions of existing images. Due to
implementation dependencies, there may be differences in pixel values
of an image filtered on different platforms.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** ImageConsumer

,

Cloneable

int height)

Constructs a ReplicateScaleFilter that scales the pixels from
its source Image as specified by the width and height parameters.

**Parameters:**

#### Method Detail

setProperties

```java
public void setProperties​(
Hashtable
<?,​?> props)
```

Passes along the properties from the source object after adding a
property indicating the scale applied.
This method invokes

super.setProperties

,
which might result in additional properties being added.

Note: This method is intended to be called by the

ImageProducer

of the

Image

whose pixels
are being filtered. Developers using
this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
this method directly since that operation could interfere
with the filtering operation.

**Specified by:** setProperties

in interface

ImageConsumer
**Overrides:** setProperties

in class

ImageFilter
**Parameters:** props

- the properties from the source object

setDimensions

```java

Override the dimensions of the source image and pass the dimensions
of the new scaled size to the ImageConsumer.

**Parameters:** w

- the width of the source image

setPixels

```java
public void setPixels​(int x,
int y,
int w,
int h,

ColorModel
model,
byte[] pixels,
int off,
int scansize)
```

Choose which rows and columns of the delivered byte pixels are
needed for the destination scaled image and pass through just
those rows and columns that are needed, replicated as necessary.

ImageProducer

of the

Image

whose pixels

**Parameters:** x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
area of pixels to be set
**Parameters:** y

area of pixels to be set
**Parameters:** w

- the width of the area of pixels
**Parameters:** h

- the height of the area of pixels
**Parameters:** model

- the specified

ColorModel
**Parameters:** pixels

- the array of pixels
