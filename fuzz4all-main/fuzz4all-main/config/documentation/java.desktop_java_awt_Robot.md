# Class Robot

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\Robot.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Robot

extends
Object
```

This class is used to generate native system input events
for the purposes of test automation, self-running demos, and
other applications where control of the mouse and keyboard
is needed. The primary purpose of Robot is to facilitate
automated testing of Java platform implementations.

Using the class to generate input events differs from posting
events to the AWT event queue or AWT components in that the
events are generated in the platform's native input
queue. For example,

Robot.mouseMove

will actually move
the mouse cursor instead of just generating mouse move events.

Note that some platforms require special privileges or extensions
to access low-level input control. If the current platform configuration
does not allow input control, an

AWTException

will be thrown
when trying to construct Robot objects. For example, X-Window systems
will throw the exception if the XTEST 2.2 standard extension is not supported
(or not enabled) by the X server.

Applications that use Robot for purposes other than self-testing should
handle these error conditions gracefully.

Platforms and desktop environments may impose restrictions or limitations
on the access required to implement all functionality in the Robot class.
For example:

- preventing access to the contents of any part of a desktop
or Window on the desktop that is not owned by the running application.
- treating window decorations as non-owned content.
- ignoring or limiting specific requests to manipulate windows.
- ignoring or limiting specific requests for Robot generated (synthesized)
events related to keyboard and mouse etc.
- requiring specific or global permissions to any access to window
contents, even application owned content,or to perform even limited
synthesizing of events.

The Robot API specification requires that approvals for these be granted
for full operation.
If they are not granted, the API will be degraded as discussed here.
Relevant specific API methods may document more specific limitations
and requirements.
Depending on the policies of the desktop environment,
the approvals mentioned above may:

- be required every time
- or persistent for the lifetime of an application,
- or persistent across multiple user desktop sessions
- be fine-grained permissions
- be associated with a specific binary application,
or a class of binary applications.

When such approvals need to given interactively, it may impede the normal
operation of the application until approved, and if approval is denied
or not possible, or cannot be made persistent then it will degrade
the functionality of this class and in turn any part of the operation
of the application which is dependent on it.

### Constructor Details

#### public Robot()
throws
AWTException

Constructs a Robot object in the coordinate system of the primary screen.

**Throws:**
- AWTException

- if the platform configuration does not allow
low-level input control. This exception is always thrown when
GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless() returns true
- SecurityException

---

#### public Robot​(
GraphicsDevice
screen)
throws
AWTException

Creates a Robot for the given screen device. Coordinates passed
to Robot method calls like mouseMove, getPixelColor and
createScreenCapture will be interpreted as being in the same coordinate
system as the specified screen. Note that depending on the platform
configuration, multiple screens may either:

- share the same coordinate system to form a combined virtual screen
- use different coordinate systems to act as independent screens

If screen devices are reconfigured such that the coordinate system is
affected, the behavior of existing Robot objects is undefined.

**Parameters:**
- screen

- A screen GraphicsDevice indicating the coordinate
system the Robot will operate in.

**Throws:**
- AWTException

- if the platform configuration does not allow
low-level input control. This exception is always thrown when
GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless() returns true.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

screen

is not a screen
GraphicsDevice.

- Robot

```java
public Robot​(
GraphicsDevice
screen)
throws
AWTException
```

Creates a Robot for the given screen device. Coordinates passed
to Robot method calls like mouseMove, getPixelColor and
createScreenCapture will be interpreted as being in the same coordinate
system as the specified screen. Note that depending on the platform
configuration, multiple screens may either:

- share the same coordinate system to form a combined virtual screen
- use different coordinate systems to act as independent screens

If screen devices are reconfigured such that the coordinate system is
affected, the behavior of existing Robot objects is undefined.

**Parameters:** screen

- A screen GraphicsDevice indicating the coordinate
system the Robot will operate in.
**Throws:** AWTException

- if the platform configuration does not allow
low-level input control. This exception is always thrown when
GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless() returns true.

```java
public void mousePress​(int buttons)
```

Presses one or more mouse buttons. The mouse buttons should
be released using the

mouseRelease(int)

method.

**Parameters:** buttons

- the Button mask; a combination of one or more
mouse button masks.

It is allowed to use only a combination of valid values as a

buttons

parameter.
A valid combination consists of

InputEvent.BUTTON1_DOWN_MASK

,

InputEvent.BUTTON2_DOWN_MASK

,

InputEvent.BUTTON3_DOWN_MASK

and values returned by the

InputEvent.getMaskForButton(button)

method.

The valid combination also depends on a

Toolkit.areExtraMouseButtonsEnabled()
