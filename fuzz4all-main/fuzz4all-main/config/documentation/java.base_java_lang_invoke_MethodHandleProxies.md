### Method Details

#### public static <T> T asInterfaceInstance​(
Class
<T> intfc,

MethodHandle
target)

Produces an instance of the given single-method interface which redirects
its calls to the given method handle.

A single-method interface is an interface which declares a uniquely named method.
When determining the uniquely named method of a single-method interface,
the public

Object

methods (

toString

,

equals

,

hashCode

)
are disregarded. For example,

Comparator

is a single-method interface,
even though it re-declares the

Object.equals

method.

The interface must be public. No additional access checks are performed.

The resulting instance of the required type will respond to
invocation of the type's uniquely named method by calling
the given target on the incoming arguments,
and returning or throwing whatever the target
returns or throws. The invocation will be as if by

target.invoke

.
The target's type will be checked before the
instance is created, as if by a call to

asType

,
which may result in a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

The uniquely named method is allowed to be multiply declared,
with distinct type descriptors. (E.g., it can be overloaded,
or can possess bridge methods.) All such declarations are
connected directly to the target method handle.
Argument and return types are adjusted by

asType

for each individual declaration.

The wrapper instance will implement the requested interface
and its super-types, but no other single-method interfaces.
This means that the instance will not unexpectedly
pass an

instanceof

test for any unrequested type.

Implementation Note:

Therefore, each instance must implement a unique single-method interface.
Implementations may not bundle together
multiple single-method interfaces onto single implementation classes
in the style of

AWTEventMulticaster

.

The method handle may throw an

undeclared exception

,
which means any checked exception (or other checked throwable)
not declared by the requested type's single abstract method.
If this happens, the throwable will be wrapped in an instance of

UndeclaredThrowableException

and thrown in that wrapped form.

Like

Integer.valueOf

,

asInterfaceInstance

is a factory method whose results are defined
by their behavior.
It is not guaranteed to return a new instance for every call.

Because of the possibility of

bridge methods

and other corner cases, the interface may also have several abstract methods
with the same name but having distinct descriptors (types of returns and parameters).
In this case, all the methods are bound in common to the one given target.
The type check and effective

asType

conversion is applied to each
method type descriptor, and all abstract methods are bound to the target in common.
Beyond this type check, no further checks are made to determine that the
abstract methods are related in any way.

Future versions of this API may accept additional types,
such as abstract classes with single abstract methods.
Future versions of this API may also equip wrapper instances
with one or more additional public "marker" interfaces.

If a security manager is installed, this method is caller sensitive.
During any invocation of the target method handle via the returned wrapper,
the original creator of the wrapper (the caller) will be visible
to context checks requested by the security manager.

**Parameters:**
- intfc

- a class object representing

T
- target

- the method handle to invoke from the wrapper

**Returns:**
- a correctly-typed wrapper for the given target

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if either argument is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the

intfc

is not a
valid argument to this method
- WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target cannot
be converted to the type required by the requested interface

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the desired type of the wrapper, a single-method interface

---

#### public static boolean isWrapperInstance​(
Object
x)

Determines if the given object was produced by a call to

asInterfaceInstance

.

**Parameters:**
- x

- any reference

**Returns:**
- true if the reference is not null and points to an object produced by

asInterfaceInstance

---

#### public static
MethodHandle
wrapperInstanceTarget​(
Object
x)

Produces or recovers a target method handle which is behaviorally
equivalent to the unique method of this wrapper instance.
The object

x

must have been produced by a call to

asInterfaceInstance

.
This requirement may be tested via

isWrapperInstance

.

**Parameters:**
- x

- any reference

**Returns:**
- a method handle implementing the unique method

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the reference x is not to a wrapper instance

---

#### public static
Class
<?> wrapperInstanceType​(
Object
x)

Recovers the unique single-method interface type for which this wrapper instance was created.
The object

x

must have been produced by a call to

asInterfaceInstance

.
This requirement may be tested via

isWrapperInstance

.

**Parameters:**
- x

- any reference

**Returns:**
- the single-method interface type for which the wrapper was created

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the reference x is not to a wrapper instance

abstract methods are related in any way.

Future versions of this API may accept additional types,
such as abstract classes with single abstract methods.
Future versions of this API may also equip wrapper instances
with one or more additional public "marker" interfaces.

If a security manager is installed, this method is caller sensitive.
During any invocation of the target method handle via the returned wrapper,
the original creator of the wrapper (the caller) will be visible
to context checks requested by the security manager.

The resulting instance of the required type will respond to
invocation of the type's uniquely named method by calling
the given target on the incoming arguments,
and returning or throwing whatever the target
returns or throws. The invocation will be as if by

target.invoke

.
The target's type will be checked before the
instance is created, as if by a call to

asType

,
which may result in a

WrongMethodTypeException

.

The uniquely named method is allowed to be multiply declared,
with distinct type descriptors. (E.g., it can be overloaded,
or can possess bridge methods.) All such declarations are
connected directly to the target method handle.
Argument and return types are adjusted by

asType

for each individual declaration.

The wrapper instance will implement the requested interface
and its super-types, but no other single-method interfaces.
This means that the instance will not unexpectedly
pass an

instanceof

test for any unrequested type.

Implementation Note:

Therefore, each instance must implement a unique single-method interface.
Implementations may not bundle together
multiple single-method interfaces onto single implementation classes
in the style of

AWTEventMulticaster

.

The method handle may throw an

undeclared exception

,
which means any checked exception (or other checked throwable)
not declared by the requested type's single abstract method.
If this happens, the throwable will be wrapped in an instance of

UndeclaredThrowableException

and thrown in that wrapped form.

Like

Integer.valueOf

,

asInterfaceInstance

is a factory method whose results are defined
by their behavior.
It is not guaranteed to return a new instance for every call.

Because of the possibility of

bridge methods

and other corner cases, the interface may also have several abstract methods
with the same name but having distinct descriptors (types of returns and parameters).
In this case, all the methods are bound in common to the one given target.
The type check and effective

asType

conversion is applied to each
method type descriptor, and all abstract methods are bound to the target in common.
Beyond this type check, no further checks are made to determine that the
abstract methods are related in any way.
