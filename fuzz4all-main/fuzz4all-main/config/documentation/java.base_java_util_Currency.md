# Class Currency

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Currency.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
Currency

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

Represents a currency. Currencies are identified by their ISO 4217 currency
codes. Visit the

ISO web site

for more information.

The class is designed so that there's never more than one

Currency

instance for any given currency. Therefore, there's
no public constructor. You obtain a

Currency

instance using
the

getInstance

methods.

Users can supersede the Java runtime currency data by means of the system
property

java.util.currency.data

. If this system property is
defined then its value is the location of a properties file, the contents of
which are key/value pairs of the ISO 3166 country codes and the ISO 4217
currency data respectively. The value part consists of three ISO 4217 values
of a currency, i.e., an alphabetic code, a numeric code, and a minor unit.
Those three ISO 4217 values are separated by commas.
The lines which start with '#'s are considered comment lines. An optional UTC
timestamp may be specified per currency entry if users need to specify a
cutover date indicating when the new data comes into effect. The timestamp is
appended to the end of the currency properties and uses a comma as a separator.
If a UTC datestamp is present and valid, the JRE will only use the new currency
properties if the current UTC date is later than the date specified at class
loading time. The format of the timestamp must be of ISO 8601 format :

'yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'

. For example,

#Sample currency properties

JP=JPZ,999,0

will supersede the currency data for Japan. If JPZ is one of the existing
ISO 4217 currency code referred by other countries, the existing
JPZ currency data is updated with the given numeric code and minor
unit value.

#Sample currency properties with cutover date

JP=JPZ,999,0,2014-01-01T00:00:00

will supersede the currency data for Japan if

Currency

class is loaded after
1st January 2014 00:00:00 GMT.

Where syntactically malformed entries are encountered, the entry is ignored
and the remainder of entries in file are processed. For instances where duplicate
country code entries exist, the behavior of the Currency information for that

Currency

is undefined and the remainder of entries in file are processed.

If multiple property entries with same currency code but different numeric code
and/or minor unit are encountered, those entries are ignored and the remainder
of entries in file are processed.

It is recommended to use

BigDecimal

class while dealing
with

Currency

or monetary values as it provides better handling of floating
point numbers and their operations.

### Method Details

#### public static
Currency
getInstance​(
String
currencyCode)

Returns the

Currency

instance for the given currency code.

**Parameters:**
- currencyCode

- the ISO 4217 code of the currency

**Returns:**
- the

Currency

instance for the given currency code

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

currencyCode

is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

currencyCode

is not
a supported ISO 4217 code.

---

#### public static
Currency
getInstance​(
Locale
locale)

Returns the

Currency

instance for the country of the
given locale. The language and variant components of the locale
are ignored. The result may vary over time, as countries change their
currencies. For example, for the original member countries of the
European Monetary Union, the method returns the old national currencies
until December 31, 2001, and the Euro from January 1, 2002, local time
of the respective countries.

If the specified

locale

contains "cu" and/or "rg"

Unicode extensions

,
the instance returned from this method reflects
the values specified with those extensions. If both "cu" and "rg" are
specified, the currency from the "cu" extension supersedes the implicit one
from the "rg" extension.

The method returns

null

for territories that don't
have a currency, such as Antarctica.

**Parameters:**
- locale

- the locale for whose country a

Currency

instance is needed

**Returns:**
- the

Currency

instance for the country of the given
locale, or

null

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

locale

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the country of the given

locale

is not a supported ISO 3166 country code.

---

#### public static
Set
<
Currency
> getAvailableCurrencies()

Gets the set of available currencies. The returned set of currencies
contains all of the available currencies, which may include currencies
that represent obsolete ISO 4217 codes. The set can be modified
without affecting the available currencies in the runtime.

**Returns:**
- the set of available currencies. If there is no currency
available in the runtime, the returned set is empty.

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public
String
getCurrencyCode()

Gets the ISO 4217 currency code of this currency.

**Returns:**
- the ISO 4217 currency code of this currency.

---

#### public
String
getSymbol()

Gets the symbol of this currency for the default

DISPLAY

locale.
For example, for the US Dollar, the symbol is "$" if the default
locale is the US, while for other locales it may be "US$". If no
symbol can be determined, the ISO 4217 currency code is returned.

If the default

DISPLAY

locale
contains "rg" (region override)

Unicode extension

,
the symbol returned from this method reflects
the value specified with that extension.

This is equivalent to calling

getSymbol(Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category.DISPLAY))

.

**Returns:**
- the symbol of this currency for the default

DISPLAY

locale

---

#### public
String
getSymbol​(
Locale
locale)

Gets the symbol of this currency for the specified locale.
For example, for the US Dollar, the symbol is "$" if the specified
locale is the US, while for other locales it may be "US$". If no
symbol can be determined, the ISO 4217 currency code is returned.

If the specified

locale

contains "rg" (region override)

Unicode extension

,
the symbol returned from this method reflects
the value specified with that extension.

**Parameters:**
- locale

- the locale for which a display name for this currency is
needed

**Returns:**
- the symbol of this currency for the specified locale

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

locale

is null

---

#### public int getDefaultFractionDigits()

Gets the default number of fraction digits used with this currency.
Note that the number of fraction digits is the same as ISO 4217's
minor unit for the currency.
For example, the default number of fraction digits for the Euro is 2,
while for the Japanese Yen it's 0.
In the case of pseudo-currencies, such as IMF Special Drawing Rights,
-1 is returned.

**Returns:**
- the default number of fraction digits used with this currency

---

#### public int getNumericCode()

Returns the ISO 4217 numeric code of this currency.

**Returns:**
- the ISO 4217 numeric code of this currency

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public
String
getNumericCodeAsString()

Returns the 3 digit ISO 4217 numeric code of this currency as a

String

.
Unlike

getNumericCode()

, which returns the numeric code as

int

,
this method always returns the numeric code as a 3 digit string.
e.g. a numeric value of 32 would be returned as "032",
and a numeric value of 6 would be returned as "006".

**Returns:**
- the 3 digit ISO 4217 numeric code of this currency as a

String

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public
String
getDisplayName()

Gets the name that is suitable for displaying this currency for
the default

DISPLAY

locale.
If there is no suitable display name found
for the default locale, the ISO 4217 currency code is returned.

This is equivalent to calling

getDisplayName(Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category.DISPLAY))

.

**Returns:**
- the display name of this currency for the default

DISPLAY

locale

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public
String
getDisplayName​(
Locale
locale)

public static
Currency
getInstance​(
String
currencyCode)
```

Returns the

Currency

instance for the given currency code.

**Parameters:** currencyCode

- the ISO 4217 code of the currency
**Returns:** the

Currency

instance for the given currency code
**Throws:** NullPointerException
