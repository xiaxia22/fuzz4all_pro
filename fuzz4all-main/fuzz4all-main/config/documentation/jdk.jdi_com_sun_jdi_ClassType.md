# Interface ClassType

**Source:** `jdk.jdi\com\sun\jdi\ClassType.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ClassType

extends
ReferenceType
```

A mirror of a class in the target VM. A ClassType is a refinement
of

ReferenceType

that applies to true classes in the JLS
sense of the definition (not an interface, not an array type). Any

ObjectReference

that mirrors an instance of such a class
will have a ClassType as its type.

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### ClassType
superclass()

Gets the superclass of this class.

**Returns:**
- a

ClassType

that mirrors the superclass
of this class in the target VM. If no such class exists,
returns null

---

#### List
<
InterfaceType
> interfaces()

Gets the interfaces directly implemented by this class.
Only the interfaces that are declared with the "implements"
keyword in this class are included.

**Returns:**
- a List of

InterfaceType

objects each mirroring
a direct interface this ClassType in the target VM.
If none exist, returns a zero length List.

**Throws:**
- ClassNotPreparedException

- if this class not yet been
prepared.

---

#### List
<
InterfaceType
> allInterfaces()

Gets the interfaces directly and indirectly implemented
by this class. Interfaces returned by

interfaces()

are returned as well all superinterfaces.

**Returns:**
- a List of

InterfaceType

objects each mirroring
an interface of this ClassType in the target VM.
If none exist, returns a zero length List.

**Throws:**
- ClassNotPreparedException

- if this class not yet been
prepared.

---

#### List
<
ClassType
> subclasses()

Gets the currently loaded, direct subclasses of this class.
No ordering of this list is guaranteed.

**Returns:**
- a List of

ClassType

objects each mirroring a loaded
subclass of this class in the target VM. If no such classes
exist, this method returns a zero-length list.

---

#### boolean isEnum()

Determine if this class was declared as an enum.

**Returns:**
- true

if this class was declared as an enum; false
otherwise.

---

#### void setValue​(
Field
field,

Value
value)
throws
InvalidTypeException
,

ClassNotLoadedException

Assigns a value to a static field.
The

Field

must be valid for this ClassType; that is,
it must be from the mirrored object's class or a superclass of that class.
The field must not be final.

Object values must be assignment compatible with the field type
(This implies that the field type must be loaded through the
enclosing class' class loader). Primitive values must be
either assignment compatible with the field type or must be
convertible to the field type without loss of information.
See JLS section 5.2 for more information on assignment
compatibility.

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to set.
- value

- the value to be assigned.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the field is
not static, the field is final, or the field does not exist
in this class.
- ClassNotLoadedException

- if the field type has not yet been loaded
through the appropriate class loader.
- InvalidTypeException

- if the value's type does not match
the field's declared type.
- VMCannotBeModifiedException

- if the VirtualMachine is read-only - see

InvocationException

Invokes the specified static

Method

in the
target VM. The
specified method can be defined in this class,
or in a superclass.
The method must be a static method
but not a static initializer.
Use

newInstance(com.sun.jdi.ThreadReference, com.sun.jdi.Method, java.util.List<? extends com.sun.jdi.Value>, int)

to create a new object and
run its constructor.

The method invocation will occur in the specified thread.
Method invocation can occur only if the specified thread
has been suspended by an event which occurred in that thread.
Method invocation is not supported
when the target VM has been suspended through

VirtualMachine.suspend()

or when the specified thread
is suspended through

ThreadReference.suspend()

.

The specified method is invoked with the arguments in the specified
argument list. The method invocation is synchronous; this method
does not return until the invoked method returns in the target VM.
If the invoked method throws an exception, this method will throw
an

InvocationException

which contains a mirror to the exception
object thrown.

Object arguments must be assignment compatible with the argument type
(This implies that the argument type must be loaded through the
enclosing class' class loader). Primitive arguments must be
either assignment compatible with the argument type or must be
convertible to the argument type without loss of information.
If the method being called accepts a variable number of arguments,
then the last argument type is an array of some component type.
The argument in the matching position can be omitted, or can be null,
an array of the same component type, or an argument of the
component type followed by any number of other arguments of the same
type. If the argument is omitted, then a 0 length array of the
component type is passed. The component type can be a primitive type.
Autoboxing is not supported.

See Section 5.2 of

The Java™ Language Specification

for more information on assignment compatibility.

By default, all threads in the target VM are resumed while
the method is being invoked if they were previously
suspended by an event or by

VirtualMachine.suspend()

or

ThreadReference.suspend()

. This is done to prevent the deadlocks
that will occur if any of the threads own monitors
that will be needed by the invoked method.
Note, however, that this implicit resume acts exactly like

ThreadReference.resume()

, so if the thread's suspend
count is greater than 1, it will remain in a suspended state
during the invocation and thus a deadlock could still occur.
By default, when the invocation completes,
all threads in the target VM are suspended, regardless their state
before the invocation.
It is possible that
breakpoints or other events might occur during the invocation.
This can cause deadlocks as described above. It can also cause a deadlock
if invokeMethod is called from the client's event handler thread. In this
case, this thread will be waiting for the invokeMethod to complete and
won't read the EventSet that comes in for the new event. If this
new EventSet is SUSPEND_ALL, then a deadlock will occur because no
one will resume the EventSet. To avoid this, all EventRequests should
be disabled before doing the invokeMethod, or the invokeMethod should
not be done from the client's event handler thread.

The resumption of other threads during the invocation can be prevented
by specifying the

INVOKE_SINGLE_THREADED

bit flag in the

options

argument; however,
there is no protection against or recovery from the deadlocks
described above, so this option should be used with great caution.
Only the specified thread will be resumed (as described for all
threads above). Upon completion of a single threaded invoke, the invoking thread
will be suspended once again. Note that any threads started during
the single threaded invocation will not be suspended when the
invocation completes.

If the target VM is disconnected during the invoke (for example, through

VirtualMachine.dispose()

) the method invocation continues.

**Parameters:**
- thread

- the thread in which to invoke.
- method

- the

Method

to invoke.
- arguments

- the list of

Value

arguments bound to the
invoked method. Values from the list are assigned to arguments
in the order they appear in the method signature.
- options

- the integer bit flag options.

**Returns:**
- a

Value

mirror of the invoked method's return value.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the method is not
a member of this class or a superclass, if the size of the argument list
does not match the number of declared arguments for the method, or
if the method is an initializer, constructor or static intializer.
- ClassNotLoadedException

- if any argument type has not yet been loaded
through the appropriate class loader.
- IncompatibleThreadStateException

- if the specified thread has not
been suspended by an event.
- InvocationException

- if the method invocation resulted in
an exception in the target VM.
- InvalidTypeException

- If the arguments do not meet this requirement --
Object arguments must be assignment compatible with the argument
type. This implies that the argument type must be
loaded through the enclosing class' class loader.
Primitive arguments must be either assignment compatible with the
argument type or must be convertible to the argument type without loss
of information. See JLS section 5.2 for more information on assignment
compatibility.

specified constructor must be defined in this class.

Instance creation will occur in the specified thread.
Instance creation can occur only if the specified thread
has been suspended by an event which occurred in that thread.
Instance creation is not supported
when the target VM has been suspended through

does not return until the constructor returns in the target VM.
If the invoked method throws an
exception, this method will throw an

InvocationException

which contains a mirror to the exception object thrown.

```

Invokes the specified static

Method

in the
target VM. The
specified method can be defined in this class,
or in a superclass.
The method must be a static method
but not a static initializer.
Use

newInstance(com.sun.jdi.ThreadReference, com.sun.jdi.Method, java.util.List<? extends com.sun.jdi.Value>, int)

to create a new object and
run its constructor.

The method invocation will occur in the specified thread.
Method invocation can occur only if the specified thread
has been suspended by an event which occurred in that thread.
Method invocation is not supported
when the target VM has been suspended through

VirtualMachine.suspend()

or when the specified thread
is suspended through

ThreadReference.suspend()

.

The specified method is invoked with the arguments in the specified
argument list. The method invocation is synchronous; this method
does not return until the invoked method returns in the target VM.
If the invoked method throws an exception, this method will throw
an

InvocationException

which contains a mirror to the exception

Object arguments must be assignment compatible with the argument type
(This implies that the argument type must be loaded through the
enclosing class' class loader). Primitive arguments must be
either assignment compatible with the argument type or must be

If the method being called accepts a variable number of arguments,
then the last argument type is an array of some component type.
The argument in the matching position can be omitted, or can be null,
an array of the same component type, or an argument of the
component type followed by any number of other arguments of the same

component type is passed. The component type can be a primitive type.
Autoboxing is not supported.

See Section 5.2 of

The Java™ Language Specification

for more information on assignment compatibility.

By default, all threads in the target VM are resumed while
the method is being invoked if they were previously
suspended by an event or by

VirtualMachine.suspend()

or

ThreadReference.suspend()

. This is done to prevent the deadlocks
that will occur if any of the threads own monitors
that will be needed by the invoked method.
Note, however, that this implicit resume acts exactly like

ThreadReference.resume()

, so if the thread's suspend
count is greater than 1, it will remain in a suspended state
during the invocation and thus a deadlock could still occur.
By default, when the invocation completes,
all threads in the target VM are suspended, regardless their state
before the invocation.
It is possible that
breakpoints or other events might occur during the invocation.
This can cause deadlocks as described above. It can also cause a deadlock
if invokeMethod is called from the client's event handler thread. In this
case, this thread will be waiting for the invokeMethod to complete and
won't read the EventSet that comes in for the new event. If this
new EventSet is SUSPEND_ALL, then a deadlock will occur because no
one will resume the EventSet. To avoid this, all EventRequests should
be disabled before doing the invokeMethod, or the invokeMethod should
not be done from the client's event handler thread.

The resumption of other threads during the invocation can be prevented
by specifying the

INVOKE_SINGLE_THREADED

bit flag in the

options

argument; however,
there is no protection against or recovery from the deadlocks
described above, so this option should be used with great caution.
Only the specified thread will be resumed (as described for all
threads above). Upon completion of a single threaded invoke, the invoking thread
will be suspended once again. Note that any threads started during
the single threaded invocation will not be suspended when the
invocation completes.

If the target VM is disconnected during the invoke (for example, through

VirtualMachine.dispose()

) the method invocation continues.

**Parameters:** thread

- the thread in which to invoke.
**Parameters:** method

- the

Method

to invoke.
**Parameters:** arguments

- the list of

Value

arguments bound to the
invoked method. Values from the list are assigned to arguments
in the order they appear in the method signature.
**Parameters:** options

- the integer bit flag options.
**Returns:** a

Value

mirror of the invoked method's return value.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the method is not
a member of this class or a superclass, if the size of the argument list
does not match the number of declared arguments for the method, or
if the method is an initializer, constructor or static intializer.
**Throws:** ClassNotLoadedException

- if any argument type has not yet been loaded
through the appropriate class loader.
**Throws:** IncompatibleThreadStateException

- if the specified thread has not
been suspended by an event.
**Throws:** InvocationException

- if the method invocation resulted in
an exception in the target VM.
**Throws:** InvalidTypeException

- If the arguments do not meet this requirement --
Object arguments must be assignment compatible with the argument
type. This implies that the argument type must be
loaded through the enclosing class' class loader.
Primitive arguments must be either assignment compatible with the
argument type or must be convertible to the argument type without loss
of information. See JLS section 5.2 for more information on assignment
compatibility.

Constructs a new instance of this type, using
the given constructor

Method

in the
target VM. The
specified constructor must be defined in this class.

Instance creation will occur in the specified thread.
Instance creation can occur only if the specified thread
has been suspended by an event which occurred in that thread.
Instance creation is not supported
when the target VM has been suspended through

VirtualMachine.suspend()

or when the specified thread
is suspended through

ThreadReference.suspend()

.

The specified constructor is invoked with the arguments in the specified
argument list. The invocation is synchronous; this method
does not return until the constructor returns in the target VM.
If the invoked method throws an
exception, this method will throw an

InvocationException

which contains a mirror to the exception object thrown.

Object arguments must be assignment compatible with the argument type
(This implies that the argument type must be loaded through the
enclosing class' class loader). Primitive arguments must be
either assignment compatible with the argument type or must be
convertible to the argument type without loss of information.
If the method being called accepts a variable number of arguments,
then the last argument type is an array of some component type.
The argument in the matching position can be omitted, or can be null,
an array of the same component type, or an argument of the
component type, followed by any number of other arguments of the same
type. If the argument is omitted, then a 0 length array of the
component type is passed. The component type can be a primitive type.
Autoboxing is not supported.

See section 5.2 of

The Java™ Language Specification

for more information on assignment compatibility.

By default, all threads in the target VM are resumed while
the method is being invoked if they were previously
suspended by an event or by

VirtualMachine.suspend()

or

ThreadReference.suspend()

. This is done to prevent the deadlocks
that will occur if any of the threads own monitors
that will be needed by the invoked method. It is possible that
breakpoints or other events might occur during the invocation.
Note, however, that this implicit resume acts exactly like

ThreadReference.resume()

, so if the thread's suspend
count is greater than 1, it will remain in a suspended state
during the invocation. By default, when the invocation completes,
all threads in the target VM are suspended, regardless their state
before the invocation.

The resumption of other threads during the invocation can be prevented
by specifying the

INVOKE_SINGLE_THREADED

if invokeMethod is called from the client's event handler thread. In this
case, this thread will be waiting for the invokeMethod to complete and
won't read the EventSet that comes in for the new event. If this
new EventSet is SUSPEND_ALL, then a deadlock will occur because no
one will resume the EventSet. To avoid this, all EventRequests should
be disabled before doing the invokeMethod, or the invokeMethod should
not be done from the client's event handler thread.

The resumption of other threads during the invocation can be prevented
by specifying the

INVOKE_SINGLE_THREADED

bit flag in the

options

argument; however,
there is no protection against or recovery from the deadlocks
described above, so this option should be used with great caution.
Only the specified thread will be resumed (as described for all
threads above). Upon completion of a single threaded invoke, the invoking thread
will be suspended once again. Note that any threads started during
the single threaded invocation will not be suspended when the
invocation completes.

If the target VM is disconnected during the invoke (for example, through

VirtualMachine.dispose()

) the method invocation continues.

**Parameters:** thread

- the thread in which to invoke.
**Parameters:** method

- the

Method

to invoke.
**Parameters:** arguments

- the list of

Value

arguments bound to the
invoked method. Values from the list are assigned to arguments
in the order they appear in the method signature.
**Parameters:** options

- the integer bit flag options.
**Returns:** a

Value

mirror of the invoked method's return value.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the method is not
a member of this class or a superclass, if the size of the argument list
does not match the number of declared arguments for the method, or
if the method is an initializer, constructor or static intializer.
**Throws:** ClassNotLoadedException

- if any argument type has not yet been loaded
through the appropriate class loader.
**Throws:** IncompatibleThreadStateException

- if the specified thread has not
been suspended by an event.
**Throws:** InvocationException

- if the method invocation resulted in
an exception in the target VM.
**Throws:** InvalidTypeException

- If the arguments do not meet this requirement --
Object arguments must be assignment compatible with the argument
type. This implies that the argument type must be
loaded through the enclosing class' class loader.
Primitive arguments must be either assignment compatible with the
argument type or must be convertible to the argument type without loss
of information. See JLS section 5.2 for more information on assignment
compatibility.
**Throws:** VMCannotBeModifiedException

- if the VirtualMachine is read-only - see

VirtualMachine.canBeModified()

Use

to create a new object and
run its constructor.

The method invocation will occur in the specified thread.
Method invocation can occur only if the specified thread
has been suspended by an event which occurred in that thread.
Method invocation is not supported
when the target VM has been suspended through

The specified method is invoked with the arguments in the specified

If the invoked method throws an exception, this method will throw
an

InvocationException

then the last argument type is an array of some component type.
The argument in the matching position can be omitted, or can be null,
an array of the same component type, or an argument of the
component type followed by any number of other arguments of the same

Note, however, that this implicit resume acts exactly like

ThreadReference.resume()

count is greater than 1, it will remain in a suspended state
during the invocation and thus a deadlock could still occur.
By default, when the invocation completes,
all threads in the target VM are suspended, regardless their state
before the invocation.

then the last argument type is an array of some component type.
The argument in the matching position can be omitted, or can be null,
an array of the same component type, or an argument of the
component type, followed by any number of other arguments of the same
type. If the argument is omitted, then a 0 length array of the
component type is passed. The component type can be a primitive type.
Autoboxing is not supported.

See section 5.2 of

The Java™ Language Specification

for more information on assignment compatibility.

By default, all threads in the target VM are resumed while
the method is being invoked if they were previously
suspended by an event or by

VirtualMachine.suspend()

or

ThreadReference.suspend()

. This is done to prevent the deadlocks
that will occur if any of the threads own monitors
that will be needed by the invoked method. It is possible that
breakpoints or other events might occur during the invocation.
Note, however, that this implicit resume acts exactly like

ThreadReference.resume()

, so if the thread's suspend
count is greater than 1, it will remain in a suspended state
during the invocation. By default, when the invocation completes,
all threads in the target VM are suspended, regardless their state
before the invocation.

The resumption of other threads during the invocation can be prevented
by specifying the

INVOKE_SINGLE_THREADED

bit flag in the

options

argument; however,
there is no protection against or recovery from the deadlocks
described above, so this option should be used with great caution.
Only the specified thread will be resumed (as described for all
threads above). Upon completion of a single threaded invoke, the invoking thread
will be suspended once again. Note that any threads started during
the single threaded invocation will not be suspended when the
invocation completes.

If the target VM is disconnected during the invoke (for example, through

VirtualMachine.dispose()

) the method invocation continues.
