# Interface ModuleReader

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\module\ModuleReader.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ModuleReader

extends
Closeable
```

Provides access to the content of a module.

A module reader is intended for cases where access to the resources in a
module is required, regardless of whether the module has been loaded.
A framework that scans a collection of packaged modules on the file system,
for example, may use a module reader to access a specific resource in each
module. A module reader is also intended to be used by

ClassLoader

implementations that load classes and resources from modules.

A resource in a module is identified by an abstract name that is a
'

/

'-separated path string. For example, module

java.base

may
have a resource "

java/lang/Object.class

" that, by convention, is the
class file for

java.lang.Object

. A module reader may treat
directories in the module content as resources (whether it does or not is
module reader specific). Where the module content contains a directory
that can be located as a resource then its name ends with a slash ('/'). The
directory can also be located with a name that drops the trailing slash.

A

ModuleReader

is

open

upon
creation and is closed by invoking the

close

method. Failure
to close a module reader may result in a resource leak. The

try-with-resources

statement provides a useful construct to ensure that
module readers are closed.

A

ModuleReader

implementation may require permissions to access
resources in the module. Consequently the

find

,

open

,

read

, and

list

methods may throw

SecurityException

if access is denied by the security manager.

### Field Details

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### Optional
<
URI
> find​(
String
name)
throws
IOException

Finds a resource, returning a URI to the resource in the module.

If the module reader can determine that the name locates a directory
then the resulting URI will end with a slash ('/').

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the resource to open for reading

**Returns:**
- A URI to the resource; an empty

Optional

if the resource
is not found or a URI cannot be constructed to locate the
resource

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs or the module reader is closed
- SecurityException

- If denied by the security manager

**See Also:**
- ClassLoader.getResource(String)

---

#### default
Optional
<
InputStream
> open​(
String
name)
throws
IOException

Opens a resource, returning an input stream to read the resource in
the module.

The behavior of the input stream when used after the module reader
is closed is implementation specific and therefore not specified.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the resource to open for reading

**Returns:**
- An input stream to read the resource or an empty

Optional

if not found

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs or the module reader is closed
- SecurityException

- If denied by the security manager

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation invokes the

find

method to get a URI to the resource. If found, then it attempts
to construct a

URL

and open a connection to the
resource.

---

#### default
Optional
<
ByteBuffer
> read​(
String
name)
throws
IOException

Reads a resource, returning a byte buffer with the contents of the
resource.

The element at the returned buffer's position is the first byte of the
resource, the element at the buffer's limit is the last byte of the
resource. Once consumed, the

release

method
must be invoked. Failure to invoke the

release

method may result
in a resource leak.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the resource to read

**Returns:**
- A byte buffer containing the contents of the resource or an
empty

Optional

if not found

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs or the module reader is closed
- SecurityException

- If denied by the security manager
- OutOfMemoryError

- If the resource is larger than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

,
the maximum capacity of a byte buffer

**See Also:**
- ClassLoader.defineClass(String, ByteBuffer, java.security.ProtectionDomain)

**API Note:**
- This method is intended for high-performance class loading. It
is not capable (or intended) to read arbitrary large resources that
could potentially be 2GB or larger. The rationale for using this method
in conjunction with the

release

method is to allow module reader
implementations manage buffers in an efficient manner.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation invokes the

open

method and reads all bytes from the input stream into a byte
buffer.

---

#### default void release​(
ByteBuffer
bb)

Release a byte buffer. This method should be invoked after consuming
the contents of the buffer returned by the

read

method.
The behavior of this method when invoked to release a buffer that has
already been released, or the behavior when invoked to release a buffer
after a

ModuleReader

is closed is implementation specific and
therefore not specified.

**Parameters:**
- bb

- The byte buffer to release

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation doesn't do anything except check
if the byte buffer is null.

---

#### Stream
<
String
> list()
throws
IOException

Lists the contents of the module, returning a stream of elements that
are the names of all resources in the module. Whether the stream of
elements includes names corresponding to directories in the module is
module reader specific.

In lazy implementations then an

IOException

may be thrown
when using the stream to list the module contents. If this occurs then
the

IOException

will be wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

and thrown from the method that caused the
access to be attempted.

SecurityException

may also be thrown
when using the stream to list the module contents and access is denied
by the security manager.

The behavior of the stream when used after the module reader is
closed is implementation specific and therefore not specified.

**Returns:**
- A stream of elements that are the names of all resources
in the module

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs or the module reader is closed
- SecurityException

- If denied by the security manager

---

#### void close()
throws
IOException

Closes the module reader. Once closed then subsequent calls to locate or
read a resource will fail by throwing

IOException

.

A module reader is not required to be asynchronously closeable. If a
thread is reading a resource and another thread invokes the close method,
then the second thread may block until the read operation is complete.

**Specified by:**
- close

in interface

AutoCloseable
- close

in interface

Closeable

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations of

ModuleReader

should take great care
when translating an abstract resource name to the location of a resource in
a packaged module or on the file system. Implementations are advised to
treat resource names with elements such as '

.

, '

..

',
elements containing file separators, or empty elements as "not found". More
generally, if the resource name is not in the stream of elements that the

list

method returns then the resource should be treated as "not
found" to avoid inconsistencies.

#### list

Stream

<

String

> list()
throws

IOException

Lists the contents of the module, returning a stream of elements that
are the names of all resources in the module. Whether the stream of
elements includes names corresponding to directories in the module is
module reader specific.

In lazy implementations then an

IOException

may be thrown
when using the stream to list the module contents. If this occurs then
the

IOException

will be wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

and thrown from the method that caused the
access to be attempted.

SecurityException

may also be thrown
when using the stream to list the module contents and access is denied
by the security manager.

The behavior of the stream when used after the module reader is
closed is implementation specific and therefore not specified.

close

```java
void close()
throws
IOException
```

Closes the module reader. Once closed then subsequent calls to locate or
read a resource will fail by throwing

IOException

.

A module reader is not required to be asynchronously closeable. If a
thread is reading a resource and another thread invokes the close method,
then the second thread may block until the read operation is complete.
