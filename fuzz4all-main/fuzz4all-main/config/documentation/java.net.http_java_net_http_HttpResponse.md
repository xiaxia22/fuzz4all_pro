# Interface HttpResponse<T>

**Source:** `java.net.http\java\net\http\HttpResponse.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
HttpResponse<T>
```

An HTTP response.

An

HttpResponse

is not created directly, but rather returned as
a result of sending an

HttpRequest

. An

HttpResponse

is
made available when the response status code and headers have been received,
and typically after the response body has also been completely received.
Whether or not the

HttpResponse

is made available before the response
body has been completely received depends on the

BodyHandler

provided when sending the

HttpRequest

.

This class provides methods for accessing the response status code,
headers, the response body, and the

HttpRequest

corresponding
to this response.

The following is an example of retrieving a response as a String:

```java
HttpResponse<String> response = client
.send(request, BodyHandlers.ofString());
```

The class

BodyHandlers

provides implementations
of many common response handlers. Alternatively, a custom

BodyHandler

implementation can be used.

**Type Parameters:** T

- the response body type

---

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### int statusCode()

Returns the status code for this response.

**Returns:**
- the response code

---

#### HttpRequest
request()

Returns the

HttpRequest

corresponding to this response.

The returned

HttpRequest

may not be the initiating request
provided when

sending

. For example, if the initiating request was redirected, then the
request returned by this method will have the redirected URI, which will
be different from the initiating request URI.

**Returns:**
- the request

**See Also:**
- previousResponse()

---

#### Optional
<
HttpResponse
<
T
>> previousResponse()

Returns an

Optional

containing the previous intermediate response
if one was received. An intermediate response is one that is received
as a result of redirection or authentication. If no previous response
was received then an empty

Optional

is returned.

**Returns:**
- an Optional containing the HttpResponse, if any.

---

#### HttpHeaders
headers()

Returns the received response headers.

**Returns:**
- the response headers

---

#### T
body()

Returns the body. Depending on the type of

T

, the returned body
may represent the body after it was read (such as

byte[]

, or

String

, or

Path

) or it may represent an object with
which the body is read, such as an

InputStream

.

If this

HttpResponse

was returned from an invocation of

previousResponse()

then this method returns

null

**Returns:**
- the body

---

#### Optional
<
SSLSession
> sslSession()

Returns an

Optional

containing the

SSLSession

in effect
for this response. Returns an empty

Optional

if this is not a

HTTPS

response.

**Returns:**
- an

Optional

containing the

SSLSession

associated
with the response

---

#### URI
uri()

Returns the

URI

that the response was received from. This may be
different from the request

URI

if redirection occurred.

**Returns:**
- the URI of the response

---

#### HttpClient.Version
version()

Returns the HTTP protocol version that was used for this response.

**Returns:**
- HTTP protocol version

---
