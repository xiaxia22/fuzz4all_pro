# Class PropertyChangeSupport

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\beans\PropertyChangeSupport.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
PropertyChangeSupport

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support bound
properties. It manages a list of listeners and dispatches

PropertyChangeEvent

s to them. You can use an instance of this class
as a member field of your bean and delegate these types of work to it.
The

PropertyChangeListener

can be registered for all properties
or for a property specified by name.

Here is an example of

PropertyChangeSupport

usage that follows
the rules and recommendations laid out in the JavaBeans™ specification:

```java
public class MyBean {
private final PropertyChangeSupport pcs = new PropertyChangeSupport(this);

public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
this.pcs.addPropertyChangeListener(listener);
}

public void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
this.pcs.removePropertyChangeListener(listener);
}

private String value;

public String getValue() {
return this.value;
}

public void setValue(String newValue) {
String oldValue = this.value;
this.value = newValue;
this.pcs.firePropertyChange("value", oldValue, newValue);
}

[...]
}
```

A

PropertyChangeSupport

instance is thread-safe.

This class is serializable. When it is serialized it will save
(and restore) any listeners that are themselves serializable. Any
non-serializable listeners will be skipped during serialization.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public PropertyChangeSupport​(
Object
sourceBean)

Constructs a

PropertyChangeSupport

object.

**Parameters:**
- sourceBean

- The bean to be given as the source for any events.

---

### Method Details

#### public void addPropertyChangeListener​(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)

Add a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list.
The listener is registered for all properties.
The same listener object may be added more than once, and will be called
as many times as it is added.
If

listener

is null, no exception is thrown and no action
is taken.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- The PropertyChangeListener to be added

---

#### public void removePropertyChangeListener​(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)

Remove a PropertyChangeListener from the listener list.
This removes a PropertyChangeListener that was registered
for all properties.
If

listener

was added more than once to the same event
source, it will be notified one less time after being removed.
If

listener

is null, or was never added, no exception is
thrown and no action is taken.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- The PropertyChangeListener to be removed

---

#### public
PropertyChangeListener
[] getPropertyChangeListeners()

Returns an array of all the listeners that were added to the
PropertyChangeSupport object with addPropertyChangeListener().

If some listeners have been added with a named property, then
the returned array will be a mixture of PropertyChangeListeners
and

PropertyChangeListenerProxy

s. If the calling
method is interested in distinguishing the listeners then it must
test each element to see if it's a

PropertyChangeListenerProxy

, perform the cast, and examine
the parameter.

```java
PropertyChangeListener[] listeners = bean.getPropertyChangeListeners();
for (int i = 0; i < listeners.length; i++) {
if (listeners[i] instanceof PropertyChangeListenerProxy) {
PropertyChangeListenerProxy proxy =
(PropertyChangeListenerProxy)listeners[i];
if (proxy.getPropertyName().equals("foo")) {
// proxy is a PropertyChangeListener which was associated
// with the property named "foo"
}
}
}
```

**Returns:**
- all of the

PropertyChangeListeners

added or an
empty array if no listeners have been added

**See Also:**
- PropertyChangeListenerProxy

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public void addPropertyChangeListener​(
String
propertyName,

PropertyChangeListener
listener)

Add a PropertyChangeListener for a specific property. The listener
will be invoked only when a call on firePropertyChange names that
specific property.
The same listener object may be added more than once. For each
property, the listener will be invoked the number of times it was added
for that property.
If

propertyName

or

listener

is null, no
exception is thrown and no action is taken.

**Parameters:**
- propertyName

- The name of the property to listen on.
- listener

- The PropertyChangeListener to be added

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public void removePropertyChangeListener​(
String
propertyName,

PropertyChangeListener
listener)

Remove a PropertyChangeListener for a specific property.
If

listener

was added more than once to the same event
source for the specified property, it will be notified one less time
after being removed.
If

propertyName

is null, no exception is thrown and no
action is taken.
If

listener

is null, or was never added for the specified
property, no exception is thrown and no action is taken.

**Parameters:**
- propertyName

- The name of the property that was listened on.
- listener

- The PropertyChangeListener to be removed

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public
PropertyChangeListener
[] getPropertyChangeListeners​(
String
propertyName)

Returns an array of all the listeners which have been associated
with the named property.

**Parameters:**
- propertyName

- The name of the property being listened to

**Returns:**
- all of the

PropertyChangeListeners

associated with
the named property. If no such listeners have been added,
or if

propertyName

is null, an empty array is
returned.

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

Method Detail

- addPropertyChangeListener

```java
public void addPropertyChangeListener​(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)
```

Add a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list.
The listener is registered for all properties.
The same listener object may be added more than once, and will be called
as many times as it is added.
If

listener

is null, no exception is thrown and no action
is taken.

**Parameters:** listener

- The PropertyChangeListener to be added

- removePropertyChangeListener

```java
public void removePropertyChangeListener​(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)
```

Remove a PropertyChangeListener from the listener list.
This removes a PropertyChangeListener that was registered
for all properties.
If

listener

was added more than once to the same event
source, it will be notified one less time after being removed.
If

listener

is null, or was never added, no exception is
thrown and no action is taken.

**Parameters:** listener

- The PropertyChangeListener to be removed

- getPropertyChangeListeners

```java
public
PropertyChangeListener
[] getPropertyChangeListeners()
```

Returns an array of all the listeners that were added to the
PropertyChangeSupport object with addPropertyChangeListener().

If some listeners have been added with a named property, then
the returned array will be a mixture of PropertyChangeListeners
and

PropertyChangeListenerProxy

s. If the calling
method is interested in distinguishing the listeners then it must
test each element to see if it's a

PropertyChangeListenerProxy

, perform the cast, and examine
the parameter.

```java
PropertyChangeListener[] listeners = bean.getPropertyChangeListeners();
for (int i = 0; i < listeners.length; i++) {
if (listeners[i] instanceof PropertyChangeListenerProxy) {
PropertyChangeListenerProxy proxy =
(PropertyChangeListenerProxy)listeners[i];
if (proxy.getPropertyName().equals("foo")) {
// proxy is a PropertyChangeListener which was associated
// with the property named "foo"
}
}
}

added or an
empty array if no listeners have been added
**Since:** 1.4

for that property.
If

propertyName

or

listener

is null, no
exception is thrown and no action is taken.
