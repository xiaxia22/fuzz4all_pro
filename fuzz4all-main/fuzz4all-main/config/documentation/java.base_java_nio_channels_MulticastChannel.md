# Interface MulticastChannel

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\channels\MulticastChannel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
MulticastChannel

extends
NetworkChannel
```

A network channel that supports Internet Protocol (IP) multicasting.

IP multicasting is the transmission of IP datagrams to members of
a

group

that is zero or more hosts identified by a single destination
address.

In the case of a channel to an

IPv4

socket,
the underlying operating system optionally supports

RFC 2236: Internet Group
Management Protocol, Version 2 (IGMPv2)

. When IGMPv2 is supported then
the operating system may additionally support source filtering as specified by

RFC 3376: Internet Group
Management Protocol, Version 3 (IGMPv3)

.
For channels to an

IPv6

socket, the equivalent
standards are

RFC 2710:
Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6

and

RFC 3810: Multicast Listener
Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6

.

The

join(InetAddress,NetworkInterface)

method is used to
join a group and receive all multicast datagrams sent to the group. A channel
may join several multicast groups and may join the same group on several

interfaces

. Membership is dropped by invoking the

drop

method on the returned

MembershipKey

. If the
underlying platform supports source filtering then the

block

and

unblock

methods can be used to block or
unblock multicast datagrams from particular source addresses.

The

join(InetAddress,NetworkInterface,InetAddress)

method
is used to begin receiving datagrams sent to a group whose source address matches
a given source address. This method throws

UnsupportedOperationException

if the underlying platform does not support source filtering. Membership is

cumulative

and this method may be invoked again with the same group
and interface to allow receiving datagrams from other source addresses. The
method returns a

MembershipKey

that represents membership to receive
datagrams from the given source address. Invoking the key's

drop

method drops membership so that datagrams from the
source address can no longer be received.

Platform dependencies

The multicast implementation is intended to map directly to the native
multicasting facility. Consequently, the following items should be considered
when developing an application that receives IP multicast datagrams:

- The creation of the channel should specify the

ProtocolFamily

that corresponds to the address type of the multicast groups that the channel
will join. There is no guarantee that a channel to a socket in one protocol
family can join and receive multicast datagrams when the address of the
multicast group corresponds to another protocol family. For example, it is
implementation specific if a channel to an

IPv6

socket can join an

IPv4

multicast group and receive
multicast datagrams sent to the group.
- The channel's socket should be bound to the

wildcard

address. If the socket is bound to
a specific address, rather than the wildcard address then it is implementation
specific if multicast datagrams are received by the socket.
- The

SO_REUSEADDR

option should be
enabled prior to

binding

the socket. This is
required to allow multiple members of the group to bind to the same
address.

Usage Example:

```java
// join multicast group on this interface, and also use this
// interface for outgoing multicast datagrams
NetworkInterface ni = NetworkInterface.getByName("hme0");

DatagramChannel dc = DatagramChannel.open(StandardProtocolFamily.INET)
.setOption(StandardSocketOptions.SO_REUSEADDR, true)
.bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000))
.setOption(StandardSocketOptions.IP_MULTICAST_IF, ni);

InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("225.4.5.6");

MembershipKey key = dc.join(group, ni);

Closes this channel.

If the channel is a member of a multicast group then the membership
is

dropped

. Upon return, the

membership-key

will be

invalid

.

This method otherwise behaves exactly as specified by the

#### MembershipKey
join​(
InetAddress
group,

NetworkInterface
interf)
throws
IOException

Joins a multicast group to begin receiving all datagrams sent to the group,
returning a membership key.

If this channel is currently a member of the group on the given
interface to receive all datagrams then the membership key, representing
that membership, is returned. Otherwise this channel joins the group and
the resulting new membership key is returned. The resulting membership key
is not

source-specific

.

A multicast channel may join several multicast groups, including
the same group on more than one interface. An implementation may impose a
limit on the number of groups that may be joined at the same time.

**Parameters:**
- group

- The multicast address to join
- interf

- The network interface on which to join the group

**Returns:**
- The membership key

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the group parameter is not a

multicast

address, or the group parameter is an address type
that is not supported by this channel
- IllegalStateException

- If the channel already has source-specific membership of the
group on the interface
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If the channel's socket is not an Internet Protocol socket, or
the platform does not support multicasting
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- If a security manager is set, and its

checkMulticast

method denies access to the multiast group

---

#### MembershipKey
join​(
InetAddress
group,

NetworkInterface
interf,

InetAddress
source)
throws
IOException

Joins a multicast group to begin receiving datagrams sent to the group
from a given source address.

If this channel is currently a member of the group on the given
interface to receive datagrams from the given source address then the
membership key, representing that membership, is returned. Otherwise this
channel joins the group and the resulting new membership key is returned.
The resulting membership key is

source-specific

.

Membership is

cumulative

and this method may be invoked
again with the same group and interface to allow receiving datagrams sent
by other source addresses to the group.

**Parameters:**
- group

- The multicast address to join
- interf

- The network interface on which to join the group
- source

- The source address

**Returns:**
- The membership key

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the group parameter is not a

multicast

address, the
source parameter is not a unicast address, the group
parameter is an address type that is not supported by this channel,
or the source parameter is not the same address type as the group
- IllegalStateException

- If the channel is currently a member of the group on the given
interface to receive all datagrams
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If the channel's socket is not an Internet Protocol socket, or
source filtering is not supported, or the platform does not
support multicasting
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- If a security manager is set, and its

checkMulticast

method denies access to the multiast group

```

Joins a multicast group to begin receiving all datagrams sent to the group,
returning a membership key.

If this channel is currently a member of the group on the given
interface to receive all datagrams then the membership key, representing
that membership, is returned. Otherwise this channel joins the group and
the resulting new membership key is returned. The resulting membership key
is not

source-specific

.

A multicast channel may join several multicast groups, including
the same group on more than one interface. An implementation may impose a
limit on the number of groups that may be joined at the same time.

**Parameters:** group

- The multicast address to join
**Parameters:** interf

- The network interface on which to join the group
**Returns:** The membership key
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the group parameter is not a

multicast

address, or the group parameter is an address type
that is not supported by this channel
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If the channel already has source-specific membership of the
group on the interface
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the channel's socket is not an Internet Protocol socket, or
the platform does not support multicasting
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

checkMulticast

method denies access to the multiast group

- join

```java
MembershipKey
join​(
InetAddress
group,

NetworkInterface
interf,

InetAddress
source)
throws
IOException
```

Joins a multicast group to begin receiving datagrams sent to the group
from a given source address.

If this channel is currently a member of the group on the given
interface to receive datagrams from the given source address then the
membership key, representing that membership, is returned. Otherwise this
channel joins the group and the resulting new membership key is returned.
The resulting membership key is

source-specific

.

Membership is

cumulative

and this method may be invoked
again with the same group and interface to allow receiving datagrams sent
by other source addresses to the group.

**Parameters:** group

- The multicast address to join
**Parameters:** interf

- The network interface on which to join the group
**Parameters:** source

- The source address
**Returns:** The membership key
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the group parameter is not a

multicast

address, the
source parameter is not a unicast address, the group
parameter is an address type that is not supported by this channel,
or the source parameter is not the same address type as the group
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If the channel is currently a member of the group on the given
interface to receive all datagrams
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the channel's socket is not an Internet Protocol socket, or
source filtering is not supported, or the platform does not
support multicasting
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException
