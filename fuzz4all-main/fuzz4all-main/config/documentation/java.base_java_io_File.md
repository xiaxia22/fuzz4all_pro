### Class Description

```java
public class
File

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
,
Comparable
<
File
>
```

An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames.

User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent

pathname
strings

to name files and directories. This class presents an
abstract, system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames. An

abstract pathname

has two components:

- An optional system-dependent

prefix

string,
such as a disk-drive specifier,

"/"

for the UNIX root
directory, or

"\\\\"

for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and

A sequence of zero or more string

names

.

The first name in an abstract pathname may be a directory name or, in the
case of Microsoft Windows UNC pathnames, a hostname. Each subsequent name
in an abstract pathname denotes a directory; the last name may denote
either a directory or a file. The

empty

abstract pathname has no
prefix and an empty name sequence.

The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is
inherently system-dependent. When an abstract pathname is converted into a
pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy of
the default

separator character

. The default name-separator
character is defined by the system property

file.separator

, and
is made available in the public static fields

separator

and

separatorChar

of this class.
When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names
within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by any
other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system.

A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either

absolute

or

relative

. An absolute pathname is complete in
that no other information is required in order to locate the file that it
denotes. A relative pathname, in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of
information taken from some other pathname. By default the classes in the

java.io

package always resolve relative pathnames against the
current user directory. This directory is named by the system property

user.dir

, and is typically the directory in which the Java
virtual machine was invoked.

The

parent

of an abstract pathname may be obtained by invoking
the

getParent()

method of this class and consists of the pathname's
prefix and each name in the pathname's name sequence except for the last.
Each directory's absolute pathname is an ancestor of any

File

object with an absolute abstract pathname which begins with the directory's
absolute pathname. For example, the directory denoted by the abstract
pathname

"/usr"

is an ancestor of the directory denoted by the
pathname

"/usr/local/bin"

.

The prefix concept is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms,
and drive specifiers, root directories and UNC pathnames on Microsoft Windows platforms,
as follows:

- For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute pathname is always

"/"

. Relative pathnames have no prefix. The abstract pathname
denoting the root directory has the prefix

"/"

and an empty
name sequence.

For Microsoft Windows platforms, the prefix of a pathname that contains a drive
specifier consists of the drive letter followed by

":"

and
possibly followed by

"\\"

if the pathname is absolute. The
prefix of a UNC pathname is

"\\\\"

; the hostname and the share
name are the first two names in the name sequence. A relative pathname that
does not specify a drive has no prefix.

Instances of this class may or may not denote an actual file-system
object such as a file or a directory. If it does denote such an object
then that object resides in a

partition

. A partition is an
operating system-specific portion of storage for a file system. A single
storage device (e.g. a physical disk-drive, flash memory, CD-ROM) may
contain multiple partitions. The object, if any, will reside on the
partition

named

by some ancestor of the absolute
form of this pathname.

A file system may implement restrictions to certain operations on the
actual file-system object, such as reading, writing, and executing. These
restrictions are collectively known as

access permissions

. The file
system may have multiple sets of access permissions on a single object.
For example, one set may apply to the object's

owner

, and another
may apply to all other users. The access permissions on an object may
cause some methods in this class to fail.

Instances of the

File

class are immutable; that is, once
created, the abstract pathname represented by a

File

object
will never change.

Interoperability with

java.nio.file

package

The

java.nio.file

package defines interfaces and classes for the Java virtual machine to access
files, file attributes, and file systems. This API may be used to overcome
many of the limitations of the

java.io.File

class.
The

toPath

method may be used to obtain a

Path

that uses the abstract path represented by a

File

object to
locate a file. The resulting

Path

may be used with the

Files

class to provide more efficient and extensive access to
additional file operations, file attributes, and I/O exceptions to help
diagnose errors when an operation on a file fails.

### Field Details

#### public static final char separatorChar

The system-dependent default name-separator character. This field is
initialized to contain the first character of the value of the system
property

file.separator

. On UNIX systems the value of this
field is

'/'

; on Microsoft Windows systems it is

'\\'

.

**See Also:**
- System.getProperty(java.lang.String)

---

#### public static final
String
separator

The system-dependent default name-separator character, represented as a
string for convenience. This string contains a single character, namely

separatorChar

.

---

#### public static final char pathSeparatorChar

The system-dependent path-separator character. This field is
initialized to contain the first character of the value of the system
property

path.separator

. This character is used to
separate filenames in a sequence of files given as a

path list

.
On UNIX systems, this character is

':'

; on Microsoft Windows systems it
is

';'

.

**See Also:**
- System.getProperty(java.lang.String)

---

#### public static final
String
pathSeparator

The system-dependent path-separator character, represented as a string
for convenience. This string contains a single character, namely

pathSeparatorChar

.

---

### Constructor Details

#### public File​(
String
pathname)

Creates a new

File

instance by converting the given
pathname string into an abstract pathname. If the given string is
the empty string, then the result is the empty abstract pathname.

**Parameters:**
- pathname

- A pathname string

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If the

pathname

argument is

null

---

#### public File​(
String
parent,

String
child)

Creates a new

File

instance from a parent pathname string
and a child pathname string.

If

parent

is

null

then the new

File

instance is created as if by invoking the
single-argument

File

constructor on the given

child

pathname string.

Otherwise the

parent

pathname string is taken to denote
a directory, and the

child

pathname string is taken to
denote either a directory or a file. If the

child

pathname
string is absolute then it is converted into a relative pathname in a
system-dependent way. If

parent

is the empty string then
the new

File

instance is created by converting

child

into an abstract pathname and resolving the result
against a system-dependent default directory. Otherwise each pathname
string is converted into an abstract pathname and the child abstract
pathname is resolved against the parent.

**Parameters:**
- parent

- The parent pathname string
- child

- The child pathname string

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

child

is

null

---

#### public File​(
File
parent,

String
child)

Creates a new

File

instance from a parent abstract
pathname and a child pathname string.

If

parent

is

null

then the new

File

instance is created as if by invoking the
single-argument

File

constructor on the given

child

pathname string.

Otherwise the

parent

abstract pathname is taken to
denote a directory, and the

child

pathname string is taken
to denote either a directory or a file. If the

child

pathname string is absolute then it is converted into a relative
pathname in a system-dependent way. If

parent

is the empty
abstract pathname then the new

File

instance is created by
converting

child

into an abstract pathname and resolving
the result against a system-dependent default directory. Otherwise each
pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname and the child
abstract pathname is resolved against the parent.

**Parameters:**
- parent

- The parent abstract pathname
- child

- The child pathname string

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

child

is

null

---

#### public File​(
URI
uri)

Creates a new

File

instance by converting the given

file:

URI into an abstract pathname.

The exact form of a

file:

URI is system-dependent, hence
the transformation performed by this constructor is also
system-dependent.

For a given abstract pathname

f

it is guaranteed that

new File(

f

.

toURI

()).equals(

f

.

getAbsoluteFile

())

so long as the original abstract pathname, the URI, and the new abstract
pathname are all created in (possibly different invocations of) the same
Java virtual machine. This relationship typically does not hold,
however, when a

file:

URI that is created in a virtual machine
on one operating system is converted into an abstract pathname in a
virtual machine on a different operating system.

**Parameters:**
- uri

- An absolute, hierarchical URI with a scheme equal to

"file"

, a non-empty path component, and undefined
authority, query, and fragment components

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

uri

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameter do not hold

**See Also:**
- toURI()

,

URI

**Since:**
- 1.4

### Method Details

#### public
String
getName()

Returns the name of the file or directory denoted by this abstract
pathname. This is just the last name in the pathname's name
sequence. If the pathname's name sequence is empty, then the empty
string is returned.

**Returns:**
- The name of the file or directory denoted by this abstract
pathname, or the empty string if this pathname's name sequence
is empty

---

#### public
String
getParent()

Returns the pathname string of this abstract pathname's parent, or

null

if this pathname does not name a parent directory.

The

parent

of an abstract pathname consists of the
pathname's prefix, if any, and each name in the pathname's name
sequence except for the last. If the name sequence is empty then
the pathname does not name a parent directory.

**Returns:**
- The pathname string of the parent directory named by this
abstract pathname, or

null

if this pathname
does not name a parent

---

#### public
File
getParentFile()

Returns the abstract pathname of this abstract pathname's parent,
or

null

if this pathname does not name a parent
directory.

The

parent

of an abstract pathname consists of the
pathname's prefix, if any, and each name in the pathname's name
sequence except for the last. If the name sequence is empty then
the pathname does not name a parent directory.

**Returns:**
- The abstract pathname of the parent directory named by this
abstract pathname, or

null

if this pathname
does not name a parent

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public
String
getPath()

Converts this abstract pathname into a pathname string. The resulting
string uses the

default name-separator character

to
separate the names in the name sequence.

**Returns:**
- The string form of this abstract pathname

---

#### public boolean isAbsolute()

Tests whether this abstract pathname is absolute. The definition of
absolute pathname is system dependent. On UNIX systems, a pathname is
absolute if its prefix is

"/"

. On Microsoft Windows systems, a
pathname is absolute if its prefix is a drive specifier followed by

"\\"

, or if its prefix is

"\\\\"

.

**Returns:**
- true

if this abstract pathname is absolute,

false

otherwise

---

#### public
String
getAbsolutePath()

Returns the absolute pathname string of this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname is already absolute, then the pathname
string is simply returned as if by the

getPath()

method. If this abstract pathname is the empty abstract pathname then
the pathname string of the current user directory, which is named by the
system property

user.dir

, is returned. Otherwise this
pathname is resolved in a system-dependent way. On UNIX systems, a
relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current
user directory. On Microsoft Windows systems, a relative pathname is made absolute
by resolving it against the current directory of the drive named by the
pathname, if any; if not, it is resolved against the current user
directory.

**Returns:**
- The absolute pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed.

**See Also:**
- isAbsolute()

---

#### public
File
getAbsoluteFile()

Returns the absolute form of this abstract pathname. Equivalent to

new File(this.

getAbsolutePath()

)

.

**Returns:**
- The absolute abstract pathname denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed.

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public
String
getCanonicalPath()
throws
IOException

Returns the canonical pathname string of this abstract pathname.

A canonical pathname is both absolute and unique. The precise
definition of canonical form is system-dependent. This method first
converts this pathname to absolute form if necessary, as if by invoking the

getAbsolutePath()

method, and then maps it to its unique form in a
system-dependent way. This typically involves removing redundant names
such as

"."

and

".."

from the pathname, resolving
symbolic links (on UNIX platforms), and converting drive letters to a
standard case (on Microsoft Windows platforms).

Every pathname that denotes an existing file or directory has a
unique canonical form. Every pathname that denotes a nonexistent file
or directory also has a unique canonical form. The canonical form of
the pathname of a nonexistent file or directory may be different from
the canonical form of the same pathname after the file or directory is
created. Similarly, the canonical form of the pathname of an existing
file or directory may be different from the canonical form of the same
pathname after the file or directory is deleted.

**Returns:**
- The canonical pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs, which is possible because the
construction of the canonical pathname may require
filesystem queries
- SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed, or
if a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.io.FileDescriptor)

method denies
read access to the file

**See Also:**
- Path.toRealPath(java.nio.file.LinkOption...)

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### public
File
getCanonicalFile()
throws
IOException

Returns the canonical form of this abstract pathname. Equivalent to

new File(this.

getCanonicalPath()

)

.

**Returns:**
- The canonical pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs, which is possible because the
construction of the canonical pathname may require
filesystem queries
- SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed, or
if a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.io.FileDescriptor)

method denies
read access to the file

**See Also:**
- Path.toRealPath(java.nio.file.LinkOption...)

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### @Deprecated

public
URL
toURL()
throws
MalformedURLException

Converts this abstract pathname into a

file:

URL. The
exact form of the URL is system-dependent. If it can be determined that
the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a directory, then the
resulting URL will end with a slash.

**Returns:**
- A URL object representing the equivalent file URL

**Throws:**
- MalformedURLException

- If the path cannot be parsed as a URL

**See Also:**
- toURI()

,

URI

,

URI.toURL()

,

URL

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public
URI
toURI()

Constructs a

file:

URI that represents this abstract pathname.

The exact form of the URI is system-dependent. If it can be
determined that the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a
directory, then the resulting URI will end with a slash.

For a given abstract pathname

f

, it is guaranteed that

new

File

(

f

.toURI()).equals(

f

.

getAbsoluteFile

())

so long as the original abstract pathname, the URI, and the new abstract
pathname are all created in (possibly different invocations of) the same
Java virtual machine. Due to the system-dependent nature of abstract
pathnames, however, this relationship typically does not hold when a

file:

URI that is created in a virtual machine on one operating
system is converted into an abstract pathname in a virtual machine on a
different operating system.

Note that when this abstract pathname represents a UNC pathname then
all components of the UNC (including the server name component) are encoded
in the

URI

path. The authority component is undefined, meaning
that it is represented as

null

. The

Path

class defines the

toUri

method to encode the server name in the authority
component of the resulting

URI

. The

toPath

method
may be used to obtain a

Path

representing this abstract pathname.

**Returns:**
- An absolute, hierarchical URI with a scheme equal to

"file"

, a path representing this abstract pathname,
and undefined authority, query, and fragment components

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot
be accessed.

**See Also:**
- File(java.net.URI)

,

URI

,

URI.toURL()

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public boolean canRead()

Tests whether the application can read the file denoted by this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to read
files that are marked as unreadable. Consequently this method may return

true

even though the file does not have read permissions.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the file specified by this
abstract pathname exists

and

can be read by the
application;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

---

#### public boolean canWrite()

Tests whether the application can modify the file denoted by this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to modify
files that are marked read-only. Consequently this method may return

true

even though the file is marked read-only.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the file system actually
contains a file denoted by this abstract pathname

and

the application is allowed to write to the file;

false

otherwise.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file

---

#### public boolean exists()

Tests whether the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname
exists.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the file or directory denoted
by this abstract pathname exists;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file or directory

---

#### public boolean isDirectory()

Tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a
directory.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that the file is not a directory, or where several attributes of the
same file are required at the same time, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the file denoted by this
abstract pathname exists

and

is a directory;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

---

#### public boolean isFile()

Tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a normal
file. A file is

normal

if it is not a directory and, in
addition, satisfies other system-dependent criteria. Any non-directory
file created by a Java application is guaranteed to be a normal file.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that the file is not a normal file, or where several attributes of the
same file are required at the same time, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the file denoted by this
abstract pathname exists

and

is a normal file;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

---

#### public boolean isHidden()

Tests whether the file named by this abstract pathname is a hidden
file. The exact definition of

hidden

is system-dependent. On
UNIX systems, a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with
a period character (

'.'

). On Microsoft Windows systems, a file is
considered to be hidden if it has been marked as such in the filesystem.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the file denoted by this
abstract pathname is hidden according to the conventions of the
underlying platform

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public long lastModified()

Returns the time that the file denoted by this abstract pathname was
last modified.

**Returns:**
- A

long

value representing the time the file was
last modified, measured in milliseconds since the epoch
(00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970), or

0L

if the
file does not exist or if an I/O error occurs. The value may
be negative indicating the number of milliseconds before the
epoch

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

**API Note:**
- While the unit of time of the return value is milliseconds, the
granularity of the value depends on the underlying file system and may
be larger. For example, some file systems use time stamps in units of
seconds.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
where

0L

is returned, or where several attributes of the
same file are required at the same time, or where the time of last
access or the creation time are required, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used. If however only the
time of last modification is required, then the

Files.getLastModifiedTime

method may be used instead.

---

#### public long length()

Returns the length of the file denoted by this abstract pathname.
The return value is unspecified if this pathname denotes a directory.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that

0L

is returned, or where several attributes of the same file
are required at the same time, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used.

**Returns:**
- The length, in bytes, of the file denoted by this abstract
pathname, or

0L

if the file does not exist. Some
operating systems may return

0L

for pathnames
denoting system-dependent entities such as devices or pipes.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

---

#### public boolean createNewFile()
throws
IOException

Atomically creates a new, empty file named by this abstract pathname if
and only if a file with this name does not yet exist. The check for the
existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
are a single operation that is atomic with respect to all other
filesystem activities that might affect the file.

Note: this method should

not

be used for file-locking, as
the resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The

FileLock

facility should be used instead.

**Returns:**
- true

if the named file does not exist and was
successfully created;

false

if the named file
already exists

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurred
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean delete()

Deletes the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname. If
this pathname denotes a directory, then the directory must be empty in
order to be deleted.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

delete

method to throw an

IOException

when a file cannot be deleted. This is useful for error reporting and to
diagnose why a file cannot be deleted.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the file or directory is
successfully deleted;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkDelete(java.lang.String)

method denies
delete access to the file

---

#### public void deleteOnExit()

Requests that the file or directory denoted by this abstract
pathname be deleted when the virtual machine terminates.
Files (or directories) are deleted in the reverse order that
they are registered. Invoking this method to delete a file or
directory that is already registered for deletion has no effect.
Deletion will be attempted only for normal termination of the
virtual machine, as defined by the Java Language Specification.

Once deletion has been requested, it is not possible to cancel the
request. This method should therefore be used with care.

Note: this method should

not

be used for file-locking, as
the resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The

FileLock

facility should be used instead.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkDelete(java.lang.String)

method denies
delete access to the file

**See Also:**
- delete()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public
String
[] list()

Returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, then this
method returns

null

. Otherwise an array of strings is
returned, one for each file or directory in the directory. Names
denoting the directory itself and the directory's parent directory are
not included in the result. Each string is a file name rather than a
complete path.

There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array
will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular,
guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

newDirectoryStream

method to
open a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the directory.
This may use less resources when working with very large directories, and
may be more responsive when working with remote directories.

**Returns:**
- An array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname. The array will be
empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if
this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, or if an
I/O error occurs.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory

---

#### public
String
[] list​(
FilenameFilter
filter)

Returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname that satisfy the specified
filter. The behavior of this method is the same as that of the

list()

method, except that the strings in the returned array
must satisfy the filter. If the given

filter

is

null

then all names are accepted. Otherwise, a name satisfies the filter if
and only if the value

true

results when the

FilenameFilter.accept(File, String)

method
of the filter is invoked on this abstract pathname and the name of a
file or directory in the directory that it denotes.

**Parameters:**
- filter

- A filename filter

**Returns:**
- An array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname that were accepted
by the given

filter

. The array will be empty if the
directory is empty or if no names were accepted by the filter.
Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote
a directory, or if an I/O error occurs.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory

**See Also:**
- Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,String)

---

#### public
File
[] listFiles()

Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, then this
method returns

null

. Otherwise an array of

File

objects
is returned, one for each file or directory in the directory. Pathnames
denoting the directory itself and the directory's parent directory are
not included in the result. Each resulting abstract pathname is
constructed from this abstract pathname using the

File(File, String)

constructor. Therefore if this
pathname is absolute then each resulting pathname is absolute; if this
pathname is relative then each resulting pathname will be relative to
the same directory.

There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array
will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular,
guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

newDirectoryStream

method
to open a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the
directory. This may use less resources when working with very large
directories.

**Returns:**
- An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
The array will be empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote a
directory, or if an I/O error occurs.

**Throws:**

#### public
File
[] listFiles​(
FilenameFilter
filter)

Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname that
satisfy the specified filter. The behavior of this method is the same
as that of the

listFiles()

method, except that the pathnames in
the returned array must satisfy the filter. If the given

filter

is

null

then all pathnames are accepted. Otherwise, a pathname
satisfies the filter if and only if the value

true

results when
the

FilenameFilter.accept(File, String)

method of the filter is
invoked on this abstract pathname and the name of a file or directory in
the directory that it denotes.

**Parameters:**
- filter

- A filename filter

**Returns:**
- An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
The array will be empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote a
directory, or if an I/O error occurs.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory

**See Also:**
- Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,String)

**Since:**
- 1.2

#### public
File
[] listFiles​(
FileFilter
filter)

Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname that
satisfy the specified filter. The behavior of this method is the same
as that of the

listFiles()

method, except that the pathnames in
the returned array must satisfy the filter. If the given

filter

is

null

then all pathnames are accepted. Otherwise, a pathname
satisfies the filter if and only if the value

true

results when
the

FileFilter.accept(File)

method of the
filter is invoked on the pathname.

**Parameters:**
- filter

- A file filter

**Returns:**
- An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
The array will be empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote a
directory, or if an I/O error occurs.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory

**See Also:**
- Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,java.nio.file.DirectoryStream.Filter)

**Since:**
- 1.2

#### public boolean mkdir()

Creates the directory named by this abstract pathname.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the directory was
created;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not permit the named directory to be created

---

#### public boolean mkdirs()

Creates the directory named by this abstract pathname, including any
necessary but nonexistent parent directories. Note that if this
operation fails it may have succeeded in creating some of the necessary
parent directories.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the directory was created,
along with all necessary parent directories;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method does not permit verification of the existence of the
named directory and all necessary parent directories; or if
the

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not permit the named directory and all necessary
parent directories to be created

---

#### public boolean renameTo​(
File
dest)

Renames the file denoted by this abstract pathname.

Many aspects of the behavior of this method are inherently
platform-dependent: The rename operation might not be able to move a
file from one filesystem to another, it might not be atomic, and it
might not succeed if a file with the destination abstract pathname
already exists. The return value should always be checked to make sure
that the rename operation was successful.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

move

method to move or rename a file in a
platform independent manner.

**Parameters:**
- dest

- The new abstract pathname for the named file

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the renaming succeeded;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to either the old or new pathnames
- NullPointerException

- If parameter

dest

is

null

---

#### public boolean setLastModified​(long time)

Sets the last-modified time of the file or directory named by this
abstract pathname.

All platforms support file-modification times to the nearest second,
but some provide more precision. The argument will be truncated to fit
the supported precision. If the operation succeeds and no intervening
operations on the file take place, then the next invocation of the

lastModified()

method will return the (possibly
truncated)

time

argument that was passed to this method.

**Parameters:**
- time

- The new last-modified time, measured in milliseconds since
the epoch (00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970)

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the operation succeeded;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the argument is negative
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the named file

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean setReadOnly()

Marks the file or directory named by this abstract pathname so that
only read operations are allowed. After invoking this method the file
or directory will not change until it is either deleted or marked
to allow write access. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to modify
files that are marked read-only. Whether or not a read-only file or
directory may be deleted depends upon the underlying system.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the operation succeeded;

false

otherwise

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the named file

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean setWritable​(boolean writable,
boolean ownerOnly)

Sets the owner's or everybody's write permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to modify files that
disallow write operations.

The

Files

class defines methods that operate on
file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
manipulation of file permissions is required.

**Parameters:**
- writable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow write
operations; if

false

to disallow write operations
- ownerOnly

- If

true

, the write permission applies only to the
owner's write permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody. If
the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's write
permission from that of others, then the permission will apply to
everybody, regardless of this value.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to change
the access permissions of this abstract pathname.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the named file

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public boolean setWritable​(boolean writable)

A convenience method to set the owner's write permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to modify files that
disallow write operations.

An invocation of this method of the form

file.setWritable(arg)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
file.setWritable(arg, true)
```

**Parameters:**
- writable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow write
operations; if

false

to disallow write operations

method denies write access to the file

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public boolean setReadable​(boolean readable,
boolean ownerOnly)

Sets the owner's or everybody's read permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to read files that are
marked as unreadable.

The

Files

class defines methods that operate on
file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
manipulation of file permissions is required.

**Parameters:**
- readable

true

, the read permission applies only to the
owner's read permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody. If
the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's read
permission from that of others, then the permission will apply to
everybody, regardless of this value.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

readable

is

false

#### public boolean setReadable​(boolean readable)

A convenience method to set the owner's read permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to read files that are
marked as unreadable.

An invocation of this method of the form

file.setReadable(arg)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
file.setReadable(arg, true)
```

**Parameters:**
- readable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow read
operations; if

false

to disallow read operations

**Returns:**

method denies write access to the file

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public boolean setExecutable​(boolean executable,
boolean ownerOnly)

Sets the owner's or everybody's execute permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to execute files that are
not marked executable.

The

Files

class defines methods that operate on
file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
manipulation of file permissions is required.

**Parameters:**
- executable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow execute
operations; if

false

to disallow execute operations
- ownerOnly

- If

true

, the execute permission applies only to the
owner's execute permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody.
If the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's
execute permission from that of others, then the permission will
apply to everybody, regardless of this value.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

executable

is

false

and the underlying
file system does not implement an execute permission, then the
operation will fail.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public boolean setExecutable​(boolean executable)

A convenience method to set the owner's execute permission for this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java
virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to execute files
that are not marked executable.

An invocation of this method of the form

file.setExcutable(arg)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
file.setExecutable(arg, true)
```

**Parameters:**
- executable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow execute
operations; if

false

to disallow execute operations

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

executable

is

false

and the underlying
file system does not implement an execute permission, then the
operation will fail.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public boolean canExecute()

Tests whether the application can execute the file denoted by this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to execute
files that are not marked executable. Consequently this method may return

true

even though the file does not have execute permissions.

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the abstract pathname exists

and

the application is allowed to execute the file

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkExec(java.lang.String)

method denies execute access to the file

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public static
File
[] listRoots()

List the available filesystem roots.

A particular Java platform may support zero or more
hierarchically-organized file systems. Each file system has a

root

directory from which all other files in that file system
can be reached. Windows platforms, for example, have a root directory
for each active drive; UNIX platforms have a single root directory,
namely

"/"

. The set of available filesystem roots is affected
by various system-level operations such as the insertion or ejection of
removable media and the disconnecting or unmounting of physical or
virtual disk drives.

This method returns an array of

File

objects that denote the
root directories of the available filesystem roots. It is guaranteed
that the canonical pathname of any file physically present on the local
machine will begin with one of the roots returned by this method.

The canonical pathname of a file that resides on some other machine
and is accessed via a remote-filesystem protocol such as SMB or NFS may
or may not begin with one of the roots returned by this method. If the
pathname of a remote file is syntactically indistinguishable from the
pathname of a local file then it will begin with one of the roots
returned by this method. Thus, for example,

File

objects
denoting the root directories of the mapped network drives of a Windows
platform will be returned by this method, while

File

objects
containing UNC pathnames will not be returned by this method.

Unlike most methods in this class, this method does not throw
security exceptions. If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to a
particular root directory, then that directory will not appear in the
result.

**Returns:**
- An array of

File

objects denoting the available
filesystem roots, or

null

if the set of roots could not
be determined. The array will be empty if there are no
filesystem roots.

**See Also:**
- FileStore

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public long getTotalSpace()

Returns the size of the partition

named

by this
abstract pathname.

**Returns:**
- The size, in bytes, of the partition or

0L

if this
abstract pathname does not name a partition

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

RuntimePermission

("getFileSystemAttributes")

or its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies
read access to the file named by this abstract pathname

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public long getFreeSpace()

Returns the number of unallocated bytes in the partition

named

by this abstract path name.

The returned number of unallocated bytes is a hint, but not
a guarantee, that it is possible to use most or any of these
bytes. The number of unallocated bytes is most likely to be
accurate immediately after this call. It is likely to be made
inaccurate by any external I/O operations including those made
on the system outside of this virtual machine. This method
makes no guarantee that write operations to this file system
will succeed.

**Returns:**
- The number of unallocated bytes on the partition or

0L

if the abstract pathname does not name a partition. This
value will be less than or equal to the total file system size
returned by

getTotalSpace()

.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

RuntimePermission

("getFileSystemAttributes")

or its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies
read access to the file named by this abstract pathname

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public long getUsableSpace()

Returns the number of bytes available to this virtual machine on the
partition

named

by this abstract pathname. When
possible, this method checks for write permissions and other operating
system restrictions and will therefore usually provide a more accurate
estimate of how much new data can actually be written than

getFreeSpace()

.

The returned number of available bytes is a hint, but not a
guarantee, that it is possible to use most or any of these bytes. The
number of unallocated bytes is most likely to be accurate immediately
after this call. It is likely to be made inaccurate by any external
I/O operations including those made on the system outside of this
virtual machine. This method makes no guarantee that write operations
to this file system will succeed.

**Returns:**
- The number of available bytes on the partition or

0L

if the abstract pathname does not name a partition. On
systems where this information is not available, this method
will be equivalent to a call to

getFreeSpace()

.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

RuntimePermission

("getFileSystemAttributes")

or its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies
read access to the file named by this abstract pathname

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public static
File
createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix,

File
directory)
throws
IOException

Creates a new empty file in the specified directory, using the
given prefix and suffix strings to generate its name. If this method
returns successfully then it is guaranteed that:

- The file denoted by the returned abstract pathname did not exist
before this method was invoked, and

Neither this method nor any of its variants will return the same
abstract pathname again in the current invocation of the virtual
machine.

This method provides only part of a temporary-file facility. To arrange
for a file created by this method to be deleted automatically, use the

deleteOnExit()

method.

The

prefix

argument must be at least three characters
long. It is recommended that the prefix be a short, meaningful string
such as

"hjb"

or

"mail"

. The

suffix

argument may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used.

To create the new file, the prefix and the suffix may first be
adjusted to fit the limitations of the underlying platform. If the
prefix is too long then it will be truncated, but its first three
characters will always be preserved. If the suffix is too long then it
too will be truncated, but if it begins with a period character
(

'.'

) then the period and the first three characters
following it will always be preserved. Once these adjustments have been
made the name of the new file will be generated by concatenating the
prefix, five or more internally-generated characters, and the suffix.

If the

directory

argument is

null

then the
system-dependent default temporary-file directory will be used. The
default temporary-file directory is specified by the system property

java.io.tmpdir

. On UNIX systems the default value of this
property is typically

"/tmp"

or

"/var/tmp"

; on
Microsoft Windows systems it is typically

"C:\\WINNT\\TEMP"

. A different
value may be given to this system property when the Java virtual machine
is invoked, but programmatic changes to this property are not guaranteed
to have any effect upon the temporary directory used by this method.

**Parameters:**
- prefix

- The prefix string to be used in generating the file's
name; must be at least three characters long
- suffix

- The suffix string to be used in generating the file's
name; may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used
- directory

- The directory in which the file is to be created, or

null

if the default temporary-file
directory is to be used

**Returns:**
- An abstract pathname denoting a newly-created empty file

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the

prefix

argument contains fewer than three
characters
- IOException

- If a file could not be created
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not allow a file to be created

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public static
File
createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix)
throws
IOException

Creates an empty file in the default temporary-file directory, using
the given prefix and suffix to generate its name. Invoking this method
is equivalent to invoking

createTempFile(prefix, suffix, null)

.

The

Files.createTempFile

method provides an alternative method to create an
empty file in the temporary-file directory. Files created by that method
may have more restrictive access permissions to files created by this
method and so may be more suited to security-sensitive applications.

**Parameters:**
- prefix

- The prefix string to be used in generating the file's
name; must be at least three characters long
- suffix

- The suffix string to be used in generating the file's
name; may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used

**Returns:**
- An abstract pathname denoting a newly-created empty file

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the

prefix

argument contains fewer than three
characters
- IOException

- If a file could not be created
- SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not allow a file to be created

#### public int compareTo​(
File
pathname)

Compares two abstract pathnames lexicographically. The ordering
defined by this method depends upon the underlying system. On UNIX
systems, alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows
systems it is not.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

File

>

**Parameters:**
- pathname

- The abstract pathname to be compared to this abstract
pathname

**Returns:**
- Zero if the argument is equal to this abstract pathname, a
value less than zero if this abstract pathname is
lexicographically less than the argument, or a value greater
than zero if this abstract pathname is lexicographically
greater than the argument

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Tests this abstract pathname for equality with the given object.
Returns

true

if and only if the argument is not

null

and is an abstract pathname that denotes the same file
or directory as this abstract pathname. Whether or not two abstract
pathnames are equal depends upon the underlying system. On UNIX
systems, alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows
systems it is not.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- The object to be compared with this abstract pathname

**Returns:**
- true

if and only if the objects are the same;

false

otherwise

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### public int hashCode()

Computes a hash code for this abstract pathname. Because equality of
abstract pathnames is inherently system-dependent, so is the computation
of their hash codes. On UNIX systems, the hash code of an abstract
pathname is equal to the exclusive

or

of the hash code
of its pathname string and the decimal value

1234321

. On Microsoft Windows systems, the hash
code is equal to the exclusive

or

of the hash code of
its pathname string converted to lower case and the decimal
value

1234321

. Locale is not taken into account on
lowercasing the pathname string.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- A hash code for this abstract pathname

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

#### public
String
toString()

Returns the pathname string of this abstract pathname. This is just the
string returned by the

getPath()

method.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- The string form of this abstract pathname

---

#### public
Path
toPath()

Returns a

java.nio.file.Path

object constructed from
this abstract path. The resulting

Path

is associated with the

default-filesystem

.

The first invocation of this method works as if invoking it were
equivalent to evaluating the expression:

```java
FileSystems.getDefault
().
getPath
(this.
getPath
());
```

Subsequent invocations of this method return the same

Path

.

If this abstract pathname is the empty abstract pathname then this
method returns a

Path

that may be used to access the current
user directory.

**Returns:**
- a

Path

constructed from this abstract path

**Throws:**
- InvalidPathException

- if a

Path

object cannot be constructed from the abstract
path (see

FileSystem.getPath

)

An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames.

User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent

pathname
strings

to name files and directories. This class presents an
abstract, system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames. An

abstract pathname

has two components:

- An optional system-dependent

prefix

string,
such as a disk-drive specifier,

"/"

for the UNIX root
directory, or

"\\\\"

for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and

A sequence of zero or more string

names

.

The first name in an abstract pathname may be a directory name or, in the
case of Microsoft Windows UNC pathnames, a hostname. Each subsequent name
in an abstract pathname denotes a directory; the last name may denote
either a directory or a file. The

empty

abstract pathname has no
prefix and an empty name sequence.

The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is
inherently system-dependent. When an abstract pathname is converted into a
pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy of
the default

separator character

. The default name-separator
character is defined by the system property

file.separator

, and
is made available in the public static fields

separator

and

separatorChar

of this class.
When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names
within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by any
other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system.

A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either

absolute

or

relative

. An absolute pathname is complete in
that no other information is required in order to locate the file that it
denotes. A relative pathname, in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of
information taken from some other pathname. By default the classes in the

java.io

package always resolve relative pathnames against the
current user directory. This directory is named by the system property

user.dir

, and is typically the directory in which the Java
virtual machine was invoked.

The

parent

of an abstract pathname may be obtained by invoking
the

getParent()

method of this class and consists of the pathname's
prefix and each name in the pathname's name sequence except for the last.
Each directory's absolute pathname is an ancestor of any

File

object with an absolute abstract pathname which begins with the directory's
absolute pathname. For example, the directory denoted by the abstract
pathname

"/usr"

is an ancestor of the directory denoted by the
pathname

"/usr/local/bin"

.

The prefix concept is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms,
and drive specifiers, root directories and UNC pathnames on Microsoft Windows platforms,
as follows:

- For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute pathname is always

"/"

. Relative pathnames have no prefix. The abstract pathname
denoting the root directory has the prefix

"/"

and an empty
name sequence.

For Microsoft Windows platforms, the prefix of a pathname that contains a drive
specifier consists of the drive letter followed by

":"

and
possibly followed by

"\\"

if the pathname is absolute. The
prefix of a UNC pathname is

"\\\\"

; the hostname and the share
name are the first two names in the name sequence. A relative pathname that
does not specify a drive has no prefix.

Instances of this class may or may not denote an actual file-system
object such as a file or a directory. If it does denote such an object
then that object resides in a

partition

. A partition is an
operating system-specific portion of storage for a file system. A single
storage device (e.g. a physical disk-drive, flash memory, CD-ROM) may
contain multiple partitions. The object, if any, will reside on the
partition

named

by some ancestor of the absolute
form of this pathname.

A file system may implement restrictions to certain operations on the
actual file-system object, such as reading, writing, and executing. These
restrictions are collectively known as

access permissions

. The file
system may have multiple sets of access permissions on a single object.
For example, one set may apply to the object's

owner

, and another
may apply to all other users. The access permissions on an object may
cause some methods in this class to fail.

An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames.

User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent

pathname
strings

to name files and directories. This class presents an
abstract, system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames. An

abstract pathname

has two components:

- An optional system-dependent

prefix

string,
such as a disk-drive specifier,

"/"

for the UNIX root
directory, or

"\\\\"

for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and

A sequence of zero or more string

names

.

The first name in an abstract pathname may be a directory name or, in the
case of Microsoft Windows UNC pathnames, a hostname. Each subsequent name
in an abstract pathname denotes a directory; the last name may denote
either a directory or a file. The

empty

abstract pathname has no
prefix and an empty name sequence.

The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is
inherently system-dependent. When an abstract pathname is converted into a
pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy of
the default

separator character

. The default name-separator
character is defined by the system property

file.separator

, and
is made available in the public static fields

separator

and

separatorChar

of this class.
When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names
within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by any
other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system.

A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either

absolute

or

relative

. An absolute pathname is complete in
that no other information is required in order to locate the file that it
denotes. A relative pathname, in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of
information taken from some other pathname. By default the classes in the

java.io

package always resolve relative pathnames against the
current user directory. This directory is named by the system property

user.dir

, and is typically the directory in which the Java
virtual machine was invoked.

The

parent

of an abstract pathname may be obtained by invoking
the

getParent()

method of this class and consists of the pathname's
prefix and each name in the pathname's name sequence except for the last.
Each directory's absolute pathname is an ancestor of any

File

object with an absolute abstract pathname which begins with the directory's
absolute pathname. For example, the directory denoted by the abstract
pathname

"/usr"

is an ancestor of the directory denoted by the
pathname

"/usr/local/bin"

.

The prefix concept is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms,
and drive specifiers, root directories and UNC pathnames on Microsoft Windows platforms,
as follows:

- For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute pathname is always

"/"

. Relative pathnames have no prefix. The abstract pathname
denoting the root directory has the prefix

"/"

and an empty
name sequence.

For Microsoft Windows platforms, the prefix of a pathname that contains a drive
specifier consists of the drive letter followed by

":"

and
possibly followed by

"\\"

if the pathname is absolute. The
prefix of a UNC pathname is

"\\\\"

; the hostname and the share
name are the first two names in the name sequence. A relative pathname that
does not specify a drive has no prefix.

Instances of this class may or may not denote an actual file-system
object such as a file or a directory. If it does denote such an object
then that object resides in a

partition

. A partition is an
operating system-specific portion of storage for a file system. A single
storage device (e.g. a physical disk-drive, flash memory, CD-ROM) may
contain multiple partitions. The object, if any, will reside on the
partition

named

by some ancestor of the absolute
form of this pathname.

A file system may implement restrictions to certain operations on the
actual file-system object, such as reading, writing, and executing. These
restrictions are collectively known as

access permissions

. The file
system may have multiple sets of access permissions on a single object.
For example, one set may apply to the object's

owner

, and another
may apply to all other users. The access permissions on an object may
cause some methods in this class to fail.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- File

```java
public File​(
String
pathname)
```

Creates a new

File

instance by converting the given
pathname string into an abstract pathname. If the given string is
the empty string, then the result is the empty abstract pathname.

**Parameters:** pathname

- A pathname string
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If the

pathname

argument is

null

- File

```java
public File​(
String
parent,

String
child)
```

Creates a new

File

instance from a parent pathname string
and a child pathname string.

If

parent

is

null

then the new

File

instance is created as if by invoking the
single-argument

File

constructor on the given

child

pathname string.

Otherwise the

parent

pathname string is taken to denote
a directory, and the

child

pathname string is taken to
denote either a directory or a file. If the

child

pathname
string is absolute then it is converted into a relative pathname in a
system-dependent way. If

parent

is the empty string then
the new

File

instance is created by converting

child

into an abstract pathname and resolving the result
against a system-dependent default directory. Otherwise each pathname
string is converted into an abstract pathname and the child abstract
pathname is resolved against the parent.

**Parameters:** parent

- The parent pathname string
**Parameters:** child

- The child pathname string
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

child

is

null

- File

```java
public File​(
File
parent,

String
child)
```

Creates a new

File

instance from a parent abstract
pathname and a child pathname string.

If

parent

is

null

then the new

File

instance is created as if by invoking the
single-argument

File

constructor on the given

child

pathname string.

Otherwise the

parent

abstract pathname is taken to
denote a directory, and the

child

pathname string is taken
to denote either a directory or a file. If the

child

pathname string is absolute then it is converted into a relative
pathname in a system-dependent way. If

parent

is the empty
abstract pathname then the new

File

instance is created by
converting

child

into an abstract pathname and resolving
the result against a system-dependent default directory. Otherwise each
pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname and the child
abstract pathname is resolved against the parent.

**Parameters:** parent

- The parent abstract pathname
**Parameters:** child

- The child pathname string
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

child

is

null

- File

```java
public File​(
URI
uri)
```

Creates a new

File

instance by converting the given

file:

URI into an abstract pathname.

The exact form of a

file:

URI is system-dependent, hence
the transformation performed by this constructor is also
system-dependent.

For a given abstract pathname

f

it is guaranteed that

new File(

f

.

toURI

()).equals(

f

.

getAbsoluteFile

())

so long as the original abstract pathname, the URI, and the new abstract
pathname are all created in (possibly different invocations of) the same
Java virtual machine. This relationship typically does not hold,
however, when a

file:

URI that is created in a virtual machine
on one operating system is converted into an abstract pathname in a
virtual machine on a different operating system.

**Parameters:** uri

- An absolute, hierarchical URI with a scheme equal to

"file"

, a non-empty path component, and undefined
authority, query, and fragment components
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

uri

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameter do not hold
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** toURI()

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getName

```java
public
String
getName()
```

Returns the name of the file or directory denoted by this abstract
pathname. This is just the last name in the pathname's name
sequence. If the pathname's name sequence is empty, then the empty
string is returned.

**Returns:** The name of the file or directory denoted by this abstract
pathname, or the empty string if this pathname's name sequence
is empty

- getParent

```java
public
String
getParent()
```

Returns the pathname string of this abstract pathname's parent, or

null

if this pathname does not name a parent directory.

The

parent

of an abstract pathname consists of the
pathname's prefix, if any, and each name in the pathname's name
sequence except for the last. If the name sequence is empty then
the pathname does not name a parent directory.

**Returns:** The pathname string of the parent directory named by this
abstract pathname, or

null

if this pathname
does not name a parent

- getParentFile

```java
public
File
getParentFile()
```

Returns the abstract pathname of this abstract pathname's parent,
or

null

if this pathname does not name a parent
directory.

The

parent

of an abstract pathname consists of the
pathname's prefix, if any, and each name in the pathname's name
sequence except for the last. If the name sequence is empty then
the pathname does not name a parent directory.

**Returns:** The abstract pathname of the parent directory named by this
abstract pathname, or

null

if this pathname
does not name a parent
**Since:** 1.2

- getPath

```java
public
String
getPath()
```

Converts this abstract pathname into a pathname string. The resulting
string uses the

default name-separator character

to
separate the names in the name sequence.

**Returns:** The string form of this abstract pathname

- isAbsolute

```java
public boolean isAbsolute()
```

Tests whether this abstract pathname is absolute. The definition of
absolute pathname is system dependent. On UNIX systems, a pathname is
absolute if its prefix is

"/"

. On Microsoft Windows systems, a
pathname is absolute if its prefix is a drive specifier followed by

"\\"

, or if its prefix is

"\\\\"

.

**Returns:** true

if this abstract pathname is absolute,

false

otherwise

- getAbsolutePath

```java
public
String
getAbsolutePath()
```

Returns the absolute pathname string of this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname is already absolute, then the pathname
string is simply returned as if by the

getPath()

method. If this abstract pathname is the empty abstract pathname then
the pathname string of the current user directory, which is named by the
system property

user.dir

, is returned. Otherwise this
pathname is resolved in a system-dependent way. On UNIX systems, a
relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current
user directory. On Microsoft Windows systems, a relative pathname is made absolute
by resolving it against the current directory of the drive named by the
pathname, if any; if not, it is resolved against the current user
directory.

**Returns:** The absolute pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed.
**See Also:** isAbsolute()

- getAbsoluteFile

```java
public
File
getAbsoluteFile()
```

Returns the absolute form of this abstract pathname. Equivalent to

new File(this.

getAbsolutePath()

)

.

**Returns:** The absolute abstract pathname denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed.
**Since:** 1.2

- getCanonicalPath

```java
public
String
getCanonicalPath()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the canonical pathname string of this abstract pathname.

A canonical pathname is both absolute and unique. The precise
definition of canonical form is system-dependent. This method first
converts this pathname to absolute form if necessary, as if by invoking the

getAbsolutePath()

method, and then maps it to its unique form in a
system-dependent way. This typically involves removing redundant names
such as

"."

and

".."

from the pathname, resolving
symbolic links (on UNIX platforms), and converting drive letters to a
standard case (on Microsoft Windows platforms).

Every pathname that denotes an existing file or directory has a
unique canonical form. Every pathname that denotes a nonexistent file
or directory also has a unique canonical form. The canonical form of
the pathname of a nonexistent file or directory may be different from
the canonical form of the same pathname after the file or directory is
created. Similarly, the canonical form of the pathname of an existing
file or directory may be different from the canonical form of the same
pathname after the file or directory is deleted.

**Returns:** The canonical pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs, which is possible because the
construction of the canonical pathname may require
filesystem queries
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed, or
if a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.io.FileDescriptor)

method denies
read access to the file
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** Path.toRealPath(java.nio.file.LinkOption...)

- getCanonicalFile

```java
public
File
getCanonicalFile()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the canonical form of this abstract pathname. Equivalent to

new File(this.

getCanonicalPath()

)

.

**Returns:** The canonical pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs, which is possible because the
construction of the canonical pathname may require
filesystem queries
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed, or
if a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.io.FileDescriptor)

method denies
read access to the file
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Path.toRealPath(java.nio.file.LinkOption...)

- toURL

```java
@Deprecated

public
URL
toURL()
throws
MalformedURLException
```

Deprecated.

This method does not automatically escape characters that
are illegal in URLs. It is recommended that new code convert an
abstract pathname into a URL by first converting it into a URI, via the

toURI

method, and then converting the URI into a URL
via the

URI.toURL

method.

Converts this abstract pathname into a

file:

URL. The
exact form of the URL is system-dependent. If it can be determined that
the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a directory, then the
resulting URL will end with a slash.

**Returns:** A URL object representing the equivalent file URL
**Throws:** MalformedURLException

- If the path cannot be parsed as a URL
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** toURI()

,

URI

,

URI.toURL()

,

URL

- toURI

```java
public
URI
toURI()
```

Constructs a

file:

URI that represents this abstract pathname.

The exact form of the URI is system-dependent. If it can be
determined that the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a
directory, then the resulting URI will end with a slash.

For a given abstract pathname

f

, it is guaranteed that

new

File

(

f

.toURI()).equals(

f

.

getAbsoluteFile

())

so long as the original abstract pathname, the URI, and the new abstract
pathname are all created in (possibly different invocations of) the same
Java virtual machine. Due to the system-dependent nature of abstract
pathnames, however, this relationship typically does not hold when a

file:

URI that is created in a virtual machine on one operating
system is converted into an abstract pathname in a virtual machine on a
different operating system.

Note that when this abstract pathname represents a UNC pathname then
all components of the UNC (including the server name component) are encoded
in the

URI

path. The authority component is undefined, meaning
that it is represented as

null

. The

Path

class defines the

toUri

method to encode the server name in the authority
component of the resulting

URI

. The

toPath

method
may be used to obtain a

Path

representing this abstract pathname.

**Returns:** An absolute, hierarchical URI with a scheme equal to

"file"

, a path representing this abstract pathname,
and undefined authority, query, and fragment components
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot
be accessed.
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** File(java.net.URI)

,

URI

,

URI.toURL()

- canRead

```java
public boolean canRead()
```

Tests whether the application can read the file denoted by this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to read
files that are marked as unreadable. Consequently this method may return

true

even though the file does not have read permissions.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file specified by this
abstract pathname exists

and

can be read by the
application;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

- canWrite

```java
public boolean canWrite()
```

Tests whether the application can modify the file denoted by this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to modify
files that are marked read-only. Consequently this method may return

true

even though the file is marked read-only.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file system actually
contains a file denoted by this abstract pathname

and

the application is allowed to write to the file;

false

otherwise.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file

- exists

```java
public boolean exists()
```

Tests whether the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname
exists.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file or directory denoted
by this abstract pathname exists;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file or directory

- isDirectory

```java
public boolean isDirectory()
```

Tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a
directory.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that the file is not a directory, or where several attributes of the
same file are required at the same time, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file denoted by this
abstract pathname exists

and

is a directory;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

- isFile

```java
public boolean isFile()
```

Tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a normal
file. A file is

normal

if it is not a directory and, in
addition, satisfies other system-dependent criteria. Any non-directory
file created by a Java application is guaranteed to be a normal file.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that the file is not a normal file, or where several attributes of the
same file are required at the same time, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file denoted by this
abstract pathname exists

and

is a normal file;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

- isHidden

```java
public boolean isHidden()
```

Tests whether the file named by this abstract pathname is a hidden
file. The exact definition of

hidden

is system-dependent. On
UNIX systems, a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with
a period character (

'.'

). On Microsoft Windows systems, a file is
considered to be hidden if it has been marked as such in the filesystem.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file denoted by this
abstract pathname is hidden according to the conventions of the
underlying platform
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file
**Since:** 1.2

- lastModified

```java
public long lastModified()
```

Returns the time that the file denoted by this abstract pathname was
last modified.

**API Note:** While the unit of time of the return value is milliseconds, the
granularity of the value depends on the underlying file system and may
be larger. For example, some file systems use time stamps in units of
seconds.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
where

0L

is returned, or where several attributes of the
same file are required at the same time, or where the time of last
access or the creation time are required, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used. If however only the
time of last modification is required, then the

Files.getLastModifiedTime

method may be used instead.
**Returns:** A

long

value representing the time the file was
last modified, measured in milliseconds since the epoch
(00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970), or

0L

if the
file does not exist or if an I/O error occurs. The value may
be negative indicating the number of milliseconds before the
epoch
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

- length

```java
public long length()
```

Returns the length of the file denoted by this abstract pathname.
The return value is unspecified if this pathname denotes a directory.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that

0L

is returned, or where several attributes of the same file
are required at the same time, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used.

**Returns:** The length, in bytes, of the file denoted by this abstract
pathname, or

0L

if the file does not exist. Some
operating systems may return

0L

for pathnames
denoting system-dependent entities such as devices or pipes.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

- createNewFile

```java
public boolean createNewFile()
throws
IOException
```

Atomically creates a new, empty file named by this abstract pathname if
and only if a file with this name does not yet exist. The check for the
existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
are a single operation that is atomic with respect to all other
filesystem activities that might affect the file.

Note: this method should

not

be used for file-locking, as
the resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The

FileLock

facility should be used instead.

**Returns:** true

if the named file does not exist and was
successfully created;

false

if the named file
already exists
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurred
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.2

- delete

```java
public boolean delete()
```

Deletes the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname. If
this pathname denotes a directory, then the directory must be empty in
order to be deleted.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

delete

method to throw an

IOException

when a file cannot be deleted. This is useful for error reporting and to
diagnose why a file cannot be deleted.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file or directory is
successfully deleted;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkDelete(java.lang.String)

method denies
delete access to the file

- deleteOnExit

```java
public void deleteOnExit()
```

Requests that the file or directory denoted by this abstract
pathname be deleted when the virtual machine terminates.
Files (or directories) are deleted in the reverse order that
they are registered. Invoking this method to delete a file or
directory that is already registered for deletion has no effect.
Deletion will be attempted only for normal termination of the
virtual machine, as defined by the Java Language Specification.

Once deletion has been requested, it is not possible to cancel the
request. This method should therefore be used with care.

Note: this method should

not

be used for file-locking, as
the resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The

FileLock

facility should be used instead.

**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkDelete(java.lang.String)

method denies
delete access to the file
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** delete()

- list

```java
public
String
[] list()
```

Returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, then this
method returns

null

. Otherwise an array of strings is
returned, one for each file or directory in the directory. Names
denoting the directory itself and the directory's parent directory are
not included in the result. Each string is a file name rather than a
complete path.

There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array
will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular,
guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

newDirectoryStream

method to
open a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the directory.
This may use less resources when working with very large directories, and
may be more responsive when working with remote directories.

**Returns:** An array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname. The array will be
empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if
this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, or if an
I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory

- list

```java
public
String
[] list​(
FilenameFilter
filter)
```

Returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname that satisfy the specified
filter. The behavior of this method is the same as that of the

list()

method, except that the strings in the returned array
must satisfy the filter. If the given

filter

is

null

then all names are accepted. Otherwise, a name satisfies the filter if
and only if the value

true

results when the

FilenameFilter.accept(File, String)

method
of the filter is invoked on this abstract pathname and the name of a
file or directory in the directory that it denotes.

**Parameters:** filter

- A filename filter
**Returns:** An array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname that were accepted
by the given

filter

. The array will be empty if the
directory is empty or if no names were accepted by the filter.
Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote
a directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory
**See Also:** Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,String)

- listFiles

```java
public
File
[] listFiles()
```

Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, then this
method returns

null

. Otherwise an array of

File

objects
is returned, one for each file or directory in the directory. Pathnames
denoting the directory itself and the directory's parent directory are
not included in the result. Each resulting abstract pathname is
constructed from this abstract pathname using the

File(File, String)

constructor. Therefore if this
pathname is absolute then each resulting pathname is absolute; if this
pathname is relative then each resulting pathname will be relative to
the same directory.

There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array
will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular,
guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

newDirectoryStream

method
to open a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the
directory. This may use less resources when working with very large
directories.

**Returns:** An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
The array will be empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote a
directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory
**Since:** 1.2

- listFiles

```java
public
File
[] listFiles​(
FilenameFilter
filter)
```

Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname that
satisfy the specified filter. The behavior of this method is the same
as that of the

listFiles()

method, except that the pathnames in
the returned array must satisfy the filter. If the given

filter

is

null

then all pathnames are accepted. Otherwise, a pathname
satisfies the filter if and only if the value

true

results when
the

FilenameFilter.accept(File, String)

method of the filter is
invoked on this abstract pathname and the name of a file or directory in
the directory that it denotes.

**Parameters:** filter

- A filename filter
**Returns:** An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
The array will be empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote a
directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,String)

- listFiles

```java
public
File
[] listFiles​(
FileFilter
filter)
```

Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname that
satisfy the specified filter. The behavior of this method is the same
as that of the

listFiles()

method, except that the pathnames in
the returned array must satisfy the filter. If the given

filter

is

null

then all pathnames are accepted. Otherwise, a pathname
satisfies the filter if and only if the value

true

results when
the

FileFilter.accept(File)

method of the
filter is invoked on the pathname.

**Parameters:** filter

- A file filter
**Returns:** An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
The array will be empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote a
directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,java.nio.file.DirectoryStream.Filter)

- mkdir

```java
public boolean mkdir()
```

Creates the directory named by this abstract pathname.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the directory was
created;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not permit the named directory to be created

- mkdirs

```java
public boolean mkdirs()
```

Creates the directory named by this abstract pathname, including any
necessary but nonexistent parent directories. Note that if this
operation fails it may have succeeded in creating some of the necessary
parent directories.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the directory was created,
along with all necessary parent directories;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method does not permit verification of the existence of the
named directory and all necessary parent directories; or if
the

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not permit the named directory and all necessary
parent directories to be created

- renameTo

```java
public boolean renameTo​(
File
dest)
```

Renames the file denoted by this abstract pathname.

Many aspects of the behavior of this method are inherently
platform-dependent: The rename operation might not be able to move a
file from one filesystem to another, it might not be atomic, and it
might not succeed if a file with the destination abstract pathname
already exists. The return value should always be checked to make sure
that the rename operation was successful.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

move

method to move or rename a file in a
platform independent manner.

**Parameters:** dest

- The new abstract pathname for the named file
**Returns:** true

if and only if the renaming succeeded;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to either the old or new pathnames
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If parameter

dest

is

null

- setLastModified

```java
public boolean setLastModified​(long time)
```

Sets the last-modified time of the file or directory named by this
abstract pathname.

All platforms support file-modification times to the nearest second,
but some provide more precision. The argument will be truncated to fit
the supported precision. If the operation succeeds and no intervening
operations on the file take place, then the next invocation of the

lastModified()

method will return the (possibly
truncated)

time

argument that was passed to this method.

**Parameters:** time

- The new last-modified time, measured in milliseconds since
the epoch (00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970)
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the argument is negative
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the named file
**Since:** 1.2

- setReadOnly

```java
public boolean setReadOnly()
```

Marks the file or directory named by this abstract pathname so that
only read operations are allowed. After invoking this method the file
or directory will not change until it is either deleted or marked
to allow write access. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to modify
files that are marked read-only. Whether or not a read-only file or
directory may be deleted depends upon the underlying system.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the named file
**Since:** 1.2

- setWritable

```java
public boolean setWritable​(boolean writable,
boolean ownerOnly)
```

Sets the owner's or everybody's write permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to modify files that
disallow write operations.

The

Files

class defines methods that operate on
file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
manipulation of file permissions is required.

**Parameters:** writable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow write
operations; if

false

to disallow write operations
**Parameters:** ownerOnly

- If

true

, the write permission applies only to the
owner's write permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody. If
the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's write
permission from that of others, then the permission will apply to
everybody, regardless of this value.
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to change
the access permissions of this abstract pathname.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the named file
**Since:** 1.6

- setWritable

```java
public boolean setWritable​(boolean writable)
```

A convenience method to set the owner's write permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to modify files that
disallow write operations.

An invocation of this method of the form

file.setWritable(arg)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
file.setWritable(arg, true)
```

**Parameters:** writable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow write
operations; if

false

to disallow write operations
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- setReadable

```java
public boolean setReadable​(boolean readable,
boolean ownerOnly)
```

Sets the owner's or everybody's read permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to read files that are
marked as unreadable.

The

Files

class defines methods that operate on
file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
manipulation of file permissions is required.

**Parameters:** readable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow read
operations; if

false

to disallow read operations
**Parameters:** ownerOnly

- If

true

, the read permission applies only to the
owner's read permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody. If
the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's read
permission from that of others, then the permission will apply to
everybody, regardless of this value.
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

readable

is

false

and the underlying
file system does not implement a read permission, then the
operation will fail.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- setReadable

```java
public boolean setReadable​(boolean readable)
```

A convenience method to set the owner's read permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to read files that are
marked as unreadable.

An invocation of this method of the form

file.setReadable(arg)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
file.setReadable(arg, true)
```

**Parameters:** readable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow read
operations; if

false

to disallow read operations
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

readable

is

false

and the underlying
file system does not implement a read permission, then the
operation will fail.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- setExecutable

```java
public boolean setExecutable​(boolean executable,
boolean ownerOnly)
```

Sets the owner's or everybody's execute permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to execute files that are
not marked executable.

The

Files

class defines methods that operate on
file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
manipulation of file permissions is required.

**Parameters:** executable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow execute
operations; if

false

to disallow execute operations
**Parameters:** ownerOnly

- If

true

, the execute permission applies only to the
owner's execute permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody.
If the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's
execute permission from that of others, then the permission will
apply to everybody, regardless of this value.
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

executable

is

false

and the underlying
file system does not implement an execute permission, then the
operation will fail.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- setExecutable

```java
public boolean setExecutable​(boolean executable)
```

A convenience method to set the owner's execute permission for this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java
virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to execute files
that are not marked executable.

An invocation of this method of the form

file.setExcutable(arg)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
file.setExecutable(arg, true)
```

**Parameters:** executable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow execute
operations; if

false

to disallow execute operations
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

executable

is

false

and the underlying
file system does not implement an execute permission, then the
operation will fail.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- canExecute

```java
public boolean canExecute()
```

Tests whether the application can execute the file denoted by this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to execute
files that are not marked executable. Consequently this method may return

true

even though the file does not have execute permissions.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the abstract pathname exists

and

the application is allowed to execute the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkExec(java.lang.String)

method denies execute access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- listRoots

```java
public static
File
[] listRoots()
```

List the available filesystem roots.

A particular Java platform may support zero or more
hierarchically-organized file systems. Each file system has a

root

directory from which all other files in that file system
can be reached. Windows platforms, for example, have a root directory
for each active drive; UNIX platforms have a single root directory,
namely

"/"

. The set of available filesystem roots is affected
by various system-level operations such as the insertion or ejection of
removable media and the disconnecting or unmounting of physical or
virtual disk drives.

This method returns an array of

File

objects that denote the
root directories of the available filesystem roots. It is guaranteed
that the canonical pathname of any file physically present on the local
machine will begin with one of the roots returned by this method.

The canonical pathname of a file that resides on some other machine
and is accessed via a remote-filesystem protocol such as SMB or NFS may
or may not begin with one of the roots returned by this method. If the
pathname of a remote file is syntactically indistinguishable from the
pathname of a local file then it will begin with one of the roots
returned by this method. Thus, for example,

File

objects
denoting the root directories of the mapped network drives of a Windows
platform will be returned by this method, while

File

objects
containing UNC pathnames will not be returned by this method.

Unlike most methods in this class, this method does not throw
security exceptions. If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to a
particular root directory, then that directory will not appear in the
result.

**Returns:** An array of

File

objects denoting the available
filesystem roots, or

null

if the set of roots could not
be determined. The array will be empty if there are no
filesystem roots.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** FileStore

- getTotalSpace

```java
public long getTotalSpace()
```

Returns the size of the partition

named

by this
abstract pathname.

**Returns:** The size, in bytes, of the partition or

0L

if this
abstract pathname does not name a partition
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

RuntimePermission

("getFileSystemAttributes")

or its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies
read access to the file named by this abstract pathname
**Since:** 1.6

- getFreeSpace

```java
public long getFreeSpace()
```

Returns the number of unallocated bytes in the partition

named

by this abstract path name.

The returned number of unallocated bytes is a hint, but not
a guarantee, that it is possible to use most or any of these
bytes. The number of unallocated bytes is most likely to be
accurate immediately after this call. It is likely to be made
inaccurate by any external I/O operations including those made
on the system outside of this virtual machine. This method
makes no guarantee that write operations to this file system
will succeed.

**Returns:** The number of unallocated bytes on the partition or

0L

if the abstract pathname does not name a partition. This
value will be less than or equal to the total file system size
returned by

getTotalSpace()

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

RuntimePermission

or its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies
read access to the file named by this abstract pathname
**Since:** 1.6

- getUsableSpace

```java
public long getUsableSpace()
```

Returns the number of bytes available to this virtual machine on the
partition

named

by this abstract pathname. When
possible, this method checks for write permissions and other operating
system restrictions and will therefore usually provide a more accurate
estimate of how much new data can actually be written than

getFreeSpace()

.

The returned number of available bytes is a hint, but not a
guarantee, that it is possible to use most or any of these bytes. The
number of unallocated bytes is most likely to be accurate immediately
after this call. It is likely to be made inaccurate by any external
I/O operations including those made on the system outside of this
virtual machine. This method makes no guarantee that write operations
to this file system will succeed.

**Returns:** The number of available bytes on the partition or

0L

if the abstract pathname does not name a partition. On
systems where this information is not available, this method
will be equivalent to a call to

getFreeSpace()

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

RuntimePermission

("getFileSystemAttributes")

or its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies
read access to the file named by this abstract pathname
**Since:** 1.6

- createTempFile

```java
public static
File
createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix,

File
directory)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new empty file in the specified directory, using the
given prefix and suffix strings to generate its name. If this method
returns successfully then it is guaranteed that:

- The file denoted by the returned abstract pathname did not exist
before this method was invoked, and

Neither this method nor any of its variants will return the same
abstract pathname again in the current invocation of the virtual
machine.

This method provides only part of a temporary-file facility. To arrange
for a file created by this method to be deleted automatically, use the

deleteOnExit()

method.

The

prefix

argument must be at least three characters
long. It is recommended that the prefix be a short, meaningful string
such as

"hjb"

or

"mail"

. The

suffix

argument may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used.

To create the new file, the prefix and the suffix may first be
adjusted to fit the limitations of the underlying platform. If the
prefix is too long then it will be truncated, but its first three
characters will always be preserved. If the suffix is too long then it
too will be truncated, but if it begins with a period character
(

'.'

) then the period and the first three characters
following it will always be preserved. Once these adjustments have been
made the name of the new file will be generated by concatenating the
prefix, five or more internally-generated characters, and the suffix.

If the

directory

argument is

null

then the
system-dependent default temporary-file directory will be used. The
default temporary-file directory is specified by the system property

java.io.tmpdir

. On UNIX systems the default value of this
property is typically

"/tmp"

or

"/var/tmp"

; on
Microsoft Windows systems it is typically

"C:\\WINNT\\TEMP"

. A different
value may be given to this system property when the Java virtual machine
is invoked, but programmatic changes to this property are not guaranteed
to have any effect upon the temporary directory used by this method.

**Parameters:** prefix

- The prefix string to be used in generating the file's
name; must be at least three characters long
**Parameters:** suffix

- The suffix string to be used in generating the file's
name; may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used
**Parameters:** directory

- The directory in which the file is to be created, or

null

if the default temporary-file
directory is to be used
**Returns:** An abstract pathname denoting a newly-created empty file
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the

prefix

argument contains fewer than three
characters
**Throws:** IOException

- If a file could not be created
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not allow a file to be created
**Since:** 1.2

- createTempFile

```java
public static
File
createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix)
throws
IOException
```

Creates an empty file in the default temporary-file directory, using
the given prefix and suffix to generate its name. Invoking this method
is equivalent to invoking

createTempFile(prefix, suffix, null)

.

The

Files.createTempFile

method provides an alternative method to create an
empty file in the temporary-file directory. Files created by that method
may have more restrictive access permissions to files created by this
method and so may be more suited to security-sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** prefix

- The prefix string to be used in generating the file's
name; must be at least three characters long
**Parameters:** suffix

- The suffix string to be used in generating the file's
name; may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used
**Returns:** An abstract pathname denoting a newly-created empty file
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the

prefix

argument contains fewer than three
characters
**Throws:** IOException

- If a file could not be created
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not allow a file to be created
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Files.createTempDirectory(String,FileAttribute[])

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
File
pathname)
```

Compares two abstract pathnames lexicographically. The ordering
defined by this method depends upon the underlying system. On UNIX
systems, alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows
systems it is not.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

File

>
**Parameters:** pathname

- The abstract pathname to be compared to this abstract
pathname
**Returns:** Zero if the argument is equal to this abstract pathname, a
value less than zero if this abstract pathname is
lexicographically less than the argument, or a value greater
than zero if this abstract pathname is lexicographically
greater than the argument
**Since:** 1.2

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Tests this abstract pathname for equality with the given object.
Returns

true

if and only if the argument is not

null

and is an abstract pathname that denotes the same file
or directory as this abstract pathname. Whether or not two abstract
pathnames are equal depends upon the underlying system. On UNIX
systems, alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows
systems it is not.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- The object to be compared with this abstract pathname
**Returns:** true

if and only if the objects are the same;

false

otherwise
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Computes a hash code for this abstract pathname. Because equality of
abstract pathnames is inherently system-dependent, so is the computation
of their hash codes. On UNIX systems, the hash code of an abstract
pathname is equal to the exclusive

or

of the hash code
of its pathname string and the decimal value

1234321

. On Microsoft Windows systems, the hash
code is equal to the exclusive

or

of the hash code of
its pathname string converted to lower case and the decimal
value

1234321

. Locale is not taken into account on
lowercasing the pathname string.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** A hash code for this abstract pathname
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the pathname string of this abstract pathname. This is just the
string returned by the

getPath()

method.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** The string form of this abstract pathname

- toPath

```java
public
Path
toPath()
```

Returns a

java.nio.file.Path

object constructed from
this abstract path. The resulting

Path

is associated with the

default-filesystem

.

The first invocation of this method works as if invoking it were
equivalent to evaluating the expression:

```java
FileSystems.getDefault
().
getPath
(this.
getPath
());
```

Subsequent invocations of this method return the same

Path

.

If this abstract pathname is the empty abstract pathname then this
method returns a

Path

that may be used to access the current
user directory.

**Returns:** a

Path

constructed from this abstract path
**Throws:** InvalidPathException

- if a

Path

object cannot be constructed from the abstract
path (see

FileSystem.getPath

)

Method Detail

- getName

```java
public
String
getName()
```

Returns the name of the file or directory denoted by this abstract
pathname. This is just the last name in the pathname's name
sequence. If the pathname's name sequence is empty, then the empty
string is returned.

**Returns:** The name of the file or directory denoted by this abstract
pathname, or the empty string if this pathname's name sequence
is empty

- getParent

```java
public
String
getParent()
```

Returns the pathname string of this abstract pathname's parent, or

null

if this pathname does not name a parent directory.

The

parent

of an abstract pathname consists of the
pathname's prefix, if any, and each name in the pathname's name
sequence except for the last. If the name sequence is empty then
the pathname does not name a parent directory.

**Returns:** The pathname string of the parent directory named by this
abstract pathname, or

null

if this pathname
does not name a parent

- getParentFile

```java
public
File
getParentFile()
```

Returns the abstract pathname of this abstract pathname's parent,
or

null

if this pathname does not name a parent
directory.

The

parent

of an abstract pathname consists of the
pathname's prefix, if any, and each name in the pathname's name
sequence except for the last. If the name sequence is empty then
the pathname does not name a parent directory.

**Returns:** The abstract pathname of the parent directory named by this
abstract pathname, or

null

if this pathname
does not name a parent
**Since:** 1.2

- getPath

```java
public
String
getPath()
```

Converts this abstract pathname into a pathname string. The resulting
string uses the

default name-separator character

to
separate the names in the name sequence.

**Returns:** The string form of this abstract pathname

- isAbsolute

```java
public boolean isAbsolute()
```

Tests whether this abstract pathname is absolute. The definition of
absolute pathname is system dependent. On UNIX systems, a pathname is
absolute if its prefix is

"/"

. On Microsoft Windows systems, a
pathname is absolute if its prefix is a drive specifier followed by

"\\"

, or if its prefix is

"\\\\"

.

**Returns:** true

if this abstract pathname is absolute,

false

otherwise

- getAbsolutePath

```java
public
String
getAbsolutePath()
```

Returns the absolute pathname string of this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname is already absolute, then the pathname
string is simply returned as if by the

getPath()

method. If this abstract pathname is the empty abstract pathname then
the pathname string of the current user directory, which is named by the
system property

user.dir

, is returned. Otherwise this
pathname is resolved in a system-dependent way. On UNIX systems, a
relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current
user directory. On Microsoft Windows systems, a relative pathname is made absolute
by resolving it against the current directory of the drive named by the
pathname, if any; if not, it is resolved against the current user
directory.

**Returns:** The absolute pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed.
**See Also:** isAbsolute()

- getAbsoluteFile

```java
public
File
getAbsoluteFile()
```

Returns the absolute form of this abstract pathname. Equivalent to

new File(this.

getAbsolutePath()

)

.

**Returns:** The absolute abstract pathname denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed.
**Since:** 1.2

- getCanonicalPath

```java
public
String
getCanonicalPath()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the canonical pathname string of this abstract pathname.

A canonical pathname is both absolute and unique. The precise
definition of canonical form is system-dependent. This method first
converts this pathname to absolute form if necessary, as if by invoking the

getAbsolutePath()

method, and then maps it to its unique form in a
system-dependent way. This typically involves removing redundant names
such as

"."

and

".."

from the pathname, resolving
symbolic links (on UNIX platforms), and converting drive letters to a
standard case (on Microsoft Windows platforms).

Every pathname that denotes an existing file or directory has a
unique canonical form. Every pathname that denotes a nonexistent file
or directory also has a unique canonical form. The canonical form of
the pathname of a nonexistent file or directory may be different from
the canonical form of the same pathname after the file or directory is
created. Similarly, the canonical form of the pathname of an existing
file or directory may be different from the canonical form of the same
pathname after the file or directory is deleted.

**Returns:** The canonical pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs, which is possible because the
construction of the canonical pathname may require
filesystem queries
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed, or
if a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.io.FileDescriptor)

method denies
read access to the file
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** Path.toRealPath(java.nio.file.LinkOption...)

- getCanonicalFile

```java
public
File
getCanonicalFile()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the canonical form of this abstract pathname. Equivalent to

new File(this.

getCanonicalPath()

)

.

**Returns:** The canonical pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs, which is possible because the
construction of the canonical pathname may require
filesystem queries
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed, or
if a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.io.FileDescriptor)

method denies
read access to the file
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Path.toRealPath(java.nio.file.LinkOption...)

- toURL

```java
@Deprecated

public
URL
toURL()
throws
MalformedURLException
```

Deprecated.

This method does not automatically escape characters that
are illegal in URLs. It is recommended that new code convert an
abstract pathname into a URL by first converting it into a URI, via the

toURI

method, and then converting the URI into a URL
via the

URI.toURL

method.

Converts this abstract pathname into a

file:

URL. The
exact form of the URL is system-dependent. If it can be determined that
the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a directory, then the
resulting URL will end with a slash.

**Returns:** A URL object representing the equivalent file URL
**Throws:** MalformedURLException

- If the path cannot be parsed as a URL
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** toURI()

,

URI

,

URI.toURL()

,

URL

- toURI

```java
public
URI
toURI()
```

Constructs a

file:

URI that represents this abstract pathname.

The exact form of the URI is system-dependent. If it can be
determined that the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a
directory, then the resulting URI will end with a slash.

For a given abstract pathname

f

, it is guaranteed that

new

File

(

f

.toURI()).equals(

f

.

getAbsoluteFile

())

so long as the original abstract pathname, the URI, and the new abstract
pathname are all created in (possibly different invocations of) the same
Java virtual machine. Due to the system-dependent nature of abstract
pathnames, however, this relationship typically does not hold when a

file:

URI that is created in a virtual machine on one operating
system is converted into an abstract pathname in a virtual machine on a
different operating system.

Note that when this abstract pathname represents a UNC pathname then
all components of the UNC (including the server name component) are encoded
in the

URI

path. The authority component is undefined, meaning
that it is represented as

null

. The

Path

class defines the

toUri

method to encode the server name in the authority
component of the resulting

URI

. The

toPath

method
may be used to obtain a

Path

representing this abstract pathname.

**Returns:** An absolute, hierarchical URI with a scheme equal to

"file"

, a path representing this abstract pathname,
and undefined authority, query, and fragment components
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot
be accessed.
**Since:** 1.4

- canRead

```java
public boolean canRead()
```

Tests whether the application can read the file denoted by this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to read
files that are marked as unreadable. Consequently this method may return

true

even though the file does not have read permissions.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file specified by this
abstract pathname exists

and

can be read by the
application;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

- canWrite

```java
public boolean canWrite()
```

Tests whether the application can modify the file denoted by this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to modify
files that are marked read-only. Consequently this method may return

true

even though the file is marked read-only.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file system actually
contains a file denoted by this abstract pathname

and

the application is allowed to write to the file;

false

otherwise.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file

- exists

```java
public boolean exists()
```

Tests whether the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname
exists.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file or directory denoted
by this abstract pathname exists;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file or directory

- isDirectory

```java
public boolean isDirectory()
```

Tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a
directory.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that the file is not a directory, or where several attributes of the
same file are required at the same time, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file denoted by this
abstract pathname exists

and

is a directory;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

- isFile

```java
public boolean isFile()
```

Tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a normal
file. A file is

normal

if it is not a directory and, in
addition, satisfies other system-dependent criteria. Any non-directory
file created by a Java application is guaranteed to be a normal file.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that the file is not a normal file, or where several attributes of the
same file are required at the same time, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file denoted by this
abstract pathname exists

and

is a normal file;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

- isHidden

```java
public boolean isHidden()
```

Tests whether the file named by this abstract pathname is a hidden
file. The exact definition of

hidden

is system-dependent. On
UNIX systems, a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with
a period character (

'.'

). On Microsoft Windows systems, a file is
considered to be hidden if it has been marked as such in the filesystem.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file denoted by this
abstract pathname is hidden according to the conventions of the
underlying platform
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file
**Since:** 1.2

- lastModified

```java
public long lastModified()
```

Returns the time that the file denoted by this abstract pathname was
last modified.

**API Note:** While the unit of time of the return value is milliseconds, the
granularity of the value depends on the underlying file system and may
be larger. For example, some file systems use time stamps in units of
seconds.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
where

0L

is returned, or where several attributes of the
same file are required at the same time, or where the time of last
access or the creation time are required, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used. If however only the
time of last modification is required, then the

Files.getLastModifiedTime

method may be used instead.
**Returns:** A

long

value representing the time the file was
last modified, measured in milliseconds since the epoch
(00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970), or

0L

if the
file does not exist or if an I/O error occurs. The value may
be negative indicating the number of milliseconds before the
epoch
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

- length

```java
public long length()
```

Returns the length of the file denoted by this abstract pathname.
The return value is unspecified if this pathname denotes a directory.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
that

0L

is returned, or where several attributes of the same file
are required at the same time, then the

Files.readAttributes

method may be used.

**Returns:** The length, in bytes, of the file denoted by this abstract
pathname, or

0L

if the file does not exist. Some
operating systems may return

0L

for pathnames
denoting system-dependent entities such as devices or pipes.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method denies read access to the file

- createNewFile

```java
public boolean createNewFile()
throws
IOException
```

Atomically creates a new, empty file named by this abstract pathname if
and only if a file with this name does not yet exist. The check for the
existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
are a single operation that is atomic with respect to all other
filesystem activities that might affect the file.

Note: this method should

not

be used for file-locking, as
the resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The

FileLock

facility should be used instead.

**Returns:** true

if the named file does not exist and was
successfully created;

false

if the named file
already exists
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurred
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.2

- delete

```java
public boolean delete()
```

Deletes the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname. If
this pathname denotes a directory, then the directory must be empty in
order to be deleted.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

delete

method to throw an

IOException

when a file cannot be deleted. This is useful for error reporting and to
diagnose why a file cannot be deleted.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the file or directory is
successfully deleted;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkDelete(java.lang.String)

method denies
delete access to the file

- deleteOnExit

```java
public void deleteOnExit()
```

Requests that the file or directory denoted by this abstract
pathname be deleted when the virtual machine terminates.
Files (or directories) are deleted in the reverse order that
they are registered. Invoking this method to delete a file or
directory that is already registered for deletion has no effect.
Deletion will be attempted only for normal termination of the
virtual machine, as defined by the Java Language Specification.

Once deletion has been requested, it is not possible to cancel the
request. This method should therefore be used with care.

Note: this method should

not

be used for file-locking, as
the resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The

FileLock

facility should be used instead.

**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkDelete(java.lang.String)

method denies
delete access to the file
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** delete()

- list

```java
public
String
[] list()
```

Returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, then this
method returns

null

. Otherwise an array of strings is
returned, one for each file or directory in the directory. Names
denoting the directory itself and the directory's parent directory are
not included in the result. Each string is a file name rather than a
complete path.

There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array
will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular,
guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

newDirectoryStream

method to
open a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the directory.
This may use less resources when working with very large directories, and
may be more responsive when working with remote directories.

**Returns:** An array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname. The array will be
empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if
this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, or if an
I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory

- list

```java
public
String
[] list​(
FilenameFilter
filter)
```

Returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname that satisfy the specified
filter. The behavior of this method is the same as that of the

list()

method, except that the strings in the returned array
must satisfy the filter. If the given

filter

is

null

then all names are accepted. Otherwise, a name satisfies the filter if
and only if the value

true

results when the

FilenameFilter.accept(File, String)

method
of the filter is invoked on this abstract pathname and the name of a
file or directory in the directory that it denotes.

**Parameters:** filter

- A filename filter
**Returns:** An array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname that were accepted
by the given

filter

. The array will be empty if the
directory is empty or if no names were accepted by the filter.
Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote
a directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory
**See Also:** Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,String)

- listFiles

```java
public
File
[] listFiles()
```

Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, then this
method returns

null

. Otherwise an array of

File

objects
is returned, one for each file or directory in the directory. Pathnames
denoting the directory itself and the directory's parent directory are
not included in the result. Each resulting abstract pathname is
constructed from this abstract pathname using the

File(File, String)

constructor. Therefore if this
pathname is absolute then each resulting pathname is absolute; if this
pathname is relative then each resulting pathname will be relative to
the same directory.

There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array
will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular,
guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

newDirectoryStream

method
to open a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the
directory. This may use less resources when working with very large
directories.

**Returns:** An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
The array will be empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote a
directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory
**Since:** 1.2

- listFiles

```java
public
File
[] listFiles​(
FilenameFilter
filter)
```

Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname that
satisfy the specified filter. The behavior of this method is the same
as that of the

listFiles()

method, except that the pathnames in
the returned array must satisfy the filter. If the given

filter

is

null

then all pathnames are accepted. Otherwise, a pathname
satisfies the filter if and only if the value

true

results when
the

FilenameFilter.accept(File, String)

method of the filter is
invoked on this abstract pathname and the name of a file or directory in
the directory that it denotes.

**Parameters:** filter

- A filename filter
**Returns:** An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
The array will be empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote a
directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,String)

- listFiles

```java
public
File
[] listFiles​(
FileFilter
filter)
```

Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname that
satisfy the specified filter. The behavior of this method is the same
as that of the

listFiles()

method, except that the pathnames in
the returned array must satisfy the filter. If the given

filter

is

null

then all pathnames are accepted. Otherwise, a pathname
satisfies the filter if and only if the value

true

results when
the

FileFilter.accept(File)

method of the
filter is invoked on the pathname.

**Parameters:** filter

- A file filter
**Returns:** An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
The array will be empty if the directory is empty. Returns

null

if this abstract pathname does not denote a
directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to
the directory
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,java.nio.file.DirectoryStream.Filter)

- mkdir

```java
public boolean mkdir()
```

Creates the directory named by this abstract pathname.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the directory was
created;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not permit the named directory to be created

- mkdirs

```java
public boolean mkdirs()
```

Creates the directory named by this abstract pathname, including any
necessary but nonexistent parent directories. Note that if this
operation fails it may have succeeded in creating some of the necessary
parent directories.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the directory was created,
along with all necessary parent directories;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)

method does not permit verification of the existence of the
named directory and all necessary parent directories; or if
the

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not permit the named directory and all necessary
parent directories to be created

- renameTo

```java
public boolean renameTo​(
File
dest)
```

Renames the file denoted by this abstract pathname.

Many aspects of the behavior of this method are inherently
platform-dependent: The rename operation might not be able to move a
file from one filesystem to another, it might not be atomic, and it
might not succeed if a file with the destination abstract pathname
already exists. The return value should always be checked to make sure
that the rename operation was successful.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

move

method to move or rename a file in a
platform independent manner.

**Parameters:** dest

- The new abstract pathname for the named file
**Returns:** true

if and only if the renaming succeeded;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to either the old or new pathnames
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If parameter

dest

is

null

- setLastModified

```java
public boolean setLastModified​(long time)
```

Sets the last-modified time of the file or directory named by this
abstract pathname.

All platforms support file-modification times to the nearest second,
but some provide more precision. The argument will be truncated to fit
the supported precision. If the operation succeeds and no intervening
operations on the file take place, then the next invocation of the

lastModified()

method will return the (possibly
truncated)

time

argument that was passed to this method.

**Parameters:** time

- The new last-modified time, measured in milliseconds since
the epoch (00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970)
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the argument is negative
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the named file
**Since:** 1.2

- setReadOnly

```java
public boolean setReadOnly()
```

Marks the file or directory named by this abstract pathname so that
only read operations are allowed. After invoking this method the file
or directory will not change until it is either deleted or marked
to allow write access. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to modify
files that are marked read-only. Whether or not a read-only file or
directory may be deleted depends upon the underlying system.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the named file
**Since:** 1.2

- setWritable

```java
public boolean setWritable​(boolean writable,
boolean ownerOnly)
```

Sets the owner's or everybody's write permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to modify files that
disallow write operations.

The

Files

class defines methods that operate on
file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
manipulation of file permissions is required.

**Parameters:** writable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow write
operations; if

false

to disallow write operations
**Parameters:** ownerOnly

- If

true

, the write permission applies only to the
owner's write permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody. If
the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's write
permission from that of others, then the permission will apply to
everybody, regardless of this value.
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to change
the access permissions of this abstract pathname.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the named file
**Since:** 1.6

- setWritable

```java
public boolean setWritable​(boolean writable)
```

A convenience method to set the owner's write permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to modify files that
disallow write operations.

An invocation of this method of the form

file.setWritable(arg)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
file.setWritable(arg, true)
```

**Parameters:** writable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow write
operations; if

false

to disallow write operations
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- setReadable

```java
public boolean setReadable​(boolean readable,
boolean ownerOnly)
```

Sets the owner's or everybody's read permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to read files that are
marked as unreadable.

The

Files

class defines methods that operate on
file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
manipulation of file permissions is required.

**Parameters:** readable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow read
operations; if

false

to disallow read operations
**Parameters:** ownerOnly

- If

true

, the read permission applies only to the
owner's read permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody. If
the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's read
permission from that of others, then the permission will apply to
everybody, regardless of this value.
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

readable

is

false

and the underlying
file system does not implement a read permission, then the
operation will fail.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- setReadable

```java
public boolean setReadable​(boolean readable)
```

A convenience method to set the owner's read permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to read files that are
marked as unreadable.

An invocation of this method of the form

file.setReadable(arg)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
file.setReadable(arg, true)
```

**Parameters:** readable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow read
operations; if

false

to disallow read operations
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

readable

is

false

and the underlying
file system does not implement a read permission, then the
operation will fail.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- setExecutable

```java
public boolean setExecutable​(boolean executable,
boolean ownerOnly)
```

Sets the owner's or everybody's execute permission for this abstract
pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
machine with special privileges that allow it to execute files that are
not marked executable.

The

Files

class defines methods that operate on
file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
manipulation of file permissions is required.

**Parameters:** executable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow execute
operations; if

false

to disallow execute operations
**Parameters:** ownerOnly

- If

true

, the execute permission applies only to the
owner's execute permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody.
If the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's
execute permission from that of others, then the permission will
apply to everybody, regardless of this value.
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

operation will fail.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- setExecutable

```java
public boolean setExecutable​(boolean executable)
```

A convenience method to set the owner's execute permission for this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java
virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to execute files
that are not marked executable.

An invocation of this method of the form

file.setExcutable(arg)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

**Parameters:** executable

- If

true

, sets the access permission to allow execute
operations; if

false

to disallow execute operations
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded. The
operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
change the access permissions of this abstract pathname. If

executable

is

false

and the underlying
file system does not implement an execute permission, then the
operation will fail.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- canExecute

```java
public boolean canExecute()
```

Tests whether the application can execute the file denoted by this
abstract pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the
Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to execute
files that are not marked executable. Consequently this method may return

true

even though the file does not have execute permissions.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the abstract pathname exists

and

the application is allowed to execute the file
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkExec(java.lang.String)

method denies execute access to the file
**Since:** 1.6

- listRoots

```java
public static
File
[] listRoots()
```

List the available filesystem roots.

A particular Java platform may support zero or more
hierarchically-organized file systems. Each file system has a

root

directory from which all other files in that file system
can be reached. Windows platforms, for example, have a root directory
for each active drive; UNIX platforms have a single root directory,
namely

"/"

. The set of available filesystem roots is affected
by various system-level operations such as the insertion or ejection of
removable media and the disconnecting or unmounting of physical or
virtual disk drives.

This method returns an array of

File

objects that denote the
root directories of the available filesystem roots. It is guaranteed
that the canonical pathname of any file physically present on the local
machine will begin with one of the roots returned by this method.

The canonical pathname of a file that resides on some other machine
and is accessed via a remote-filesystem protocol such as SMB or NFS may
or may not begin with one of the roots returned by this method. If the
pathname of a remote file is syntactically indistinguishable from the
pathname of a local file then it will begin with one of the roots
returned by this method. Thus, for example,

File

objects
denoting the root directories of the mapped network drives of a Windows
platform will be returned by this method, while

File

objects
containing UNC pathnames will not be returned by this method.

Unlike most methods in this class, this method does not throw
security exceptions. If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to a
particular root directory, then that directory will not appear in the
result.

**Returns:** An array of

File

objects denoting the available
filesystem roots, or

null

if the set of roots could not
be determined. The array will be empty if there are no
filesystem roots.

- getTotalSpace

```java
public long getTotalSpace()
```

Returns the size of the partition

named

by this
abstract pathname.

**Returns:** The size, in bytes, of the partition or

0L

if this
abstract pathname does not name a partition
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

RuntimePermission

or its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies
read access to the file named by this abstract pathname
**Since:** 1.6

- getFreeSpace

```java
public long getFreeSpace()
```

Returns the number of unallocated bytes in the partition

named

by this abstract path name.

The returned number of unallocated bytes is a hint, but not
a guarantee, that it is possible to use most or any of these
bytes. The number of unallocated bytes is most likely to be
accurate immediately after this call. It is likely to be made
inaccurate by any external I/O operations including those made
on the system outside of this virtual machine. This method
makes no guarantee that write operations to this file system
will succeed.

**Returns:** The number of unallocated bytes on the partition or

0L

if the abstract pathname does not name a partition. This
value will be less than or equal to the total file system size
returned by

getTotalSpace()

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

RuntimePermission

("getFileSystemAttributes")

or its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies
read access to the file named by this abstract pathname
**Since:** 1.6

- getUsableSpace

```java
public long getUsableSpace()
```

Returns the number of bytes available to this virtual machine on the
partition

named

by this abstract pathname. When
possible, this method checks for write permissions and other operating
system restrictions and will therefore usually provide a more accurate
estimate of how much new data can actually be written than

getFreeSpace()

.

The returned number of available bytes is a hint, but not a
guarantee, that it is possible to use most or any of these bytes. The
number of unallocated bytes is most likely to be accurate immediately
after this call. It is likely to be made inaccurate by any external
I/O operations including those made on the system outside of this
virtual machine. This method makes no guarantee that write operations
to this file system will succeed.

**Returns:** The number of available bytes on the partition or

0L

if the abstract pathname does not name a partition. On
systems where this information is not available, this method
will be equivalent to a call to

getFreeSpace()

.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

RuntimePermission

("getFileSystemAttributes")

or its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies
read access to the file named by this abstract pathname
**Since:** 1.6

- createTempFile

```java
public static
File
createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix,

File
directory)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new empty file in the specified directory, using the
given prefix and suffix strings to generate its name. If this method
returns successfully then it is guaranteed that:

- The file denoted by the returned abstract pathname did not exist
before this method was invoked, and

Neither this method nor any of its variants will return the same
abstract pathname again in the current invocation of the virtual
machine.

This method provides only part of a temporary-file facility. To arrange
for a file created by this method to be deleted automatically, use the

deleteOnExit()

method.

The

prefix

argument must be at least three characters
long. It is recommended that the prefix be a short, meaningful string
such as

"hjb"

or

"mail"

. The

suffix

argument may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used.

To create the new file, the prefix and the suffix may first be
adjusted to fit the limitations of the underlying platform. If the
prefix is too long then it will be truncated, but its first three
characters will always be preserved. If the suffix is too long then it
too will be truncated, but if it begins with a period character
(

'.'

) then the period and the first three characters
following it will always be preserved. Once these adjustments have been
made the name of the new file will be generated by concatenating the
prefix, five or more internally-generated characters, and the suffix.

If the

directory

argument is

null

then the
system-dependent default temporary-file directory will be used. The
default temporary-file directory is specified by the system property

java.io.tmpdir

. On UNIX systems the default value of this
property is typically

"/tmp"

or

"/var/tmp"

; on
Microsoft Windows systems it is typically

"C:\\WINNT\\TEMP"

. A different
value may be given to this system property when the Java virtual machine
is invoked, but programmatic changes to this property are not guaranteed
to have any effect upon the temporary directory used by this method.

**Parameters:** prefix

- The prefix string to be used in generating the file's
name; must be at least three characters long
**Parameters:** suffix

- The suffix string to be used in generating the file's
name; may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used
**Parameters:** directory

- The directory in which the file is to be created, or

null

if the default temporary-file
directory is to be used
**Returns:** An abstract pathname denoting a newly-created empty file
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the

prefix

argument contains fewer than three
characters
**Throws:** IOException

- If a file could not be created
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not allow a file to be created
**Since:** 1.2

- createTempFile

```java
public static
File
createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix)
throws
IOException
```

Creates an empty file in the default temporary-file directory, using
the given prefix and suffix to generate its name. Invoking this method
is equivalent to invoking

createTempFile(prefix, suffix, null)

.

The

Files.createTempFile

method provides an alternative method to create an
empty file in the temporary-file directory. Files created by that method
may have more restrictive access permissions to files created by this
method and so may be more suited to security-sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** prefix

- The prefix string to be used in generating the file's
name; must be at least three characters long
**Parameters:** suffix

- The suffix string to be used in generating the file's
name; may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used
**Returns:** An abstract pathname denoting a newly-created empty file
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the

prefix

argument contains fewer than three
characters
**Throws:** IOException

- If a file could not be created
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method does not allow a file to be created

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
File
pathname)
```

Compares two abstract pathnames lexicographically. The ordering
defined by this method depends upon the underlying system. On UNIX
systems, alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows
systems it is not.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

File

>
**Parameters:** pathname

- The abstract pathname to be compared to this abstract
pathname
**Returns:** Zero if the argument is equal to this abstract pathname, a
value less than zero if this abstract pathname is
lexicographically less than the argument, or a value greater
than zero if this abstract pathname is lexicographically
greater than the argument
**Since:** 1.2

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Tests this abstract pathname for equality with the given object.
Returns

true

if and only if the argument is not

null

and is an abstract pathname that denotes the same file
or directory as this abstract pathname. Whether or not two abstract
pathnames are equal depends upon the underlying system. On UNIX
systems, alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows
systems it is not.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- The object to be compared with this abstract pathname
**Returns:** true

if and only if the objects are the same;

false

otherwise
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Computes a hash code for this abstract pathname. Because equality of
abstract pathnames is inherently system-dependent, so is the computation
of their hash codes. On UNIX systems, the hash code of an abstract
pathname is equal to the exclusive

or

of the hash code
of its pathname string and the decimal value

1234321

. On Microsoft Windows systems, the hash
code is equal to the exclusive

or

of the hash code of
its pathname string converted to lower case and the decimal
value

1234321

. Locale is not taken into account on
lowercasing the pathname string.

**Overrides:** hashCode

```

Returns the pathname string of this abstract pathname. This is just the
string returned by the

getPath()

method.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** The string form of this abstract pathname

- toPath

```java
public
Path
toPath()
```

Returns a

java.nio.file.Path

object constructed from
this abstract path. The resulting

Path

is associated with the

default-filesystem

.

The first invocation of this method works as if invoking it were
equivalent to evaluating the expression:

```java
FileSystems.getDefault
().
getPath
(this.
getPath
());
```

Subsequent invocations of this method return the same

Path

.

If this abstract pathname is the empty abstract pathname then this
method returns a

Path

that may be used to access the current
user directory.

**Returns:** a

Path

constructed from this abstract path
**Throws:** InvalidPathException

- if a

Path

object cannot be constructed from the abstract
path (see

FileSystem.getPath

)

#### Method Detail

getName

```java
public
String
getName()
```

getParent

```java
public
String
getParent()
```

Returns the pathname string of this abstract pathname's parent, or

null

if this pathname does not name a parent directory.

The

parent

of an abstract pathname consists of the
pathname's prefix, if any, and each name in the pathname's name
sequence except for the last. If the name sequence is empty then
the pathname does not name a parent directory.

**Returns:** The pathname string of the parent directory named by this
abstract pathname, or

null

if this pathname
does not name a parent

---

sequence except for the last. If the name sequence is empty then
the pathname does not name a parent directory.

getPath

```java
public
String
getPath()
```

Converts this abstract pathname into a pathname string. The resulting
string uses the

default name-separator character

to
separate the names in the name sequence.

**Returns:** The string form of this abstract pathname

String

getPath()

Converts this abstract pathname into a pathname string. The resulting
string uses the

default name-separator character

to
separate the names in the name sequence.

isAbsolute

```java
public boolean isAbsolute()
```

Tests whether this abstract pathname is absolute. The definition of
absolute pathname is system dependent. On UNIX systems, a pathname is
absolute if its prefix is

"/"

. On Microsoft Windows systems, a
pathname is absolute if its prefix is a drive specifier followed by

"\\"

, or if its prefix is

"\\\\"

.

**Returns:** true

if this abstract pathname is absolute,

false

otherwise

---

#### isAbsolute

public boolean isAbsolute()

getAbsolutePath

```java
public
String
getAbsolutePath()
```

Returns the absolute pathname string of this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname is already absolute, then the pathname
string is simply returned as if by the

getPath()

method. If this abstract pathname is the empty abstract pathname then
the pathname string of the current user directory, which is named by the
system property

user.dir

, is returned. Otherwise this
pathname is resolved in a system-dependent way. On UNIX systems, a
relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current
user directory. On Microsoft Windows systems, a relative pathname is made absolute
by resolving it against the current directory of the drive named by the
pathname, if any; if not, it is resolved against the current user
directory.

**Returns:** The absolute pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed.
**See Also:** isAbsolute()

String

getAbsolutePath()

Returns the absolute pathname string of this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname is already absolute, then the pathname

getCanonicalPath

```java
public
String
getCanonicalPath()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the canonical pathname string of this abstract pathname.

A canonical pathname is both absolute and unique. The precise
definition of canonical form is system-dependent. This method first
converts this pathname to absolute form if necessary, as if by invoking the

getAbsolutePath()

method, and then maps it to its unique form in a
system-dependent way. This typically involves removing redundant names
such as

"."

and

".."

from the pathname, resolving
symbolic links (on UNIX platforms), and converting drive letters to a
standard case (on Microsoft Windows platforms).

Every pathname that denotes an existing file or directory has a
unique canonical form. Every pathname that denotes a nonexistent file
or directory also has a unique canonical form. The canonical form of
the pathname of a nonexistent file or directory may be different from
the canonical form of the same pathname after the file or directory is
created. Similarly, the canonical form of the pathname of an existing
file or directory may be different from the canonical form of the same
pathname after the file or directory is deleted.

**Returns:** The canonical pathname string denoting the same file or
directory as this abstract pathname
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs, which is possible because the
construction of the canonical pathname may require
filesystem queries
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a required system property value cannot be accessed, or
if a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(java.io.FileDescriptor)

method denies
read access to the file

system is converted into an abstract pathname in a virtual machine on a
different operating system.

Note that when this abstract pathname represents a UNC pathname then
all components of the UNC (including the server name component) are encoded
in the

URI

path. The authority component is undefined, meaning
that it is represented as

null

. The

Path

class defines the

toUri

method to encode the server name in the authority
component of the resulting

URI

. The

toPath

method
may be used to obtain a

Path

representing this abstract pathname.

For a given abstract pathname

f

, it is guaranteed that

new

File

(

f

.toURI()).equals(

f

.

getAbsoluteFile

())

so long as the original abstract pathname, the URI, and the new abstract
pathname are all created in (possibly different invocations of) the same
Java virtual machine. Due to the system-dependent nature of abstract
pathnames, however, this relationship typically does not hold when a

```

Returns the time that the file denoted by this abstract pathname was
last modified.

**API Note:** While the unit of time of the return value is milliseconds, the
granularity of the value depends on the underlying file system and may
be larger. For example, some file systems use time stamps in units of
seconds.

Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
where

```

Requests that the file or directory denoted by this abstract
pathname be deleted when the virtual machine terminates.
Files (or directories) are deleted in the reverse order that
they are registered. Invoking this method to delete a file or
directory that is already registered for deletion has no effect.
Deletion will be attempted only for normal termination of the
virtual machine, as defined by the Java Language Specification.

Once deletion has been requested, it is not possible to cancel the
request. This method should therefore be used with care.

Note: this method should

not

be used for file-locking, as
the resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The

FileLock

facility should be used instead.

Returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the
directory denoted by this abstract pathname.

If this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, then this
method returns

null

. Otherwise an array of strings is
returned, one for each file or directory in the directory. Names
denoting the directory itself and the directory's parent directory are
not included in the result. Each string is a file name rather than a
complete path.

There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array
will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular,
guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order.

Note that the

method to
open a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the directory.
This may use less resources when working with very large directories, and
may be more responsive when working with remote directories.

Creates the directory named by this abstract pathname, including any
necessary but nonexistent parent directories. Note that if this
operation fails it may have succeeded in creating some of the necessary
parent directories.

renameTo

```java
public boolean renameTo​(
File
dest)
```

Renames the file denoted by this abstract pathname.

Many aspects of the behavior of this method are inherently
platform-dependent: The rename operation might not be able to move a
file from one filesystem to another, it might not be atomic, and it
might not succeed if a file with the destination abstract pathname
already exists. The return value should always be checked to make sure
that the rename operation was successful.

Note that the

Files

class defines the

move

method to move or rename a file in a
platform independent manner.

**Parameters:** dest

- The new abstract pathname for the named file
**Returns:** true

if and only if the renaming succeeded;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)

method denies write access to either the old or new pathnames
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If parameter

dest

is

null

setLastModified

```java
public boolean setLastModified​(long time)
```

Sets the last-modified time of the file or directory named by this
abstract pathname.

All platforms support file-modification times to the nearest second,
but some provide more precision. The argument will be truncated to fit
the supported precision. If the operation succeeds and no intervening
operations on the file take place, then the next invocation of the

lastModified()

method will return the (possibly
truncated)

time

argument that was passed to this method.

**Parameters:** time

- The new last-modified time, measured in milliseconds since
the epoch (00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970)
**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

setReadOnly

```java
public boolean setReadOnly()
```

Marks the file or directory named by this abstract pathname so that
only read operations are allowed. After invoking this method the file
or directory will not change until it is either deleted or marked

Java virtual machine with special privileges that allow it to modify
files that are marked read-only. Whether or not a read-only file or
directory may be deleted depends upon the underlying system.

**Returns:** true

if and only if the operation succeeded;

false

otherwise
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

listRoots

```java
public static
File
[] listRoots()
```

List the available filesystem roots.

A particular Java platform may support zero or more
hierarchically-organized file systems. Each file system has a

root

directory from which all other files in that file system
can be reached. Windows platforms, for example, have a root directory
for each active drive; UNIX platforms have a single root directory,
namely

"/"

. The set of available filesystem roots is affected
by various system-level operations such as the insertion or ejection of
removable media and the disconnecting or unmounting of physical or
virtual disk drives.

This method returns an array of

File

objects that denote the
root directories of the available filesystem roots. It is guaranteed
that the canonical pathname of any file physically present on the local
machine will begin with one of the roots returned by this method.

The canonical pathname of a file that resides on some other machine
and is accessed via a remote-filesystem protocol such as SMB or NFS may
or may not begin with one of the roots returned by this method. If the
pathname of a remote file is syntactically indistinguishable from the
pathname of a local file then it will begin with one of the roots
returned by this method. Thus, for example,

File

objects
denoting the root directories of the mapped network drives of a Windows
platform will be returned by this method, while

File

objects
containing UNC pathnames will not be returned by this method.

Unlike most methods in this class, this method does not throw
security exceptions. If a security manager exists and its

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method denies read access to a
particular root directory, then that directory will not appear in the
result.

**Returns:** An array of

File

objects denoting the available
filesystem roots, or

null

if the set of roots could not
be determined. The array will be empty if there are no
filesystem roots.

The returned number of unallocated bytes is a hint, but not
a guarantee, that it is possible to use most or any of these
bytes. The number of unallocated bytes is most likely to be
accurate immediately after this call. It is likely to be made
inaccurate by any external I/O operations including those made

createTempFile

```java
public static
File
createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix,

File
directory)
throws
IOException
```

Creates a new empty file in the specified directory, using the
given prefix and suffix strings to generate its name. If this method
returns successfully then it is guaranteed that:

- The file denoted by the returned abstract pathname did not exist
before this method was invoked, and

Neither this method nor any of its variants will return the same
abstract pathname again in the current invocation of the virtual
machine.

This method provides only part of a temporary-file facility. To arrange
for a file created by this method to be deleted automatically, use the

deleteOnExit()

method.

The

prefix

argument must be at least three characters
long. It is recommended that the prefix be a short, meaningful string
such as

"hjb"

or

"mail"

. The

suffix

argument may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used.

To create the new file, the prefix and the suffix may first be
adjusted to fit the limitations of the underlying platform. If the
prefix is too long then it will be truncated, but its first three
characters will always be preserved. If the suffix is too long then it
too will be truncated, but if it begins with a period character
(

'.'

) then the period and the first three characters
following it will always be preserved. Once these adjustments have been
made the name of the new file will be generated by concatenating the
prefix, five or more internally-generated characters, and the suffix.

If the

directory

argument is

null

then the
system-dependent default temporary-file directory will be used. The
default temporary-file directory is specified by the system property

java.io.tmpdir

. On UNIX systems the default value of this
property is typically

"/tmp"

or

"/var/tmp"

; on
Microsoft Windows systems it is typically

"C:\\WINNT\\TEMP"

#### createTempFile

File

createTempFile​(

String

prefix,

String

suffix,

File

directory)
throws

IOException

Creates a new empty file in the specified directory, using the
given prefix and suffix strings to generate its name. If this method
returns successfully then it is guaranteed that:

- The file denoted by the returned abstract pathname did not exist
before this method was invoked, and

Neither this method nor any of its variants will return the same
abstract pathname again in the current invocation of the virtual
machine.

This method provides only part of a temporary-file facility. To arrange
for a file created by this method to be deleted automatically, use the

deleteOnExit()

method.

The

prefix

argument must be at least three characters
long. It is recommended that the prefix be a short, meaningful string
such as

"hjb"

or

"mail"

. The

suffix

argument may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used.

To create the new file, the prefix and the suffix may first be
adjusted to fit the limitations of the underlying platform. If the
prefix is too long then it will be truncated, but its first three
characters will always be preserved. If the suffix is too long then it
too will be truncated, but if it begins with a period character
(

'.'

) then the period and the first three characters
following it will always be preserved. Once these adjustments have been
made the name of the new file will be generated by concatenating the
prefix, five or more internally-generated characters, and the suffix.

If the

directory

argument is

null

then the
system-dependent default temporary-file directory will be used. The
default temporary-file directory is specified by the system property

java.io.tmpdir

. On UNIX systems the default value of this
property is typically

"/tmp"

or

"/var/tmp"

; on
Microsoft Windows systems it is typically

"C:\\WINNT\\TEMP"

. A different
value may be given to this system property when the Java virtual machine
is invoked, but programmatic changes to this property are not guaranteed

createTempFile

```java
public static
File
createTempFile​(
String
prefix,

String
suffix)
throws
IOException
```

Creates an empty file in the default temporary-file directory, using
the given prefix and suffix to generate its name. Invoking this method
is equivalent to invoking

createTempFile(prefix, suffix, null)

.

The

Files.createTempFile

method provides an alternative method to create an
empty file in the temporary-file directory. Files created by that method
may have more restrictive access permissions to files created by this
method and so may be more suited to security-sensitive applications.

**Parameters:** prefix

- The prefix string to be used in generating the file's
name; must be at least three characters long
**Parameters:** suffix

- The suffix string to be used in generating the file's
name; may be

null

, in which case the
suffix

".tmp"

will be used
**Returns:** An abstract pathname denoting a newly-created empty file
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the

prefix

argument contains fewer than three
characters
**Throws:** IOException

- If a file could not be created
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager exists and its

compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
File
pathname)

Compares two abstract pathnames lexicographically. The ordering
defined by this method depends upon the underlying system. On UNIX
systems, alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows
systems it is not.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

File

>
**Parameters:** pathname

- The abstract pathname to be compared to this abstract
pathname
**Returns:** Zero if the argument is equal to this abstract pathname, a
value less than zero if this abstract pathname is
lexicographically less than the argument, or a value greater
than zero if this abstract pathname is lexicographically
greater than the argument
**Since:** 1.2

```

Tests this abstract pathname for equality with the given object.
Returns

true

if and only if the argument is not

null

and is an abstract pathname that denotes the same file
or directory as this abstract pathname. Whether or not two abstract
pathnames are equal depends upon the underlying system. On UNIX
systems, alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows

hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Computes a hash code for this abstract pathname. Because equality of
abstract pathnames is inherently system-dependent, so is the computation
of their hash codes. On UNIX systems, the hash code of an abstract
pathname is equal to the exclusive

or

of the hash code
of its pathname string and the decimal value

1234321

. On Microsoft Windows systems, the hash
code is equal to the exclusive

or

of the hash code of
its pathname string converted to lower case and the decimal
value

1234321

. Locale is not taken into account on
lowercasing the pathname string.

**Overrides:** hashCode
