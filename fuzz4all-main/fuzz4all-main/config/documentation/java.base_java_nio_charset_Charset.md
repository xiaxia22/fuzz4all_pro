# Class Charset

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\charset\Charset.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Charset

extends
Object

implements
Comparable
<
Charset
>
```

A named mapping between sequences of sixteen-bit Unicode

code units

and sequences of
bytes. This class defines methods for creating decoders and encoders and
for retrieving the various names associated with a charset. Instances of
this class are immutable.

This class also defines static methods for testing whether a particular
charset is supported, for locating charset instances by name, and for
constructing a map that contains every charset for which support is
available in the current Java virtual machine. Support for new charsets can
be added via the service-provider interface defined in the

CharsetProvider

class.

All of the methods defined in this class are safe for use by multiple
concurrent threads.

Charset names

Charsets are named by strings composed of the following characters:

- The uppercase letters

'A'

through

'Z'

(

'\u0041'

through

'\u005a'

),

The lowercase letters

'a'

through

'z'

(

'\u0061'

through

'\u007a'

),

The digits

'0'

through

'9'

(

'\u0030'

through

'\u0039'

),

The dash character

'-'

(

'\u002d'

,

HYPHEN-MINUS

),

The plus character

'+'

(

'\u002b'

,

PLUS SIGN

),

The period character

'.'

(

'\u002e'

,

FULL STOP

),

The colon character

':'

(

'\u003a'

,

COLON

), and

The underscore character

'_'

(

'\u005f'

,

LOW LINE

).

A charset name must begin with either a letter or a digit. The empty string
is not a legal charset name. Charset names are not case-sensitive; that is,
case is always ignored when comparing charset names. Charset names
generally follow the conventions documented in

RFC 2278: IANA Charset
Registration Procedures

.

Every charset has a

canonical name

and may also have one or more

aliases

. The canonical name is returned by the

name

method
of this class. Canonical names are, by convention, usually in upper case.
The aliases of a charset are returned by the

aliases

method.

Some charsets have an

historical name

that is defined for
compatibility with previous versions of the Java platform.

A charset's
historical name is either its canonical name or one of its aliases. The
historical name is returned by the

getEncoding()

methods of the

InputStreamReader

and

OutputStreamWriter

classes.

If a charset listed in the

IANA Charset
Registry

is supported by an implementation of the Java platform then
its canonical name must be the name listed in the registry. Many charsets
are given more than one name in the registry, in which case the registry
identifies one of the names as

MIME-preferred

. If a charset has more
than one registry name then its canonical name must be the MIME-preferred
name and the other names in the registry must be valid aliases. If a
supported charset is not listed in the IANA registry then its canonical name
must begin with one of the strings

"X-"

or

"x-"

.

The IANA charset registry does change over time, and so the canonical
name and the aliases of a particular charset may also change over time. To
ensure compatibility it is recommended that no alias ever be removed from a
charset, and that if the canonical name of a charset is changed then its
previous canonical name be made into an alias.

Standard charsets

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard charsets.

Consult the release documentation for your
implementation to see if any other charsets are supported. The behavior
of such optional charsets may differ between implementations.

Description of standard charsets

Charset

Description

US-ASCII

Seven-bit ASCII, a.k.a.

ISO646-US

,
a.k.a. the Basic Latin block of the Unicode character set

ISO-8859-1

ISO Latin Alphabet No. 1, a.k.a.

ISO-LATIN-1

UTF-8

Eight-bit UCS Transformation Format

UTF-16BE

Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format,
big-endian byte order

UTF-16LE

Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format,
little-endian byte order

UTF-16

Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format,
byte order identified by an optional byte-order mark

The

UTF-8

charset is specified by

RFC 2279

; the
transformation format upon which it is based is specified in
Amendment 2 of ISO 10646-1 and is also described in the

Unicode
Standard

.

The

UTF-16

charsets are specified by

RFC 2781

; the
transformation formats upon which they are based are specified in
Amendment 1 of ISO 10646-1 and are also described in the

Unicode
Standard

.

The

UTF-16

charsets use sixteen-bit quantities and are
therefore sensitive to byte order. In these encodings the byte order of a
stream may be indicated by an initial

byte-order mark

represented by
the Unicode character

'\uFEFF'

. Byte-order marks are handled
as follows:

- When decoding, the

UTF-16BE

and

UTF-16LE

charsets interpret the initial byte-order marks as a

ZERO-WIDTH
NON-BREAKING SPACE

; when encoding, they do not write
byte-order marks.
- When decoding, the

UTF-16

charset interprets the
byte-order mark at the beginning of the input stream to indicate the
byte-order of the stream but defaults to big-endian if there is no
byte-order mark; when encoding, it uses big-endian byte order and writes
a big-endian byte-order mark.

In any case, byte order marks occurring after the first element of an
input sequence are not omitted since the same code is used to represent

ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE

.

Every instance of the Java virtual machine has a default charset, which
may or may not be one of the standard charsets. The default charset is
determined during virtual-machine startup and typically depends upon the
locale and charset being used by the underlying operating system.

The

StandardCharsets

class defines constants for each of the
standard charsets.

Terminology

The name of this class is taken from the terms used in

RFC 2278

.
In that document a

charset

is defined as the combination of
one or more coded character sets and a character-encoding scheme.
(This definition is confusing; some other software systems define

charset

as a synonym for

coded character set

.)

A

coded character set

is a mapping between a set of abstract
characters and a set of integers. US-ASCII, ISO 8859-1,
JIS X 0201, and Unicode are examples of coded character sets.

Some standards have defined a

character set

to be simply a
set of abstract characters without an associated assigned numbering.
An alphabet is an example of such a character set. However, the subtle
distinction between

character set

and

coded character set

is rarely used in practice; the former has become a short form for the
latter, including in the Java API specification.

A

character-encoding scheme

is a mapping between one or more
coded character sets and a set of octet (eight-bit byte) sequences.
UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO 2022, and EUC are examples of
character-encoding schemes. Encoding schemes are often associated with
a particular coded character set; UTF-8, for example, is used only to
encode Unicode. Some schemes, however, are associated with multiple
coded character sets; EUC, for example, can be used to encode
characters in a variety of Asian coded character sets.

When a coded character set is used exclusively with a single
character-encoding scheme then the corresponding charset is usually
named for the coded character set; otherwise a charset is usually named
for the encoding scheme and, possibly, the locale of the coded
character sets that it supports. Hence

US-ASCII

is both the
name of a coded character set and of the charset that encodes it, while

EUC-JP

is the name of the charset that encodes the
JIS X 0201, JIS X 0208, and JIS X 0212
coded character sets for the Japanese language.

The native character encoding of the Java programming language is
UTF-16. A charset in the Java platform therefore defines a mapping
between sequences of sixteen-bit UTF-16 code units (that is, sequences
of chars) and sequences of bytes.

String
canonicalName,

String
[] aliases)

Initializes a new charset with the given canonical name and alias
set.

**Parameters:**
- canonicalName

- The canonical name of this charset
- aliases

- An array of this charset's aliases, or null if it has no aliases

**Throws:**

---

### Method Details

#### public static boolean isSupported​(
String
charsetName)

Tells whether the named charset is supported.

**Parameters:**
- charsetName

- The name of the requested charset; may be either
a canonical name or an alias

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, support for the named charset
is available in the current Java virtual machine

**Throws:**
- IllegalCharsetNameException

- If the given charset name is illegal
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the given

charsetName

is null

---

#### public static
Charset
forName​(
String
charsetName)

Returns a charset object for the named charset.

**Parameters:**
- charsetName

- The name of the requested charset; may be either
a canonical name or an alias

**Returns:**
- A charset object for the named charset

**Throws:**
- IllegalCharsetNameException

- If the given charset name is illegal
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the given

charsetName

is null
- UnsupportedCharsetException

- If no support for the named charset is available
in this instance of the Java virtual machine

---

#### public static
SortedMap
<
String
,​
Charset
> availableCharsets()

Constructs a sorted map from canonical charset names to charset objects.

The map returned by this method will have one entry for each charset
for which support is available in the current Java virtual machine. If
two or more supported charsets have the same canonical name then the
resulting map will contain just one of them; which one it will contain
is not specified.

The invocation of this method, and the subsequent use of the
resulting map, may cause time-consuming disk or network I/O operations
to occur. This method is provided for applications that need to
enumerate all of the available charsets, for example to allow user
charset selection. This method is not used by the

forName

method, which instead employs an efficient incremental lookup
algorithm.

This method may return different results at different times if new
charset providers are dynamically made available to the current Java
virtual machine. In the absence of such changes, the charsets returned
by this method are exactly those that can be retrieved via the

forName

method.

**Returns:**
- An immutable, case-insensitive map from canonical charset names
to charset objects

---

#### public static
Charset
defaultCharset()

Returns the default charset of this Java virtual machine.

The default charset is determined during virtual-machine startup and
typically depends upon the locale and charset of the underlying
operating system.

**Returns:**
- A charset object for the default charset

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public final
String
name()

Returns this charset's canonical name.

**Returns:**
- The canonical name of this charset

---

#### public final
Set
<
String
> aliases()

Returns a set containing this charset's aliases.

**Returns:**
- An immutable set of this charset's aliases

---

#### public
String
displayName()

Returns this charset's human-readable name for the default locale.

The default implementation of this method simply returns this
charset's canonical name. Concrete subclasses of this class may
override this method in order to provide a localized display name.

**Returns:**
- The display name of this charset in the default locale

---

#### public final boolean isRegistered()

Tells whether or not this charset is registered in the

IANA Charset
Registry

.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this charset is known by its
implementor to be registered with the IANA

---

#### public
String
displayName​(
Locale
locale)

Returns this charset's human-readable name for the given locale.

The default implementation of this method simply returns this
charset's canonical name. Concrete subclasses of this class may
override this method in order to provide a localized display name.

**Parameters:**
- locale

- The locale for which the display name is to be retrieved

**Returns:**
- The display name of this charset in the given locale

---

#### public abstract boolean contains​(
Charset
cs)

Tells whether or not this charset contains the given charset.

A charset

C

is said to

contain

a charset

D

if,
and only if, every character representable in

D

is also
representable in

C

. If this relationship holds then it is
guaranteed that every string that can be encoded in

D

can also be
encoded in

C

without performing any replacements.

That

C

contains

D

does not imply that each character
representable in

C

by a particular byte sequence is represented
in

D

by the same byte sequence, although sometimes this is the
case.

Every charset contains itself.

This method computes an approximation of the containment relation:
If it returns

true

then the given charset is known to be
contained by this charset; if it returns

false

, however, then
it is not necessarily the case that the given charset is not contained
in this charset.

**Parameters:**
- cs

- The given charset

**Returns:**
- true

if the given charset is contained in this charset

---

#### public abstract
CharsetDecoder
newDecoder()

Constructs a new decoder for this charset.

**Returns:**
- A new decoder for this charset

---

#### public abstract
CharsetEncoder
newEncoder()

Constructs a new encoder for this charset.

**Returns:**
- A new encoder for this charset

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If this charset does not support encoding

---

#### public boolean canEncode()

Tells whether or not this charset supports encoding.

Nearly all charsets support encoding. The primary exceptions are
special-purpose

auto-detect

charsets whose decoders can determine
which of several possible encoding schemes is in use by examining the
input byte sequence. Such charsets do not support encoding because
there is no way to determine which encoding should be used on output.
Implementations of such charsets should override this method to return

false

.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this charset supports encoding

---

#### public final
CharBuffer
decode​(
ByteBuffer
bb)

Convenience method that decodes bytes in this charset into Unicode
characters.

An invocation of this method upon a charset

cs

returns the
same result as the expression

```java
cs.newDecoder()
.onMalformedInput(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
.onUnmappableCharacter(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
.decode(bb);
```

except that it is potentially more efficient because it can cache
decoders between successive invocations.

This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
sequences with this charset's default replacement byte array. In order
to detect such sequences, use the

CharsetDecoder.decode(java.nio.ByteBuffer)

method directly.

**Parameters:**
- bb

- The byte buffer to be decoded

**Returns:**
- A char buffer containing the decoded characters

---

#### public final
ByteBuffer
encode​(
CharBuffer
cb)

Convenience method that encodes Unicode characters into bytes in this
charset.

An invocation of this method upon a charset

cs

returns the
same result as the expression

```java
cs.newEncoder()
.onMalformedInput(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
.onUnmappableCharacter(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
.encode(bb);
```

except that it is potentially more efficient because it can cache
encoders between successive invocations.

This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
sequences with this charset's default replacement string. In order to
detect such sequences, use the

CharsetEncoder.encode(java.nio.CharBuffer)

method directly.

**Parameters:**
- cb

- The char buffer to be encoded

**Returns:**
- A byte buffer containing the encoded characters

---

#### public final
ByteBuffer
encode​(
String
str)

Convenience method that encodes a string into bytes in this charset.

An invocation of this method upon a charset

cs

returns the
same result as the expression

```java
cs.encode(CharBuffer.wrap(s));
```

**Parameters:**
- str

- The string to be encoded

**Returns:**
- A byte buffer containing the encoded characters

---

#### public final int compareTo​(
Charset
that)

Compares this charset to another.

Charsets are ordered by their canonical names, without regard to
case.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

Charset

>

**Parameters:**
- that

- The charset to which this charset is to be compared

**Returns:**
- A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this charset
is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified charset

---

#### public final int hashCode()

Computes a hashcode for this charset.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- An integer hashcode

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public final boolean equals​(
Object
ob)

Tells whether or not this object is equal to another.

Two charsets are equal if, and only if, they have the same canonical
names. A charset is never equal to any other type of object.

A named mapping between sequences of sixteen-bit Unicode

code units

and sequences of
bytes. This class defines methods for creating decoders and encoders and
for retrieving the various names associated with a charset. Instances of
this class are immutable.

This class also defines static methods for testing whether a particular
charset is supported, for locating charset instances by name, and for
constructing a map that contains every charset for which support is
available in the current Java virtual machine. Support for new charsets can
be added via the service-provider interface defined in the

CharsetProvider

class.

All of the methods defined in this class are safe for use by multiple
concurrent threads.

Charset names

Charsets are named by strings composed of the following characters:

- The uppercase letters

'A'

through

'Z'

(

'\u0041'

through

'\u005a'

),

The lowercase letters

'a'

through

'z'

(

'\u0061'

through

'\u007a'

),

The digits

'0'

through

'9'

(

'\u0030'

through

'\u0039'

),

The dash character

'-'

(

'\u002d'

,

HYPHEN-MINUS

),

The plus character

'+'

(

'\u002b'

,

PLUS SIGN

),

The period character

'.'

(

'\u002e'

,

FULL STOP

),

The colon character

':'

(

'\u003a'

,

COLON

), and

The underscore character

'_'

(

'\u005f'

,

LOW LINE

).

A charset name must begin with either a letter or a digit. The empty string
is not a legal charset name. Charset names are not case-sensitive; that is,
case is always ignored when comparing charset names. Charset names
generally follow the conventions documented in

RFC 2278: IANA Charset
Registration Procedures

.

Every charset has a

canonical name

and may also have one or more

aliases

. The canonical name is returned by the

name

method
of this class. Canonical names are, by convention, usually in upper case.
The aliases of a charset are returned by the

aliases

method.

Some charsets have an

historical name

that is defined for
compatibility with previous versions of the Java platform.

A charset's
historical name is either its canonical name or one of its aliases. The
historical name is returned by the

getEncoding()

methods of the

InputStreamReader

and

OutputStreamWriter

classes.

If a charset listed in the

IANA Charset
Registry

is supported by an implementation of the Java platform then
its canonical name must be the name listed in the registry. Many charsets
are given more than one name in the registry, in which case the registry
identifies one of the names as

MIME-preferred

. If a charset has more
than one registry name then its canonical name must be the MIME-preferred
name and the other names in the registry must be valid aliases. If a
supported charset is not listed in the IANA registry then its canonical name
must begin with one of the strings

"X-"

or

"x-"

.

The IANA charset registry does change over time, and so the canonical
name and the aliases of a particular charset may also change over time. To
ensure compatibility it is recommended that no alias ever be removed from a
charset, and that if the canonical name of a charset is changed then its
previous canonical name be made into an alias.

Standard charsets

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard charsets.

Consult the release documentation for your
implementation to see if any other charsets are supported. The behavior
of such optional charsets may differ between implementations.

Description of standard charsets

The

UTF-8

charset is specified by

RFC 2279

; the
transformation format upon which it is based is specified in
Amendment 2 of ISO 10646-1 and is also described in the

Unicode
Standard

.

The

UTF-16

charsets are specified by

RFC 2781

; the
transformation formats upon which they are based are specified in
Amendment 1 of ISO 10646-1 and are also described in the

Unicode
Standard

.

The

UTF-16

charsets use sixteen-bit quantities and are
therefore sensitive to byte order. In these encodings the byte order of a
stream may be indicated by an initial

byte-order mark

represented by
the Unicode character

'\uFEFF'

. Byte-order marks are handled
as follows:

- When decoding, the

UTF-16BE

and

UTF-16LE

charsets interpret the initial byte-order marks as a

ZERO-WIDTH
NON-BREAKING SPACE

; when encoding, they do not write
byte-order marks.
- When decoding, the

UTF-16

charset interprets the
byte-order mark at the beginning of the input stream to indicate the
byte-order of the stream but defaults to big-endian if there is no
byte-order mark; when encoding, it uses big-endian byte order and writes
a big-endian byte-order mark.

In any case, byte order marks occurring after the first element of an
input sequence are not omitted since the same code is used to represent

ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE

.

Every instance of the Java virtual machine has a default charset, which
may or may not be one of the standard charsets. The default charset is
determined during virtual-machine startup and typically depends upon the
locale and charset being used by the underlying operating system.

The

StandardCharsets

class defines constants for each of the
standard charsets.

Terminology

The name of this class is taken from the terms used in

RFC 2278

.
In that document a

charset

is defined as the combination of
one or more coded character sets and a character-encoding scheme.
(This definition is confusing; some other software systems define

charset

as a synonym for

coded character set

.)

A

coded character set

is a mapping between a set of abstract
characters and a set of integers. US-ASCII, ISO 8859-1,
JIS X 0201, and Unicode are examples of coded character sets.

Some standards have defined a

character set

to be simply a
set of abstract characters without an associated assigned numbering.
An alphabet is an example of such a character set. However, the subtle
distinction between

character set

and

coded character set

is rarely used in practice; the former has become a short form for the
latter, including in the Java API specification.

A

character-encoding scheme

is a mapping between one or more
coded character sets and a set of octet (eight-bit byte) sequences.
UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO 2022, and EUC are examples of
character-encoding schemes. Encoding schemes are often associated with
a particular coded character set; UTF-8, for example, is used only to
encode Unicode. Some schemes, however, are associated with multiple
coded character sets; EUC, for example, can be used to encode
characters in a variety of Asian coded character sets.

When a coded character set is used exclusively with a single
character-encoding scheme then the corresponding charset is usually
named for the coded character set; otherwise a charset is usually named
for the encoding scheme and, possibly, the locale of the coded
character sets that it supports. Hence

US-ASCII

is both the
name of a coded character set and of the charset that encodes it, while

EUC-JP

is the name of the charset that encodes the
JIS X 0201, JIS X 0208, and JIS X 0212
coded character sets for the Japanese language.

The native character encoding of the Java programming language is
UTF-16. A charset in the Java platform therefore defines a mapping
between sequences of sixteen-bit UTF-16 code units (that is, sequences
of chars) and sequences of bytes.

are given more than one name in the registry, in which case the registry
identifies one of the names as

MIME-preferred

. If a charset has more
than one registry name then its canonical name must be the MIME-preferred
name and the other names in the registry must be valid aliases. If a
supported charset is not listed in the IANA registry then its canonical name
must begin with one of the strings

"X-"

or

"x-"

.

The IANA charset registry does change over time, and so the canonical
name and the aliases of a particular charset may also change over time. To
ensure compatibility it is recommended that no alias ever be removed from a
charset, and that if the canonical name of a charset is changed then its
previous canonical name be made into an alias.

Standard charsets

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard charsets.

Consult the release documentation for your
implementation to see if any other charsets are supported. The behavior
of such optional charsets may differ between implementations.

The

charsets use sixteen-bit quantities and are
therefore sensitive to byte order. In these encodings the byte order of a
stream may be indicated by an initial

byte-order mark

represented by
the Unicode character

'\uFEFF'

. Byte-order marks are handled
as follows:

- When decoding, the

UTF-16BE

and

UTF-16LE

charsets interpret the initial byte-order marks as a

ZERO-WIDTH

; when encoding, they do not write
byte-order marks.
- When decoding, the

UTF-16

charset interprets the
byte-order mark at the beginning of the input stream to indicate the
byte-order of the stream but defaults to big-endian if there is no
byte-order mark; when encoding, it uses big-endian byte order and writes
a big-endian byte-order mark.

In any case, byte order marks occurring after the first element of an
input sequence are not omitted since the same code is used to represent

ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE

.

Every instance of the Java virtual machine has a default charset, which
may or may not be one of the standard charsets. The default charset is
determined during virtual-machine startup and typically depends upon the
locale and charset being used by the underlying operating system.

The

StandardCharsets

class defines constants for each of the
standard charsets.

Terminology

The name of this class is taken from the terms used in

RFC 2278

.
In that document a

charset

is defined as the combination of
one or more coded character sets and a character-encoding scheme.
(This definition is confusing; some other software systems define

charset

as a synonym for

coded character set

.)

A

coded character set

is a mapping between a set of abstract
characters and a set of integers. US-ASCII, ISO 8859-1,
JIS X 0201, and Unicode are examples of coded character sets.

Some standards have defined a

character set

to be simply a
set of abstract characters without an associated assigned numbering.
An alphabet is an example of such a character set. However, the subtle
distinction between

character set

and

coded character set

is rarely used in practice; the former has become a short form for the
latter, including in the Java API specification.

A

character-encoding scheme

is a mapping between one or more
coded character sets and a set of octet (eight-bit byte) sequences.
UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO 2022, and EUC are examples of
character-encoding schemes. Encoding schemes are often associated with
a particular coded character set; UTF-8, for example, is used only to
encode Unicode. Some schemes, however, are associated with multiple
coded character sets; EUC, for example, can be used to encode
characters in a variety of Asian coded character sets.

When a coded character set is used exclusively with a single
character-encoding scheme then the corresponding charset is usually
named for the coded character set; otherwise a charset is usually named
for the encoding scheme and, possibly, the locale of the coded
character sets that it supports. Hence

US-ASCII

is both the
name of a coded character set and of the charset that encodes it, while

EUC-JP

is the name of the charset that encodes the
JIS X 0201, JIS X 0208, and JIS X 0212
coded character sets for the Japanese language.

The native character encoding of the Java programming language is
UTF-16. A charset in the Java platform therefore defines a mapping
between sequences of sixteen-bit UTF-16 code units (that is, sequences
of chars) and sequences of bytes.

This class also defines static methods for testing whether a particular
charset is supported, for locating charset instances by name, and for
constructing a map that contains every charset for which support is
available in the current Java virtual machine. Support for new charsets can
be added via the service-provider interface defined in the

CharsetProvider

class.

All of the methods defined in this class are safe for use by multiple
concurrent threads.

Charset names

Charsets are named by strings composed of the following characters:

- The uppercase letters

'A'

through

'Z'

(

'\u0041'

through

'\u005a'

),

The lowercase letters

'a'

through

'z'

(

'\u0061'

through

'\u007a'

),

The digits

'0'

through

'9'

(

'\u0030'

through

'\u0039'

),

The dash character

'-'

(

'\u002d'

,

HYPHEN-MINUS

),

The plus character

'+'

(

'\u002b'

,

PLUS SIGN

),

The period character

'.'

(

'\u002e'

,

FULL STOP

),

The colon character

':'

(

'\u003a'

,

COLON

), and

The underscore character

'_'

(

'\u005f'

,

LOW LINE

).

A charset name must begin with either a letter or a digit. The empty string
is not a legal charset name. Charset names are not case-sensitive; that is,
case is always ignored when comparing charset names. Charset names
generally follow the conventions documented in

RFC 2278: IANA Charset
Registration Procedures

.

Every charset has a

canonical name

and may also have one or more

aliases

. The canonical name is returned by the

name

method
of this class. Canonical names are, by convention, usually in upper case.
The aliases of a charset are returned by the

aliases

method.

Some charsets have an

historical name

that is defined for
compatibility with previous versions of the Java platform.

A charset's
historical name is either its canonical name or one of its aliases. The
historical name is returned by the

getEncoding()

methods of the

InputStreamReader

and

OutputStreamWriter

classes.

If a charset listed in the

IANA Charset
Registry

is supported by an implementation of the Java platform then
its canonical name must be the name listed in the registry. Many charsets
are given more than one name in the registry, in which case the registry
identifies one of the names as

MIME-preferred

. If a charset has more
than one registry name then its canonical name must be the MIME-preferred
name and the other names in the registry must be valid aliases. If a
supported charset is not listed in the IANA registry then its canonical name
must begin with one of the strings

"X-"

or

"x-"

.

The IANA charset registry does change over time, and so the canonical
name and the aliases of a particular charset may also change over time. To
ensure compatibility it is recommended that no alias ever be removed from a
charset, and that if the canonical name of a charset is changed then its
previous canonical name be made into an alias.

Every charset has a

canonical name

and may also have one or more

aliases

. The canonical name is returned by the

name

method
of this class. Canonical names are, by convention, usually in upper case.
The aliases of a charset are returned by the

aliases

method.

Some charsets have an

historical name

that is defined for
compatibility with previous versions of the Java platform.

A charset's
historical name is either its canonical name or one of its aliases. The
historical name is returned by the

getEncoding()

methods of the

InputStreamReader

and

OutputStreamWriter

classes.

If a charset listed in the

IANA Charset
Registry

is supported by an implementation of the Java platform then
its canonical name must be the name listed in the registry. Many charsets
are given more than one name in the registry, in which case the registry
identifies one of the names as

MIME-preferred

. If a charset has more
than one registry name then its canonical name must be the MIME-preferred
name and the other names in the registry must be valid aliases. If a
supported charset is not listed in the IANA registry then its canonical name
must begin with one of the strings

"X-"

or

"x-"

.

The IANA charset registry does change over time, and so the canonical
name and the aliases of a particular charset may also change over time. To
ensure compatibility it is recommended that no alias ever be removed from a
charset, and that if the canonical name of a charset is changed then its
previous canonical name be made into an alias.

Standard charsets

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard charsets.

Consult the release documentation for your
implementation to see if any other charsets are supported. The behavior
of such optional charsets may differ between implementations.

charsets are specified by

RFC 2781

; the
transformation formats upon which they are based are specified in
Amendment 1 of ISO 10646-1 and are also described in the

.

The

UTF-16

charsets use sixteen-bit quantities and are
therefore sensitive to byte order. In these encodings the byte order of a
stream may be indicated by an initial

byte-order mark

represented by
the Unicode character

'\uFEFF'

. Byte-order marks are handled
as follows:

- When decoding, the

UTF-16BE

and

UTF-16LE

charsets interpret the initial byte-order marks as a

ZERO-WIDTH
NON-BREAKING SPACE

; when encoding, they do not write
byte-order marks.
- When decoding, the

UTF-16

charset interprets the
byte-order mark at the beginning of the input stream to indicate the
byte-order of the stream but defaults to big-endian if there is no
byte-order mark; when encoding, it uses big-endian byte order and writes
a big-endian byte-order mark.

In any case, byte order marks occurring after the first element of an
input sequence are not omitted since the same code is used to represent

ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE

.

Every instance of the Java virtual machine has a default charset, which
may or may not be one of the standard charsets. The default charset is
determined during virtual-machine startup and typically depends upon the
locale and charset being used by the underlying operating system.

The

StandardCharsets

class defines constants for each of the
standard charsets.

Terminology

The name of this class is taken from the terms used in

RFC 2278

.
In that document a

charset

is defined as the combination of
one or more coded character sets and a character-encoding scheme.
(This definition is confusing; some other software systems define

charset

as a synonym for

coded character set

.)

A

coded character set

is a mapping between a set of abstract
characters and a set of integers. US-ASCII, ISO 8859-1,
JIS X 0201, and Unicode are examples of coded character sets.

Some standards have defined a

character set

to be simply a
set of abstract characters without an associated assigned numbering.
An alphabet is an example of such a character set. However, the subtle
distinction between

character set

and

coded character set

is rarely used in practice; the former has become a short form for the
latter, including in the Java API specification.

A

character-encoding scheme

is a mapping between one or more
coded character sets and a set of octet (eight-bit byte) sequences.
UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO 2022, and EUC are examples of
character-encoding schemes. Encoding schemes are often associated with
a particular coded character set; UTF-8, for example, is used only to
encode Unicode. Some schemes, however, are associated with multiple
coded character sets; EUC, for example, can be used to encode
characters in a variety of Asian coded character sets.

When a coded character set is used exclusively with a single
character-encoding scheme then the corresponding charset is usually
named for the coded character set; otherwise a charset is usually named
for the encoding scheme and, possibly, the locale of the coded
character sets that it supports. Hence

US-ASCII

is both the
name of a coded character set and of the charset that encodes it, while

EUC-JP

is the name of the charset that encodes the
JIS X 0201, JIS X 0208, and JIS X 0212
coded character sets for the Japanese language.

The native character encoding of the Java programming language is
UTF-16. A charset in the Java platform therefore defines a mapping
between sequences of sixteen-bit UTF-16 code units (that is, sequences
of chars) and sequences of bytes.

Some charsets have an

historical name

that is defined for
compatibility with previous versions of the Java platform.

A charset's
historical name is either its canonical name or one of its aliases. The
historical name is returned by the

getEncoding()

methods of the

InputStreamReader

and

OutputStreamWriter

classes.

If a charset listed in the

IANA Charset
Registry

is supported by an implementation of the Java platform then
its canonical name must be the name listed in the registry. Many charsets
are given more than one name in the registry, in which case the registry
identifies one of the names as

MIME-preferred

. If a charset has more
than one registry name then its canonical name must be the MIME-preferred
name and the other names in the registry must be valid aliases. If a
supported charset is not listed in the IANA registry then its canonical name
must begin with one of the strings

"X-"

or

"x-"

.

The IANA charset registry does change over time, and so the canonical
name and the aliases of a particular charset may also change over time. To
ensure compatibility it is recommended that no alias ever be removed from a
charset, and that if the canonical name of a charset is changed then its
previous canonical name be made into an alias.

Standard charsets

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard charsets.

implementation to see if any other charsets are supported. The behavior
of such optional charsets may differ between implementations.

coded character set

is a mapping between a set of abstract
characters and a set of integers. US-ASCII, ISO 8859-1,
JIS X 0201, and Unicode are examples of coded character sets.

Some standards have defined a

character set

to be simply a
set of abstract characters without an associated assigned numbering.
An alphabet is an example of such a character set. However, the subtle
distinction between

character set

and

coded character set

is rarely used in practice; the former has become a short form for the
latter, including in the Java API specification.

A

character-encoding scheme

is a mapping between one or more
coded character sets and a set of octet (eight-bit byte) sequences.
UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO 2022, and EUC are examples of
character-encoding schemes. Encoding schemes are often associated with
a particular coded character set; UTF-8, for example, is used only to
encode Unicode. Some schemes, however, are associated with multiple
coded character sets; EUC, for example, can be used to encode
characters in a variety of Asian coded character sets.

When a coded character set is used exclusively with a single
character-encoding scheme then the corresponding charset is usually
named for the coded character set; otherwise a charset is usually named
for the encoding scheme and, possibly, the locale of the coded
character sets that it supports. Hence

US-ASCII

is both the
name of a coded character set and of the charset that encodes it, while

EUC-JP

is the name of the charset that encodes the
JIS X 0201, JIS X 0208, and JIS X 0212
coded character sets for the Japanese language.

The native character encoding of the Java programming language is
UTF-16. A charset in the Java platform therefore defines a mapping
between sequences of sixteen-bit UTF-16 code units (that is, sequences
of chars) and sequences of bytes.

The

UTF-16

charsets are specified by

RFC 2781

; the
transformation formats upon which they are based are specified in
Amendment 1 of ISO 10646-1 and are also described in the

Unicode
Standard

.

The

UTF-16

charsets use sixteen-bit quantities and are
therefore sensitive to byte order. In these encodings the byte order of a
stream may be indicated by an initial

byte-order mark

represented by
the Unicode character

'\uFEFF'

. Byte-order marks are handled
as follows:

- When decoding, the

UTF-16BE

and

UTF-16LE

charsets interpret the initial byte-order marks as a

ZERO-WIDTH
NON-BREAKING SPACE

; when encoding, they do not write
byte-order marks.
- When decoding, the

UTF-16

charset interprets the
byte-order mark at the beginning of the input stream to indicate the
byte-order of the stream but defaults to big-endian if there is no
byte-order mark; when encoding, it uses big-endian byte order and writes
a big-endian byte-order mark.

In any case, byte order marks occurring after the first element of an
input sequence are not omitted since the same code is used to represent

ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE

.

Every instance of the Java virtual machine has a default charset, which
may or may not be one of the standard charsets. The default charset is
determined during virtual-machine startup and typically depends upon the
locale and charset being used by the underlying operating system.

The

StandardCharsets

class defines constants for each of the
standard charsets.

Terminology

The name of this class is taken from the terms used in

RFC 2278

.
In that document a

charset

is defined as the combination of
one or more coded character sets and a character-encoding scheme.
(This definition is confusing; some other software systems define

charset

as a synonym for

coded character set

.)

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- Charset

```java
protected Charset​(
String
canonicalName,

String
[] aliases)
```

Initializes a new charset with the given canonical name and alias
set.

**Parameters:** canonicalName

- The canonical name of this charset
**Parameters:** aliases

- An array of this charset's aliases, or null if it has no aliases
**Throws:** IllegalCharsetNameException

- If the canonical name or any of the aliases are illegal

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- isSupported

```java
public static boolean isSupported​(
String
charsetName)
```

Tells whether the named charset is supported.

**Parameters:** charsetName

- The name of the requested charset; may be either
a canonical name or an alias
**Returns:** true

if, and only if, support for the named charset
is available in the current Java virtual machine
**Throws:** IllegalCharsetNameException

- If the given charset name is illegal
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the given

charsetName

is null

- forName

```java
public static
Charset
forName​(
String
charsetName)
```

Returns a charset object for the named charset.

**Parameters:** charsetName

- The name of the requested charset; may be either
a canonical name or an alias
**Returns:** A charset object for the named charset
**Throws:** IllegalCharsetNameException

- If the given charset name is illegal
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the given

charsetName

is null
**Throws:** UnsupportedCharsetException

- If no support for the named charset is available
in this instance of the Java virtual machine

- availableCharsets

```java
public static
SortedMap
<
String
,​
Charset
> availableCharsets()
```

Constructs a sorted map from canonical charset names to charset objects.

The map returned by this method will have one entry for each charset
for which support is available in the current Java virtual machine. If
two or more supported charsets have the same canonical name then the
resulting map will contain just one of them; which one it will contain
is not specified.

The invocation of this method, and the subsequent use of the
resulting map, may cause time-consuming disk or network I/O operations
to occur. This method is provided for applications that need to
enumerate all of the available charsets, for example to allow user
charset selection. This method is not used by the

forName

method, which instead employs an efficient incremental lookup
algorithm.

This method may return different results at different times if new
charset providers are dynamically made available to the current Java
virtual machine. In the absence of such changes, the charsets returned
by this method are exactly those that can be retrieved via the

forName

method.

**Returns:** An immutable, case-insensitive map from canonical charset names
to charset objects

- defaultCharset

```java
public static
Charset
defaultCharset()
```

Returns the default charset of this Java virtual machine.

The default charset is determined during virtual-machine startup and
typically depends upon the locale and charset of the underlying
operating system.

**Returns:** A charset object for the default charset
**Since:** 1.5

- name

```java
public final
String
name()

**Returns:** The display name of this charset in the given locale

- contains

```java
public abstract boolean contains​(
Charset
cs)
```

Tells whether or not this charset contains the given charset.

A charset

C

is said to

contain

a charset

D

if,
and only if, every character representable in

D

is also
representable in

C

. If this relationship holds then it is
guaranteed that every string that can be encoded in

D

can also be
encoded in

C

without performing any replacements.

That

C

contains

D

does not imply that each character
representable in

C

by a particular byte sequence is represented
in

D

by the same byte sequence, although sometimes this is the
case.

Every charset contains itself.

This method computes an approximation of the containment relation:
If it returns

true

then the given charset is known to be
contained by this charset; if it returns

false

, however, then
it is not necessarily the case that the given charset is not contained
in this charset.

**Parameters:** cs

- The given charset
**Returns:** true

if the given charset is contained in this charset

- newDecoder

```java
public abstract
CharsetDecoder
newDecoder()
```

Constructs a new decoder for this charset.

**Returns:** A new encoder for this charset
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If this charset does not support encoding

- canEncode

```java
public boolean canEncode()
```

Tells whether or not this charset supports encoding.

Nearly all charsets support encoding. The primary exceptions are
special-purpose

auto-detect

charsets whose decoders can determine
which of several possible encoding schemes is in use by examining the
input byte sequence. Such charsets do not support encoding because
there is no way to determine which encoding should be used on output.
Implementations of such charsets should override this method to return

false

.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this charset supports encoding

- decode

```java
public final
CharBuffer
decode​(
ByteBuffer
bb)
```

Convenience method that decodes bytes in this charset into Unicode
characters.

An invocation of this method upon a charset

cs

returns the
same result as the expression

```java
cs.newDecoder()
.onMalformedInput(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
.onUnmappableCharacter(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
.decode(bb);
```

except that it is potentially more efficient because it can cache
decoders between successive invocations.

This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
sequences with this charset's default replacement byte array. In order
to detect such sequences, use the

CharsetDecoder.decode(java.nio.ByteBuffer)

method directly.

**Parameters:** bb

- The byte buffer to be decoded
**Returns:** A char buffer containing the decoded characters

- encode

```java
public final

Tells whether or not this charset supports encoding.

Nearly all charsets support encoding. The primary exceptions are
special-purpose

auto-detect

charsets whose decoders can determine
which of several possible encoding schemes is in use by examining the
input byte sequence. Such charsets do not support encoding because
there is no way to determine which encoding should be used on output.
Implementations of such charsets should override this method to return

false

.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this charset supports encoding

decode

```java
public final
CharBuffer
decode​(
ByteBuffer
bb)
```

Convenience method that decodes bytes in this charset into Unicode
characters.

An invocation of this method upon a charset

cs

returns the
same result as the expression

```java
cs.newDecoder()
.onMalformedInput(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
.onUnmappableCharacter(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
.decode(bb);
```

except that it is potentially more efficient because it can cache
decoders between successive invocations.

This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
sequences with this charset's default replacement byte array. In order
to detect such sequences, use the

CharsetDecoder.decode(java.nio.ByteBuffer)

method directly.

**Parameters:** bb

- The byte buffer to be decoded
**Returns:** A char buffer containing the decoded characters
