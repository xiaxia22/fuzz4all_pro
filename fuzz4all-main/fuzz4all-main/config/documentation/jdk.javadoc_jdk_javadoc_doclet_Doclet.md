# Interface Doclet

**Source:** `jdk.javadoc\jdk\javadoc\doclet\Doclet.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Doclet
```

The user doclet must implement this interface, as described in the

package description

.
Each implementation of a Doclet must provide a public no-argument constructor
to be used by tools to instantiate the doclet. The tool infrastructure will
interact with classes implementing this interface as follows:

- The tool will create an instance of a doclet using the no-arg constructor
of the doclet class.

Next, the tool calls the

init

method with an appropriate locale
and reporter.

Afterwards, the tool calls

getSupportedOptions

,
and

getSupportedSourceVersion

.
These methods are only called once.

As appropriate, the tool calls the

run

method on the doclet
object, giving it a DocletEnvironment object, from which the doclet can determine
the elements to be included in the documentation.

If a doclet object is created and used without the above protocol being followed,
then the doclet's behavior is not defined by this interface specification.

To start the doclet, pass

-doclet

followed by the fully-qualified
name of the entry point class (i.e. the implementation of this interface) on
the javadoc tool command line.
