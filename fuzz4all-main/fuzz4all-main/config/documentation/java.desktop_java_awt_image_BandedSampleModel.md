# Class BandedSampleModel

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\BandedSampleModel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
BandedSampleModel

extends
ComponentSampleModel
```

This class represents image data which is stored in a band interleaved
fashion and for
which each sample of a pixel occupies one data element of the DataBuffer.
It subclasses ComponentSampleModel but provides a more efficient
implementation for accessing band interleaved image data than is provided
by ComponentSampleModel. This class should typically be used when working
with images which store sample data for each band in a different bank of the
DataBuffer. Accessor methods are provided so that image data can be
manipulated directly. Pixel stride is the number of
data array elements between two samples for the same band on the same
scanline. The pixel stride for a BandedSampleModel is one.
Scanline stride is the number of data array elements between
a given sample and the corresponding sample in the same column of the next
scanline. Band offsets denote the number
of data array elements from the first data array element of the bank
of the DataBuffer holding each band to the first sample of the band.
The bands are numbered from 0 to N-1.
Bank indices denote the correspondence between a bank of the data buffer
and a band of image data. This class supports

TYPE_BYTE

,

TYPE_USHORT

,

TYPE_SHORT

,

TYPE_INT

,

TYPE_FLOAT

, and

TYPE_DOUBLE

datatypes

---

#### public
Object
getDataElements​(int x,
int y,

Object
obj,

DataBuffer
data)

Returns data for a single pixel in a primitive array of type
TransferType. For a BandedSampleModel, this will be the same
as the data type, and samples will be returned one per array
element. Generally, obj
should be passed in as null, so that the Object will be created
automatically and will be of the right primitive data type.

The following code illustrates transferring data for one pixel from
DataBuffer

db1

, whose storage layout is described by
BandedSampleModel

bsm1

, to DataBuffer

db2

,
whose storage layout is described by
BandedSampleModel

bsm2

.
The transfer will generally be more efficient than using
getPixel/setPixel.

```java
BandedSampleModel bsm1, bsm2;
DataBufferInt db1, db2;
bsm2.setDataElements(x, y, bsm1.getDataElements(x, y, null, db1),
db2);
```

Using getDataElements/setDataElements to transfer between two
DataBuffer/SampleModel pairs is legitimate if the SampleModels have
the same number of bands, corresponding bands have the same number of
bits per sample, and the TransferTypes are the same.

If obj is non-null, it should be a primitive array of type TransferType.
Otherwise, a ClassCastException is thrown. An
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException may be thrown if the coordinates are
not in bounds, or if obj is non-null and is not large enough to hold
the pixel data.

**Overrides:**
- getDataElements

in class

ComponentSampleModel

This class represents image data which is stored in a band interleaved
fashion and for
which each sample of a pixel occupies one data element of the DataBuffer.
It subclasses ComponentSampleModel but provides a more efficient
implementation for accessing band interleaved image data than is provided
by ComponentSampleModel. This class should typically be used when working
with images which store sample data for each band in a different bank of the
DataBuffer. Accessor methods are provided so that image data can be
manipulated directly. Pixel stride is the number of
data array elements between two samples for the same band on the same
scanline. The pixel stride for a BandedSampleModel is one.
Scanline stride is the number of data array elements between
a given sample and the corresponding sample in the same column of the next
scanline. Band offsets denote the number
of data array elements from the first data array element of the bank
of the DataBuffer holding each band to the first sample of the band.
The bands are numbered from 0 to N-1.
Bank indices denote the correspondence between a bank of the data buffer
and a band of image data. This class supports

public
SampleModel
createCompatibleSampleModel​(int w,
int h)
```

Creates a new BandedSampleModel with the specified
width and height. The new BandedSampleModel will have the same
number of bands, storage data type, and bank indices
as this BandedSampleModel. The band offsets will be compressed
such that the offset between bands will be w*pixelStride and
the minimum of all of the band offsets is zero.

**Overrides:** createCompatibleSampleModel

in class

ComponentSampleModel

- the width of the resulting

BandedSampleModel
**Parameters:** h

- the height of the resulting

BandedSampleModel
**Returns:** a new

BandedSampleModel

with the specified

createSubsetSampleModel​(int[] bands)
```

Creates a new BandedSampleModel with a subset of the bands of this
BandedSampleModel. The new BandedSampleModel can be
used with any DataBuffer that the existing BandedSampleModel

combination will represent an image with a subset of the bands
of the original BandedSampleModel/DataBuffer combination.

**Overrides:** createSubsetSampleModel

in class

ComponentSampleModel

ComponentSampleModel

created with a subset
of bands from this

ComponentSampleModel

.

DataBuffer

whose data type, number of banks
and size are consistent with this

ComponentSampleModel

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- getDataElements

```java
public
Object
getDataElements​(int x,
int y,

Object
obj,

DataBuffer
data)
```

Returns data for a single pixel in a primitive array of type
TransferType. For a BandedSampleModel, this will be the same
as the data type, and samples will be returned one per array
element. Generally, obj
should be passed in as null, so that the Object will be created
automatically and will be of the right primitive data type.

The following code illustrates transferring data for one pixel from
DataBuffer

db1

, whose storage layout is described by
BandedSampleModel

bsm1

, to DataBuffer

db2

,
whose storage layout is described by
BandedSampleModel

bsm2

.
The transfer will generally be more efficient than using
getPixel/setPixel.

```java
BandedSampleModel bsm1, bsm2;
DataBufferInt db1, db2;
bsm2.setDataElements(x, y, bsm1.getDataElements(x, y, null, db1),
db2);
```

Using getDataElements/setDataElements to transfer between two
DataBuffer/SampleModel pairs is legitimate if the SampleModels have
the same number of bands, corresponding bands have the same number of
bits per sample, and the TransferTypes are the same.

If obj is non-null, it should be a primitive array of type TransferType.
Otherwise, a ClassCastException is thrown. An
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException may be thrown if the coordinates are
not in bounds, or if obj is non-null and is not large enough to hold
the pixel data.

- getDataElements

```java
public
Object
getDataElements​(int x,
int y,

Object
obj,

DataBuffer
data)
```

Returns data for a single pixel in a primitive array of type
TransferType. For a BandedSampleModel, this will be the same
as the data type, and samples will be returned one per array
element. Generally, obj
should be passed in as null, so that the Object will be created
automatically and will be of the right primitive data type.

The following code illustrates transferring data for one pixel from
DataBuffer

db1

, whose storage layout is described by
BandedSampleModel

bsm1

, to DataBuffer

db2

,
whose storage layout is described by
BandedSampleModel

bsm2

.
The transfer will generally be more efficient than using
getPixel/setPixel.

```java
BandedSampleModel bsm1, bsm2;
DataBufferInt db1, db2;
bsm2.setDataElements(x, y, bsm1.getDataElements(x, y, null, db1),
db2);
```

Using getDataElements/setDataElements to transfer between two
DataBuffer/SampleModel pairs is legitimate if the SampleModels have
the same number of bands, corresponding bands have the same number of
bits per sample, and the TransferTypes are the same.

If obj is non-null, it should be a primitive array of type TransferType.
Otherwise, a ClassCastException is thrown. An
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException may be thrown if the coordinates are
not in bounds, or if obj is non-null and is not large enough to hold
the pixel data.

#### setDataElements

public void setDataElements​(int x,
int y,

Object

obj,

DataBuffer

data)

Sets the data for a single pixel in the specified DataBuffer from a
primitive array of type TransferType. For a BandedSampleModel,
this will be the same as the data type, and samples are transferred
one per array element.

The following code illustrates transferring data for one pixel from
DataBuffer

db1

, whose storage layout is described by
BandedSampleModel

bsm1

, to DataBuffer

db2

,
whose storage layout is described by
BandedSampleModel

bsm2

.
The transfer will generally be more efficient than using
getPixel/setPixel.

```java
BandedSampleModel bsm1, bsm2;
DataBufferInt db1, db2;
bsm2.setDataElements(x, y, bsm1.getDataElements(x, y, null, db1),
db2);
```

Using getDataElements/setDataElements to transfer between two
DataBuffer/SampleModel pairs is legitimate if the SampleModels have
the same number of bands, corresponding bands have the same number of
bits per sample, and the TransferTypes are the same.

obj must be a primitive array of type TransferType. Otherwise,
a ClassCastException is thrown. An
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException may be thrown if the coordinates are
not in bounds, or if obj is not large enough to hold the pixel data.
