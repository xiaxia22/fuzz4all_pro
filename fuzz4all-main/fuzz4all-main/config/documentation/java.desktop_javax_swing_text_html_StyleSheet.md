# Class StyleSheet

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\text\html\StyleSheet.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
StyleSheet

extends
StyleContext
```

Support for defining the visual characteristics of
HTML views being rendered. The StyleSheet is used to
translate the HTML model into visual characteristics.
This enables views to be customized by a look-and-feel,
multiple views over the same model can be rendered
differently, etc. This can be thought of as a CSS
rule repository. The key for CSS attributes is an
object of type CSS.Attribute. The type of the value
is up to the StyleSheet implementation, but the

toString

method is required
to return a string representation of CSS value.

The primary entry point for HTML View implementations
to get their attributes is the

getViewAttributes

method. This should be implemented to establish the
desired policy used to associate attributes with the view.
Each HTMLEditorKit (i.e. and therefore each associated
JEditorPane) can have its own StyleSheet, but by default one
sheet will be shared by all of the HTMLEditorKit instances.
HTMLDocument instance can also have a StyleSheet, which
holds the document-specific CSS specifications.

In order for Views to store less state and therefore be
more lightweight, the StyleSheet can act as a factory for
painters that handle some of the rendering tasks. This allows
implementations to determine what they want to cache
and have the sharing potentially at the level that a
selector is common to multiple views. Since the StyleSheet
may be used by views over multiple documents and typically
the HTML attributes don't effect the selector being used,
the potential for sharing is significant.

The rules are stored as named styles, and other information
is stored to translate the context of an element to a
rule quickly. The following code fragment will display
the named styles, and therefore the CSS rules contained.

```java
import java.util.*;
import javax.swing.text.*;
import javax.swing.text.html.*;

public class ShowStyles {

public static void main(String[] args) {
HTMLEditorKit kit = new HTMLEditorKit();
HTMLDocument doc = (HTMLDocument) kit.createDefaultDocument();
StyleSheet styles = doc.getStyleSheet();

Enumeration rules = styles.getStyleNames();
while (rules.hasMoreElements()) {
String name = (String) rules.nextElement();
Style rule = styles.getStyle(name);
System.out.println(rule.toString());
}
System.exit(0);
}
}
```

The semantics for when a CSS style should overide visual attributes
defined by an element are not well defined. For example, the html

<body bgcolor=red>

makes the body have a red
background. But if the html file also contains the CSS rule

body { background: blue }

it becomes less clear as to
what color the background of the body should be. The current
implementation gives visual attributes defined in the element the
highest precedence, that is they are always checked before any styles.
Therefore, in the previous example the background would have a
red color as the body element defines the background color to be red.

As already mentioned this supports CSS. We don't support the full CSS
spec. Refer to the javadoc of the CSS class to see what properties
we support. The two major CSS parsing related
concepts we do not currently
support are pseudo selectors, such as

A:link { color: red }

,
and the

important

modifier.

### Constructor Details

#### public StyleSheet()

Construct a StyleSheet

---

### Method Details

#### public
Style
getRule​(
HTML.Tag
t,

Element
e)

Fetches the style to use to render the given type
of HTML tag. The element given is representing
the tag and can be used to determine the nesting
for situations where the attributes will differ
if nesting inside of elements.

**Parameters:**
- t

- the type to translate to visual attributes
- e

- the element representing the tag; the element
can be used to determine the nesting for situations where
the attributes will differ if nested inside of other
elements

**Returns:**
- the set of CSS attributes to use to render
the tag

---

#### public
Style
getRule​(
String
selector)

Fetches the rule that best matches the selector given
in string form. Where

selector

is a space separated
String of the element names. For example,

selector

might be 'html body tr td''

The attributes of the returned Style will change
as rules are added and removed. That is if you to ask for a rule
with a selector "table p" and a new rule was added with a selector
of "p" the returned Style would include the new attributes from
the rule "p".

**Parameters:**
- selector

- a space separated String of the element names.

**Returns:**
- the rule that best matches the selector.

---

#### public void addRule​(
String
rule)

Adds a set of rules to the sheet. The rules are expected to
be in valid CSS format. Typically this would be called as
a result of parsing a <style> tag.

**Parameters:**
- rule

- a set of rules

---

#### public
AttributeSet
getDeclaration​(
String
decl)

Translates a CSS declaration to an AttributeSet that represents
the CSS declaration. Typically this would be called as a

- a set of attributes that represents the CSS declaration.

---

#### public void loadRules​(

location of the stream and may be null. All relative
URLs specified in the stream will be based upon this
parameter.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if I/O error occured.

defined by an element are not well defined. For example, the html

<body bgcolor=red>

makes the body have a red
background. But if the html file also contains the CSS rule

body { background: blue }

it becomes less clear as to
what color the background of the body should be. The current
implementation gives visual attributes defined in the element the
highest precedence, that is they are always checked before any styles.
Therefore, in the previous example the background would have a
red color as the body element defines the background color to be red.

As already mentioned this supports CSS. We don't support the full CSS
spec. Refer to the javadoc of the CSS class to see what properties
we support. The two major CSS parsing related
concepts we do not currently
support are pseudo selectors, such as

A:link { color: red }

,
and the

important

modifier.

public
Style
getRule​(
HTML.Tag
t,

Element
