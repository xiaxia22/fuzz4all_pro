# Class MethodHandle

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\invoke\MethodHandle.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
MethodHandle

extends
Object
```

A method handle is a typed, directly executable reference to an underlying method,
constructor, field, or similar low-level operation, with optional
transformations of arguments or return values.
These transformations are quite general, and include such patterns as

conversion

,

insertion

,

deletion

,
and

substitution

.

Method handle contents

Method handles are dynamically and strongly typed according to their parameter and return types.
They are not distinguished by the name or the defining class of their underlying methods.
A method handle must be invoked using a symbolic type descriptor which matches
the method handle's own

type descriptor

.

Every method handle reports its type descriptor via the

type

accessor.
This type descriptor is a

MethodType

object,
whose structure is a series of classes, one of which is
the return type of the method (or

void.class

if none).

A method handle's type controls the types of invocations it accepts,
and the kinds of transformations that apply to it.

A method handle contains a pair of special invoker methods
called

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
Both invoker methods provide direct access to the method handle's
underlying method, constructor, field, or other operation,
as modified by transformations of arguments and return values.
Both invokers accept calls which exactly match the method handle's own type.
The plain, inexact invoker also accepts a range of other call types.

Method handles are immutable and have no visible state.
Of course, they can be bound to underlying methods or data which exhibit state.
With respect to the Java Memory Model, any method handle will behave
as if all of its (internal) fields are final variables. This means that any method
handle made visible to the application will always be fully formed.
This is true even if the method handle is published through a shared
variable in a data race.

Method handles cannot be subclassed by the user.
Implementations may (or may not) create internal subclasses of

MethodHandle

which may be visible via the

Object.getClass

operation. The programmer should not draw conclusions about a method handle
from its specific class, as the method handle class hierarchy (if any)
may change from time to time or across implementations from different vendors.

Method handle compilation

A Java method call expression naming

invokeExact

or

invoke

can invoke a method handle from Java source code.
From the viewpoint of source code, these methods can take any arguments
and their result can be cast to any return type.
Formally this is accomplished by giving the invoker methods

Object

return types and variable arity

Object

arguments,
but they have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction.
More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
Instead, it must generate instructions that push them on the stack according
to their own unconverted types. The method handle object itself is pushed on
the stack before the arguments.
The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction that invokes
the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which describes the argument
and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
the return type. This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
if there is one, or else

Object

if the invocation is an expression,
or else

void

if the invocation is a statement.
The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given
a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

.
The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Method handle invocation

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed
it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
This also holds for calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes
a method handle will always link, as long
as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

#### public
MethodType
type()

Reports the type of this method handle.
Every invocation of this method handle via

invokeExact

must exactly match this type.

**Returns:**
- the method handle type

---

#### public final
Object
invokeExact​(
Object
... args)
throws
Throwable

Invokes the method handle, allowing any caller type descriptor, but requiring an exact type match.
The symbolic type descriptor at the call site of

invokeExact

must
exactly match this method handle's

type

.
No conversions are allowed on arguments or return values.

When this method is observed via the Core Reflection API,
it will appear as a single native method, taking an object array and returning an object.
If this native method is invoked directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

, via JNI,
or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

,
it will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Parameters:**
- args

- the signature-polymorphic parameter list, statically represented using varargs

**Returns:**
- the signature-polymorphic result, statically represented using

Object

**Throws:**
- WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type is not identical with the caller's symbolic type descriptor
- Throwable

- anything thrown by the underlying method propagates unchanged through the method handle call

---

#### public final
Object
invoke​(
Object
... args)
throws
Throwable

Invokes the method handle, allowing any caller type descriptor,
and optionally performing conversions on arguments and return values.

If the call site's symbolic type descriptor exactly matches this method handle's

type

,
the call proceeds as if by

invokeExact

.

Otherwise, the call proceeds as if this method handle were first
adjusted by calling

asType

to adjust this method handle
to the required type, and then the call proceeds as if by

invokeExact

on the adjusted method handle.

There is no guarantee that the

asType

call is actually made.
If the JVM can predict the results of making the call, it may perform
adaptations directly on the caller's arguments,
and call the target method handle according to its own exact type.

The resolved type descriptor at the call site of

invoke

must
be a valid argument to the receivers

asType

method.
In particular, the caller must specify the same argument arity
as the callee's type,
if the callee is not a

variable arity collector

.

When this method is observed via the Core Reflection API,
it will appear as a single native method, taking an object array and returning an object.
If this native method is invoked directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

, via JNI,
or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

,
it will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Parameters:**
- args

- the signature-polymorphic parameter list, statically represented using varargs

**Returns:**
- the signature-polymorphic result, statically represented using

Object

**Throws:**
- WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type cannot be adjusted to the caller's symbolic type descriptor
- ClassCastException

- if the target's type can be adjusted to the caller, but a reference cast fails
- Throwable

- anything thrown by the underlying method propagates unchanged through the method handle call

---

#### public
Object
invokeWithArguments​(
Object
... arguments)
throws
Throwable

Performs a variable arity invocation, passing the arguments in the given array
to the method handle, as if via an inexact

invoke

from a call site
which mentions only the type

Object

, and whose actual argument count is the length
of the argument array.

Specifically, execution proceeds as if by the following steps,
although the methods are not guaranteed to be called if the JVM
can predict their effects.

- Determine the length of the argument array as

N

.
For a null reference,

N=0

.
- Collect the

N

elements of the array as a logical
argument list, each argument statically typed as an

Object

.
- Determine, as

M

, the parameter count of the type of this
method handle.
- Determine the general type

TN

of

N

arguments or

M

arguments, if smaller than

N

, as

TN=MethodType.genericMethodType(Math.min(N, M))

.
- If

N

is greater than

M

, perform the following
checks and actions to shorten the logical argument list:

- Check that this method handle has variable arity with a

trailing parameter

of some array type

A[]

. If not, fail with a

WrongMethodTypeException

.
- Collect the trailing elements (there are

N-M+1

of them)
from the logical argument list into a single array of
type

A[]

, using

asType

conversions to
convert each trailing argument to type

A

.
- If any of these conversions proves impossible, fail with either
a

ClassCastException

if any trailing element cannot be
cast to

A

or a

NullPointerException

if any
trailing element is

null

and

A

is not a reference
type.
- Replace the logical arguments gathered into the array of
type

A[]

with the array itself, thus shortening
the argument list to length

M

. This final argument
retains the static type

A[]

.
- Adjust the type

TN

by changing the

N

th
parameter type from

Object

to

A[]

.

Force the original target method handle

MH0

to the
required type, as

MH1 = MH0.asType(TN)

.

Spread the argument list into

N

separate arguments

A0, ...

.

Invoke the type-adjusted method handle on the unpacked arguments:
MH1.invokeExact(A0, ...).

Take the return value as an

Object

reference.

If the target method handle has variable arity, and the argument list is longer
than that arity, the excess arguments, starting at the position of the trailing
array argument, will be gathered (if possible, as if by

asType

conversions)
into an array of the appropriate type, and invocation will proceed on the
shortened argument list.
In this way,

jumbo argument lists

which would spread into more
than 254 slots can still be processed uniformly.

Unlike the

generic

invocation mode, which can
"recycle" an array argument, passing it directly to the target method,
this invocation mode

always

creates a new array parameter, even
if the original array passed to

invokeWithArguments

would have
been acceptable as a direct argument to the target method.
Even if the number

M

of actual arguments is the arity

N

,
and the last argument is dynamically a suitable array of type

A[]

,
it will still be boxed into a new one-element array, since the call
site statically types the argument as

Object

, not an array type.
This is not a special rule for this method, but rather a regular effect
of the

rules for variable-arity invocation

.

Because of the action of the

asType

step, the following argument
conversions are applied as necessary:

- reference casting

unboxing

widening primitive conversions

variable arity conversion

The result returned by the call is boxed if it is a primitive,
or forced to null if the return type is void.

Unlike the signature polymorphic methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

,

invokeWithArguments

can be accessed normally via the Core Reflection API and JNI.
It can therefore be used as a bridge between native or reflective code and method handles.

**Parameters:**
- arguments

- the arguments to pass to the target

**Returns:**
- the result returned by the target

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if an argument cannot be converted by reference casting
- WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type cannot be adjusted to take the given number of

Object

arguments
- Throwable

- anything thrown by the target method invocation

**See Also:**
- MethodHandles.spreadInvoker(java.lang.invoke.MethodType, int)

**API Note:**
- This call is approximately equivalent to the following code:

```java
// for jumbo argument lists, adapt varargs explicitly:
int N = (arguments == null? 0: arguments.length);
int M = this.type.parameterCount();
int MAX_SAFE = 127; // 127 longs require 254 slots, which is OK
if (N > MAX_SAFE && N > M && this.isVarargsCollector()) {
Class<?> arrayType = this.type().lastParameterType();
Class<?> elemType = arrayType.getComponentType();
if (elemType != null) {
Object args2 = Array.newInstance(elemType, M);
MethodHandle arraySetter = MethodHandles.arrayElementSetter(arrayType);
for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
arraySetter.invoke(args2, i, arguments[M-1 + i]);
}
arguments = Arrays.copyOf(arguments, M);
arguments[M-1] = args2;
return this.asFixedArity().invokeWithArguments(arguments);
}
} // done with explicit varargs processing

// Handle fixed arity and non-jumbo variable arity invocation.
MethodHandle invoker = MethodHandles.spreadInvoker(this.type(), 0);
Object result = invoker.invokeExact(this, arguments);
```

Performs a variable arity invocation, passing the arguments in the given list
to the method handle, as if via an inexact

---

#### public
MethodHandle
asType​(
MethodType
newType)

Produces an adapter method handle which adapts the type of the
current method handle to a new type.
The resulting method handle is guaranteed to report a type
which is equal to the desired new type.

If the original type and new type are equal, returns

this

.

The new method handle, when invoked, will perform the following
steps:

- Convert the incoming argument list to match the original
method handle's argument list.

Invoke the original method handle on the converted argument list.

Convert any result returned by the original method handle
to the return type of new method handle.

This method provides the crucial behavioral difference between

invokeExact

and plain, inexact

invoke

.
The two methods
perform the same steps when the caller's type descriptor exactly matches
the callee's, but when the types differ, plain

invoke

also calls

asType

(or some internal equivalent) in order
to match up the caller's and callee's types.

If the current method is a variable arity method handle
argument list conversion may involve the conversion and collection
of several arguments into an array, as

described elsewhere

.
In every other case, all conversions are applied

pairwise

,
which means that each argument or return value is converted to
exactly one argument or return value (or no return value).
The applied conversions are defined by consulting
the corresponding component types of the old and new
method handle types.

Let

T0

and

T1

be corresponding new and old parameter types,
or old and new return types. Specifically, for some valid index

i

, let

T0

=newType.parameterType(i)

and

T1

=this.type().parameterType(i)

.
Or else, going the other way for return values, let

T0

=this.type().returnType()

and

T1

=newType.returnType()

.
If the types are the same, the new method handle makes no change
to the corresponding argument or return value (if any).
Otherwise, one of the following conversions is applied
if possible:

- If

T0

and

T1

are references, then a cast to

T1

is applied.
(The types do not need to be related in any particular way.
This is because a dynamic value of null can convert to any reference type.)

If

T0

and

T1

are primitives, then a Java method invocation
conversion (JLS 5.3) is applied, if one exists.
(Specifically,

T0

must convert to

T1

by a widening primitive conversion.)

If

T0

is a primitive and

T1

a reference,
a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) is applied if one exists.
(Specifically, the value is boxed from

T0

to its wrapper class,
which is then widened as needed to

T1

.)

If

T0

is a reference and

T1

a primitive, an unboxing
conversion will be applied at runtime, possibly followed
by a Java method invocation conversion (JLS 5.3)
on the primitive value. (These are the primitive widening conversions.)

T0

must be a wrapper class or a supertype of one.
(In the case where

T0

is Object, these are the conversions
allowed by

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.)
The unboxing conversion must have a possibility of success, which means that
if

T0

is not itself a wrapper class, there must exist at least one
wrapper class

TW

which is a subtype of

T0

and whose unboxed
primitive value can be widened to

T1

.

If the return type

T1

is marked as void, any returned value is discarded

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a reference, a null value is introduced.

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a primitive,
a zero value is introduced.

(

Note:

Both

T0

and

T1

may be regarded as static types,
because neither corresponds specifically to the

dynamic type

of any
actual argument or return value.)

The method handle conversion cannot be made if any one of the required
pairwise conversions cannot be made.

At runtime, the conversions applied to reference arguments
or return values may require additional runtime checks which can fail.
An unboxing operation may fail because the original reference is null,
causing a

NullPointerException

.
An unboxing operation or a reference cast may also fail on a reference
to an object of the wrong type,
causing a

ClassCastException

.
Although an unboxing operation may accept several kinds of wrappers,
if none are available, a

ClassCastException

will be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- newType

- the expected type of the new method handle

**Returns:**
- a method handle which delegates to

this

after performing
any necessary argument conversions, and arranges for any
necessary return value conversions

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

newType

is a null reference
- WrongMethodTypeException

- if the conversion cannot be made

#### public
MethodHandle
asSpreader​(
Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)

Makes an

array-spreading

method handle, which accepts a trailing array argument
and spreads its elements as positional arguments.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be
the same as the type of the target, except that the final

arrayLength

parameters of the target's type are replaced
by a single array parameter of type

arrayType

.

If the array element type differs from any of the corresponding
argument types on the original target,
the original target is adapted to take the array elements directly,
as if by a call to

asType

.

When called, the adapter replaces a trailing array argument
by the array's elements, each as its own argument to the target.
(The order of the arguments is preserved.)
They are converted pairwise by casting and/or unboxing
to the types of the trailing parameters of the target.
Finally the target is called.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

Before calling the target, the adapter verifies that the array
contains exactly enough elements to provide a correct argument count
to the target method handle.
(The array may also be null when zero elements are required.)

When the adapter is called, the length of the supplied

array

argument is queried as if by

array.length

or

arraylength

bytecode. If the adapter accepts a zero-length trailing array argument,
the supplied

array

argument can either be a zero-length array or

null

; otherwise, the adapter will throw a

NullPointerException

if the array is

null

and throw an

IllegalArgumentException

if the array does not have the correct number of elements.

Here are some simple examples of array-spreading method handles:

```java
MethodHandle equals = publicLookup()
.findVirtual(String.class, "equals", methodType(boolean.class, Object.class));
assert( (boolean) equals.invokeExact("me", (Object)"me"));
assert(!(boolean) equals.invokeExact("me", (Object)"thee"));
// spread both arguments from a 2-array:
MethodHandle eq2 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 2);
assert( (boolean) eq2.invokeExact(new Object[]{ "me", "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq2.invokeExact(new Object[]{ "me", "thee" }));
// try to spread from anything but a 2-array:
for (int n = 0; n <= 10; n++) {
Object[] badArityArgs = (n == 2 ? new Object[0] : new Object[n]);
try { assert((boolean) eq2.invokeExact(badArityArgs) && false); }
catch (IllegalArgumentException ex) { } // OK
}
// spread both arguments from a String array:
MethodHandle eq2s = equals.asSpreader(String[].class, 2);
assert( (boolean) eq2s.invokeExact(new String[]{ "me", "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq2s.invokeExact(new String[]{ "me", "thee" }));
// spread second arguments from a 1-array:
MethodHandle eq1 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 1);
assert( (boolean) eq1.invokeExact("me", new Object[]{ "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq1.invokeExact("me", new Object[]{ "thee" }));
// spread no arguments from a 0-array or null:
MethodHandle eq0 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 0);
assert( (boolean) eq0.invokeExact("me", (Object)"me", new Object[0]));
assert(!(boolean) eq0.invokeExact("me", (Object)"thee", (Object[])null));
// asSpreader and asCollector are approximate inverses:
for (int n = 0; n <= 2; n++) {
for (Class<?> a : new Class<?>[]{Object[].class, String[].class, CharSequence[].class}) {
MethodHandle equals2 = equals.asSpreader(a, n).asCollector(a, n);
assert( (boolean) equals2.invokeWithArguments("me", "me"));
assert(!(boolean) equals2.invokeWithArguments("me", "thee"));
}
}
MethodHandle caToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, char[].class));
assertEquals("[A, B, C]", (String) caToString.invokeExact("ABC".toCharArray()));
MethodHandle caString3 = caToString.asCollector(char[].class, 3);
assertEquals("[A, B, C]", (String) caString3.invokeExact('A', 'B', 'C'));
MethodHandle caToString2 = caString3.asSpreader(char[].class, 2);
assertEquals("[A, B, C]", (String) caToString2.invokeExact('A', "BC".toCharArray()));
```

**Parameters:**
- arrayType

- usually

Object[]

, the type of the array argument from which to extract the spread arguments
- arrayLength

- the number of arguments to spread from an incoming array argument

**Returns:**
- a new method handle which spreads its final array argument,
before calling the original method handle

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type,
or if target does not have at least

arrayLength

parameter types,
or if

arrayLength

is negative,
or if the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
- WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails

#### public
MethodHandle
asSpreader​(int spreadArgPos,

Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)

Makes an

array-spreading

method handle, which accepts an array argument at a given position and spreads
its elements as positional arguments in place of the array. The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be the same as the type of the target, except that the

arrayLength

parameters of the target's type, starting at the zero-based position

spreadArgPos

,
are replaced by a single array parameter of type

arrayType

.

This method behaves very much like

asSpreader(Class, int)

, but accepts an additional

spreadArgPos

argument to indicate at which position in the parameter list the spreading should take place.

**Parameters:**
- spreadArgPos

- the position (zero-based index) in the argument list at which spreading should start.
- arrayType

- usually

Object[]

, the type of the array argument from which to extract the spread arguments
- arrayLength

- the number of arguments to spread from an incoming array argument

**Returns:**
- a new method handle which spreads an array argument at a given position,
before calling the original method handle

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type,
or if target does not have at least

arrayLength

parameter types,
or if

arrayLength

is negative,
or if

spreadArgPos

has an illegal value (negative, or together with arrayLength exceeding the
number of arguments),
or if the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
- WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails

- asSpreader(Class, int)

**Since:**

**API Note:**
- Example:

```java
MethodHandle compare = LOOKUP.findStatic(Objects.class, "compare", methodType(int.class, Object.class, Object.class, Comparator.class));
MethodHandle compare2FromArray = compare.asSpreader(0, Object[].class, 2);
Object[] ints = new Object[]{3, 9, 7, 7};
Comparator<Integer> cmp = (a, b) -> a - b;
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 0, 2), cmp) < 0);
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 1, 3), cmp) > 0);
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 2, 4), cmp) == 0);

#### public
MethodHandle
withVarargs​(boolean makeVarargs)

Adapts this method handle to be

variable arity

if the boolean flag is true, else

fixed arity

.
If the method handle is already of the proper arity mode, it is returned
unchanged.

**Parameters:**
- makeVarargs

- true if the return method handle should have variable arity behavior

**Returns:**
- a method handle of the same type, with possibly adjusted variable arity behavior

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

makeVarargs

is true and
this method handle does not have a trailing array parameter

**See Also:**
- asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class<?>)

,

asFixedArity()

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- This method is sometimes useful when adapting a method handle that
may be variable arity, to ensure that the resulting adapter is also
variable arity if and only if the original handle was. For example,
this code changes the first argument of a handle

mh

to

int

without
disturbing its variable arity property:

mh.asType(mh.type().changeParameterType(0,int.class))
.withVarargs(mh.isVarargsCollector())

This call is approximately equivalent to the following code:

```java
if (makeVarargs == isVarargsCollector())
return this;
else if (makeVarargs)
return asVarargsCollector(type().lastParameterType());
else
return return asFixedArity();
```

---

#### public
MethodHandle
asCollector​(
Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)

Makes an

array-collecting

method handle, which accepts a given number of trailing
positional arguments and collects them into an array argument.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be
the same as the type of the target, except that a single trailing
parameter (usually of type

arrayType

) is replaced by

arrayLength

parameters whose type is element type of

arrayType

.

If the array type differs from the final argument type on the original target,
the original target is adapted to take the array type directly,
as if by a call to

asType

.

When called, the adapter replaces its trailing

arrayLength

arguments by a single new array of type

arrayType

, whose elements
comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.
Finally the target is called.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

(The array may also be a shared constant when

arrayLength

is zero.)

(

Note:

The

arrayType

is often identical to the

last parameter type

of the original target.
It is an explicit argument for symmetry with

asSpreader

, and also
to allow the target to use a simple

Object

as its last parameter type.)

In order to create a collecting adapter which is not restricted to a particular
number of collected arguments, use

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

instead.

Here are some examples of array-collecting method handles:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) deepToString.invokeExact(new Object[]{"won"}));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 1);
assertEquals(methodType(String.class, Object.class), ts1.type());
//assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invokeExact( new Object[]{"won"})); //FAIL
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invokeExact((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// arrayType can be a subtype of Object[]
MethodHandle ts2 = deepToString.asCollector(String[].class, 2);
assertEquals(methodType(String.class, String.class, String.class), ts2.type());
assertEquals("[two, too]", (String) ts2.invokeExact("two", "too"));
MethodHandle ts0 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 0);
assertEquals("[]", (String) ts0.invokeExact());
// collectors can be nested, Lisp-style
MethodHandle ts22 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 3).asCollector(String[].class, 2);
assertEquals("[A, B, [C, D]]", ((String) ts22.invokeExact((Object)'A', (Object)"B", "C", "D")));
// arrayType can be any primitive array type
MethodHandle bytesToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, byte[].class))
.asCollector(byte[].class, 3);
assertEquals("[1, 2, 3]", (String) bytesToString.invokeExact((byte)1, (byte)2, (byte)3));
MethodHandle longsToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, long[].class))
.asCollector(long[].class, 1);
assertEquals("[123]", (String) longsToString.invokeExact((long)123));
```

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.

**Parameters:**
- arrayType

- often

Object[]

, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments
- arrayLength

- the number of arguments to collect into a new array argument

**Returns:**
- a new method handle which collects some trailing argument
into an array, before calling the original method handle

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type
or

arrayType

is not assignable to this method handle's trailing parameter type,
or

arrayLength

is not a legal array size,
or the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters

call fails

#### public
MethodHandle
asCollector​(int collectArgPos,

Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)

Makes an

array-collecting

method handle, which accepts a given number of positional arguments starting
at a given position, and collects them into an array argument. The new method handle adapts, as its

target

, the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be the same as the type of the target,
except that the parameter at the position indicated by

collectArgPos

(usually of type

arrayType

)
is replaced by

arrayLength

parameters whose type is element type of

arrayType

.

This method behaves very much like

asCollector(Class, int)

, but differs in that its

collectArgPos

argument indicates at which position in the parameter list arguments should be collected. This
index is zero-based.

**Parameters:**
- collectArgPos

- the zero-based position in the parameter list at which to start collecting.
- arrayType

- often

Object[]

, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments
- arrayLength

- the number of arguments to collect into a new array argument

**Returns:**

```

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.

---

#### public
MethodHandle
asVarargsCollector​(
Class
<?> arrayType)

Makes a

variable arity

adapter which is able to accept
any number of trailing positional arguments and collect them
into an array argument.

The type and behavior of the adapter will be the same as
the type and behavior of the target, except that certain

invoke

and

asType

requests can lead to
trailing positional arguments being collected into target's
trailing parameter.
Also, the

last parameter type

of the adapter will be

arrayType

, even if the target has a different
last parameter type.

This transformation may return

this

if the method handle is
already of variable arity and its trailing parameter type
is identical to

arrayType

.

When called with

invokeExact

, the adapter invokes
the target with no argument changes.
(

Note:

This behavior is different from a

fixed arity collector

,
since it accepts a whole array of indeterminate length,
rather than a fixed number of arguments.)

When called with plain, inexact

invoke

, if the caller
type is the same as the adapter, the adapter invokes the target as with

invokeExact

.
(This is the normal behavior for

invoke

when types match.)

Otherwise, if the caller and adapter arity are the same, and the
trailing parameter type of the caller is a reference type identical to
or assignable to the trailing parameter type of the adapter,
the arguments and return values are converted pairwise,
as if by

asType

on a fixed arity
method handle.

Otherwise, the arities differ, or the adapter's trailing parameter
type is not assignable from the corresponding caller type.
In this case, the adapter replaces all trailing arguments from
the original trailing argument position onward, by
a new array of type

arrayType

, whose elements
comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.

The caller type must provides as least enough arguments,
and of the correct type, to satisfy the target's requirement for
positional arguments before the trailing array argument.
Thus, the caller must supply, at a minimum,

N-1

arguments,
where

N

is the arity of the target.
Also, there must exist conversions from the incoming arguments
to the target's arguments.
As with other uses of plain

invoke

, if these basic
requirements are not fulfilled, a

WrongMethodTypeException

may be thrown.

In all cases, what the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

In the final case, it is exactly as if the target method handle were
temporarily adapted with a

fixed arity collector

to the arity required by the caller type.
(As with

asCollector

, if the array length is zero,
a shared constant may be used instead of a new array.
If the implied call to

asCollector

would throw
an

IllegalArgumentException

or

WrongMethodTypeException

,
the call to the variable arity adapter must throw

WrongMethodTypeException

.)

The behavior of

asType

is also specialized for
variable arity adapters, to maintain the invariant that
plain, inexact

invoke

is always equivalent to an

asType

call to adjust the target type, followed by

invokeExact

.
Therefore, a variable arity adapter responds
to an

asType

request by building a fixed arity collector,
if and only if the adapter and requested type differ either
in arity or trailing argument type.
The resulting fixed arity collector has its type further adjusted
(if necessary) to the requested type by pairwise conversion,
as if by another application of

asType

.

When a method handle is obtained by executing an

ldc

instruction
of a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

constant, and the target method is marked
as a variable arity method (with the modifier bit

0x0080

),
the method handle will accept multiple arities, as if the method handle
constant were created by means of a call to

asVarargsCollector

.

In order to create a collecting adapter which collects a predetermined
number of arguments, and whose type reflects this predetermined number,
use

asCollector

instead.

No method handle transformations produce new method handles with
variable arity, unless they are documented as doing so.
Therefore, besides

asVarargsCollector

and

withVarargs

,
all methods in

MethodHandle

and

MethodHandles

will return a method handle with fixed arity,
except in the cases where they are specified to return their original
operand (e.g.,

asType

of the method handle's own type).

Calling

asVarargsCollector

on a method handle which is already
of variable arity will produce a method handle with the same type and behavior.
It may (or may not) return the original variable arity method handle.

Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invokeExact( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( "won" ));
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invoke((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// findStatic of Arrays.asList(...) produces a variable arity method handle:
MethodHandle asList = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals(methodType(List.class, Object[].class), asList.type());
assert(asList.isVarargsCollector());
assertEquals("[]", asList.invoke().toString());
assertEquals("[1]", asList.invoke(1).toString());
assertEquals("[two, too]", asList.invoke("two", "too").toString());
String[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke((Object[])argv).toString());
List ls = (List) asList.invoke((Object)argv);
assertEquals(1, ls.size());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", Arrays.toString((Object[])ls.get(0)));
```

Discussion:

These rules are designed as a dynamically-typed variation
of the Java rules for variable arity methods.
In both cases, callers to a variable arity method or method handle
can either pass zero or more positional arguments, or else pass
pre-collected arrays of any length. Users should be aware of the
special role of the final argument, and of the effect of a
type match on that final argument, which determines whether
or not a single trailing argument is interpreted as a whole
array or a single element of an array to be collected.
Note that the dynamic type of the trailing argument has no
effect on this decision, only a comparison between the symbolic
type descriptor of the call site and the type descriptor of the method handle.)

**Parameters:**
- arrayType

- often

Object[]

, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments

**Returns:**
- a new method handle which can collect any number of trailing arguments
into an array, before calling the original method handle

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type
or

arrayType

is not assignable to this method handle's trailing parameter type

---

#### public boolean isVarargsCollector()

Determines if this method handle
supports

variable arity

calls.
Such method handles arise from the following sources:

- a call to

asVarargsCollector

a call to a

lookup method

which resolves to a variable arity Java method or constructor

an

ldc

instruction of a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

which resolves to a variable arity Java method or constructor

**Returns:**
- true if this method handle accepts more than one arity of plain, inexact

invoke

calls

**See Also:**
- asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class<?>)

,

asFixedArity()

---

#### public
MethodHandle
asFixedArity()

Makes a

fixed arity

method handle which is otherwise
equivalent to the current method handle.

If the current method handle is not of

variable arity

,
the current method handle is returned.
This is true even if the current method handle
could not be a valid input to

asVarargsCollector

.

Otherwise, the resulting fixed-arity method handle has the same
type and behavior of the current method handle,
except that

isVarargsCollector

will be false.
The fixed-arity method handle may (or may not) be the
a previous argument to

asVarargsCollector

.

Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:

```java
MethodHandle asListVar = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class))
.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
MethodHandle asListFix = asListVar.asFixedArity();
assertEquals("[1]", asListVar.invoke(1).toString());
Exception caught = null;
try { asListFix.invoke((Object)1); }
catch (Exception ex) { caught = ex; }
assert(caught instanceof ClassCastException);
assertEquals("[two, too]", asListVar.invoke("two", "too").toString());
try { asListFix.invoke("two", "too"); }
catch (Exception ex) { caught = ex; }
assert(caught instanceof WrongMethodTypeException);
Object[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asListVar.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asListFix.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals(1, ((List) asListVar.invoke((Object)argv)).size());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asListFix.invoke((Object)argv).toString());
```

**Returns:**
- a new method handle which accepts only a fixed number of arguments

x)

Binds a value

,
the current method handle by binding it to the given argument.
The type of the bound handle will be
the same as the type of the target, except that a single leading
reference parameter will be omitted.

When called, the bound handle inserts the given value

x

as a new leading argument to the target. The other arguments are
also passed unchanged.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the bound handle.

The reference

x

must be convertible to the first parameter
type of the target.

Note:

Because method handles are immutable, the target method handle
retains its original type and behavior.

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.

**Parameters:**
- x

- the value to bind to the first argument of the target

**Returns:**
- a new method handle which prepends the given value to the incoming
argument list, before calling the original method handle

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the target does not have a
leading parameter type that is a reference type
- ClassCastException

- if

x

cannot be converted
to the leading parameter type of the target

ending with the string representation of the method handle's type.
In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value of:

```java
"MethodHandle" + type().toString()
```

(

Note:

Future releases of this API may add further information
to the string representation.
Therefore, the present syntax should not be parsed by applications.)

```java
public abstract class
MethodHandle

extends
Object
```

A method handle is a typed, directly executable reference to an underlying method,
constructor, field, or similar low-level operation, with optional
transformations of arguments or return values.
These transformations are quite general, and include such patterns as

conversion

,

insertion

,

deletion

,
and

substitution

.

Method handle contents

Method handles are dynamically and strongly typed according to their parameter and return types.
They are not distinguished by the name or the defining class of their underlying methods.
A method handle must be invoked using a symbolic type descriptor which matches
the method handle's own

type descriptor

.

Every method handle reports its type descriptor via the

type

accessor.
This type descriptor is a

MethodType

object,
whose structure is a series of classes, one of which is
the return type of the method (or

void.class

if none).

A method handle's type controls the types of invocations it accepts,
and the kinds of transformations that apply to it.

A method handle contains a pair of special invoker methods
called

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
Both invoker methods provide direct access to the method handle's
underlying method, constructor, field, or other operation,
as modified by transformations of arguments and return values.
Both invokers accept calls which exactly match the method handle's own type.
The plain, inexact invoker also accepts a range of other call types.

Method handles are immutable and have no visible state.
Of course, they can be bound to underlying methods or data which exhibit state.
With respect to the Java Memory Model, any method handle will behave
as if all of its (internal) fields are final variables. This means that any method
handle made visible to the application will always be fully formed.
This is true even if the method handle is published through a shared
variable in a data race.

Method handles cannot be subclassed by the user.
Implementations may (or may not) create internal subclasses of

MethodHandle

which may be visible via the

Object.getClass

operation. The programmer should not draw conclusions about a method handle
from its specific class, as the method handle class hierarchy (if any)
may change from time to time or across implementations from different vendors.

Method handle compilation

A Java method call expression naming

invokeExact

or

invoke

can invoke a method handle from Java source code.
From the viewpoint of source code, these methods can take any arguments
and their result can be cast to any return type.
Formally this is accomplished by giving the invoker methods

Object

return types and variable arity

Object

arguments,
but they have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction.
More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
Instead, it must generate instructions that push them on the stack according
to their own unconverted types. The method handle object itself is pushed on
the stack before the arguments.
The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction that invokes
the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which describes the argument
and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
the return type. This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
if there is one, or else

Object

if the invocation is an expression,
or else

void

if the invocation is a statement.
The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given
a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

.
The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Method handle invocation

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed
it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
This also holds for calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes
a method handle will always link, as long
as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

Method handle compilation

A Java method call expression naming

From the viewpoint of source code, these methods can take any arguments

Formally this is accomplished by giving the invoker methods

which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to

More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
Instead, it must generate instructions that push them on the stack according

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
the return type. This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
if there is one, or else

Object

if the invocation is an expression,
or else

void

if the invocation is a statement.
The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given
a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

.
The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Method handle invocation

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed
it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
This also holds for calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes
a method handle will always link, as long
as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;

```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

---

#### Method handle contents

Every method handle reports its type descriptor via the

type

accessor.
This type descriptor is a

MethodType

object,
whose structure is a series of classes, one of which is
the return type of the method (or

void.class

if none).

A method handle's type controls the types of invocations it accepts,
and the kinds of transformations that apply to it.

A method handle contains a pair of special invoker methods
called

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
Both invoker methods provide direct access to the method handle's
underlying method, constructor, field, or other operation,
as modified by transformations of arguments and return values.
Both invokers accept calls which exactly match the method handle's own type.
The plain, inexact invoker also accepts a range of other call types.

Method handles are immutable and have no visible state.
Of course, they can be bound to underlying methods or data which exhibit state.
With respect to the Java Memory Model, any method handle will behave
as if all of its (internal) fields are final variables. This means that any method
handle made visible to the application will always be fully formed.
This is true even if the method handle is published through a shared
variable in a data race.

Method handles cannot be subclassed by the user.
Implementations may (or may not) create internal subclasses of

MethodHandle

which may be visible via the

Object.getClass

operation. The programmer should not draw conclusions about a method handle
from its specific class, as the method handle class hierarchy (if any)
may change from time to time or across implementations from different vendors.

Method handle compilation

A Java method call expression naming

invokeExact

or

invoke

can invoke a method handle from Java source code.
From the viewpoint of source code, these methods can take any arguments
and their result can be cast to any return type.
Formally this is accomplished by giving the invoker methods

Object

return types and variable arity

Object

arguments,
but they have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction.
More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
Instead, it must generate instructions that push them on the stack according
to their own unconverted types. The method handle object itself is pushed on
the stack before the arguments.
The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction that invokes
the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which describes the argument
and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
the return type. This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
if there is one, or else

Object

if the invocation is an expression,
or else

void

if the invocation is a statement.
The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given
a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

.
The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Method handle invocation

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed
it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
This also holds for calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes
a method handle will always link, as long
as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

A method handle's type controls the types of invocations it accepts,
and the kinds of transformations that apply to it.

A method handle contains a pair of special invoker methods
called

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
Both invoker methods provide direct access to the method handle's
underlying method, constructor, field, or other operation,
as modified by transformations of arguments and return values.
Both invokers accept calls which exactly match the method handle's own type.
The plain, inexact invoker also accepts a range of other call types.

Method handles are immutable and have no visible state.
Of course, they can be bound to underlying methods or data which exhibit state.
With respect to the Java Memory Model, any method handle will behave
as if all of its (internal) fields are final variables. This means that any method

This is true even if the method handle is published through a shared

MethodHandle

Object.getClass

operation. The programmer should not draw conclusions about a method handle
from its specific class, as the method handle class hierarchy (if any)
may change from time to time or across implementations from different vendors.

Method handle compilation

A Java method call expression naming

invokeExact

or

invoke

can invoke a method handle from Java source code.
From the viewpoint of source code, these methods can take any arguments
and their result can be cast to any return type.
Formally this is accomplished by giving the invoker methods

Object

return types and variable arity

Object

arguments,
but they have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction.
More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
Instead, it must generate instructions that push them on the stack according
to their own unconverted types. The method handle object itself is pushed on
the stack before the arguments.
The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction that invokes
the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which describes the argument
and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
the return type. This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
if there is one, or else

Object

if the invocation is an expression,
or else

void

if the invocation is a statement.
The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given
a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

.
The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Method handle invocation

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed
it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
This also holds for calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes
a method handle will always link, as long
as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

A method handle contains a pair of special invoker methods
called

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
Both invoker methods provide direct access to the method handle's
underlying method, constructor, field, or other operation,
as modified by transformations of arguments and return values.
Both invokers accept calls which exactly match the method handle's own type.
The plain, inexact invoker also accepts a range of other call types.

Method handles are immutable and have no visible state.
Of course, they can be bound to underlying methods or data which exhibit state.
With respect to the Java Memory Model, any method handle will behave
as if all of its (internal) fields are final variables. This means that any method
handle made visible to the application will always be fully formed.
This is true even if the method handle is published through a shared
variable in a data race.

Method handles cannot be subclassed by the user.
Implementations may (or may not) create internal subclasses of

MethodHandle

which may be visible via the

Object.getClass

operation. The programmer should not draw conclusions about a method handle
from its specific class, as the method handle class hierarchy (if any)
may change from time to time or across implementations from different vendors.

Method handle compilation

A Java method call expression naming

invokeExact

or

invoke

can invoke a method handle from Java source code.
From the viewpoint of source code, these methods can take any arguments
and their result can be cast to any return type.
Formally this is accomplished by giving the invoker methods

Object

return types and variable arity

Object

arguments,
but they have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction.
More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
Instead, it must generate instructions that push them on the stack according
to their own unconverted types. The method handle object itself is pushed on
the stack before the arguments.
The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction that invokes
the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which describes the argument
and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
the return type. This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
if there is one, or else

Object

if the invocation is an expression,
or else

void

if the invocation is a statement.
The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given
a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

.
The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Method handle invocation

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed
it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
This also holds for calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes
a method handle will always link, as long
as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

Method handles are immutable and have no visible state.
Of course, they can be bound to underlying methods or data which exhibit state.
With respect to the Java Memory Model, any method handle will behave
as if all of its (internal) fields are final variables. This means that any method
handle made visible to the application will always be fully formed.
This is true even if the method handle is published through a shared

but they have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction.
More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
Instead, it must generate instructions that push them on the stack according
to their own unconverted types. The method handle object itself is pushed on
the stack before the arguments.
The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction that invokes
the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which describes the argument
and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
the return type. This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
if there is one, or else

Object

if the invocation is an expression,
or else

void

if the invocation is a statement.
The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given
a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

.
The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Method handle invocation

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed
it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
This also holds for calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes
a method handle will always link, as long
as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

Method handles cannot be subclassed by the user.
Implementations may (or may not) create internal subclasses of

MethodHandle

which may be visible via the

Object.getClass

operation. The programmer should not draw conclusions about a method handle
from its specific class, as the method handle class hierarchy (if any)
may change from time to time or across implementations from different vendors.

Method handle compilation

A Java method call expression naming

invokeExact

or

invoke

can invoke a method handle from Java source code.
From the viewpoint of source code, these methods can take any arguments
and their result can be cast to any return type.
Formally this is accomplished by giving the invoker methods

Object

return types and variable arity

Object

arguments,
but they have an additional quality called

signature polymorphism

which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction.
More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
Instead, it must generate instructions that push them on the stack according
to their own unconverted types. The method handle object itself is pushed on
the stack before the arguments.
The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction that invokes
the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which describes the argument
and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
the return type. This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
if there is one, or else

Object

if the invocation is an expression,
or else

void

if the invocation is a statement.
The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given
a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

.
The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Method handle invocation

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed
it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
This also holds for calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes
a method handle will always link, as long
as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;

mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

The

to call

,
for any specified type descriptor .

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

---

#### Method handle compilation

As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

compile to an

invokevirtual

instruction.
More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
Instead, it must generate instructions that push them on the stack according
to their own unconverted types. The method handle object itself is pushed on
the stack before the arguments.
The compiler then generates an

invokevirtual

instruction that invokes
the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which describes the argument
and return types.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
the return type. This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
if there is one, or else

Object

if the invocation is an expression,
or else

void

if the invocation is a statement.
The cast may be to a primitive type (but not

void

).

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given
a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

.
The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Method handle invocation

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed
it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
This also holds for calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes
a method handle will always link, as long
as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
the return type. This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,

a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

As a corner case, an uncasted

null

argument is given
a symbolic type descriptor of

java.lang.Void

.
The ambiguity with the type

Void

is harmless, since there are no references of type

Void

except the null reference.

Method handle invocation

The first time an

invokevirtual

instruction is executed
it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
This also holds for calls to

invokeExact

and

invoke

.
In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
Thus, an

invokevirtual

instruction which invokes
a method handle will always link, as long
as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
and the types exist.

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

#### Method handle invocation

When the

invokevirtual

is executed after linking,
the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
caller is invoking is not present on the individual
method handle being invoked.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

In the case of

invokeExact

, the type descriptor of the invocation
(after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
of the receiving method handle.
In the case of plain, inexact

invoke

, the resolved type descriptor
must be a valid argument to the receiver's

asType

method.
Thus, plain

invoke

is more permissive than

invokeExact

.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

After type matching, a call to

invokeExact

directly
and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
(or other behavior, as the case may be).

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.

M

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

Since a method handle’s

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

A call to plain

invoke

works the same as a call to

invokeExact

, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
exactly matches the method handle's own type.
If there is a type mismatch,

invoke

attempts
to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
as if by a call to

asType

,
to obtain an exactly invokable method handle

M2

.
This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
between caller and callee.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

(

Note:

The adjusted method handle

M2

is not directly observable,
and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)

Invocation checking

In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a

WrongMethodTypeException

,
either directly (in the case of

invokeExact

) or indirectly as if
by a failed call to

asType

(in the case of

invoke

).

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

#### Invocation checking

Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
in a statically typed program can show up as
a dynamic

WrongMethodTypeException

in a program which uses method handles.

Because method types contain "live"

method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

Because method types contain "live"

Class

objects,
method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
Thus, even if a method handle

M

is created in one
class loader

L1

and used in another

L2

,
method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
descriptor, as resolved in

L2

,
is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
as resolved in

L1

.
The resolution in

L1

happens when

M

is created
and its type is assigned, while the resolution in

L2

happens
when the

invokevirtual

instruction is linked.

Apart from type descriptor checks,
a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.

Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
a reflective method is invoked,
method handle access checking is performed

when the method handle is created

.
In the case of

ldc

(see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
should generally be kept secret.
They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
the untrusted code would be harmless.

Method handle creation

Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called

MethodHandles.Lookup

.
For example, a static method handle can be obtained
from

Lookup.findStatic

.
There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
such as

Lookup.unreflect

.

Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by

ldc

bytecodes.
A new type of constant pool entry,

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

,
refers directly to an associated

CONSTANT_Methodref

,

CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref

, or

CONSTANT_Fieldref

constant pool entry.
(For full details on method handle constants,
see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)

Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (

0x0080

)
have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
the help of

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V

or

withVarargs

.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
(E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via

ldc

,
the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the

ldc

instruction
will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
throw such errors.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks

mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

The methods

(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit

Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
of the protected member's defining class.
If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
In these examples, the helper method

assertEquals

is assumed to
be a method which calls

Objects.equals

on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.

Exceptions

The methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

are declared
to throw

Throwable

,
which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
can throw. Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
checked exceptions to method handle invocations. But in Java source
code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
throw

Throwable

, or else must catch all
throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
and wrapping ones which are illegal.

Signature polymorphism

The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of

invokeExact

and plain

invoke

is referenced by the term

signature polymorphism

.
As defined in the Java Language Specification,
a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.

In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
As usual, the Java compiler emits an

invokevirtual

instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.

When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
(In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).

A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
can also be created. These do not perform virtual lookup based on
receiver type. Such a method handle simulates the effect of
an

invokespecial

instruction to the same method.
A non-virtual method handle can also be created to simulate the effect
of an

invokevirtual

or

invokeinterface

instruction on
a private method (as applicable).

Usage examples

Here are some examples of usage:

```java
Object x, y; String s; int i;
MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
// mt is (char,char)String
mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
assertEquals(s, "nanny");
// weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
assertEquals(s, "savvy");
// mt is (Object[])List
mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
// invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
// mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
mh = mh.asType(mt);
x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
// invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// mt is ()int
mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
// invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
assert(i == 3);
mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
// invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```

Each of the above calls to

invokeExact

Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API

Using factory methods in the

Lookup

API,
any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
For example, a reflective

Method

can
be converted to a method handle using

Lookup.unreflect

.
The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
access to the underlying class members.

As a special case,
when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
methods

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

in this class,
they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
Their reflective appearance, as viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

,
is unaffected by their special status in this API.
For example,

Method.getModifiers

will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
declared method, including in this case

native

and

varargs

bits.

As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
invoked via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.
However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
Such a call, if passed the required argument
(a single one, of type

Object[]

), will ignore the argument and
will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

Since

invokevirtual

instructions can natively
invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by

Class.getDeclaredMethod

, may be regarded as placeholders only.

In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
use

MethodHandles.exactInvoker

,
or

MethodHandles.invoker

.
The

Lookup.findVirtual

API is also able to return a method handle
to call

invokeExact

or plain

invoke

,
for any specified type descriptor .

Interoperation between method handles and Java generics

A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
which is declared with Java generic types.
As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
will be constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
for the

invokevirtual

instruction.

Method handles do not represent
their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
Java types.

- Method types range over all possible arities,
from no arguments to up to the

maximum number

of allowed arguments.
Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
- Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
which Java generic types cannot range over.
- Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
often generic across a wide range of function types, including
those of multiple arities. It is impossible to represent such
genericity with a Java type parameter.

Arity limits

The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
limit of 255 stacked arguments. This limit can appear more restrictive
in certain cases:

- A

long

or

double

argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.

A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.

A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.

Since a method handle’s

invoke

method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.

These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an

IllegalArgumentException

.
In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.

Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.

#### Methods declared in class java.lang. Object

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- type

```java
public
MethodType
type()
```

Reports the type of this method handle.
Every invocation of this method handle via

invokeExact

must exactly match this type.

**Returns:** the method handle type

- invokeExact

```java
public final
Object
invokeExact​(
Object
... args)
throws
Throwable
```

Invokes the method handle, allowing any caller type descriptor, but requiring an exact type match.
The symbolic type descriptor at the call site of

invokeExact

must
exactly match this method handle's

type

.
No conversions are allowed on arguments or return values.

When this method is observed via the Core Reflection API,
it will appear as a single native method, taking an object array and returning an object.
If this native method is invoked directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

, via JNI,
or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

,
it will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Parameters:** args

- the signature-polymorphic parameter list, statically represented using varargs
**Returns:** the signature-polymorphic result, statically represented using

Object
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type is not identical with the caller's symbolic type descriptor
**Throws:** Throwable

- anything thrown by the underlying method propagates unchanged through the method handle call

- invoke

```java
public final
Object
invoke​(
Object
... args)
throws
Throwable
```

Invokes the method handle, allowing any caller type descriptor,
and optionally performing conversions on arguments and return values.

If the call site's symbolic type descriptor exactly matches this method handle's

type

,
the call proceeds as if by

invokeExact

.

Otherwise, the call proceeds as if this method handle were first
adjusted by calling

asType

to adjust this method handle
to the required type, and then the call proceeds as if by

invokeExact

on the adjusted method handle.

There is no guarantee that the

asType

call is actually made.
If the JVM can predict the results of making the call, it may perform
adaptations directly on the caller's arguments,
and call the target method handle according to its own exact type.

The resolved type descriptor at the call site of

invoke

must
be a valid argument to the receivers

asType

method.
In particular, the caller must specify the same argument arity
as the callee's type,
if the callee is not a

variable arity collector

.

When this method is observed via the Core Reflection API,
it will appear as a single native method, taking an object array and returning an object.
If this native method is invoked directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

, via JNI,
or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

,
it will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Parameters:** args

- the signature-polymorphic parameter list, statically represented using varargs
**Returns:** the signature-polymorphic result, statically represented using

Object
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type cannot be adjusted to the caller's symbolic type descriptor
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the target's type can be adjusted to the caller, but a reference cast fails
**Throws:** Throwable

- anything thrown by the underlying method propagates unchanged through the method handle call

- invokeWithArguments

```java
public
Object
invokeWithArguments​(
Object
... arguments)
throws
Throwable
```

Performs a variable arity invocation, passing the arguments in the given array
to the method handle, as if via an inexact

invoke

from a call site
which mentions only the type

Object

, and whose actual argument count is the length
of the argument array.

Specifically, execution proceeds as if by the following steps,
although the methods are not guaranteed to be called if the JVM
can predict their effects.

- Determine the length of the argument array as

N

.
For a null reference,

N=0

.
- Collect the

N

elements of the array as a logical
argument list, each argument statically typed as an

Object

.
- Determine, as

M

, the parameter count of the type of this
method handle.
- Determine the general type

TN

of

N

arguments or

M

arguments, if smaller than

N

, as

TN=MethodType.genericMethodType(Math.min(N, M))

.
- If

N

is greater than

M

, perform the following
checks and actions to shorten the logical argument list:

- Check that this method handle has variable arity with a

trailing parameter

of some array type

A[]

. If not, fail with a

WrongMethodTypeException

.
- Collect the trailing elements (there are

N-M+1

of them)
from the logical argument list into a single array of
type

A[]

, using

asType

conversions to
convert each trailing argument to type

A

.
- If any of these conversions proves impossible, fail with either
a

ClassCastException

if any trailing element cannot be
cast to

A

or a

NullPointerException

if any
trailing element is

null

and

A

is not a reference
type.
- Replace the logical arguments gathered into the array of
type

A[]

with the array itself, thus shortening
the argument list to length

M

. This final argument
retains the static type

A[]

.
- Adjust the type

TN

by changing the

N

th
parameter type from

Object

to

A[]

.

Force the original target method handle

MH0

to the
required type, as

MH1 = MH0.asType(TN)

.

Spread the argument list into

N

separate arguments

A0, ...

.

Invoke the type-adjusted method handle on the unpacked arguments:
MH1.invokeExact(A0, ...).

Take the return value as an

Object

reference.

If the target method handle has variable arity, and the argument list is longer
than that arity, the excess arguments, starting at the position of the trailing
array argument, will be gathered (if possible, as if by

asType

conversions)
into an array of the appropriate type, and invocation will proceed on the
shortened argument list.
In this way,

jumbo argument lists

which would spread into more
than 254 slots can still be processed uniformly.

Unlike the

generic

invocation mode, which can
"recycle" an array argument, passing it directly to the target method,
this invocation mode

always

creates a new array parameter, even
if the original array passed to

invokeWithArguments

would have
been acceptable as a direct argument to the target method.
Even if the number

M

of actual arguments is the arity

N

,
and the last argument is dynamically a suitable array of type

A[]

,
it will still be boxed into a new one-element array, since the call
site statically types the argument as

Object

, not an array type.
This is not a special rule for this method, but rather a regular effect
of the

rules for variable-arity invocation

.

Because of the action of the

asType

step, the following argument
conversions are applied as necessary:

- reference casting

unboxing

widening primitive conversions

variable arity conversion

The result returned by the call is boxed if it is a primitive,
or forced to null if the return type is void.

Unlike the signature polymorphic methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

,

invokeWithArguments

can be accessed normally via the Core Reflection API and JNI.
It can therefore be used as a bridge between native or reflective code and method handles.

**API Note:** This call is approximately equivalent to the following code:

```java
// for jumbo argument lists, adapt varargs explicitly:
int N = (arguments == null? 0: arguments.length);
int M = this.type.parameterCount();
int MAX_SAFE = 127; // 127 longs require 254 slots, which is OK
if (N > MAX_SAFE && N > M && this.isVarargsCollector()) {
Class<?> arrayType = this.type().lastParameterType();
Class<?> elemType = arrayType.getComponentType();
if (elemType != null) {
Object args2 = Array.newInstance(elemType, M);
MethodHandle arraySetter = MethodHandles.arrayElementSetter(arrayType);
for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
arraySetter.invoke(args2, i, arguments[M-1 + i]);
}
arguments = Arrays.copyOf(arguments, M);
arguments[M-1] = args2;
return this.asFixedArity().invokeWithArguments(arguments);
}
} // done with explicit varargs processing

// Handle fixed arity and non-jumbo variable arity invocation.
MethodHandle invoker = MethodHandles.spreadInvoker(this.type(), 0);
Object result = invoker.invokeExact(this, arguments);
```
**Parameters:** arguments

- the arguments to pass to the target
**Returns:** the result returned by the target
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if an argument cannot be converted by reference casting
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type cannot be adjusted to take the given number of

Object

arguments
**Throws:** Throwable

- anything thrown by the target method invocation
**See Also:** MethodHandles.spreadInvoker(java.lang.invoke.MethodType, int)

- invokeWithArguments

```java
public
Object
invokeWithArguments​(
List
<?> arguments)
throws
Throwable
```

Performs a variable arity invocation, passing the arguments in the given list
to the method handle, as if via an inexact

invoke

from a call site
which mentions only the type

Object

, and whose actual argument count is the length
of the argument list.

This method is also equivalent to the following code:

```java
invokeWithArguments(arguments.toArray())
```

Jumbo-sized lists are acceptable if this method handle has variable arity.
See

invokeWithArguments(Object[])

for details.

**Parameters:** arguments

- the arguments to pass to the target
**Returns:** the result returned by the target
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arguments

is a null reference
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if an argument cannot be converted by reference casting
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type cannot be adjusted to take the given number of

Object

arguments
**Throws:** Throwable

- anything thrown by the target method invocation

- asType

```java
public
MethodHandle
asType​(
MethodType
newType)
```

Produces an adapter method handle which adapts the type of the
current method handle to a new type.
The resulting method handle is guaranteed to report a type
which is equal to the desired new type.

If the original type and new type are equal, returns

this

.

The new method handle, when invoked, will perform the following
steps:

- Convert the incoming argument list to match the original
method handle's argument list.

Invoke the original method handle on the converted argument list.

Convert any result returned by the original method handle
to the return type of new method handle.

This method provides the crucial behavioral difference between

invokeExact

and plain, inexact

invoke

.
The two methods
perform the same steps when the caller's type descriptor exactly matches
the callee's, but when the types differ, plain

invoke

also calls

asType

(or some internal equivalent) in order
to match up the caller's and callee's types.

If the current method is a variable arity method handle
argument list conversion may involve the conversion and collection
of several arguments into an array, as

described elsewhere

.
In every other case, all conversions are applied

pairwise

,
which means that each argument or return value is converted to
exactly one argument or return value (or no return value).
The applied conversions are defined by consulting
the corresponding component types of the old and new
method handle types.

Let

T0

and

T1

be corresponding new and old parameter types,
or old and new return types. Specifically, for some valid index

i

, let

T0

=newType.parameterType(i)

and

T1

=this.type().parameterType(i)

.
Or else, going the other way for return values, let

T0

=this.type().returnType()

and

T1

=newType.returnType()

.
If the types are the same, the new method handle makes no change
to the corresponding argument or return value (if any).
Otherwise, one of the following conversions is applied
if possible:

- If

T0

and

T1

are references, then a cast to

T1

is applied.
(The types do not need to be related in any particular way.
This is because a dynamic value of null can convert to any reference type.)

If

T0

and

T1

are primitives, then a Java method invocation
conversion (JLS 5.3) is applied, if one exists.
(Specifically,

T0

must convert to

T1

by a widening primitive conversion.)

If

T0

is a primitive and

T1

a reference,
a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) is applied if one exists.
(Specifically, the value is boxed from

T0

to its wrapper class,
which is then widened as needed to

T1

.)

If

T0

is a reference and

T1

a primitive, an unboxing
conversion will be applied at runtime, possibly followed
by a Java method invocation conversion (JLS 5.3)
on the primitive value. (These are the primitive widening conversions.)

T0

must be a wrapper class or a supertype of one.
(In the case where

T0

is Object, these are the conversions
allowed by

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.)
The unboxing conversion must have a possibility of success, which means that
if

T0

is not itself a wrapper class, there must exist at least one
wrapper class

TW

which is a subtype of

T0

and whose unboxed
primitive value can be widened to

T1

.

If the return type

T1

is marked as void, any returned value is discarded

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a reference, a null value is introduced.

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a primitive,
a zero value is introduced.

(

Note:

Both

T0

and

T1

may be regarded as static types,
because neither corresponds specifically to the

dynamic type

of any
actual argument or return value.)

The method handle conversion cannot be made if any one of the required
pairwise conversions cannot be made.

At runtime, the conversions applied to reference arguments
or return values may require additional runtime checks which can fail.
An unboxing operation may fail because the original reference is null,
causing a

NullPointerException

.
An unboxing operation or a reference cast may also fail on a reference
to an object of the wrong type,
causing a

ClassCastException

.
Although an unboxing operation may accept several kinds of wrappers,
if none are available, a

ClassCastException

will be thrown.

**Parameters:** newType

- the expected type of the new method handle
**Returns:** a method handle which delegates to

this

after performing
any necessary argument conversions, and arranges for any
necessary return value conversions
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

newType

is a null reference
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the conversion cannot be made
**See Also:** MethodHandles.explicitCastArguments(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)

- asSpreader

```java
public
MethodHandle
asSpreader​(
Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)
```

Makes an

array-spreading

method handle, which accepts a trailing array argument
and spreads its elements as positional arguments.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be
the same as the type of the target, except that the final

arrayLength

parameters of the target's type are replaced
by a single array parameter of type

arrayType

.

If the array element type differs from any of the corresponding
argument types on the original target,
the original target is adapted to take the array elements directly,
as if by a call to

asType

.

When called, the adapter replaces a trailing array argument
by the array's elements, each as its own argument to the target.
(The order of the arguments is preserved.)
They are converted pairwise by casting and/or unboxing
to the types of the trailing parameters of the target.
Finally the target is called.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

Before calling the target, the adapter verifies that the array
contains exactly enough elements to provide a correct argument count
to the target method handle.
(The array may also be null when zero elements are required.)

When the adapter is called, the length of the supplied

array

argument is queried as if by

array.length

or

arraylength

bytecode. If the adapter accepts a zero-length trailing array argument,
the supplied

array

argument can either be a zero-length array or

null

; otherwise, the adapter will throw a

NullPointerException

if the array is

null

and throw an

IllegalArgumentException

if the array does not have the correct number of elements.

Here are some simple examples of array-spreading method handles:

```java
MethodHandle equals = publicLookup()
.findVirtual(String.class, "equals", methodType(boolean.class, Object.class));
assert( (boolean) equals.invokeExact("me", (Object)"me"));
assert(!(boolean) equals.invokeExact("me", (Object)"thee"));
// spread both arguments from a 2-array:
MethodHandle eq2 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 2);
assert( (boolean) eq2.invokeExact(new Object[]{ "me", "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq2.invokeExact(new Object[]{ "me", "thee" }));
// try to spread from anything but a 2-array:
for (int n = 0; n <= 10; n++) {
Object[] badArityArgs = (n == 2 ? new Object[0] : new Object[n]);
try { assert((boolean) eq2.invokeExact(badArityArgs) && false); }
catch (IllegalArgumentException ex) { } // OK
}
// spread both arguments from a String array:
MethodHandle eq2s = equals.asSpreader(String[].class, 2);
assert( (boolean) eq2s.invokeExact(new String[]{ "me", "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq2s.invokeExact(new String[]{ "me", "thee" }));
// spread second arguments from a 1-array:
MethodHandle eq1 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 1);
assert( (boolean) eq1.invokeExact("me", new Object[]{ "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq1.invokeExact("me", new Object[]{ "thee" }));
// spread no arguments from a 0-array or null:
MethodHandle eq0 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 0);
assert( (boolean) eq0.invokeExact("me", (Object)"me", new Object[0]));
assert(!(boolean) eq0.invokeExact("me", (Object)"thee", (Object[])null));
// asSpreader and asCollector are approximate inverses:
for (int n = 0; n <= 2; n++) {
for (Class<?> a : new Class<?>[]{Object[].class, String[].class, CharSequence[].class}) {
MethodHandle equals2 = equals.asSpreader(a, n).asCollector(a, n);
assert( (boolean) equals2.invokeWithArguments("me", "me"));
assert(!(boolean) equals2.invokeWithArguments("me", "thee"));
}
}
MethodHandle caToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, char[].class));
assertEquals("[A, B, C]", (String) caToString.invokeExact("ABC".toCharArray()));
MethodHandle caString3 = caToString.asCollector(char[].class, 3);
assertEquals("[A, B, C]", (String) caString3.invokeExact('A', 'B', 'C'));
MethodHandle caToString2 = caString3.asSpreader(char[].class, 2);
assertEquals("[A, B, C]", (String) caToString2.invokeExact('A', "BC".toCharArray()));
```

**Parameters:** arrayType

- usually

Object[]

, the type of the array argument from which to extract the spread arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to spread from an incoming array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which spreads its final array argument,
before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type,
or if target does not have at least

arrayLength

parameter types,
or if

arrayLength

is negative,
or if the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails
**See Also:** asCollector(java.lang.Class<?>, int)

- asSpreader

```java
public
MethodHandle
asSpreader​(int spreadArgPos,

Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)
```

Makes an

array-spreading

method handle, which accepts an array argument at a given position and spreads
its elements as positional arguments in place of the array. The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be the same as the type of the target, except that the

arrayLength

parameters of the target's type, starting at the zero-based position

spreadArgPos

,
are replaced by a single array parameter of type

arrayType

.

This method behaves very much like

asSpreader(Class, int)

, but accepts an additional

spreadArgPos

argument to indicate at which position in the parameter list the spreading should take place.

**API Note:** Example:

```java
MethodHandle compare = LOOKUP.findStatic(Objects.class, "compare", methodType(int.class, Object.class, Object.class, Comparator.class));
MethodHandle compare2FromArray = compare.asSpreader(0, Object[].class, 2);
Object[] ints = new Object[]{3, 9, 7, 7};
Comparator<Integer> cmp = (a, b) -> a - b;
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 0, 2), cmp) < 0);
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 1, 3), cmp) > 0);
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 2, 4), cmp) == 0);
```
**Parameters:** spreadArgPos

- the position (zero-based index) in the argument list at which spreading should start.
**Parameters:** arrayType

- usually

Object[]

, the type of the array argument from which to extract the spread arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to spread from an incoming array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which spreads an array argument at a given position,
before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type,
or if target does not have at least

arrayLength

parameter types,
or if

arrayLength

is negative,
or if

spreadArgPos

has an illegal value (negative, or together with arrayLength exceeding the
number of arguments),
or if the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** asSpreader(Class, int)

- withVarargs

```java
public
MethodHandle
withVarargs​(boolean makeVarargs)
```

Adapts this method handle to be

variable arity

if the boolean flag is true, else

fixed arity

.
If the method handle is already of the proper arity mode, it is returned
unchanged.

**API Note:** This method is sometimes useful when adapting a method handle that
may be variable arity, to ensure that the resulting adapter is also
variable arity if and only if the original handle was. For example,
this code changes the first argument of a handle

mh

to

int

without
disturbing its variable arity property:

mh.asType(mh.type().changeParameterType(0,int.class))
.withVarargs(mh.isVarargsCollector())

This call is approximately equivalent to the following code:

```java
if (makeVarargs == isVarargsCollector())
return this;
else if (makeVarargs)
return asVarargsCollector(type().lastParameterType());
else
return return asFixedArity();
```
**Parameters:** makeVarargs

- true if the return method handle should have variable arity behavior
**Returns:** a method handle of the same type, with possibly adjusted variable arity behavior
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

makeVarargs

is true and
this method handle does not have a trailing array parameter
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class<?>)

,

asFixedArity()

- asCollector

```java
public
MethodHandle
asCollector​(
Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)
```

Makes an

array-collecting

method handle, which accepts a given number of trailing
positional arguments and collects them into an array argument.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be
the same as the type of the target, except that a single trailing
parameter (usually of type

arrayType

) is replaced by

arrayLength

parameters whose type is element type of

arrayType

.

If the array type differs from the final argument type on the original target,
the original target is adapted to take the array type directly,
as if by a call to

asType

.

When called, the adapter replaces its trailing

arrayLength

arguments by a single new array of type

arrayType

, whose elements
comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.
Finally the target is called.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

(The array may also be a shared constant when

arrayLength

is zero.)

(

Note:

The

arrayType

is often identical to the

last parameter type

of the original target.
It is an explicit argument for symmetry with

asSpreader

, and also
to allow the target to use a simple

Object

as its last parameter type.)

In order to create a collecting adapter which is not restricted to a particular
number of collected arguments, use

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

instead.

Here are some examples of array-collecting method handles:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) deepToString.invokeExact(new Object[]{"won"}));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 1);
assertEquals(methodType(String.class, Object.class), ts1.type());
//assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invokeExact( new Object[]{"won"})); //FAIL
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invokeExact((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// arrayType can be a subtype of Object[]
MethodHandle ts2 = deepToString.asCollector(String[].class, 2);
assertEquals(methodType(String.class, String.class, String.class), ts2.type());
assertEquals("[two, too]", (String) ts2.invokeExact("two", "too"));
MethodHandle ts0 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 0);
assertEquals("[]", (String) ts0.invokeExact());
// collectors can be nested, Lisp-style
MethodHandle ts22 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 3).asCollector(String[].class, 2);
assertEquals("[A, B, [C, D]]", ((String) ts22.invokeExact((Object)'A', (Object)"B", "C", "D")));
// arrayType can be any primitive array type
MethodHandle bytesToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, byte[].class))
.asCollector(byte[].class, 3);
assertEquals("[1, 2, 3]", (String) bytesToString.invokeExact((byte)1, (byte)2, (byte)3));
MethodHandle longsToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, long[].class))
.asCollector(long[].class, 1);
assertEquals("[123]", (String) longsToString.invokeExact((long)123));
```

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.

**Parameters:** arrayType

- often

Object[]

, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to collect into a new array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which collects some trailing argument
into an array, before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type
or

arrayType

is not assignable to this method handle's trailing parameter type,
or

arrayLength

is not a legal array size,
or the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails

asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class<?>)

- asCollector

```java
public
MethodHandle
asCollector​(int collectArgPos,

Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)
```

Makes an

array-collecting

method handle, which accepts a given number of positional arguments starting
at a given position, and collects them into an array argument. The new method handle adapts, as its

target

, the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be the same as the type of the target,
except that the parameter at the position indicated by

collectArgPos

(usually of type

arrayType

)
is replaced by

arrayLength

parameters whose type is element type of

arrayType

.

This method behaves very much like

asCollector(Class, int)

, but differs in that its

collectArgPos

argument indicates at which position in the parameter list arguments should be collected. This
index is zero-based.

**API Note:** Examples:

```java
StringWriter swr = new StringWriter();
MethodHandle swWrite = LOOKUP.findVirtual(StringWriter.class, "write", methodType(void.class, char[].class, int.class, int.class)).bindTo(swr);
MethodHandle swWrite4 = swWrite.asCollector(0, char[].class, 4);
swWrite4.invoke('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 1, 2);
assertEquals("BC", swr.toString());
swWrite4.invoke('P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 0, 4);
assertEquals("BCPQRS", swr.toString());
swWrite4.invoke('W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 3, 1);
assertEquals("BCPQRSZ", swr.toString());
```

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.
**Parameters:** collectArgPos

- the zero-based position in the parameter list at which to start collecting.
**Parameters:** arrayType

- often

Object[]

, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to collect into a new array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which collects some arguments
into an array, before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type
or

arrayType

is not assignable to this method handle's array parameter type,
or

arrayLength

is not a legal array size,
or

collectArgPos

has an illegal value (negative, or greater than the number of arguments),
or the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** asCollector(Class, int)

- asVarargsCollector

```java
public
MethodHandle
asVarargsCollector​(
Class
<?> arrayType)
```

Makes a

variable arity

adapter which is able to accept
any number of trailing positional arguments and collect them
into an array argument.

The type and behavior of the adapter will be the same as
the type and behavior of the target, except that certain

invoke

and

asType

requests can lead to
trailing positional arguments being collected into target's
trailing parameter.
Also, the

last parameter type

of the adapter will be

arrayType

, even if the target has a different
last parameter type.

This transformation may return

this

if the method handle is
already of variable arity and its trailing parameter type
is identical to

arrayType

.

When called with

invokeExact

, the adapter invokes
the target with no argument changes.
(

Note:

This behavior is different from a

fixed arity collector

,
since it accepts a whole array of indeterminate length,
rather than a fixed number of arguments.)

When called with plain, inexact

invoke

, if the caller
type is the same as the adapter, the adapter invokes the target as with

invokeExact

.
(This is the normal behavior for

invoke

when types match.)

Otherwise, if the caller and adapter arity are the same, and the
trailing parameter type of the caller is a reference type identical to
or assignable to the trailing parameter type of the adapter,
the arguments and return values are converted pairwise,
as if by

asType

on a fixed arity
method handle.

Otherwise, the arities differ, or the adapter's trailing parameter
type is not assignable from the corresponding caller type.
In this case, the adapter replaces all trailing arguments from
the original trailing argument position onward, by
a new array of type

arrayType

, whose elements
comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.

The caller type must provides as least enough arguments,
and of the correct type, to satisfy the target's requirement for
positional arguments before the trailing array argument.
Thus, the caller must supply, at a minimum,

N-1

arguments,
where

N

is the arity of the target.
Also, there must exist conversions from the incoming arguments
to the target's arguments.
As with other uses of plain

invoke

, if these basic
requirements are not fulfilled, a

WrongMethodTypeException

may be thrown.

In all cases, what the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

In the final case, it is exactly as if the target method handle were
temporarily adapted with a

fixed arity collector

to the arity required by the caller type.
(As with

asCollector

, if the array length is zero,
a shared constant may be used instead of a new array.
If the implied call to

asCollector

would throw
an

IllegalArgumentException

or

WrongMethodTypeException

,
the call to the variable arity adapter must throw

WrongMethodTypeException

.)

The behavior of

asType

is also specialized for
variable arity adapters, to maintain the invariant that
plain, inexact

invoke

is always equivalent to an

asType

call to adjust the target type, followed by

invokeExact

.
Therefore, a variable arity adapter responds
to an

asType

request by building a fixed arity collector,
if and only if the adapter and requested type differ either
in arity or trailing argument type.
The resulting fixed arity collector has its type further adjusted
(if necessary) to the requested type by pairwise conversion,
as if by another application of

asType

.

When a method handle is obtained by executing an

ldc

instruction
of a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

constant, and the target method is marked
as a variable arity method (with the modifier bit

0x0080

),
the method handle will accept multiple arities, as if the method handle
constant were created by means of a call to

asVarargsCollector

.

In order to create a collecting adapter which collects a predetermined
number of arguments, and whose type reflects this predetermined number,
use

asCollector

instead.

No method handle transformations produce new method handles with
variable arity, unless they are documented as doing so.
Therefore, besides

asVarargsCollector

and

withVarargs

,
all methods in

MethodHandle

and

MethodHandles

will return a method handle with fixed arity,
except in the cases where they are specified to return their original
operand (e.g.,

asType

of the method handle's own type).

Calling

asVarargsCollector

on a method handle which is already
of variable arity will produce a method handle with the same type and behavior.
It may (or may not) return the original variable arity method handle.

Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invokeExact( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( "won" ));
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invoke((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// findStatic of Arrays.asList(...) produces a variable arity method handle:
MethodHandle asList = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals(methodType(List.class, Object[].class), asList.type());
assert(asList.isVarargsCollector());
assertEquals("[]", asList.invoke().toString());
assertEquals("[1]", asList.invoke(1).toString());
assertEquals("[two, too]", asList.invoke("two", "too").toString());
String[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke((Object[])argv).toString());
List ls = (List) asList.invoke((Object)argv);
assertEquals(1, ls.size());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", Arrays.toString((Object[])ls.get(0)));
```

Discussion:

These rules are designed as a dynamically-typed variation
of the Java rules for variable arity methods.
In both cases, callers to a variable arity method or method handle
can either pass zero or more positional arguments, or else pass
pre-collected arrays of any length. Users should be aware of the
special role of the final argument, and of the effect of a
type match on that final argument, which determines whether
or not a single trailing argument is interpreted as a whole
array or a single element of an array to be collected.
Note that the dynamic type of the trailing argument has no
effect on this decision, only a comparison between the symbolic
type descriptor of the call site and the type descriptor of the method handle.)

**Parameters:** arrayType

- often

Object[]

, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments
**Returns:** a new method handle which can collect any number of trailing arguments
into an array, before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type
or

arrayType

is not assignable to this method handle's trailing parameter type
**See Also:** asCollector(java.lang.Class<?>, int)

,

isVarargsCollector()

,

withVarargs(boolean)

,

asFixedArity()

- isVarargsCollector

```java
public boolean isVarargsCollector()
```

Determines if this method handle
supports

variable arity

calls.
Such method handles arise from the following sources:

- a call to

asVarargsCollector

a call to a

lookup method

which resolves to a variable arity Java method or constructor

an

ldc

instruction of a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

which resolves to a variable arity Java method or constructor

**Returns:** true if this method handle accepts more than one arity of plain, inexact

invoke

calls
**See Also:** asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class<?>)

,

asFixedArity()

- asFixedArity

```java
public
MethodHandle
asFixedArity()
```

Makes a

fixed arity

method handle which is otherwise
equivalent to the current method handle.

If the current method handle is not of

variable arity

,
the current method handle is returned.
This is true even if the current method handle
could not be a valid input to

asVarargsCollector

.

Otherwise, the resulting fixed-arity method handle has the same
type and behavior of the current method handle,
except that

isVarargsCollector

will be false.
The fixed-arity method handle may (or may not) be the
a previous argument to

asVarargsCollector

.

Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:

```java
MethodHandle asListVar = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class))
.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
MethodHandle asListFix = asListVar.asFixedArity();
assertEquals("[1]", asListVar.invoke(1).toString());
Exception caught = null;
try { asListFix.invoke((Object)1); }
catch (Exception ex) { caught = ex; }
assert(caught instanceof ClassCastException);
assertEquals("[two, too]", asListVar.invoke("two", "too").toString());
try { asListFix.invoke("two", "too"); }
catch (Exception ex) { caught = ex; }
assert(caught instanceof WrongMethodTypeException);
Object[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asListVar.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asListFix.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals(1, ((List) asListVar.invoke((Object)argv)).size());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asListFix.invoke((Object)argv).toString());
```

**Returns:** a new method handle which accepts only a fixed number of arguments
**See Also:** asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class<?>)

,

isVarargsCollector()

,

withVarargs(boolean)

- bindTo

```java
public
MethodHandle
bindTo​(
Object
x)
```

Binds a value

x

to the first argument of a method handle, without invoking it.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle by binding it to the given argument.
The type of the bound handle will be
the same as the type of the target, except that a single leading
reference parameter will be omitted.

When called, the bound handle inserts the given value

x

as a new leading argument to the target. The other arguments are
also passed unchanged.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the bound handle.

The reference

x

must be convertible to the first parameter
type of the target.

Note:

Because method handles are immutable, the target method handle
retains its original type and behavior.

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.

**Parameters:** x

- the value to bind to the first argument of the target
**Returns:** a new method handle which prepends the given value to the incoming
argument list, before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the target does not have a
leading parameter type that is a reference type
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if

x

cannot be converted
to the leading parameter type of the target
**See Also:** MethodHandles.insertArguments(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle, int, java.lang.Object...)

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of the method handle,
starting with the string

"MethodHandle"

and
ending with the string representation of the method handle's type.
In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value of:

```java
"MethodHandle" + type().toString()
```

(

Note:

Future releases of this API may add further information
to the string representation.
Therefore, the present syntax should not be parsed by applications.)

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of the method handle

Method Detail

- type

```java
public
MethodType
type()
```

Reports the type of this method handle.
Every invocation of this method handle via

invokeExact

must exactly match this type.

**Returns:** the method handle type

- invokeExact

```java
public final
Object
invokeExact​(
Object
... args)
throws
Throwable
```

Invokes the method handle, allowing any caller type descriptor, but requiring an exact type match.
The symbolic type descriptor at the call site of

invokeExact

must
exactly match this method handle's

type

.
No conversions are allowed on arguments or return values.

When this method is observed via the Core Reflection API,
it will appear as a single native method, taking an object array and returning an object.
If this native method is invoked directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

, via JNI,
or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

,
it will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Parameters:** args

- the signature-polymorphic parameter list, statically represented using varargs
**Returns:** the signature-polymorphic result, statically represented using

Object
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type is not identical with the caller's symbolic type descriptor
**Throws:** Throwable

- anything thrown by the underlying method propagates unchanged through the method handle call

- invoke

```java
public final
Object
invoke​(
Object
... args)
throws
Throwable
```

Invokes the method handle, allowing any caller type descriptor,
and optionally performing conversions on arguments and return values.

If the call site's symbolic type descriptor exactly matches this method handle's

type

,
the call proceeds as if by

invokeExact

.

Otherwise, the call proceeds as if this method handle were first
adjusted by calling

asType

to adjust this method handle
to the required type, and then the call proceeds as if by

invokeExact

on the adjusted method handle.

There is no guarantee that the

asType

call is actually made.
If the JVM can predict the results of making the call, it may perform
adaptations directly on the caller's arguments,
and call the target method handle according to its own exact type.

The resolved type descriptor at the call site of

invoke

must
be a valid argument to the receivers

asType

method.
In particular, the caller must specify the same argument arity
as the callee's type,
if the callee is not a

variable arity collector

.

When this method is observed via the Core Reflection API,
it will appear as a single native method, taking an object array and returning an object.
If this native method is invoked directly via

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

, via JNI,
or indirectly via

Lookup.unreflect

,
it will throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Parameters:** args

- the signature-polymorphic parameter list, statically represented using varargs
**Returns:** the signature-polymorphic result, statically represented using

Object
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type cannot be adjusted to the caller's symbolic type descriptor
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the target's type can be adjusted to the caller, but a reference cast fails
**Throws:** Throwable

- anything thrown by the underlying method propagates unchanged through the method handle call

- invokeWithArguments

```java
public
Object
invokeWithArguments​(
Object
... arguments)
throws
Throwable
```

Performs a variable arity invocation, passing the arguments in the given array
to the method handle, as if via an inexact

invoke

from a call site
which mentions only the type

Object

, and whose actual argument count is the length
of the argument array.

Specifically, execution proceeds as if by the following steps,
although the methods are not guaranteed to be called if the JVM
can predict their effects.

- Determine the length of the argument array as

N

.
For a null reference,

N=0

.
- Collect the

N

elements of the array as a logical
argument list, each argument statically typed as an

Object

.
- Determine, as

M

, the parameter count of the type of this
method handle.
- Determine the general type

TN

of

N

arguments or

M

arguments, if smaller than

N

, as

TN=MethodType.genericMethodType(Math.min(N, M))

.
- If

N

is greater than

M

, perform the following
checks and actions to shorten the logical argument list:

- Check that this method handle has variable arity with a

trailing parameter

of some array type

A[]

. If not, fail with a

WrongMethodTypeException

.
- Collect the trailing elements (there are

N-M+1

of them)
from the logical argument list into a single array of
type

A[]

, using

asType

conversions to
convert each trailing argument to type

A

.
- If any of these conversions proves impossible, fail with either
a

ClassCastException

if any trailing element cannot be
cast to

A

or a

NullPointerException

if any
trailing element is

null

and

A

is not a reference
type.
- Replace the logical arguments gathered into the array of
type

A[]

with the array itself, thus shortening
the argument list to length

M

. This final argument
retains the static type

A[]

.
- Adjust the type

TN

by changing the

N

th
parameter type from

Object

to

A[]

.

Force the original target method handle

MH0

to the
required type, as

MH1 = MH0.asType(TN)

.

Spread the argument list into

N

separate arguments

A0, ...

.

Invoke the type-adjusted method handle on the unpacked arguments:
MH1.invokeExact(A0, ...).

Take the return value as an

Object

reference.

If the target method handle has variable arity, and the argument list is longer
than that arity, the excess arguments, starting at the position of the trailing
array argument, will be gathered (if possible, as if by

asType

conversions)
into an array of the appropriate type, and invocation will proceed on the
shortened argument list.
In this way,

jumbo argument lists

which would spread into more
than 254 slots can still be processed uniformly.

Unlike the

generic

invocation mode, which can
"recycle" an array argument, passing it directly to the target method,
this invocation mode

always

creates a new array parameter, even
if the original array passed to

invokeWithArguments

would have
been acceptable as a direct argument to the target method.
Even if the number

M

of actual arguments is the arity

N

,
and the last argument is dynamically a suitable array of type

A[]

,
it will still be boxed into a new one-element array, since the call
site statically types the argument as

Object

, not an array type.
This is not a special rule for this method, but rather a regular effect
of the

rules for variable-arity invocation

.

Because of the action of the

asType

step, the following argument
conversions are applied as necessary:

- reference casting

unboxing

widening primitive conversions

variable arity conversion

The result returned by the call is boxed if it is a primitive,
or forced to null if the return type is void.

Unlike the signature polymorphic methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

,

invokeWithArguments

can be accessed normally via the Core Reflection API and JNI.
It can therefore be used as a bridge between native or reflective code and method handles.

**API Note:** This call is approximately equivalent to the following code:

```java
// for jumbo argument lists, adapt varargs explicitly:
int N = (arguments == null? 0: arguments.length);
int M = this.type.parameterCount();
int MAX_SAFE = 127; // 127 longs require 254 slots, which is OK
if (N > MAX_SAFE && N > M && this.isVarargsCollector()) {
Class<?> arrayType = this.type().lastParameterType();
Class<?> elemType = arrayType.getComponentType();
if (elemType != null) {
Object args2 = Array.newInstance(elemType, M);
MethodHandle arraySetter = MethodHandles.arrayElementSetter(arrayType);
for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
arraySetter.invoke(args2, i, arguments[M-1 + i]);
}
arguments = Arrays.copyOf(arguments, M);
arguments[M-1] = args2;
return this.asFixedArity().invokeWithArguments(arguments);
}
} // done with explicit varargs processing

// Handle fixed arity and non-jumbo variable arity invocation.
MethodHandle invoker = MethodHandles.spreadInvoker(this.type(), 0);
Object result = invoker.invokeExact(this, arguments);
```
**Parameters:** arguments

- the arguments to pass to the target
**Returns:** the result returned by the target
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if an argument cannot be converted by reference casting
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type cannot be adjusted to take the given number of

Object

arguments
**Throws:** Throwable

- anything thrown by the target method invocation
**See Also:** MethodHandles.spreadInvoker(java.lang.invoke.MethodType, int)

- invokeWithArguments

```java
public
Object
invokeWithArguments​(
List
<?> arguments)
throws
Throwable
```

Performs a variable arity invocation, passing the arguments in the given list
to the method handle, as if via an inexact

invoke

from a call site
which mentions only the type

Object

, and whose actual argument count is the length
of the argument list.

This method is also equivalent to the following code:

```java
invokeWithArguments(arguments.toArray())
```

Jumbo-sized lists are acceptable if this method handle has variable arity.
See

invokeWithArguments(Object[])

for details.

**Parameters:** arguments

- the arguments to pass to the target
**Returns:** the result returned by the target
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arguments

is a null reference
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if an argument cannot be converted by reference casting
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type cannot be adjusted to take the given number of

Object

arguments
**Throws:** Throwable

- anything thrown by the target method invocation

- asType

```java
public
MethodHandle
asType​(
MethodType
newType)
```

Produces an adapter method handle which adapts the type of the
current method handle to a new type.
The resulting method handle is guaranteed to report a type
which is equal to the desired new type.

If the original type and new type are equal, returns

this

.

The new method handle, when invoked, will perform the following
steps:

- Convert the incoming argument list to match the original
method handle's argument list.

Invoke the original method handle on the converted argument list.

Convert any result returned by the original method handle
to the return type of new method handle.

This method provides the crucial behavioral difference between

invokeExact

and plain, inexact

invoke

.
The two methods
perform the same steps when the caller's type descriptor exactly matches
the callee's, but when the types differ, plain

invoke

also calls

asType

(or some internal equivalent) in order
to match up the caller's and callee's types.

If the current method is a variable arity method handle
argument list conversion may involve the conversion and collection
of several arguments into an array, as

described elsewhere

.
In every other case, all conversions are applied

pairwise

,
which means that each argument or return value is converted to
exactly one argument or return value (or no return value).
The applied conversions are defined by consulting
the corresponding component types of the old and new
method handle types.

Let

T0

and

T1

be corresponding new and old parameter types,
or old and new return types. Specifically, for some valid index

i

, let

T0

=newType.parameterType(i)

and

T1

=this.type().parameterType(i)

.
Or else, going the other way for return values, let

T0

=this.type().returnType()

and

T1

=newType.returnType()

.
If the types are the same, the new method handle makes no change
to the corresponding argument or return value (if any).
Otherwise, one of the following conversions is applied
if possible:

- If

T0

and

T1

are references, then a cast to

T1

is applied.
(The types do not need to be related in any particular way.
This is because a dynamic value of null can convert to any reference type.)

If

T0

and

T1

are primitives, then a Java method invocation
conversion (JLS 5.3) is applied, if one exists.
(Specifically,

T0

must convert to

T1

by a widening primitive conversion.)

If

T0

is a primitive and

T1

a reference,
a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) is applied if one exists.
(Specifically, the value is boxed from

T0

to its wrapper class,
which is then widened as needed to

T1

.)

If

T0

is a reference and

T1

a primitive, an unboxing
conversion will be applied at runtime, possibly followed
by a Java method invocation conversion (JLS 5.3)
on the primitive value. (These are the primitive widening conversions.)

T0

must be a wrapper class or a supertype of one.
(In the case where

T0

is Object, these are the conversions
allowed by

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.)
The unboxing conversion must have a possibility of success, which means that
if

T0

is not itself a wrapper class, there must exist at least one
wrapper class

TW

which is a subtype of

T0

and whose unboxed
primitive value can be widened to

T1

.

If the return type

T1

is marked as void, any returned value is discarded

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a reference, a null value is introduced.

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a primitive,
a zero value is introduced.

(

Note:

Both

T0

and

T1

may be regarded as static types,
because neither corresponds specifically to the

dynamic type

of any
actual argument or return value.)

The method handle conversion cannot be made if any one of the required
pairwise conversions cannot be made.

At runtime, the conversions applied to reference arguments
or return values may require additional runtime checks which can fail.
An unboxing operation may fail because the original reference is null,
causing a

NullPointerException

.
An unboxing operation or a reference cast may also fail on a reference
to an object of the wrong type,
causing a

ClassCastException

.
Although an unboxing operation may accept several kinds of wrappers,
if none are available, a

ClassCastException

will be thrown.

**Parameters:** newType

- the expected type of the new method handle
**Returns:** a method handle which delegates to

this

after performing
any necessary argument conversions, and arranges for any
necessary return value conversions
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

newType

is a null reference
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the conversion cannot be made

method handle, which accepts a trailing array argument
and spreads its elements as positional arguments.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be
the same as the type of the target, except that the final

arrayLength

parameters of the target's type are replaced
by a single array parameter of type

arrayType

.

If the array element type differs from any of the corresponding
argument types on the original target,
the original target is adapted to take the array elements directly,
as if by a call to

asType

.

When called, the adapter replaces a trailing array argument
by the array's elements, each as its own argument to the target.
(The order of the arguments is preserved.)
They are converted pairwise by casting and/or unboxing
to the types of the trailing parameters of the target.
Finally the target is called.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

Before calling the target, the adapter verifies that the array
contains exactly enough elements to provide a correct argument count
to the target method handle.
(The array may also be null when zero elements are required.)

When the adapter is called, the length of the supplied

array

argument is queried as if by

array.length

or

arraylength

bytecode. If the adapter accepts a zero-length trailing array argument,
the supplied

array

argument can either be a zero-length array or

null

; otherwise, the adapter will throw a

NullPointerException

if the array is

null

and throw an

IllegalArgumentException

if the array does not have the correct number of elements.

Here are some simple examples of array-spreading method handles:

```java
MethodHandle equals = publicLookup()
.findVirtual(String.class, "equals", methodType(boolean.class, Object.class));
assert( (boolean) equals.invokeExact("me", (Object)"me"));
assert(!(boolean) equals.invokeExact("me", (Object)"thee"));
// spread both arguments from a 2-array:
MethodHandle eq2 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 2);
assert( (boolean) eq2.invokeExact(new Object[]{ "me", "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq2.invokeExact(new Object[]{ "me", "thee" }));
// try to spread from anything but a 2-array:
for (int n = 0; n <= 10; n++) {
Object[] badArityArgs = (n == 2 ? new Object[0] : new Object[n]);
try { assert((boolean) eq2.invokeExact(badArityArgs) && false); }
catch (IllegalArgumentException ex) { } // OK
}
// spread both arguments from a String array:
MethodHandle eq2s = equals.asSpreader(String[].class, 2);
assert( (boolean) eq2s.invokeExact(new String[]{ "me", "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq2s.invokeExact(new String[]{ "me", "thee" }));
// spread second arguments from a 1-array:
MethodHandle eq1 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 1);
assert( (boolean) eq1.invokeExact("me", new Object[]{ "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq1.invokeExact("me", new Object[]{ "thee" }));
// spread no arguments from a 0-array or null:
MethodHandle eq0 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 0);
assert( (boolean) eq0.invokeExact("me", (Object)"me", new Object[0]));
assert(!(boolean) eq0.invokeExact("me", (Object)"thee", (Object[])null));
// asSpreader and asCollector are approximate inverses:
for (int n = 0; n <= 2; n++) {
for (Class<?> a : new Class<?>[]{Object[].class, String[].class, CharSequence[].class}) {
MethodHandle equals2 = equals.asSpreader(a, n).asCollector(a, n);
assert( (boolean) equals2.invokeWithArguments("me", "me"));
assert(!(boolean) equals2.invokeWithArguments("me", "thee"));
}
}
MethodHandle caToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, char[].class));
assertEquals("[A, B, C]", (String) caToString.invokeExact("ABC".toCharArray()));
MethodHandle caString3 = caToString.asCollector(char[].class, 3);
assertEquals("[A, B, C]", (String) caString3.invokeExact('A', 'B', 'C'));
MethodHandle caToString2 = caString3.asSpreader(char[].class, 2);
assertEquals("[A, B, C]", (String) caToString2.invokeExact('A', "BC".toCharArray()));
```

**Parameters:** arrayType

- usually

Object[]

, the type of the array argument from which to extract the spread arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to spread from an incoming array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which spreads its final array argument,
before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type,
or if target does not have at least

arrayLength

parameter types,
or if

arrayLength

is negative,
or if the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails
**See Also:** asCollector(java.lang.Class<?>, int)

- asSpreader

```java
public
MethodHandle
asSpreader​(int spreadArgPos,

Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)
```

Makes an

array-spreading

method handle, which accepts an array argument at a given position and spreads
its elements as positional arguments in place of the array. The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be the same as the type of the target, except that the

arrayLength

parameters of the target's type, starting at the zero-based position

spreadArgPos

,
are replaced by a single array parameter of type

arrayType

.

This method behaves very much like

asSpreader(Class, int)

, but accepts an additional

spreadArgPos

argument to indicate at which position in the parameter list the spreading should take place.

**API Note:** Example:

```java
MethodHandle compare = LOOKUP.findStatic(Objects.class, "compare", methodType(int.class, Object.class, Object.class, Comparator.class));
MethodHandle compare2FromArray = compare.asSpreader(0, Object[].class, 2);
Object[] ints = new Object[]{3, 9, 7, 7};
Comparator<Integer> cmp = (a, b) -> a - b;
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 0, 2), cmp) < 0);
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 1, 3), cmp) > 0);
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 2, 4), cmp) == 0);
```
**Parameters:** spreadArgPos

- the position (zero-based index) in the argument list at which spreading should start.
**Parameters:** arrayType

- usually

Object[]

, the type of the array argument from which to extract the spread arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to spread from an incoming array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which spreads an array argument at a given position,
before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type,
or if target does not have at least

arrayLength

parameter types,
or if

arrayLength

is negative,
or if

spreadArgPos

has an illegal value (negative, or together with arrayLength exceeding the
number of arguments),
or if the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** asSpreader(Class, int)

- withVarargs

```java
public
MethodHandle
withVarargs​(boolean makeVarargs)
```

Adapts this method handle to be

variable arity

if the boolean flag is true, else

fixed arity

.
If the method handle is already of the proper arity mode, it is returned
unchanged.

**API Note:** This method is sometimes useful when adapting a method handle that
may be variable arity, to ensure that the resulting adapter is also
variable arity if and only if the original handle was. For example,
this code changes the first argument of a handle

mh

to

int

without
disturbing its variable arity property:

mh.asType(mh.type().changeParameterType(0,int.class))
.withVarargs(mh.isVarargsCollector())

This call is approximately equivalent to the following code:

```java
if (makeVarargs == isVarargsCollector())
return this;
else if (makeVarargs)
return asVarargsCollector(type().lastParameterType());
else
return return asFixedArity();
```
**Parameters:** makeVarargs

- true if the return method handle should have variable arity behavior
**Returns:** a method handle of the same type, with possibly adjusted variable arity behavior
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

makeVarargs

is true and
this method handle does not have a trailing array parameter
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class<?>)

,

asFixedArity()

- asCollector

```java
public
MethodHandle
asCollector​(
Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)
```

Makes an

array-collecting

method handle, which accepts a given number of trailing
positional arguments and collects them into an array argument.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be
the same as the type of the target, except that a single trailing
parameter (usually of type

arrayType

) is replaced by

arrayLength

parameters whose type is element type of

arrayType

.

If the array type differs from the final argument type on the original target,
the original target is adapted to take the array type directly,
as if by a call to

asType

.

When called, the adapter replaces its trailing

arrayLength

arguments by a single new array of type

arrayType

, whose elements
comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.
Finally the target is called.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

(The array may also be a shared constant when

arrayLength

is zero.)

(

Note:

The

arrayType

is often identical to the

last parameter type

of the original target.
It is an explicit argument for symmetry with

asSpreader

, and also
to allow the target to use a simple

Object

as its last parameter type.)

In order to create a collecting adapter which is not restricted to a particular
number of collected arguments, use

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

instead.

Here are some examples of array-collecting method handles:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) deepToString.invokeExact(new Object[]{"won"}));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 1);
assertEquals(methodType(String.class, Object.class), ts1.type());
//assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invokeExact( new Object[]{"won"})); //FAIL
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invokeExact((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// arrayType can be a subtype of Object[]
MethodHandle ts2 = deepToString.asCollector(String[].class, 2);
assertEquals(methodType(String.class, String.class, String.class), ts2.type());
assertEquals("[two, too]", (String) ts2.invokeExact("two", "too"));
MethodHandle ts0 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 0);
assertEquals("[]", (String) ts0.invokeExact());
// collectors can be nested, Lisp-style
MethodHandle ts22 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 3).asCollector(String[].class, 2);
assertEquals("[A, B, [C, D]]", ((String) ts22.invokeExact((Object)'A', (Object)"B", "C", "D")));
// arrayType can be any primitive array type
MethodHandle bytesToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, byte[].class))
.asCollector(byte[].class, 3);
assertEquals("[1, 2, 3]", (String) bytesToString.invokeExact((byte)1, (byte)2, (byte)3));
MethodHandle longsToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, long[].class))
.asCollector(long[].class, 1);
assertEquals("[123]", (String) longsToString.invokeExact((long)123));
```

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.

**Parameters:** arrayType

- often

Object[]

, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to collect into a new array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which collects some trailing argument
into an array, before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type
or

arrayType

is not assignable to this method handle's trailing parameter type,
or

arrayLength

is not a legal array size,
or the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails
**See Also:** asSpreader(java.lang.Class<?>, int)

,

asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class<?>)

- asCollector

```java
public
MethodHandle
asCollector​(int collectArgPos,

Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)
```

Makes an

array-collecting

method handle, which accepts a given number of positional arguments starting
at a given position, and collects them into an array argument. The new method handle adapts, as its

target

, the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be the same as the type of the target,
except that the parameter at the position indicated by

collectArgPos

(usually of type

arrayType

)
is replaced by

arrayLength

parameters whose type is element type of

arrayType

.

This method behaves very much like

asCollector(Class, int)

, but differs in that its

collectArgPos

argument indicates at which position in the parameter list arguments should be collected. This
index is zero-based.

**API Note:** Examples:

```java
StringWriter swr = new StringWriter();
MethodHandle swWrite = LOOKUP.findVirtual(StringWriter.class, "write", methodType(void.class, char[].class, int.class, int.class)).bindTo(swr);
MethodHandle swWrite4 = swWrite.asCollector(0, char[].class, 4);
swWrite4.invoke('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 1, 2);
assertEquals("BC", swr.toString());
swWrite4.invoke('P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 0, 4);
assertEquals("BCPQRS", swr.toString());
swWrite4.invoke('W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 3, 1);
assertEquals("BCPQRSZ", swr.toString());
```

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.
**Parameters:** collectArgPos

- the zero-based position in the parameter list at which to start collecting.
**Parameters:** arrayType

- often

Object[]

, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to collect into a new array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which collects some arguments
into an array, before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type
or

arrayType

is not assignable to this method handle's array parameter type,
or

arrayLength

is not a legal array size,
or

collectArgPos

has an illegal value (negative, or greater than the number of arguments),
or the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** asCollector(Class, int)

- asVarargsCollector

```java
public
MethodHandle
asVarargsCollector​(
Class
<?> arrayType)
```

Makes a

variable arity

adapter which is able to accept
any number of trailing positional arguments and collect them
into an array argument.

The type and behavior of the adapter will be the same as
the type and behavior of the target, except that certain

invoke

and

asType

requests can lead to
trailing positional arguments being collected into target's
trailing parameter.
Also, the

last parameter type

of the adapter will be

arrayType

, even if the target has a different
last parameter type.

This transformation may return

this

if the method handle is
already of variable arity and its trailing parameter type
is identical to

arrayType

.

When called with

invokeExact

, the adapter invokes
the target with no argument changes.
(

Note:

This behavior is different from a

fixed arity collector

,
since it accepts a whole array of indeterminate length,
rather than a fixed number of arguments.)

When called with plain, inexact

invoke

, if the caller
type is the same as the adapter, the adapter invokes the target as with

invokeExact

.
(This is the normal behavior for

invoke

when types match.)

Otherwise, if the caller and adapter arity are the same, and the
trailing parameter type of the caller is a reference type identical to
or assignable to the trailing parameter type of the adapter,
the arguments and return values are converted pairwise,
as if by

asType

on a fixed arity
method handle.

Otherwise, the arities differ, or the adapter's trailing parameter
type is not assignable from the corresponding caller type.
In this case, the adapter replaces all trailing arguments from
the original trailing argument position onward, by
a new array of type

arrayType

, whose elements
comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.

The caller type must provides as least enough arguments,
and of the correct type, to satisfy the target's requirement for
positional arguments before the trailing array argument.
Thus, the caller must supply, at a minimum,

N-1

arguments,
where

N

is the arity of the target.
Also, there must exist conversions from the incoming arguments
to the target's arguments.
As with other uses of plain

invoke

, if these basic
requirements are not fulfilled, a

WrongMethodTypeException

may be thrown.

In all cases, what the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

In the final case, it is exactly as if the target method handle were
temporarily adapted with a

fixed arity collector

to the arity required by the caller type.
(As with

asCollector

, if the array length is zero,
a shared constant may be used instead of a new array.
If the implied call to

asCollector

would throw
an

IllegalArgumentException

or

WrongMethodTypeException

,
the call to the variable arity adapter must throw

WrongMethodTypeException

.)

The behavior of

asType

is also specialized for
variable arity adapters, to maintain the invariant that
plain, inexact

invoke

is always equivalent to an

asType

call to adjust the target type, followed by

invokeExact

.
Therefore, a variable arity adapter responds
to an

asType

request by building a fixed arity collector,
if and only if the adapter and requested type differ either
in arity or trailing argument type.
The resulting fixed arity collector has its type further adjusted
(if necessary) to the requested type by pairwise conversion,
as if by another application of

asType

.

When a method handle is obtained by executing an

ldc

instruction
of a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

constant, and the target method is marked
as a variable arity method (with the modifier bit

0x0080

),
the method handle will accept multiple arities, as if the method handle
constant were created by means of a call to

asVarargsCollector

.

In order to create a collecting adapter which collects a predetermined
number of arguments, and whose type reflects this predetermined number,
use

asCollector

instead.

No method handle transformations produce new method handles with
variable arity, unless they are documented as doing so.
Therefore, besides

asVarargsCollector

and

withVarargs

,
all methods in

MethodHandle

and

MethodHandles

will return a method handle with fixed arity,
except in the cases where they are specified to return their original
operand (e.g.,

asType

of the method handle's own type).

Calling

asVarargsCollector

on a method handle which is already
of variable arity will produce a method handle with the same type and behavior.
It may (or may not) return the original variable arity method handle.

Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invokeExact( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( "won" ));
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invoke((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// findStatic of Arrays.asList(...) produces a variable arity method handle:
MethodHandle asList = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals(methodType(List.class, Object[].class), asList.type());
assert(asList.isVarargsCollector());
assertEquals("[]", asList.invoke().toString());
assertEquals("[1]", asList.invoke(1).toString());
assertEquals("[two, too]", asList.invoke("two", "too").toString());
String[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke((Object[])argv).toString());
List ls = (List) asList.invoke((Object)argv);
assertEquals(1, ls.size());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", Arrays.toString((Object[])ls.get(0)));
```

Discussion:

These rules are designed as a dynamically-typed variation
of the Java rules for variable arity methods.
In both cases, callers to a variable arity method or method handle
can either pass zero or more positional arguments, or else pass
pre-collected arrays of any length. Users should be aware of the
special role of the final argument, and of the effect of a
type match on that final argument, which determines whether
or not a single trailing argument is interpreted as a whole
array or a single element of an array to be collected.
Note that the dynamic type of the trailing argument has no
effect on this decision, only a comparison between the symbolic
type descriptor of the call site and the type descriptor of the method handle.)

**Parameters:** arrayType

- often

Object[]

, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments
**Returns:** a new method handle which can collect any number of trailing arguments
into an array, before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type
or

arrayType

is not assignable to this method handle's trailing parameter type
**See Also:** asCollector(java.lang.Class<?>, int)

,

isVarargsCollector()

,

withVarargs(boolean)

,

asFixedArity()

- isVarargsCollector

```java
public boolean isVarargsCollector()
```

Determines if this method handle
supports

variable arity

calls.
Such method handles arise from the following sources:

- a call to

asVarargsCollector

a call to a

lookup method

which resolves to a variable arity Java method or constructor

an

ldc

instruction of a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

which resolves to a variable arity Java method or constructor

**Returns:** true if this method handle accepts more than one arity of plain, inexact

invoke

calls
**See Also:** asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class<?>)

,

asFixedArity()

- asFixedArity

```java
public
MethodHandle
asFixedArity()
```

Makes a

fixed arity

method handle which is otherwise
equivalent to the current method handle.

If the current method handle is not of

variable arity

,
the current method handle is returned.
This is true even if the current method handle
could not be a valid input to

asVarargsCollector

.

Otherwise, the resulting fixed-arity method handle has the same
type and behavior of the current method handle,
except that

isVarargsCollector

will be false.
The fixed-arity method handle may (or may not) be the
a previous argument to

asVarargsCollector

.

Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:

```java
MethodHandle asListVar = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class))
.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
MethodHandle asListFix = asListVar.asFixedArity();
assertEquals("[1]", asListVar.invoke(1).toString());
Exception caught = null;
try { asListFix.invoke((Object)1); }
catch (Exception ex) { caught = ex; }
assert(caught instanceof ClassCastException);
assertEquals("[two, too]", asListVar.invoke("two", "too").toString());
try { asListFix.invoke("two", "too"); }
catch (Exception ex) { caught = ex; }
assert(caught instanceof WrongMethodTypeException);
Object[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asListVar.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asListFix.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals(1, ((List) asListVar.invoke((Object)argv)).size());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asListFix.invoke((Object)argv).toString());
```

**Returns:** a new method handle which accepts only a fixed number of arguments
**See Also:** asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class<?>)

,

isVarargsCollector()

,

withVarargs(boolean)

- bindTo

```java
public
MethodHandle
bindTo​(
Object
x)
```

Binds a value

x

to the first argument of a method handle, without invoking it.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle by binding it to the given argument.
The type of the bound handle will be
the same as the type of the target, except that a single leading
reference parameter will be omitted.

When called, the bound handle inserts the given value

x

as a new leading argument to the target. The other arguments are
also passed unchanged.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the bound handle.

The reference

x

must be convertible to the first parameter
type of the target.

Note:

Because method handles are immutable, the target method handle
retains its original type and behavior.

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.

**Parameters:** x

- the value to bind to the first argument of the target
**Returns:** a new method handle which prepends the given value to the incoming
argument list, before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the target does not have a
leading parameter type that is a reference type
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if

x

cannot be converted
to the leading parameter type of the target
**See Also:** MethodHandles.insertArguments(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle, int, java.lang.Object...)

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of the method handle,
starting with the string

"MethodHandle"

and
ending with the string representation of the method handle's type.
In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value of:

```java
"MethodHandle" + type().toString()
```

(

Note:

Future releases of this API may add further information
to the string representation.
Therefore, the present syntax should not be parsed by applications.)

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of the method handle

invokeWithArguments

```java
public
Object
invokeWithArguments​(
Object
... arguments)
throws
Throwable
```

Performs a variable arity invocation, passing the arguments in the given array
to the method handle, as if via an inexact

invoke

from a call site
which mentions only the type

Object

, and whose actual argument count is the length
of the argument array.

Specifically, execution proceeds as if by the following steps,
although the methods are not guaranteed to be called if the JVM
can predict their effects.

- Determine the length of the argument array as

N

.
For a null reference,

N=0

.
- Collect the

N

elements of the array as a logical
argument list, each argument statically typed as an

Object

.
- Determine, as

M

, the parameter count of the type of this
method handle.
- Determine the general type

TN

of

N

arguments or

M

arguments, if smaller than

N

, as

TN=MethodType.genericMethodType(Math.min(N, M))

.
- If

N

is greater than

M

, perform the following
checks and actions to shorten the logical argument list:

- Check that this method handle has variable arity with a

trailing parameter

of some array type

A[]

. If not, fail with a

WrongMethodTypeException

.
- Collect the trailing elements (there are

N-M+1

of them)
from the logical argument list into a single array of
type

A[]

, using

asType

conversions to
convert each trailing argument to type

A

.
- If any of these conversions proves impossible, fail with either
a

ClassCastException

if any trailing element cannot be
cast to

A

or a

NullPointerException

if any
trailing element is

null

and

A

is not a reference
type.
- Replace the logical arguments gathered into the array of
type

A[]

with the array itself, thus shortening
the argument list to length

M

. This final argument
retains the static type

A[]

.
- Adjust the type

TN

by changing the

N

th
parameter type from

Object

to

A[]

.

Force the original target method handle

MH0

to the
required type, as

MH1 = MH0.asType(TN)

.

Spread the argument list into

N

separate arguments

A0, ...

.

Invoke the type-adjusted method handle on the unpacked arguments:
MH1.invokeExact(A0, ...).

Take the return value as an

Object

reference.

If the target method handle has variable arity, and the argument list is longer
than that arity, the excess arguments, starting at the position of the trailing
array argument, will be gathered (if possible, as if by

asType

conversions)
into an array of the appropriate type, and invocation will proceed on the
shortened argument list.
In this way,

jumbo argument lists

which would spread into more
than 254 slots can still be processed uniformly.

Unlike the

generic

invocation mode, which can
"recycle" an array argument, passing it directly to the target method,
this invocation mode

always

creates a new array parameter, even
if the original array passed to

invokeWithArguments

would have
been acceptable as a direct argument to the target method.
Even if the number

M

of actual arguments is the arity

N

,
and the last argument is dynamically a suitable array of type

A[]

,
it will still be boxed into a new one-element array, since the call
site statically types the argument as

Object

, not an array type.
This is not a special rule for this method, but rather a regular effect
of the

rules for variable-arity invocation

.

Because of the action of the

asType

step, the following argument
conversions are applied as necessary:

- reference casting

unboxing

widening primitive conversions

variable arity conversion

The result returned by the call is boxed if it is a primitive,
or forced to null if the return type is void.

Unlike the signature polymorphic methods

invokeExact

and

invoke

,

invokeWithArguments

can be accessed normally via the Core Reflection API and JNI.
It can therefore be used as a bridge between native or reflective code and method handles.

**API Note:** This call is approximately equivalent to the following code:

```java
// for jumbo argument lists, adapt varargs explicitly:
int N = (arguments == null? 0: arguments.length);
int M = this.type.parameterCount();
int MAX_SAFE = 127; // 127 longs require 254 slots, which is OK
if (N > MAX_SAFE && N > M && this.isVarargsCollector()) {
Class<?> arrayType = this.type().lastParameterType();
Class<?> elemType = arrayType.getComponentType();
if (elemType != null) {
Object args2 = Array.newInstance(elemType, M);
MethodHandle arraySetter = MethodHandles.arrayElementSetter(arrayType);
for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
arraySetter.invoke(args2, i, arguments[M-1 + i]);
}
arguments = Arrays.copyOf(arguments, M);
arguments[M-1] = args2;
return this.asFixedArity().invokeWithArguments(arguments);
}
} // done with explicit varargs processing

// Handle fixed arity and non-jumbo variable arity invocation.
MethodHandle invoker = MethodHandles.spreadInvoker(this.type(), 0);
Object result = invoker.invokeExact(this, arguments);
```
**Parameters:** arguments

- the arguments to pass to the target
**Returns:** the result returned by the target
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if an argument cannot be converted by reference casting
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the target's type cannot be adjusted to take the given number of

arguments
**Throws:** Throwable

- anything thrown by the target method invocation

asType

```java
public
MethodHandle
asType​(
MethodType
newType)
```

Produces an adapter method handle which adapts the type of the
current method handle to a new type.
The resulting method handle is guaranteed to report a type
which is equal to the desired new type.

If the original type and new type are equal, returns

this

.

The new method handle, when invoked, will perform the following
steps:

- Convert the incoming argument list to match the original
method handle's argument list.

Invoke the original method handle on the converted argument list.

Convert any result returned by the original method handle
to the return type of new method handle.

This method provides the crucial behavioral difference between

invokeExact

and plain, inexact

invoke

.
The two methods
perform the same steps when the caller's type descriptor exactly matches
the callee's, but when the types differ, plain

invoke

also calls

asType

(or some internal equivalent) in order
to match up the caller's and callee's types.

If the current method is a variable arity method handle
argument list conversion may involve the conversion and collection
of several arguments into an array, as

described elsewhere

.
In every other case, all conversions are applied

pairwise

,
which means that each argument or return value is converted to
exactly one argument or return value (or no return value).
The applied conversions are defined by consulting
the corresponding component types of the old and new
method handle types.

Let

T0

and

T1

be corresponding new and old parameter types,
or old and new return types. Specifically, for some valid index

i

, let

T0

=newType.parameterType(i)

and

T1

=this.type().parameterType(i)

.
Or else, going the other way for return values, let

T0

=this.type().returnType()

and

T1

=newType.returnType()

.
If the types are the same, the new method handle makes no change
to the corresponding argument or return value (if any).
Otherwise, one of the following conversions is applied
if possible:

- If

T0

and

T1

are references, then a cast to

T1

is applied.
(The types do not need to be related in any particular way.
This is because a dynamic value of null can convert to any reference type.)

If

T0

and

T1

are primitives, then a Java method invocation
conversion (JLS 5.3) is applied, if one exists.
(Specifically,

T0

must convert to

T1

by a widening primitive conversion.)

If

T0

is a primitive and

T1

a reference,
a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) is applied if one exists.
(Specifically, the value is boxed from

T0

to its wrapper class,
which is then widened as needed to

T1

.)

If

T0

is a reference and

T1

a primitive, an unboxing
conversion will be applied at runtime, possibly followed
by a Java method invocation conversion (JLS 5.3)
on the primitive value. (These are the primitive widening conversions.)

T0

must be a wrapper class or a supertype of one.
(In the case where

T0

is Object, these are the conversions
allowed by

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.)
The unboxing conversion must have a possibility of success, which means that
if

T0

is not itself a wrapper class, there must exist at least one
wrapper class

TW

which is a subtype of

T0

and whose unboxed
primitive value can be widened to

T1

.

If the return type

T1

is marked as void, any returned value is discarded

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a reference, a null value is introduced.

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a primitive,
a zero value is introduced.

(

Note:

Both

T0

and

T1

may be regarded as static types,
because neither corresponds specifically to the

dynamic type

of any
actual argument or return value.)

The method handle conversion cannot be made if any one of the required
pairwise conversions cannot be made.

At runtime, the conversions applied to reference arguments
or return values may require additional runtime checks which can fail.
An unboxing operation may fail because the original reference is null,
causing a

NullPointerException

.
An unboxing operation or a reference cast may also fail on a reference
to an object of the wrong type,
causing a

ClassCastException

.
Although an unboxing operation may accept several kinds of wrappers,
if none are available, a

ClassCastException

will be thrown.

**Parameters:** newType

- the expected type of the new method handle
**Returns:** a method handle which delegates to

this

after performing
any necessary argument conversions, and arranges for any
necessary return value conversions
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

newType

is a null reference
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the conversion cannot be made

T1

a reference, a null value is introduced.

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a primitive,
a zero value is introduced.

(

Note:

Both

T0

and

T1

may be regarded as static types,
because neither corresponds specifically to the

dynamic type

of any
actual argument or return value.)

The method handle conversion cannot be made if any one of the required
pairwise conversions cannot be made.

At runtime, the conversions applied to reference arguments
or return values may require additional runtime checks which can fail.
An unboxing operation may fail because the original reference is null,
causing a

NullPointerException

.
An unboxing operation or a reference cast may also fail on a reference
to an object of the wrong type,
causing a

ClassCastException

.
Although an unboxing operation may accept several kinds of wrappers,
if none are available, a

ClassCastException

will be thrown.

If

T0

and

T1

are references, then a cast to

T1

is applied.
(The types do not need to be related in any particular way.
This is because a dynamic value of null can convert to any reference type.)

If

T0

and

T1

are primitives, then a Java method invocation
conversion (JLS 5.3) is applied, if one exists.
(Specifically,

T0

must convert to

T1

by a widening primitive conversion.)

If

T0

is a primitive and

T1

a reference,
a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) is applied if one exists.
(Specifically, the value is boxed from

T0

to its wrapper class,
which is then widened as needed to

T1

.)

If

T0

is a reference and

T1

a primitive, an unboxing
conversion will be applied at runtime, possibly followed
by a Java method invocation conversion (JLS 5.3)
on the primitive value. (These are the primitive widening conversions.)

T0

must be a wrapper class or a supertype of one.
(In the case where

T0

is Object, these are the conversions
allowed by

java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke

.)
The unboxing conversion must have a possibility of success, which means that
if

T0

is not itself a wrapper class, there must exist at least one
wrapper class

TW

which is a subtype of

T0

and whose unboxed
primitive value can be widened to

T1

.

If the return type

T1

is marked as void, any returned value is discarded

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a reference, a null value is introduced.

If the return type

T0

is void and

T1

a primitive,
a zero value is introduced.

The method handle conversion cannot be made if any one of the required
pairwise conversions cannot be made.

At runtime, the conversions applied to reference arguments
or return values may require additional runtime checks which can fail.

causing a

asSpreader

```java
public
MethodHandle
asSpreader​(
Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)
```

Makes an

array-spreading

method handle, which accepts a trailing array argument
and spreads its elements as positional arguments.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be
the same as the type of the target, except that the final

arrayLength

parameters of the target's type are replaced
by a single array parameter of type

arrayType

.

If the array element type differs from any of the corresponding
argument types on the original target,
the original target is adapted to take the array elements directly,
as if by a call to

asType

.

When called, the adapter replaces a trailing array argument
by the array's elements, each as its own argument to the target.
(The order of the arguments is preserved.)
They are converted pairwise by casting and/or unboxing
to the types of the trailing parameters of the target.
Finally the target is called.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

Before calling the target, the adapter verifies that the array
contains exactly enough elements to provide a correct argument count
to the target method handle.
(The array may also be null when zero elements are required.)

When the adapter is called, the length of the supplied

array

argument is queried as if by

array.length

or

arraylength

bytecode. If the adapter accepts a zero-length trailing array argument,
the supplied

array

argument can either be a zero-length array or

null

; otherwise, the adapter will throw a

NullPointerException

if the array is

null

and throw an

IllegalArgumentException

if the array does not have the correct number of elements.

Here are some simple examples of array-spreading method handles:

```java
MethodHandle equals = publicLookup()
.findVirtual(String.class, "equals", methodType(boolean.class, Object.class));
assert( (boolean) equals.invokeExact("me", (Object)"me"));
assert(!(boolean) equals.invokeExact("me", (Object)"thee"));
// spread both arguments from a 2-array:
MethodHandle eq2 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 2);
assert( (boolean) eq2.invokeExact(new Object[]{ "me", "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq2.invokeExact(new Object[]{ "me", "thee" }));
// try to spread from anything but a 2-array:
for (int n = 0; n <= 10; n++) {
Object[] badArityArgs = (n == 2 ? new Object[0] : new Object[n]);
try { assert((boolean) eq2.invokeExact(badArityArgs) && false); }
catch (IllegalArgumentException ex) { } // OK
}
// spread both arguments from a String array:
MethodHandle eq2s = equals.asSpreader(String[].class, 2);
assert( (boolean) eq2s.invokeExact(new String[]{ "me", "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq2s.invokeExact(new String[]{ "me", "thee" }));
// spread second arguments from a 1-array:
MethodHandle eq1 = equals.asSpreader(Object[].class, 1);
assert( (boolean) eq1.invokeExact("me", new Object[]{ "me" }));
assert(!(boolean) eq1.invokeExact("me", new Object[]{ "thee" }));

assert( (boolean) eq0.invokeExact("me", (Object)"me", new Object[0]));
assert(!(boolean) eq0.invokeExact("me", (Object)"thee", (Object[])null));
// asSpreader and asCollector are approximate inverses:
for (int n = 0; n <= 2; n++) {
for (Class<?> a : new Class<?>[]{Object[].class, String[].class, CharSequence[].class}) {
MethodHandle equals2 = equals.asSpreader(a, n).asCollector(a, n);
assert( (boolean) equals2.invokeWithArguments("me", "me"));
assert(!(boolean) equals2.invokeWithArguments("me", "thee"));
}
}
MethodHandle caToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, char[].class));
assertEquals("[A, B, C]", (String) caToString.invokeExact("ABC".toCharArray()));

```

**Parameters:** arrayType

- usually

Object[]

, the type of the array argument from which to extract the spread arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to spread from an incoming array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which spreads its final array argument,
before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type,
or if target does not have at least

arrayLength

parameter types,
or if

arrayLength

is negative,
or if the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails

asSpreader

```java
public
MethodHandle
asSpreader​(int spreadArgPos,

Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)
```

Makes an

array-spreading

method handle, which accepts an array argument at a given position and spreads
its elements as positional arguments in place of the array. The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be the same as the type of the target, except that the

arrayLength

parameters of the target's type, starting at the zero-based position

spreadArgPos

,
are replaced by a single array parameter of type

arrayType

.

This method behaves very much like

asSpreader(Class, int)

, but accepts an additional

spreadArgPos

argument to indicate at which position in the parameter list the spreading should take place.

**API Note:** Example:

```java
MethodHandle compare = LOOKUP.findStatic(Objects.class, "compare", methodType(int.class, Object.class, Object.class, Comparator.class));
MethodHandle compare2FromArray = compare.asSpreader(0, Object[].class, 2);
Object[] ints = new Object[]{3, 9, 7, 7};
Comparator<Integer> cmp = (a, b) -> a - b;
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 0, 2), cmp) < 0);
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 1, 3), cmp) > 0);
assertTrue((int) compare2FromArray.invoke(Arrays.copyOfRange(ints, 2, 4), cmp) == 0);
```
**Parameters:** spreadArgPos

- the position (zero-based index) in the argument list at which spreading should start.
**Parameters:** arrayType

- usually

Object[]

, the type of the array argument from which to extract the spread arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to spread from an incoming array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which spreads an array argument at a given position,
before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type,
or if target does not have at least

arrayLength

parameter types,
or if

arrayLength

is negative,
or if

spreadArgPos

has an illegal value (negative, or together with arrayLength exceeding the
number of arguments),
or if the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails

withVarargs

```java
public
MethodHandle
withVarargs​(boolean makeVarargs)
```

Adapts this method handle to be

variable arity

if the boolean flag is true, else

fixed arity

.
If the method handle is already of the proper arity mode, it is returned
unchanged.

**API Note:** This method is sometimes useful when adapting a method handle that
may be variable arity, to ensure that the resulting adapter is also
variable arity if and only if the original handle was. For example,
this code changes the first argument of a handle

mh

to

int

without
disturbing its variable arity property:

mh.asType(mh.type().changeParameterType(0,int.class))
.withVarargs(mh.isVarargsCollector())

This call is approximately equivalent to the following code:

```java
if (makeVarargs == isVarargsCollector())
return this;
else if (makeVarargs)
return asVarargsCollector(type().lastParameterType());
else
return return asFixedArity();
```
**Parameters:** makeVarargs

- true if the return method handle should have variable arity behavior
**Returns:** a method handle of the same type, with possibly adjusted variable arity behavior
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

makeVarargs

is true and
this method handle does not have a trailing array parameter

asCollector

```java
public
MethodHandle
asCollector​(
Class

```

Makes an

array-collecting

method handle, which accepts a given number of trailing
positional arguments and collects them into an array argument.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be
the same as the type of the target, except that a single trailing
parameter (usually of type

arrayType

) is replaced by

arrayLength

parameters whose type is element type of

arrayType

.

If the array type differs from the final argument type on the original target,
the original target is adapted to take the array type directly,
as if by a call to

asType

.

When called, the adapter replaces its trailing

arrayLength

arguments by a single new array of type

arrayType

, whose elements
comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.
Finally the target is called.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

(The array may also be a shared constant when

arrayLength

is zero.)

(

Note:

The

arrayType

is often identical to the

last parameter type

of the original target.
It is an explicit argument for symmetry with

asSpreader

, and also
to allow the target to use a simple

Object

as its last parameter type.)

In order to create a collecting adapter which is not restricted to a particular
number of collected arguments, use

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

instead.

Here are some examples of array-collecting method handles:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) deepToString.invokeExact(new Object[]{"won"}));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 1);

assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invokeExact((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// arrayType can be a subtype of Object[]
MethodHandle ts2 = deepToString.asCollector(String[].class, 2);
assertEquals(methodType(String.class, String.class, String.class), ts2.type());
assertEquals("[two, too]", (String) ts2.invokeExact("two", "too"));

assertEquals("[]", (String) ts0.invokeExact());
// collectors can be nested, Lisp-style

, even if the original target method handle was.

In order to create a collecting adapter which is not restricted to a particular
number of collected arguments, use

asVarargsCollector

or

withVarargs

instead.

Here are some examples of array-collecting method handles:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) deepToString.invokeExact(new Object[]{"won"}));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 1);
assertEquals(methodType(String.class, Object.class), ts1.type());
//assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invokeExact( new Object[]{"won"})); //FAIL
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invokeExact((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// arrayType can be a subtype of Object[]
MethodHandle ts2 = deepToString.asCollector(String[].class, 2);
assertEquals(methodType(String.class, String.class, String.class), ts2.type());
assertEquals("[two, too]", (String) ts2.invokeExact("two", "too"));
MethodHandle ts0 = deepToString.asCollector(Object[].class, 0);
assertEquals("[]", (String) ts0.invokeExact());
// collectors can be nested, Lisp-style

assertEquals("[A, B, [C, D]]", ((String) ts22.invokeExact((Object)'A', (Object)"B", "C", "D")));
// arrayType can be any primitive array type
MethodHandle bytesToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "toString", methodType(String.class, byte[].class))

asCollector

```java
public
MethodHandle
asCollector​(int collectArgPos,

Class
<?> arrayType,
int arrayLength)
```

Makes an

array-collecting

method handle, which accepts a given number of positional arguments starting
at a given position, and collects them into an array argument. The new method handle adapts, as its

target

, the current method handle. The type of the adapter will be the same as the type of the target,
except that the parameter at the position indicated by

collectArgPos

(usually of type

arrayType

)
is replaced by

arrayLength

parameters whose type is element type of

arrayType

.

This method behaves very much like

asCollector(Class, int)

, but differs in that its

collectArgPos

argument indicates at which position in the parameter list arguments should be collected. This
index is zero-based.

**API Note:** Examples:

```java
StringWriter swr = new StringWriter();
MethodHandle swWrite = LOOKUP.findVirtual(StringWriter.class, "write", methodType(void.class, char[].class, int.class, int.class)).bindTo(swr);
MethodHandle swWrite4 = swWrite.asCollector(0, char[].class, 4);
swWrite4.invoke('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 1, 2);
assertEquals("BC", swr.toString());
swWrite4.invoke('P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 0, 4);
assertEquals("BCPQRS", swr.toString());
swWrite4.invoke('W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 3, 1);
assertEquals("BCPQRSZ", swr.toString());
```

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.
**Parameters:** collectArgPos

- the zero-based position in the parameter list at which to start collecting.
**Parameters:** arrayType

- often

Object[]

, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments
**Parameters:** arrayLength

- the number of arguments to collect into a new array argument
**Returns:** a new method handle which collects some arguments
into an array, before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

arrayType

is a null reference
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

arrayType

is not an array type
or

arrayType

is not assignable to this method handle's array parameter type,
or

arrayLength

is not a legal array size,
or

collectArgPos

has an illegal value (negative, or greater than the number of arguments),
or the resulting method handle's type would have

too many parameters
**Throws:** WrongMethodTypeException

- if the implied

asType

call fails
**Since:** 9

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.

asVarargsCollector

```java
public
MethodHandle
asVarargsCollector​(
Class
<?> arrayType)
```

Makes a

variable arity

adapter which is able to accept
any number of trailing positional arguments and collect them
into an array argument.

The type and behavior of the adapter will be the same as
the type and behavior of the target, except that certain

invoke

and

asType

requests can lead to
trailing positional arguments being collected into target's
trailing parameter.
Also, the

last parameter type

of the adapter will be

arrayType

, even if the target has a different
last parameter type.

This transformation may return

this

if the method handle is
already of variable arity and its trailing parameter type
is identical to

arrayType

.

When called with

invokeExact

, the adapter invokes
the target with no argument changes.
(

Note:

This behavior is different from a

fixed arity collector

,
since it accepts a whole array of indeterminate length,
rather than a fixed number of arguments.)

When called with plain, inexact

invoke

, if the caller
type is the same as the adapter, the adapter invokes the target as with

invokeExact

.
(This is the normal behavior for

invoke

when types match.)

Otherwise, if the caller and adapter arity are the same, and the
trailing parameter type of the caller is a reference type identical to
or assignable to the trailing parameter type of the adapter,
the arguments and return values are converted pairwise,
as if by

asType

on a fixed arity
method handle.

Otherwise, the arities differ, or the adapter's trailing parameter
type is not assignable from the corresponding caller type.
In this case, the adapter replaces all trailing arguments from
the original trailing argument position onward, by
a new array of type

arrayType

, whose elements
comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.

The caller type must provides as least enough arguments,
and of the correct type, to satisfy the target's requirement for
positional arguments before the trailing array argument.
Thus, the caller must supply, at a minimum,

N-1

arguments,
where

N

is the arity of the target.
Also, there must exist conversions from the incoming arguments
to the target's arguments.
As with other uses of plain

invoke

, if these basic
requirements are not fulfilled, a

WrongMethodTypeException

may be thrown.

In all cases, what the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

In the final case, it is exactly as if the target method handle were
temporarily adapted with a

fixed arity collector

to the arity required by the caller type.
(As with

asCollector

, if the array length is zero,
a shared constant may be used instead of a new array.
If the implied call to

asCollector

would throw
an

IllegalArgumentException

or

WrongMethodTypeException

,
the call to the variable arity adapter must throw

WrongMethodTypeException

.)

The behavior of

asType

is also specialized for
variable arity adapters, to maintain the invariant that
plain, inexact

invoke

is always equivalent to an

asType

call to adjust the target type, followed by

invokeExact

.
Therefore, a variable arity adapter responds
to an

asType

request by building a fixed arity collector,
if and only if the adapter and requested type differ either
in arity or trailing argument type.
The resulting fixed arity collector has its type further adjusted
(if necessary) to the requested type by pairwise conversion,
as if by another application of

asType

.

When a method handle is obtained by executing an

ldc

instruction
of a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

constant, and the target method is marked
as a variable arity method (with the modifier bit

0x0080

),
the method handle will accept multiple arities, as if the method handle
constant were created by means of a call to

asVarargsCollector

.

In order to create a collecting adapter which collects a predetermined
number of arguments, and whose type reflects this predetermined number,
use

asCollector

instead.

No method handle transformations produce new method handles with
variable arity, unless they are documented as doing so.
Therefore, besides

asVarargsCollector

and

withVarargs

,
all methods in

MethodHandle

and

MethodHandles

will return a method handle with fixed arity,
except in the cases where they are specified to return their original
operand (e.g.,

asType

of the method handle's own type).

Calling

asVarargsCollector

on a method handle which is already
of variable arity will produce a method handle with the same type and behavior.
It may (or may not) return the original variable arity method handle.

Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invokeExact( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( "won" ));
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invoke((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// findStatic of Arrays.asList(...) produces a variable arity method handle:
MethodHandle asList = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals(methodType(List.class, Object[].class), asList.type());
assert(asList.isVarargsCollector());
assertEquals("[]", asList.invoke().toString());
assertEquals("[1]", asList.invoke(1).toString());
assertEquals("[two, too]", asList.invoke("two", "too").toString());
String[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke((Object[])argv).toString());
List ls = (List) asList.invoke((Object)argv);
assertEquals(1, ls.size());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", Arrays.toString((Object[])ls.get(0)));
```

Discussion:

These rules are designed as a dynamically-typed variation
of the Java rules for variable arity methods.
In both cases, callers to a variable arity method or method handle
can either pass zero or more positional arguments, or else pass
pre-collected arrays of any length. Users should be aware of the
special role of the final argument, and of the effect of a
type match on that final argument, which determines whether
or not a single trailing argument is interpreted as a whole
array or a single element of an array to be collected.
Note that the dynamic type of the trailing argument has no
effect on this decision, only a comparison between the symbolic
type descriptor of the call site and the type descriptor of the method handle.)

Discussion:

These rules are designed as a dynamically-typed variation
of the Java rules for variable arity methods.
In both cases, callers to a variable arity method or method handle
can either pass zero or more positional arguments, or else pass
pre-collected arrays of any length. Users should be aware of the
special role of the final argument, and of the effect of a
type match on that final argument, which determines whether
or not a single trailing argument is interpreted as a whole
array or a single element of an array to be collected.
Note that the dynamic type of the trailing argument has no
effect on this decision, only a comparison between the symbolic
type descriptor of the call site and the type descriptor of the method handle.)

This transformation may return

this

if the method handle is
already of variable arity and its trailing parameter type
is identical to

arrayType

.

When called with

invokeExact

, the adapter invokes
the target with no argument changes.
(

Note:

This behavior is different from a

fixed arity collector

,
since it accepts a whole array of indeterminate length,
rather than a fixed number of arguments.)

When called with plain, inexact

invoke

, if the caller
type is the same as the adapter, the adapter invokes the target as with

invokeExact

.
(This is the normal behavior for

invoke

when types match.)

Otherwise, if the caller and adapter arity are the same, and the
trailing parameter type of the caller is a reference type identical to
or assignable to the trailing parameter type of the adapter,
the arguments and return values are converted pairwise,
as if by

asType

on a fixed arity
method handle.

Otherwise, the arities differ, or the adapter's trailing parameter
type is not assignable from the corresponding caller type.
In this case, the adapter replaces all trailing arguments from
the original trailing argument position onward, by
a new array of type

arrayType

, whose elements
comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.

The caller type must provides as least enough arguments,
and of the correct type, to satisfy the target's requirement for
positional arguments before the trailing array argument.
Thus, the caller must supply, at a minimum,

N-1

arguments,
where

N

is the arity of the target.
Also, there must exist conversions from the incoming arguments
to the target's arguments.
As with other uses of plain

invoke

, if these basic
requirements are not fulfilled, a

WrongMethodTypeException

may be thrown.

In all cases, what the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

In the final case, it is exactly as if the target method handle were
temporarily adapted with a

fixed arity collector

to the arity required by the caller type.
(As with

asCollector

, if the array length is zero,
a shared constant may be used instead of a new array.
If the implied call to

asCollector

would throw
an

IllegalArgumentException

or

WrongMethodTypeException

,
the call to the variable arity adapter must throw

WrongMethodTypeException

.)

The behavior of

asType

is also specialized for
variable arity adapters, to maintain the invariant that
plain, inexact

invoke

is always equivalent to an

asType

call to adjust the target type, followed by

invokeExact

.
Therefore, a variable arity adapter responds
to an

asType

request by building a fixed arity collector,
if and only if the adapter and requested type differ either
in arity or trailing argument type.
The resulting fixed arity collector has its type further adjusted
(if necessary) to the requested type by pairwise conversion,
as if by another application of

asType

.

When a method handle is obtained by executing an

ldc

instruction
of a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

constant, and the target method is marked
as a variable arity method (with the modifier bit

0x0080

),
the method handle will accept multiple arities, as if the method handle
constant were created by means of a call to

asVarargsCollector

.

In order to create a collecting adapter which collects a predetermined
number of arguments, and whose type reflects this predetermined number,
use

asCollector

instead.

No method handle transformations produce new method handles with
variable arity, unless they are documented as doing so.
Therefore, besides

asVarargsCollector

and

withVarargs

,
all methods in

MethodHandle

and

MethodHandles

will return a method handle with fixed arity,
except in the cases where they are specified to return their original
operand (e.g.,

asType

of the method handle's own type).

Calling

asVarargsCollector

on a method handle which is already
of variable arity will produce a method handle with the same type and behavior.
It may (or may not) return the original variable arity method handle.

Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invokeExact( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( "won" ));
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invoke((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// findStatic of Arrays.asList(...) produces a variable arity method handle:
MethodHandle asList = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals(methodType(List.class, Object[].class), asList.type());
assert(asList.isVarargsCollector());
assertEquals("[]", asList.invoke().toString());
assertEquals("[1]", asList.invoke(1).toString());
assertEquals("[two, too]", asList.invoke("two", "too").toString());
String[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke((Object[])argv).toString());
List ls = (List) asList.invoke((Object)argv);
assertEquals(1, ls.size());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", Arrays.toString((Object[])ls.get(0)));
```

to the arity required by the caller type.
(As with

asCollector

, if the array length is zero,
a shared constant may be used instead of a new array.
If the implied call to

asCollector

would throw
an

IllegalArgumentException

or

WrongMethodTypeException

,
the call to the variable arity adapter must throw

WrongMethodTypeException

.)

The behavior of

asType

is also specialized for
variable arity adapters, to maintain the invariant that
plain, inexact

invoke

is always equivalent to an

asType

call to adjust the target type, followed by

invokeExact

.
Therefore, a variable arity adapter responds
to an

asType

request by building a fixed arity collector,
if and only if the adapter and requested type differ either
in arity or trailing argument type.
The resulting fixed arity collector has its type further adjusted
(if necessary) to the requested type by pairwise conversion,
as if by another application of

asType

.

When a method handle is obtained by executing an

ldc

instruction
of a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

constant, and the target method is marked
as a variable arity method (with the modifier bit

0x0080

),
the method handle will accept multiple arities, as if the method handle
constant were created by means of a call to

asVarargsCollector

.

In order to create a collecting adapter which collects a predetermined
number of arguments, and whose type reflects this predetermined number,
use

asCollector

instead.

No method handle transformations produce new method handles with
variable arity, unless they are documented as doing so.
Therefore, besides

asVarargsCollector

and

withVarargs

,
all methods in

MethodHandle

and

MethodHandles

will return a method handle with fixed arity,
except in the cases where they are specified to return their original
operand (e.g.,

asType

of the method handle's own type).

Calling

asVarargsCollector

on a method handle which is already
of variable arity will produce a method handle with the same type and behavior.
It may (or may not) return the original variable arity method handle.

Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:

```java
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invokeExact( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]", (String) ts1.invoke( "won" ));
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invoke((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// findStatic of Arrays.asList(...) produces a variable arity method handle:
MethodHandle asList = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals(methodType(List.class, Object[].class), asList.type());
assert(asList.isVarargsCollector());
assertEquals("[]", asList.invoke().toString());
assertEquals("[1]", asList.invoke(1).toString());
assertEquals("[two, too]", asList.invoke("two", "too").toString());
String[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke((Object[])argv).toString());
List ls = (List) asList.invoke((Object)argv);
assertEquals(1, ls.size());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", Arrays.toString((Object[])ls.get(0)));
```

Discussion:

These rules are designed as a dynamically-typed variation
of the Java rules for variable arity methods.
In both cases, callers to a variable arity method or method handle
can either pass zero or more positional arguments, or else pass
pre-collected arrays of any length. Users should be aware of the
special role of the final argument, and of the effect of a
type match on that final argument, which determines whether
or not a single trailing argument is interpreted as a whole
array or a single element of an array to be collected.
Note that the dynamic type of the trailing argument has no
effect on this decision, only a comparison between the symbolic
type descriptor of the call site and the type descriptor of the method handle.)

In all cases, what the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.

In the final case, it is exactly as if the target method handle were
temporarily adapted with a

fixed arity collector

to the arity required by the caller type.
(As with

asCollector

, if the array length is zero,
a shared constant may be used instead of a new array.

Discussion:

These rules are designed as a dynamically-typed variation
of the Java rules for variable arity methods.
In both cases, callers to a variable arity method or method handle
can either pass zero or more positional arguments, or else pass
pre-collected arrays of any length. Users should be aware of the
special role of the final argument, and of the effect of a
type match on that final argument, which determines whether
or not a single trailing argument is interpreted as a whole
array or a single element of an array to be collected.
Note that the dynamic type of the trailing argument has no
effect on this decision, only a comparison between the symbolic
type descriptor of the call site and the type descriptor of the method handle.)

isVarargsCollector

```java
public boolean isVarargsCollector()
```

Determines if this method handle
supports

variable arity

calls.
Such method handles arise from the following sources:

- a call to

asVarargsCollector

a call to a

lookup method

which resolves to a variable arity Java method or constructor

an

ldc

instruction of a

CONSTANT_MethodHandle

which resolves to a variable arity Java method or constructor

**Returns:** true if this method handle accepts more than one arity of plain, inexact

invoke

calls

asFixedArity

```java
public
MethodHandle
asFixedArity()
```

Makes a

fixed arity

method handle which is otherwise
equivalent to the current method handle.

If the current method handle is not of

variable arity

,
the current method handle is returned.
This is true even if the current method handle
could not be a valid input to

asVarargsCollector

.

Otherwise, the resulting fixed-arity method handle has the same
type and behavior of the current method handle,
except that

isVarargsCollector

will be false.
The fixed-arity method handle may (or may not) be the
a previous argument to

asVarargsCollector

.

Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:

```java
MethodHandle asListVar = publicLookup()
.findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class))
.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
MethodHandle asListFix = asListVar.asFixedArity();
assertEquals("[1]", asListVar.invoke(1).toString());
Exception caught = null;
try { asListFix.invoke((Object)1); }
catch (Exception ex) { caught = ex; }
assert(caught instanceof ClassCastException);
assertEquals("[two, too]", asListVar.invoke("two", "too").toString());
try { asListFix.invoke("two", "too"); }
catch (Exception ex) { caught = ex; }
assert(caught instanceof WrongMethodTypeException);
Object[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asListVar.invoke(argv).toString());

bindTo

```java
public
MethodHandle
bindTo​(
Object
x)
```

Binds a value

x

to the first argument of a method handle, without invoking it.
The new method handle adapts, as its

target

,
the current method handle by binding it to the given argument.
The type of the bound handle will be
the same as the type of the target, except that a single leading
reference parameter will be omitted.

When called, the bound handle inserts the given value

x

as a new leading argument to the target. The other arguments are
also passed unchanged.
What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the bound handle.

The reference

x

must be convertible to the first parameter
type of the target.

Note:

Because method handles are immutable, the target method handle
retains its original type and behavior.

Note:

The resulting adapter is never a

variable-arity method handle

, even if the original target method handle was.

**Parameters:** x

- the value to bind to the first argument of the target
**Returns:** a new method handle which prepends the given value to the incoming
argument list, before calling the original method handle
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the target does not have a
leading parameter type that is a reference type
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if

x

cannot be converted
to the leading parameter type of the target
