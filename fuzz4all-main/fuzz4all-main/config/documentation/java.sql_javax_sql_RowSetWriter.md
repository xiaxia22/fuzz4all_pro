# Interface RowSetWriter

**Source:** `java.sql\javax\sql\RowSetWriter.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
RowSetWriter
```

An object that implements the

RowSetWriter

interface,
called a

writer

. A writer may be registered with a

RowSet

object that supports the reader/writer paradigm.

If a disconnected

RowSet

object modifies some of its data,
and it has a writer associated with it, it may be implemented so that it
calls on the writer's

writeData

method internally
to write the updates back to the data source. In order to do this, the writer
must first establish a connection with the rowset's data source.

If the data to be updated has already been changed in the data source, there
is a conflict, in which case the writer will not write
the changes to the data source. The algorithm the writer uses for preventing
or limiting conflicts depends entirely on its implementation.

**All Known Subinterfaces:** TransactionalWriter

XmlWriter

### Method Details

#### boolean writeData​(
RowSetInternal
caller)
throws
SQLException

Writes the changes in this

RowSetWriter

object's
rowset back to the data source from which it got its data.

- caller

- the

RowSet

object (1) that has implemented the

RowSetInternal

interface, (2) with which this writer is
registered, and (3) that called this method internally

**Returns:**

if the modified data was written;

false

if not, which will be the case if there is a conflict

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs
