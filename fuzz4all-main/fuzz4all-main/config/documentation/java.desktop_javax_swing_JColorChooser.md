# Class JColorChooser

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\JColorChooser.html`

### Class Description

```java
@JavaBean
(
defaultProperty
="UI",

description
="A component that supports selecting a Color.")
public class
JColorChooser

extends
JComponent

implements
Accessible
```

JColorChooser

provides a pane of controls designed to allow
a user to manipulate and select a color.
For information about using color choosers, see

How to Use Color Choosers

,
a section in

The Java Tutorial

.

This class provides three levels of API:

- A static convenience method which shows a modal color-chooser
dialog and returns the color selected by the user.

A static convenience method for creating a color-chooser dialog
where

ActionListeners

can be specified to be invoked when
the user presses one of the dialog buttons.

The ability to create instances of

JColorChooser

panes
directly (within any container).

PropertyChange

listeners
can be added to detect when the current "color" property changes.

Warning:

Swing is not thread safe. For more
information see

Swing's Threading
Policy

.

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.

- Container.addPropertyChangeListener(java.beans.PropertyChangeListener)

---

#### public void setColor​(int r,

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="Determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled.")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)

Sets the

dragEnabled

property,
which must be

true

to enable
automatic drag handling (the first part of drag and drop)
on this component.
The

transferHandler

property needs to be set
to a non-

null

value for the drag to do
anything. The default value of the

dragEnabled

property
is

false

.

When automatic drag handling is enabled,
most look and feels begin a drag-and-drop operation
when the user presses the mouse button over the preview panel.
Some look and feels might not support automatic drag and drop;
they will ignore this property. You can work around such
look and feels by modifying the component
to directly call the

exportAsDrag

method of a

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:**
- b

- the value to set the

dragEnabled

property to

**Throws:**
- HeadlessException

- if

b

is

true

and

GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()

returns

true

setDragEnabled

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false,

description
="Determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled.")
public void setDragEnabled​(boolean b)
```

Sets the

dragEnabled

property,
which must be

true

to enable
automatic drag handling (the first part of drag and drop)
on this component.
The

transferHandler

property needs to be set
to a non-

null

value for the drag to do
anything. The default value of the

dragEnabled

property
is

false

.

When automatic drag handling is enabled,
most look and feels begin a drag-and-drop operation
when the user presses the mouse button over the preview panel.
Some look and feels might not support automatic drag and drop;
they will ignore this property. You can work around such
look and feels by modifying the component
to directly call the

exportAsDrag

method of a

TransferHandler

.

**Parameters:** b

dragEnabled

property to
