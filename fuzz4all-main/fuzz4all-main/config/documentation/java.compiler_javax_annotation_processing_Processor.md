### Class Description

```java
public interface
Processor
```

The interface for an annotation processor.

Annotation processing happens in a sequence of

rounds

. On each
round, a processor may be asked to

process

a
subset of the annotations found on the source and class files
produced by a prior round. The inputs to the first round of
processing are the initial inputs to a run of the tool; these
initial inputs can be regarded as the output of a virtual zeroth
round of processing. If a processor was asked to process on a
given round, it will be asked to process on subsequent rounds,
including the last round, even if there are no annotations for it
to process. The tool infrastructure may also ask a processor to
process files generated implicitly by the tool's operation.

Each implementation of a

Processor

must provide a
public no-argument constructor to be used by tools to instantiate
the processor. The tool infrastructure will interact with classes
implementing this interface as follows:

- If an existing

Processor

object is not being used, to
create an instance of a processor the tool calls the no-arg
constructor of the processor class.

Next, the tool calls the

init

method with
an appropriate

ProcessingEnvironment

.

Afterwards, the tool calls

getSupportedAnnotationTypes

,

getSupportedOptions

, and

getSupportedSourceVersion

. These methods are only called once per
run, not on each round.

As appropriate, the tool calls the

process

method on the

Processor

object; a new

Processor

object is

not

created for each round.

If a processor object is created and used without the above
protocol being followed, then the processor's behavior is not
defined by this interface specification.

The tool uses a

discovery process

to find annotation
processors and decide whether or not they should be run. By
configuring the tool, the set of potential processors can be
controlled. For example, for a

JavaCompiler

the list of candidate processors to run can be

set directly

or controlled by a

search path

used for a

service-style

lookup. Other tool implementations may have different
configuration mechanisms, such as command line options; for
details, refer to the particular tool's documentation. Which
processors the tool asks to

run

is a function
of the types of the annotations

present

on the

root elements

, what

annotation types a processor
supports

, and whether or not a processor

claims the annotation types it processes

. A processor will be asked to
process a subset of the annotation types it supports, possibly an
empty set.

For a given round, the tool computes the set of annotation types
that are present on the elements enclosed within the root elements.
If there is at least one annotation type present, then as
processors claim annotation types, they are removed from the set of
unmatched annotation types. When the set is empty or no more
processors are available, the round has run to completion. If
there are no annotation types present, annotation processing still
occurs but only

universal processors

which support
processing all annotation types,

"*"

, can claim the (empty)
set of annotation types.

An annotation type is considered present if there is at least
one annotation of that type present on an element enclosed within
the root elements of a round. For this purpose, a type parameter is
considered to be enclosed by its

generic
element

.

For this purpose, a package element is

not

considered to
enclose the top-level types within that package. (A root element
representing a package is created when a

package-info

file
is processed.) Likewise, for this purpose, a module element is

not

considered to enclose the packages within that
module. (A root element representing a module is created when a

module-info

file is processed.)

Annotations on

type uses

, as opposed to
annotations on elements, are ignored when computing whether or not
an annotation type is present.

An annotation is present if it meets the definition of being
present given in

AnnotatedConstruct

. In brief, an
annotation is considered present for the purposes of discovery if
it is directly present or present via inheritance. An annotation is

not

considered present by virtue of being wrapped by a
container annotation. Operationally, this is equivalent to an
annotation being present on an element if and only if it would be
included in the results of

Elements.getAllAnnotationMirrors(Element)

called on that element. Since
annotations inside container annotations are not considered
present, to properly process

repeatable annotation types

,
processors are advised to include both the repeatable annotation
type and its containing annotation type in the set of

supported annotation types

of a
processor.

Note that if a processor supports

"*"

and returns

true

, all annotations are claimed. Therefore, a universal
processor being used to, for example, implement additional validity
checks should return

false

so as to not prevent other such
checkers from being able to run.

If a processor throws an uncaught exception, the tool may cease
other active annotation processors. If a processor raises an
error, the current round will run to completion and the subsequent
round will indicate an

error was raised

. Since annotation processors are run in a
cooperative environment, a processor should throw an uncaught
exception only in situations where no error recovery or reporting
is feasible.

The tool environment is not required to support annotation
processors that access environmental resources, either

per round

or

cross-round

, in a multi-threaded fashion.

If the methods that return configuration information about the
annotation processor return

null

, return other invalid
input, or throw an exception, the tool infrastructure must treat
this as an error condition.

To be robust when running in different tool implementations, an
annotation processor should have the following properties:

- The result of processing a given input is not a function of the presence or absence
of other inputs (orthogonality).

Processing the same input produces the same output (consistency).

Processing input

A

followed by processing input

B

is equivalent to processing

B

then

A

(commutativity)

Processing an input does not rely on the presence of the output
of other annotation processors (independence)

The

Filer

interface discusses restrictions on how
processors can operate on files.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### Set
<
String
> getSupportedOptions()

Returns the options recognized by this processor. An
implementation of the processing tool must provide a way to
pass processor-specific options distinctly from options passed
to the tool itself, see

getOptions

.

Each string returned in the set must be a period separated
sequence of

identifiers

:

A tool might use this information to determine if any
options provided by a user are unrecognized by any processor,
in which case it may wish to report a warning.

---

#### Set
<
String
> getSupportedAnnotationTypes()

Returns the names of the annotation types supported by this
processor. An element of the result may be the canonical
(fully qualified) name of a supported annotation type.
Alternately it may be of the form "

name

.*

"
representing the set of all annotation types with canonical
names beginning with "

name.

".

In either of those cases, the name of the annotation type can
be optionally preceded by a module name followed by a

"/"

character. For example, if a processor supports

"a.B"

, this can include multiple annotation types named

a.B

which reside in different modules. To only support

a.B

in the

Foo

module, instead use

"Foo/a.B"

.

If a module name is included, only an annotation in that module
is matched. In particular, if a module name is given in an
environment where modules are not supported, such as an
annotation processing environment configured for a

source version

without modules, then the annotation types with
a module name do

not

match.

Finally,

"*"

by itself represents the set of all
annotation types, including the empty set. Note that a
processor should not claim

"*"

unless it is actually
processing all files; claiming unnecessary annotations may
cause a performance slowdown in some environments.

Each string returned in the set must be accepted by the
following grammar:

where

TypeName

and

ModuleName

are as defined in

The Java™ Language Specification

.

---

#### SourceVersion
getSupportedSourceVersion()

Returns the latest source version supported by this annotation
processor.

**Returns:**
- the latest source version supported by this annotation
processor.

**See Also:**
- SupportedSourceVersion

,

ProcessingEnvironment.getSourceVersion()

---

#### void init​(
ProcessingEnvironment
processingEnv)

Initializes the processor with the processing environment.

**Parameters:**
- processingEnv

- environment for facilities the tool framework
provides to the processor

---

#### boolean process​(
Set
<? extends
TypeElement
> annotations,

RoundEnvironment
roundEnv)

Processes a set of annotation types on type elements
originating from the prior round and returns whether or not
these annotation types are claimed by this processor. If

true

is returned, the annotation types are claimed and subsequent
processors will not be asked to process them; if

false

is returned, the annotation types are unclaimed and subsequent
processors may be asked to process them. A processor may
always return the same boolean value or may vary the result
based on its own chosen criteria.

The input set will be empty if the processor supports

"*"

and the root elements have no annotations. A

Processor

must gracefully handle an empty set of annotations.

**Parameters:**
- annotations

- the annotation types requested to be processed
- roundEnv

- environment for information about the current and prior round

**Returns:**
- whether or not the set of annotation types are claimed by this processor

---

#### Iterable
<? extends
Completion
> getCompletions​(
Element
element,

AnnotationMirror
annotation,

ExecutableElement
member,

String
userText)

Returns to the tool infrastructure an iterable of suggested
completions to an annotation. Since completions are being asked
for, the information provided about the annotation may be
incomplete, as if for a source code fragment. A processor may
return an empty iterable. Annotation processors should focus
their efforts on providing completions for annotation members
with additional validity constraints known to the processor, for
example an

int

member whose value should lie between 1
and 10 or a string member that should be recognized by a known
grammar, such as a regular expression or a URL.

Since incomplete programs are being modeled, some of the
parameters may only have partial information or may be

null

. At least one of

element

and

userText

must be non-

null

. If

element

is non-

null

,

annotation

and

member

may be

null

. Processors may not throw a

NullPointerException

if some parameters are

null

; if a processor has no
completions to offer based on the provided information, an
empty iterable can be returned. The processor may also return
a single completion with an empty value string and a message
describing why there are no completions.

Completions are informative and may reflect additional
validity checks performed by annotation processors. For
example, consider the simple annotation:

```java
@MersennePrime {
int value();
}
```

(A Mersenne prime is prime number of the form
2

n

- 1.) Given an

AnnotationMirror

for this annotation type, a list of all such primes in the

int

range could be returned without examining any other
arguments to

getCompletions

:

```java
import static javax.annotation.processing.Completions.*;
...
return Arrays.asList(
of
("3"),
of("7"),
of("31"),
of("127"),
of("8191"),
of("131071"),
of("524287"),
of("2147483647"));
```

A more informative set of completions would include the number
of each prime:

```java
return Arrays.asList(
of
("3", "M2"),
of("7", "M3"),
of("31", "M5"),
of("127", "M7"),
of("8191", "M13"),
of("131071", "M17"),
of("524287", "M19"),
of("2147483647", "M31"));
```

However, if the

userText

is available, it can be checked
to see if only a subset of the Mersenne primes are valid. For
example, if the user has typed

@MersennePrime(1

the value of

userText

will be

"1"

; and only
two of the primes are possible completions:

```java
return Arrays.asList(of("127", "M7"),
of("131071", "M17"));
```

Sometimes no valid completion is possible. For example, there
is no in-range Mersenne prime starting with 9:

@MersennePrime(9

An appropriate response in this case is to either return an
empty list of completions,

```java
return Collections.emptyList();
```

or a single empty completion with a helpful message

```java
return Arrays.asList(of("", "No in-range Mersenne primes start with 9"));
```

**Parameters:**
- element

- the element being annotated
- annotation

- the (perhaps partial) annotation being
applied to the element
- member

- the annotation member to return possible completions for
- userText

- source code text to be completed

**Returns:**
- suggested completions to the annotation

```java
public interface
Processor
```

The interface for an annotation processor.

Annotation processing happens in a sequence of

rounds

. On each
round, a processor may be asked to

process

a
subset of the annotations found on the source and class files
produced by a prior round. The inputs to the first round of
processing are the initial inputs to a run of the tool; these
initial inputs can be regarded as the output of a virtual zeroth
round of processing. If a processor was asked to process on a
given round, it will be asked to process on subsequent rounds,
including the last round, even if there are no annotations for it
to process. The tool infrastructure may also ask a processor to
process files generated implicitly by the tool's operation.

Each implementation of a

Processor

must provide a
public no-argument constructor to be used by tools to instantiate
the processor. The tool infrastructure will interact with classes
implementing this interface as follows:

- If an existing

Processor

object is not being used, to
create an instance of a processor the tool calls the no-arg
constructor of the processor class.

Next, the tool calls the

init

method with
an appropriate

ProcessingEnvironment

.

Afterwards, the tool calls

getSupportedAnnotationTypes

,

getSupportedOptions

, and

getSupportedSourceVersion

. These methods are only called once per
run, not on each round.

As appropriate, the tool calls the

process

method on the

Processor

object; a new

Processor

object is

not

created for each round.

If a processor object is created and used without the above
protocol being followed, then the processor's behavior is not
defined by this interface specification.

The tool uses a

discovery process

to find annotation
processors and decide whether or not they should be run. By
configuring the tool, the set of potential processors can be
controlled. For example, for a

JavaCompiler

the list of candidate processors to run can be

set directly

or controlled by a

lookup. Other tool implementations may have different
configuration mechanisms, such as command line options; for
details, refer to the particular tool's documentation. Which
processors the tool asks to

run

is a function
of the types of the annotations

present

on the

root elements

, what

annotation types a processor
supports

, and whether or not a processor

claims the annotation types it processes

. A processor will be asked to
process a subset of the annotation types it supports, possibly an
empty set.

For a given round, the tool computes the set of annotation types
that are present on the elements enclosed within the root elements.
If there is at least one annotation type present, then as
processors claim annotation types, they are removed from the set of
unmatched annotation types. When the set is empty or no more
processors are available, the round has run to completion. If
there are no annotation types present, annotation processing still
occurs but only

universal processors

which support
processing all annotation types,

"*"

, can claim the (empty)
set of annotation types.

An annotation type is considered present if there is at least
one annotation of that type present on an element enclosed within
the root elements of a round. For this purpose, a type parameter is
considered to be enclosed by its

generic
element

.

For this purpose, a package element is

not

considered to
enclose the top-level types within that package. (A root element
representing a package is created when a

package-info

file
is processed.) Likewise, for this purpose, a module element is

not

considered to enclose the packages within that
module. (A root element representing a module is created when a

module-info

file is processed.)

Annotations on

type uses

, as opposed to
annotations on elements, are ignored when computing whether or not
an annotation type is present.

An annotation is present if it meets the definition of being

it is directly present or present via inheritance. An annotation is

not

considered present by virtue of being wrapped by a

annotation being present on an element if and only if it would be
included in the results of

annotations inside container annotations are not considered
present, to properly process

repeatable annotation types

,
processors are advised to include both the repeatable annotation
type and its containing annotation type in the set of

supported annotation types

of a

Note that if a processor supports

"*"

and returns

true

, all annotations are claimed. Therefore, a universal
processor being used to, for example, implement additional validity
checks should return

false

so as to not prevent other such
checkers from being able to run.

If a processor throws an uncaught exception, the tool may cease
other active annotation processors. If a processor raises an
error, the current round will run to completion and the subsequent
round will indicate an

error was raised

. Since annotation processors are run in a
cooperative environment, a processor should throw an uncaught

As appropriate, the tool calls the

Processor

object; a new

Processor

For a given round, the tool computes the set of annotation types
that are present on the elements enclosed within the root elements.
If there is at least one annotation type present, then as

An annotation type is considered present if there is at least

For this purpose, a package element is

of other inputs (orthogonality).

Processing the same input produces the same output (consistency).

Processing input

B

is equivalent to processing

B

(commutativity)

Processing an input does not rely on the presence of the output
of other annotation processors (independence)

The

Filer

interface discusses restrictions on how
processors can operate on files.

Each implementation of a

Processor

must provide a
public no-argument constructor to be used by tools to instantiate
the processor. The tool infrastructure will interact with classes
implementing this interface as follows:

- If an existing

Processor

object is not being used, to
create an instance of a processor the tool calls the no-arg
constructor of the processor class.

Next, the tool calls the

init

method with
an appropriate

ProcessingEnvironment

.

Afterwards, the tool calls

getSupportedAnnotationTypes

,

getSupportedOptions

, and

getSupportedSourceVersion

. These methods are only called once per
run, not on each round.

As appropriate, the tool calls the

process

method on the

Processor

object; a new

Processor

object is

not

created for each round.

If a processor object is created and used without the above
protocol being followed, then the processor's behavior is not
defined by this interface specification.

The tool uses a

discovery process

to find annotation
processors and decide whether or not they should be run. By
configuring the tool, the set of potential processors can be
controlled. For example, for a

JavaCompiler

the list of candidate processors to run can be

set directly

or controlled by a

search path

used for a

service-style

lookup. Other tool implementations may have different
configuration mechanisms, such as command line options; for
details, refer to the particular tool's documentation. Which
processors the tool asks to

run

is a function
of the types of the annotations

present

on the

root elements

, what

annotation types a processor
supports

, and whether or not a processor

claims the annotation types it processes

. A processor will be asked to
process a subset of the annotation types it supports, possibly an
empty set.

For a given round, the tool computes the set of annotation types
that are present on the elements enclosed within the root elements.
If there is at least one annotation type present, then as
processors claim annotation types, they are removed from the set of
unmatched annotation types. When the set is empty or no more
processors are available, the round has run to completion. If
there are no annotation types present, annotation processing still
occurs but only

universal processors

which support
processing all annotation types,

"*"

, can claim the (empty)
set of annotation types.

An annotation type is considered present if there is at least
one annotation of that type present on an element enclosed within
the root elements of a round. For this purpose, a type parameter is
considered to be enclosed by its

generic
element

.

For this purpose, a package element is

not

considered to
enclose the top-level types within that package. (A root element
representing a package is created when a

package-info

file
is processed.) Likewise, for this purpose, a module element is

not

considered to enclose the packages within that
module. (A root element representing a module is created when a

module-info

file is processed.)

Annotations on

type uses

, as opposed to
annotations on elements, are ignored when computing whether or not
an annotation type is present.

An annotation is present if it meets the definition of being
present given in

AnnotatedConstruct

. In brief, an
annotation is considered present for the purposes of discovery if
it is directly present or present via inheritance. An annotation is

not

considered present by virtue of being wrapped by a
container annotation. Operationally, this is equivalent to an
annotation being present on an element if and only if it would be
included in the results of

Elements.getAllAnnotationMirrors(Element)

called on that element. Since
annotations inside container annotations are not considered
present, to properly process

repeatable annotation types

,
processors are advised to include both the repeatable annotation
type and its containing annotation type in the set of

supported annotation types

of a
processor.

Note that if a processor supports

"*"

and returns

true

, all annotations are claimed. Therefore, a universal
processor being used to, for example, implement additional validity
checks should return

false

so as to not prevent other such
checkers from being able to run.

If a processor throws an uncaught exception, the tool may cease
other active annotation processors. If a processor raises an
error, the current round will run to completion and the subsequent
round will indicate an

error was raised

. Since annotation processors are run in a
cooperative environment, a processor should throw an uncaught
exception only in situations where no error recovery or reporting
is feasible.

The tool environment is not required to support annotation
processors that access environmental resources, either

per round

or

cross-round

, in a multi-threaded fashion.

If the methods that return configuration information about the
annotation processor return

null

, return other invalid
input, or throw an exception, the tool infrastructure must treat
this as an error condition.

To be robust when running in different tool implementations, an
annotation processor should have the following properties:

- The result of processing a given input is not a function of the presence or absence
of other inputs (orthogonality).

Processing the same input produces the same output (consistency).

#### Method Summary

Returns to the tool infrastructure an iterable of suggested
completions to an annotation.

Returns the names of the annotation types supported by this
processor.

Returns the options recognized by this processor.

Returns the latest source version supported by this annotation
processor.

Initializes the processor with the processing environment.

Processes a set of annotation types on type elements
originating from the prior round and returns whether or not
these annotation types are claimed by this processor.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getSupportedOptions

```java
Set
<
String
> getSupportedOptions()
```

Returns the options recognized by this processor. An
implementation of the processing tool must provide a way to
pass processor-specific options distinctly from options passed
to the tool itself, see

getOptions

.

Each string returned in the set must be a period separated
sequence of

identifiers

:

A tool might use this information to determine if any
options provided by a user are unrecognized by any processor,
in which case it may wish to report a warning.

**Returns:** the options recognized by this processor or an
empty collection if none
**See Also:** SupportedOptions

- getSupportedAnnotationTypes

```java
Set
<
String
> getSupportedAnnotationTypes()
```

Returns the names of the annotation types supported by this
processor. An element of the result may be the canonical
(fully qualified) name of a supported annotation type.
Alternately it may be of the form "

name

.*

"
representing the set of all annotation types with canonical
names beginning with "

name.

".

In either of those cases, the name of the annotation type can
be optionally preceded by a module name followed by a

"/"

character. For example, if a processor supports

"a.B"

, this can include multiple annotation types named

a.B

which reside in different modules. To only support

a.B

in the

Foo

module, instead use

"Foo/a.B"

.

If a module name is included, only an annotation in that module
is matched. In particular, if a module name is given in an
environment where modules are not supported, such as an
annotation processing environment configured for a

source version

without modules, then the annotation types with
a module name do

not

match.

Finally,

"*"

by itself represents the set of all
annotation types, including the empty set. Note that a
processor should not claim

"*"

unless it is actually
processing all files; claiming unnecessary annotations may
cause a performance slowdown in some environments.

Each string returned in the set must be accepted by the
following grammar:

where

TypeName

and

ModuleName

are as defined in

The Java™ Language Specification

.

**API Note:** When running in an environment which supports modules,
processors are encouraged to include the module prefix when
describing their supported annotation types. The method

AbstractProcessor.getSupportedAnnotationTypes

provides support
for stripping off the module prefix when running in an
environment without modules.
**Returns:** the names of the annotation types supported by this processor
**See Also:** SupportedAnnotationTypes
**See The Java™ Language Specification :** 3.8 Identifiers, 6.5 Determining the Meaning of a Name

- getSupportedSourceVersion

```java
SourceVersion
getSupportedSourceVersion()
```

Returns the latest source version supported by this annotation
processor.

**Returns:** the latest source version supported by this annotation
processor.
**See Also:** SupportedSourceVersion

,

ProcessingEnvironment.getSourceVersion()

- init

```java
void init​(
ProcessingEnvironment
processingEnv)
```

Initializes the processor with the processing environment.

**Parameters:** processingEnv

- environment for facilities the tool framework
provides to the processor

- process

```java
boolean process​(
Set
<? extends
TypeElement
> annotations,

RoundEnvironment
roundEnv)
```

Processes a set of annotation types on type elements
originating from the prior round and returns whether or not
these annotation types are claimed by this processor. If

true

is returned, the annotation types are claimed and subsequent
processors will not be asked to process them; if

false

is returned, the annotation types are unclaimed and subsequent
processors may be asked to process them. A processor may
always return the same boolean value or may vary the result
based on its own chosen criteria.

The input set will be empty if the processor supports

"*"

and the root elements have no annotations. A

Processor

must gracefully handle an empty set of annotations.

**Parameters:** annotations

- the annotation types requested to be processed
**Parameters:** roundEnv

- environment for information about the current and prior round
**Returns:** whether or not the set of annotation types are claimed by this processor

- getCompletions

```java
Iterable
<? extends
Completion
> getCompletions​(
Element
element,

AnnotationMirror
annotation,

ExecutableElement
member,

String
userText)
```

Returns to the tool infrastructure an iterable of suggested
completions to an annotation. Since completions are being asked
for, the information provided about the annotation may be
incomplete, as if for a source code fragment. A processor may
return an empty iterable. Annotation processors should focus
their efforts on providing completions for annotation members
with additional validity constraints known to the processor, for
example an

int

member whose value should lie between 1
and 10 or a string member that should be recognized by a known
grammar, such as a regular expression or a URL.

Since incomplete programs are being modeled, some of the
parameters may only have partial information or may be

null

. At least one of

element

and

userText

must be non-

null

. If

element

is non-

null

,

annotation

and

member

may be

null

. Processors may not throw a

NullPointerException

if some parameters are

null

; if a processor has no
completions to offer based on the provided information, an
empty iterable can be returned. The processor may also return
a single completion with an empty value string and a message
describing why there are no completions.

Completions are informative and may reflect additional
validity checks performed by annotation processors. For
example, consider the simple annotation:

```java
@MersennePrime {
int value();
}
```

(A Mersenne prime is prime number of the form
2

n

- 1.) Given an

AnnotationMirror

for this annotation type, a list of all such primes in the

int

range could be returned without examining any other
arguments to

getCompletions

:

```java
import static javax.annotation.processing.Completions.*;
...
return Arrays.asList(
of
("3"),
of("7"),
of("31"),
of("127"),
of("8191"),
of("131071"),
of("524287"),
of("2147483647"));
```

A more informative set of completions would include the number
of each prime:

```java
return Arrays.asList(
of
("3", "M2"),
of("7", "M3"),
of("31", "M5"),
of("127", "M7"),
of("8191", "M13"),
of("131071", "M17"),
of("524287", "M19"),
of("2147483647", "M31"));
```

However, if the

userText

is available, it can be checked
to see if only a subset of the Mersenne primes are valid. For
example, if the user has typed

@MersennePrime(1

the value of

userText

will be

"1"

; and only
two of the primes are possible completions:

```java
return Arrays.asList(of("127", "M7"),
of("131071", "M17"));
```

Sometimes no valid completion is possible. For example, there
is no in-range Mersenne prime starting with 9:

@MersennePrime(9

An appropriate response in this case is to either return an
empty list of completions,

```java
return Collections.emptyList();
```

or a single empty completion with a helpful message

```java
return Arrays.asList(of("", "No in-range Mersenne primes start with 9"));
```

**Parameters:** element

- the element being annotated
**Parameters:** annotation

- the (perhaps partial) annotation being
applied to the element
**Parameters:** member

- the annotation member to return possible completions for
**Parameters:** userText

- source code text to be completed
**Returns:** suggested completions to the annotation

Method Detail

- getSupportedOptions

```java
Set
<
String
> getSupportedOptions()
```

Returns the options recognized by this processor. An
implementation of the processing tool must provide a way to
pass processor-specific options distinctly from options passed
to the tool itself, see

getOptions

.

Each string returned in the set must be a period separated
sequence of

identifiers

:

A tool might use this information to determine if any
options provided by a user are unrecognized by any processor,
in which case it may wish to report a warning.

**Returns:** the options recognized by this processor or an
empty collection if none
**See Also:** SupportedOptions

- getSupportedAnnotationTypes

```java
Set
<
String
> getSupportedAnnotationTypes()
```

Returns the names of the annotation types supported by this
processor. An element of the result may be the canonical
(fully qualified) name of a supported annotation type.
Alternately it may be of the form "

name

.*

"
representing the set of all annotation types with canonical
names beginning with "

name.

".

In either of those cases, the name of the annotation type can
be optionally preceded by a module name followed by a

"/"

character. For example, if a processor supports

"a.B"

, this can include multiple annotation types named

a.B

which reside in different modules. To only support

a.B

in the

Foo

module, instead use

"Foo/a.B"

.

If a module name is included, only an annotation in that module
is matched. In particular, if a module name is given in an
environment where modules are not supported, such as an
annotation processing environment configured for a

source version

without modules, then the annotation types with
a module name do

not

match.

Finally,

"*"

by itself represents the set of all
annotation types, including the empty set. Note that a
processor should not claim

"*"

unless it is actually
processing all files; claiming unnecessary annotations may
cause a performance slowdown in some environments.

Each string returned in the set must be accepted by the
following grammar:

where

TypeName

and

ModuleName

are as defined in

The Java™ Language Specification

.

**API Note:** When running in an environment which supports modules,
processors are encouraged to include the module prefix when
describing their supported annotation types. The method

AbstractProcessor.getSupportedAnnotationTypes

provides support
for stripping off the module prefix when running in an
environment without modules.
**Returns:** the names of the annotation types supported by this processor
**See Also:** SupportedAnnotationTypes
**See The Java™ Language Specification :** 3.8 Identifiers, 6.5 Determining the Meaning of a Name

- getSupportedSourceVersion

```java
SourceVersion
getSupportedSourceVersion()
```

Returns the latest source version supported by this annotation
processor.

**Returns:** the latest source version supported by this annotation
processor.
**See Also:** SupportedSourceVersion

,

ProcessingEnvironment.getSourceVersion()

- init

```java
void init​(
ProcessingEnvironment
processingEnv)
```

Initializes the processor with the processing environment.

**Parameters:** processingEnv

- environment for facilities the tool framework
provides to the processor

- process

```java
boolean process​(
Set
<? extends
TypeElement
> annotations,

RoundEnvironment
roundEnv)
```

Processes a set of annotation types on type elements
originating from the prior round and returns whether or not
these annotation types are claimed by this processor. If

true

is returned, the annotation types are claimed and subsequent
processors will not be asked to process them; if

false

is returned, the annotation types are unclaimed and subsequent
processors may be asked to process them. A processor may
always return the same boolean value or may vary the result
based on its own chosen criteria.

The input set will be empty if the processor supports

"*"

and the root elements have no annotations. A

Processor

must gracefully handle an empty set of annotations.

**Parameters:** annotations

- the annotation types requested to be processed
**Parameters:** roundEnv

- environment for information about the current and prior round
**Returns:** whether or not the set of annotation types are claimed by this processor

- getCompletions

```java
Iterable
<? extends
Completion
> getCompletions​(
Element
element,

AnnotationMirror
annotation,

ExecutableElement
member,

String
userText)
```

Returns to the tool infrastructure an iterable of suggested
completions to an annotation. Since completions are being asked
for, the information provided about the annotation may be
incomplete, as if for a source code fragment. A processor may
return an empty iterable. Annotation processors should focus
their efforts on providing completions for annotation members
with additional validity constraints known to the processor, for
example an

int

member whose value should lie between 1
and 10 or a string member that should be recognized by a known
grammar, such as a regular expression or a URL.

Since incomplete programs are being modeled, some of the
parameters may only have partial information or may be

null

. At least one of

element

and

userText

must be non-

null

. If

element

is non-

null

,

annotation

and

member

may be

null

. Processors may not throw a

NullPointerException

if some parameters are

null

; if a processor has no
completions to offer based on the provided information, an
empty iterable can be returned. The processor may also return
a single completion with an empty value string and a message
describing why there are no completions.

Completions are informative and may reflect additional
validity checks performed by annotation processors. For
example, consider the simple annotation:

```java
@MersennePrime {
int value();
}
```

(A Mersenne prime is prime number of the form
2

n

- 1.) Given an

AnnotationMirror

for this annotation type, a list of all such primes in the

int

range could be returned without examining any other
arguments to

getCompletions

:

```java
import static javax.annotation.processing.Completions.*;
...
return Arrays.asList(
of
("3"),
of("7"),
of("31"),
of("127"),
of("8191"),
of("131071"),
of("524287"),
of("2147483647"));
```

A more informative set of completions would include the number
of each prime:

```java
return Arrays.asList(
of
("3", "M2"),
of("7", "M3"),
of("31", "M5"),
of("127", "M7"),
of("8191", "M13"),
of("131071", "M17"),
of("524287", "M19"),
of("2147483647", "M31"));
```

However, if the

userText

is available, it can be checked
to see if only a subset of the Mersenne primes are valid. For
example, if the user has typed

@MersennePrime(1

the value of

userText

will be

"1"

; and only
two of the primes are possible completions:

```java
return Arrays.asList(of("127", "M7"),
of("131071", "M17"));
```

Sometimes no valid completion is possible. For example, there
is no in-range Mersenne prime starting with 9:

@MersennePrime(9

An appropriate response in this case is to either return an
empty list of completions,

```java
return Collections.emptyList();
```

or a single empty completion with a helpful message

```java
return Arrays.asList(of("", "No in-range Mersenne primes start with 9"));
```

**Parameters:** element

- the element being annotated
**Parameters:** annotation

- the (perhaps partial) annotation being
applied to the element
**Parameters:** member

- the annotation member to return possible completions for
**Parameters:** userText

- source code text to be completed
**Returns:** suggested completions to the annotation

character. For example, if a processor supports

"a.B"

, this can include multiple annotation types named

a.B

which reside in different modules. To only support

a.B

in the

Foo

module, instead use

"Foo/a.B"

If a module name is included, only an annotation in that module
is matched. In particular, if a module name is given in an
environment where modules are not supported, such as an
annotation processing environment configured for a

Finally,

"*"

by itself represents the set of all
annotation types, including the empty set. Note that a

processing all files; claiming unnecessary annotations may
cause a performance slowdown in some environments.
