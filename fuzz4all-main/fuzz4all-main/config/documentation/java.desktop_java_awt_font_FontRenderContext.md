# Class FontRenderContext

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\font\FontRenderContext.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
FontRenderContext

extends
Object
```

The

FontRenderContext

class is a container for the
information needed to correctly measure text. The measurement of text
can vary because of rules that map outlines to pixels, and rendering
hints provided by an application.

One such piece of information is a transform that scales
typographical points to pixels. (A point is defined to be exactly 1/72
of an inch, which is slightly different than
the traditional mechanical measurement of a point.) A character that
is rendered at 12pt on a 600dpi device might have a different size
than the same character rendered at 12pt on a 72dpi device because of
such factors as rounding to pixel boundaries and hints that the font
designer may have specified.

Anti-aliasing and Fractional-metrics specified by an application can also
affect the size of a character because of rounding to pixel
boundaries.

Typically, instances of

FontRenderContext

are
obtained from a

Graphics2D

object. A

FontRenderContext

which is directly constructed will
most likely not represent any actual graphics device, and may lead
to unexpected or incorrect results.

### Constructor Details

#### protected FontRenderContext()

Constructs a new

FontRenderContext

object.

---

#### public FontRenderContext​(
AffineTransform
tx,
boolean isAntiAliased,
boolean usesFractionalMetrics)

Constructs a

FontRenderContext

object from an
optional

AffineTransform

and two

boolean

values that determine if the newly constructed object has
anti-aliasing or fractional metrics.
In each case the boolean values

true

and

false

correspond to the rendering hint values

ON

and

OFF

respectively.

To specify other hint values, use the constructor which
specifies the rendering hint values as parameters :

FontRenderContext(AffineTransform, Object, Object)

.

**Parameters:**
- tx

- the transform which is used to scale typographical points
to pixels in this

FontRenderContext

. If null, an
identity transform is used.
- isAntiAliased

- determines if the newly constructed object
has anti-aliasing.
- usesFractionalMetrics

- determines if the newly constructed
object has fractional metrics.
