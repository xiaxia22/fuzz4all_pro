# Class Polygon

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\Polygon.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Polygon

extends
Object

implements
Shape
,
Serializable
```

The

Polygon

class encapsulates a description of a
closed, two-dimensional region within a coordinate space. This
region is bounded by an arbitrary number of line segments, each of
which is one side of the polygon. Internally, a polygon
comprises of a list of

(x,y)

coordinate pairs, where each pair defines a

vertex

of the
polygon, and two successive pairs are the endpoints of a
line that is a side of the polygon. The first and final
pairs of

(x,y)

points are joined by a line segment
that closes the polygon. This

Polygon

is defined with
an even-odd winding rule. See

WIND_EVEN_ODD

for a definition of the even-odd winding rule.
This class's hit-testing methods, which include the

contains

,

intersects

and

inside

methods, use the

insideness

definition described in the

Shape

class comments.

### Field Details

#### public int npoints

The total number of points. The value of

npoints

represents the number of valid points in this

Polygon

and might be less than the number of elements in

xpoints

or

ypoints

.
This value can be 0.

**See Also:**
- addPoint(int, int)

**Since:**
- 1.0

---

#### public int[] xpoints

The array of X coordinates. The number of elements in
this array might be more than the number of X coordinates
in this

Polygon

. The extra elements allow new points
to be added to this

Polygon

without re-creating this
array. The value of

npoints

is equal to the
number of valid points in this

Polygon

.

**See Also:**
- addPoint(int, int)

**Since:**
- 1.0

---

#### public int[] ypoints

The array of Y coordinates. The number of elements in
this array might be more than the number of Y coordinates
in this

Polygon

. The extra elements allow new points
to be added to this

Polygon

without re-creating this
array. The value of

npoints

is equal to the
number of valid points in this

Polygon

.

**See Also:**
- addPoint(int, int)

**Since:**
- 1.0

---

#### protected
Rectangle
bounds

The bounds of this

Polygon

.
This value can be null.

**See Also:**
- getBoundingBox()

,

getBounds()

**Since:**
- 1.0

---

### Constructor Details

#### public Polygon()

Creates an empty polygon.

**Since:**
- 1.0

---

#### public Polygon​(int[] xpoints,
int[] ypoints,
int npoints)

Constructs and initializes a

Polygon

from the specified
parameters.

**Parameters:**
- xpoints

- an array of X coordinates
- ypoints

- an array of Y coordinates
- npoints

- the total number of points in the

Polygon

**Throws:**
- NegativeArraySizeException

- if the value of

npoints

is negative.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

npoints

is
greater than the length of

xpoints

or the length of

ypoints

.
- NullPointerException

- if

xpoints

or

ypoints

is

null

.

**Since:**
- 1.0

---

### Method Details

#### public void reset()

Resets this

Polygon

object to an empty polygon.
The coordinate arrays and the data in them are left untouched
but the number of points is reset to zero to mark the old
vertex data as invalid and to start accumulating new vertex
data at the beginning.
All internally-cached data relating to the old vertices
are discarded.
Note that since the coordinate arrays from before the reset
are reused, creating a new empty

Polygon

might
be more memory efficient than resetting the current one if
the number of vertices in the new polygon data is significantly
smaller than the number of vertices in the data from before the
reset.

**See Also:**
- invalidate()

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public void invalidate()

Invalidates or flushes any internally-cached data that depends
on the vertex coordinates of this

Polygon

.
This method should be called after any direct manipulation
of the coordinates in the

xpoints

or

ypoints

arrays to avoid inconsistent results
from methods such as

getBounds

or

contains

that might cache data from earlier computations relating to
the vertex coordinates.

**See Also:**
- getBounds()

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public void translate​(int deltaX,
int deltaY)

Translates the vertices of the

Polygon

by

deltaX

along the x axis and by

deltaY

along the y axis.

**Parameters:**
- deltaX

- the amount to translate along the X axis
- deltaY

- the amount to translate along the Y axis

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### public void addPoint​(int x,
int y)

Appends the specified coordinates to this

Polygon

.

If an operation that calculates the bounding box of this

Polygon

has already been performed, such as

getBounds

or

contains

, then this
method updates the bounding box.

**Parameters:**
- x

- the specified X coordinate
- y

- the specified Y coordinate

**See Also:**
- getBounds()

,

contains(java.awt.Point)

**Since:**
- 1.0

---

#### public
Rectangle
getBounds()

Polygon

.
The bounding box is the smallest

Rectangle

whose
sides are parallel to the x and y axes of the
coordinate space, and can completely contain the

Polygon

.

**Specified by:**
- getBounds

in interface

Shape

**Returns:**
- a

Rectangle

that defines the bounds of this

Polygon

.

**See Also:**
- Shape.getBounds2D()

**Since:**
- 1.1

---

#### @Deprecated

public

Polygon

.

**Returns:**
- the bounds of this

Polygon

.

**Since:**
- 1.0

---

#### public boolean contains​(
Point
p)

Determines whether the specified

Point

is inside this

Polygon

.

**Parameters:**
- p

- the specified

Point

to be tested

---

#### public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Specified by:**
- getBounds2D

in interface

Shape

**Returns:**
- an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

Shape

.

**See Also:**
- Shape.getBounds()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean contains​(double x,
double y)

Tests if the specified coordinates are inside the boundary of the

Shape

, as described by the

definition of insideness

.

**Specified by:**
- contains

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- x

- the specified X coordinate to be tested
- y

- the specified Y coordinate to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified coordinates are inside
the

Shape

boundary;

false

otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean contains​(
Point2D
p)

Tests if a specified

Point2D

is inside the boundary
of the

Shape

, as described by the

definition of insideness

.

**Specified by:**
- contains

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- p

- the specified

Point2D

to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified

Point2D

is
inside the boundary of the

Shape

;

false

otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean intersects​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified rectangular area.
The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Specified by:**
- intersects

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- w

- the width of the specified rectangular area
- h

- the height of the specified rectangular area

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

and
the interior of the rectangular area intersect, or are
both highly likely to intersect and intersection calculations
would be too expensive to perform;

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- Area

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean intersects​(
Rectangle2D
r)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified

Rectangle2D

.
The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the

Rectangle2D

and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the

Rectangle2D

does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Specified by:**
- intersects

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- r

- the specified

Rectangle2D

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

and
the interior of the specified

Rectangle2D

intersect, or are both highly likely to intersect and intersection
calculations would be too expensive to perform;

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- Shape.intersects(double, double, double, double)

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean contains​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains
the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
the rectangular area must lie within the

Shape

for the
entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the

Shape

.

The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the rectangular area are
prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the rectangular area.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Specified by:**
- contains

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- w

- the width of the specified rectangular area
- h

- the height of the specified rectangular area

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the specified rectangular area;

false

otherwise or, if the

Shape

contains the rectangular area and the

intersects

method returns

true

and the containment calculations would be too expensive to
perform.

**See Also:**
- Area

,

Shape.intersects(double, double, double, double)

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean contains​(
Rectangle2D
r)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the
specified

Rectangle2D

.
The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the

Rectangle2D

are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the

Rectangle2D

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Specified by:**
- contains

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- r

- The specified

Rectangle2D

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the

Rectangle2D

;

false

otherwise or, if the

Shape

contains the

Rectangle2D

and the

intersects

method returns

true

and the containment calculations would be too expensive to
perform.

**See Also:**
- Shape.contains(double, double, double, double)

**Since:**
- 1.2

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- reset

```java
public void reset()
```

Resets this

Polygon

object to an empty polygon.
The coordinate arrays and the data in them are left untouched
but the number of points is reset to zero to mark the old
vertex data as invalid and to start accumulating new vertex
data at the beginning.
All internally-cached data relating to the old vertices
are discarded.
Note that since the coordinate arrays from before the reset
are reused, creating a new empty

Polygon

might
be more memory efficient than resetting the current one if
the number of vertices in the new polygon data is significantly
smaller than the number of vertices in the data from before the
reset.

**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** invalidate()

- invalidate

```java
public void invalidate()
```

Invalidates or flushes any internally-cached data that depends

Rectangle

whose
sides are parallel to the x and y axes of the
coordinate space, and can completely contain the

Polygon

.

- getBounds2D

```java
public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()
```

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Specified by:** getBounds2D

- intersects

```java
public boolean intersects​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)
```

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified rectangular area.
The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Specified by:** intersects

in interface

Shape
**Parameters:** x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** w

- the width of the specified rectangular area

- contains

```java
public boolean contains​(double x,

```

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains
the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
the rectangular area must lie within the

Shape

for the
entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the

Shape

.

The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the rectangular area are
prohibitively expensive.

#### Method Detail

reset

```java
public void reset()
```

Resets this

Polygon

object to an empty polygon.
The coordinate arrays and the data in them are left untouched
but the number of points is reset to zero to mark the old
vertex data as invalid and to start accumulating new vertex
data at the beginning.
All internally-cached data relating to the old vertices
are discarded.
Note that since the coordinate arrays from before the reset
are reused, creating a new empty

Polygon

might
be more memory efficient than resetting the current one if
the number of vertices in the new polygon data is significantly
smaller than the number of vertices in the data from before the
reset.

**Since:** 1.4

the rectangular area.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the rectangular area are
prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

getPathIterator

```java
public
PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at)
```

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the boundary of this

Polygon

and provides access to the geometry
of the outline of this

Polygon

. An optional

AffineTransform

can be specified so that the coordinates
returned in the iteration are transformed accordingly.

**Specified by:** getPathIterator

in interface

Shape
**Parameters:** at

- an optional

AffineTransform

to be applied to the
coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or

null

if untransformed coordinates are desired
**Returns:** a

PathIterator

object that provides access to the
geometry of this

Polygon

.
**Since:** 1.2

coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or

null

if untransformed coordinates are desired
**Parameters:** flatness

- the maximum amount that the control points
for a given curve can vary from collinear before a subdivided
curve is replaced by a straight line connecting the
endpoints. Since polygons are already flat the

flatness

parameter is ignored.
**Returns:** a

PathIterator

object that provides access to the

Shape

object's geometry.
