# Class AttachPermission

**Source:** `jdk.attach\com\sun\tools\attach\AttachPermission.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
AttachPermission

extends
BasicPermission
```

When a

SecurityManager

set, this
is the permission which will be checked when code invokes

VirtualMachine.attach

to attach to a target virtual
machine.
This permission is also checked when an

AttachProvider

is created.

An

AttachPermission

object contains a name (also referred
to as a "target name") but no actions list; you either have the
named permission or you don't.
The following table provides a summary description of what the
permission allows, and discusses the risks of granting code the
permission.

target name, what the permission allows, and associated risks

Permission Target Name

What the Permission Allows

Risks of Allowing this Permission

attachVirtualMachine

Ability to attach to another Java virtual machine and load agents
into that VM.

This allows an attacker to control the target VM which can potentially
cause it to misbehave.

createAttachProvider

Ability to create an

AttachProvider

instance.

This allows an attacker to create an AttachProvider which can
potentially be used to attach to other Java virtual machines.

Programmers do not normally create AttachPermission objects directly.
Instead they are created by the security policy code based on reading
the security policy file.
