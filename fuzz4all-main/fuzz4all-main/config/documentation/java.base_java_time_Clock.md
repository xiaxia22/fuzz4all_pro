# Class Clock

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\Clock.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Clock

extends
Object
```

A clock providing access to the current instant, date and time using a time-zone.

Instances of this class are used to find the current instant, which can be
interpreted using the stored time-zone to find the current date and time.
As such, a clock can be used instead of

System.currentTimeMillis()

and

TimeZone.getDefault()

.

Use of a

Clock

is optional. All key date-time classes also have a

now()

factory method that uses the system clock in the default time zone.
The primary purpose of this abstraction is to allow alternate clocks to be
plugged in as and when required. Applications use an object to obtain the
current time rather than a static method. This can simplify testing.

Best practice for applications is to pass a

Clock

into any method
that requires the current instant. A dependency injection framework is one
way to achieve this:

```java
public class MyBean {
private Clock clock; // dependency inject
...
public void process(LocalDate eventDate) {
if (eventDate.isBefore(LocalDate.now(clock)) {
...
}
}
}
```

This approach allows an alternate clock, such as

fixed

or

offset

to be used during testing.

The

system

factory methods provide clocks based on the best available
system clock This may use

System.currentTimeMillis()

, or a higher
resolution clock if one is available.

**Implementation Requirements:** This abstract class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.

The principal methods are defined to allow the throwing of an exception.
In normal use, no exceptions will be thrown, however one possible implementation would be to
obtain the time from a central time server across the network. Obviously, in this case the
lookup could fail, and so the method is permitted to throw an exception.

The returned instants from

Clock

work on a time-scale that ignores leap seconds,
as described in

Instant

. If the implementation wraps a source that provides leap
second information, then a mechanism should be used to "smooth" the leap second.
The Java Time-Scale mandates the use of UTC-SLS, however clock implementations may choose
how accurate they are with the time-scale so long as they document how they work.
Implementations are therefore not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to
otherwise be aware of leap seconds.

Implementations should implement

Serializable

wherever possible and must
document whether or not they do support serialization.
**Implementation Note:** The clock implementation provided here is based on the same underlying clock
as

System.currentTimeMillis()

, but may have a precision finer than
milliseconds if available.
However, little to no guarantee is provided about the accuracy of the
underlying clock. Applications requiring a more accurate clock must implement
this abstract class themselves using a different external clock, such as an
NTP server.

### Method Details

#### public static
Clock
systemUTC()

Obtains a clock that returns the current instant using the best available
system clock, converting to date and time using the UTC time-zone.

This clock, rather than

systemDefaultZone()

, should be used when
you need the current instant without the date or time.

This clock is based on the best available system clock.
This may use

System.currentTimeMillis()

, or a higher resolution
clock if one is available.

Conversion from instant to date or time uses the

UTC time-zone

.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

.
It is equivalent to

system(ZoneOffset.UTC)

.

**Returns:**
- a clock that uses the best available system clock in the UTC zone, not null

---

#### public static
Clock
systemDefaultZone()

Obtains a clock that returns the current instant using the best available
system clock, converting to date and time using the default time-zone.

This clock is based on the best available system clock.
This may use

System.currentTimeMillis()

, or a higher resolution
clock if one is available.

Using this method hard codes a dependency to the default time-zone into your application.
It is recommended to avoid this and use a specific time-zone whenever possible.
The

UTC clock

should be used when you need the current instant
without the date or time.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

.
It is equivalent to

system(ZoneId.systemDefault())

.

**Returns:**
- a clock that uses the best available system clock in the default zone, not null

**See Also:**
- ZoneId.systemDefault()

---

#### public static
Clock
system​(
ZoneId
zone)

Obtains a clock that returns the current instant using the best available
system clock.

This clock is based on the best available system clock.
This may use

System.currentTimeMillis()

, or a higher resolution
clock if one is available.

Conversion from instant to date or time uses the specified time-zone.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

.

---

#### public static
Clock
tickMillis​(
ZoneId
zone)

Obtains a clock that returns the current instant ticking in whole milliseconds
using the best available system clock.

This clock will always have the nano-of-second field truncated to milliseconds.
This ensures that the visible time ticks in whole milliseconds.
The underlying clock is the best available system clock, equivalent to
using

system(ZoneId)

.

Implementations may use a caching strategy for performance reasons.
As such, it is possible that the start of the millisecond observed via this
clock will be later than that observed directly via the underlying clock.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

.
It is equivalent to

tick(system(zone), Duration.ofMillis(1))

.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to use to convert the instant to date-time, not null

**Returns:**
- a clock that ticks in whole milliseconds using the specified zone, not null

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public static
Clock
tickSeconds​(
ZoneId
zone)

Obtains a clock that returns the current instant ticking in whole seconds
using the best available system clock.

This clock will always have the nano-of-second field set to zero.
This ensures that the visible time ticks in whole seconds.
The underlying clock is the best available system clock, equivalent to
using

system(ZoneId)

.

Implementations may use a caching strategy for performance reasons.
As such, it is possible that the start of the second observed via this
clock will be later than that observed directly via the underlying clock.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

.
It is equivalent to

tick(system(zone), Duration.ofSeconds(1))

.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to use to convert the instant to date-time, not null

**Returns:**
- a clock that ticks in whole seconds using the specified zone, not null

---

#### public static
Clock
tickMinutes​(
ZoneId
zone)

Obtains a clock that returns the current instant ticking in whole minutes
using the best available system clock.

This clock will always have the nano-of-second and second-of-minute fields set to zero.
This ensures that the visible time ticks in whole minutes.
The underlying clock is the best available system clock, equivalent to
using

system(ZoneId)

.

Implementations may use a caching strategy for performance reasons.
As such, it is possible that the start of the minute observed via this
clock will be later than that observed directly via the underlying clock.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

.
It is equivalent to

tick(system(zone), Duration.ofMinutes(1))

.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to use to convert the instant to date-time, not null

**Returns:**
- a clock that ticks in whole minutes using the specified zone, not null

---

#### public static
Clock
tick​(
Clock
baseClock,

Duration
tickDuration)

Obtains a clock that returns instants from the specified clock truncated
to the nearest occurrence of the specified duration.

This clock will only tick as per the specified duration. Thus, if the duration
is half a second, the clock will return instants truncated to the half second.

The tick duration must be positive. If it has a part smaller than a whole
millisecond, then the whole duration must divide into one second without
leaving a remainder. All normal tick durations will match these criteria,
including any multiple of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds, and
sensible nanosecond durations, such as 20ns, 250,000ns and 500,000ns.

A duration of zero or one nanosecond would have no truncation effect.
Passing one of these will return the underlying clock.

Implementations may use a caching strategy for performance reasons.
As such, it is possible that the start of the requested duration observed
via this clock will be later than that observed directly via the underlying clock.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

providing that the base clock is.

**Parameters:**
- baseClock

- the base clock to base the ticking clock on, not null
- tickDuration

- the duration of each visible tick, not negative, not null

**Returns:**
- a clock that ticks in whole units of the duration, not null

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the duration is negative, or has a
part smaller than a whole millisecond such that the whole duration is not
divisible into one second
- ArithmeticException

- if the duration is too large to be represented as nanos

---

#### public static
Clock
fixed​(
Instant
fixedInstant,

ZoneId
zone)

Obtains a clock that always returns the same instant.

This clock simply returns the specified instant.
As such, it is not a clock in the conventional sense.
The main use case for this is in testing, where the fixed clock ensures
tests are not dependent on the current clock.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

.

**Parameters:**
- fixedInstant

- the instant to use as the clock, not null
- zone

- the time-zone to use to convert the instant to date-time, not null

**Returns:**
- a clock that always returns the same instant, not null

---

#### public static
Clock
offset​(
Clock
baseClock,

Duration
offsetDuration)

Obtains a clock that returns instants from the specified clock with the
specified duration added

This clock wraps another clock, returning instants that are later by the
specified duration. If the duration is negative, the instants will be
earlier than the current date and time.
The main use case for this is to simulate running in the future or in the past.

A duration of zero would have no offsetting effect.
Passing zero will return the underlying clock.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

providing that the base clock is.

**Parameters:**
- baseClock

- the base clock to add the duration to, not null
- offsetDuration

- the duration to add, not null

**Returns:**
- a clock based on the base clock with the duration added, not null

---

#### public abstract
ZoneId
getZone()

Gets the time-zone being used to create dates and times.

A clock will typically obtain the current instant and then convert that
to a date or time using a time-zone. This method returns the time-zone used.

**Returns:**
- the time-zone being used to interpret instants, not null

---

#### public abstract
Clock
withZone​(
ZoneId
zone)

Returns a copy of this clock with a different time-zone.

A clock will typically obtain the current instant and then convert that
to a date or time using a time-zone. This method returns a clock with
similar properties but using a different time-zone.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null

**Returns:**
- a clock based on this clock with the specified time-zone, not null

---

#### public long millis()

Gets the current millisecond instant of the clock.

This returns the millisecond-based instant, measured from 1970-01-01T00:00Z (UTC).
This is equivalent to the definition of

System.currentTimeMillis()

.

Most applications should avoid this method and use

Instant

to represent
an instant on the time-line rather than a raw millisecond value.
This method is provided to allow the use of the clock in high performance use cases
where the creation of an object would be unacceptable.

The default implementation currently calls

instant()

.

**Returns:**
- the current millisecond instant from this clock, measured from
the Java epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00Z (UTC), not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the instant cannot be obtained, not thrown by most implementations

---

#### public abstract
Instant
instant()

Gets the current instant of the clock.

This returns an instant representing the current instant as defined by the clock.

**Returns:**
- the current instant from this clock, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the instant cannot be obtained, not thrown by most implementations

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Checks if this clock is equal to another clock.

Clocks should override this method to compare equals based on
their state and to meet the contract of

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

.
If not overridden, the behavior is defined by

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if this is equal to the other clock

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### public int hashCode()

A hash code for this clock.

Clocks should override this method based on
their state and to meet the contract of

Object.hashCode()

.
If not overridden, the behavior is defined by

Object.hashCode()

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a suitable hash code

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

Obtains a clock that returns instants from the specified clock truncated
to the nearest occurrence of the specified duration.

This clock will only tick as per the specified duration. Thus, if the duration
is half a second, the clock will return instants truncated to the half second.

The tick duration must be positive. If it has a part smaller than a whole
millisecond, then the whole duration must divide into one second without
leaving a remainder. All normal tick durations will match these criteria,
including any multiple of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds, and
sensible nanosecond durations, such as 20ns, 250,000ns and 500,000ns.

A duration of zero or one nanosecond would have no truncation effect.
Passing one of these will return the underlying clock.

Implementations may use a caching strategy for performance reasons.
As such, it is possible that the start of the requested duration observed
via this clock will be later than that observed directly via the underlying clock.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

providing that the base clock is.

**Parameters:** baseClock

- the base clock to base the ticking clock on, not null

The main use case for this is in testing, where the fixed clock ensures
tests are not dependent on the current clock.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

.

**Parameters:** fixedInstant

- the instant to use as the clock, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to use to convert the instant to date-time, not null

specified duration. If the duration is negative, the instants will be
earlier than the current date and time.
The main use case for this is to simulate running in the future or in the past.

A duration of zero would have no offsetting effect.
Passing zero will return the underlying clock.

The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and

Serializable

providing that the base clock is.

**Parameters:** baseClock

- the base clock to add the duration to, not null
**Parameters:** offsetDuration

- the duration to add, not null
**Returns:** a clock based on the base clock with the duration added, not null

```

Returns a copy of this clock with a different time-zone.

A clock will typically obtain the current instant and then convert that
to a date or time using a time-zone. This method returns a clock with
similar properties but using a different time-zone.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to change to, not null
**Returns:** a clock based on this clock with the specified time-zone, not null

- millis

```java
public long millis()
```

Gets the current millisecond instant of the clock.

This returns the millisecond-based instant, measured from 1970-01-01T00:00Z (UTC).
This is equivalent to the definition of

System.currentTimeMillis()

.

Most applications should avoid this method and use

Instant

to represent
an instant on the time-line rather than a raw millisecond value.
This method is provided to allow the use of the clock in high performance use cases
where the creation of an object would be unacceptable.

The default implementation currently calls

instant()

.

**Returns:** the current millisecond instant from this clock, measured from

```

Obtains a clock that returns instants from the specified clock truncated
to the nearest occurrence of the specified duration.

This clock will only tick as per the specified duration. Thus, if the duration
is half a second, the clock will return instants truncated to the half second.

The tick duration must be positive. If it has a part smaller than a whole
millisecond, then the whole duration must divide into one second without
leaving a remainder. All normal tick durations will match these criteria,
including any multiple of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds, and
sensible nanosecond durations, such as 20ns, 250,000ns and 500,000ns.

A duration of zero or one nanosecond would have no truncation effect.
Passing one of these will return the underlying clock.
