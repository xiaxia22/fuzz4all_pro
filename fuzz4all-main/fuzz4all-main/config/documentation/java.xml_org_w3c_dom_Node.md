# Interface Node

**Source:** `java.xml\org\w3c\dom\Node.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Node
```

The

Node

interface is the primary datatype for the entire
Document Object Model. It represents a single node in the document tree.
While all objects implementing the

Node

interface expose
methods for dealing with children, not all objects implementing the

Node

interface may have children. For example,

Text

nodes may not have children, and adding children to
such nodes results in a

DOMException

being raised.

The attributes

nodeName

,

nodeValue

and

attributes

are included as a mechanism to get at node
information without casting down to the specific derived interface. In
cases where there is no obvious mapping of these attributes for a
specific

nodeType

(e.g.,

nodeValue

for an

Element

or

attributes

for a

Comment

), this returns

null

. Note that the specialized interfaces
may contain additional and more convenient mechanisms to get and set the
relevant information.

The values of

nodeName

,

nodeValue

, and

attributes

vary according to the
node type as follows:

Note:

Inserting a node before itself is implementation
dependent.

**Parameters:**
- newChild

- The node to insert.
- refChild

- The reference node, i.e., the node before which the
new node must be inserted.

**Returns:**
- The node being inserted.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if this node is of a type that does not
allow children of the type of the

newChild

#### Node
replaceChild​(
Node
newChild,

Node
oldChild)
throws
DOMException

Replaces the child node

oldChild

with

newChild

in the list of children, and returns the

oldChild

node.

If

newChild

is a

DocumentFragment

object,

oldChild

is replaced by all of the

DocumentFragment

children, which are inserted in the
same order. If the

newChild

is already in the tree, it
is first removed.

Note:

Replacing a node with itself is implementation
dependent.

**Parameters:**
- newChild

- The new node to put in the child list.
- oldChild

- The node being replaced in the list.

**Returns:**
- The node replaced.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if this node is of a type that does not
allow children of the type of the

newChild

node, or if
the node to put in is one of this node's ancestors or this node
itself, or if this node is of type

Document

and the
result of the replacement operation would add a second

DocumentType

or

Element

on the

Document

node.

WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised if

newChild

was created
from a different document than the one that created this node.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node or the parent of
the new node is readonly.

---

#### Node
appendChild​(
Node
newChild)
throws
DOMException

newChild

to the end of the list of children
of this node. If the

newChild

is already in the tree, it
is first removed.

**Parameters:**
- newChild

---

#### boolean hasChildNodes()

Returns whether this node has any children.

**Returns:**
- Returns

true

if this node has any children,

false

otherwise.

---

#### Node
cloneNode​(boolean deep)

Returns a duplicate of this node, i.e., serves as a generic copy
constructor for nodes. The duplicate node has no parent (

parentNode

is

null

) and no user data. User
data associated to the imported node is not carried over. However, if
any

UserDataHandlers

has been specified along with the
associated data these handlers will be called with the appropriate
parameters before this method returns.

Cloning an

Element

copies all attributes and their
values, including those generated by the XML processor to represent
defaulted attributes, but this method does not copy any children it
contains unless it is a deep clone. This includes text contained in
an the

Element

since the text is contained in a child

Text

node. Cloning an

Attr

directly, as
opposed to be cloned as part of an

Element

cloning
operation, returns a specified attribute (

specified

is

true

). Cloning an

Attr

always clones its
children, since they represent its value, no matter whether this is a
deep clone or not. Cloning an

EntityReference

automatically constructs its subtree if a corresponding

Entity

is available, no matter whether this is a deep
clone or not. Cloning any other type of node simply returns a copy of
this node.

Note that cloning an immutable subtree results in a mutable copy,
but the children of an

EntityReference

clone are readonly
. In addition, clones of unspecified

Attr

nodes are
specified. And, cloning

Document

,

DocumentType

,

Entity

, and

Notation

nodes is implementation dependent.

**Parameters:**
- deep

- If

true

, recursively clone the subtree under
the specified node; if

false

, clone only the node
itself (and its attributes, if it is an

Element

).

**Returns:**
- The duplicate node.

---

#### void normalize()

Puts all

Text

nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree
underneath this

Node

, including attribute nodes, into a
"normal" form where only structure (e.g., elements, comments,
processing instructions, CDATA sections, and entity references)
separates

Text

nodes, i.e., there are neither adjacent

Text

nodes nor empty

Text

nodes. This can
be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if
it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as
XPointer [

XPointer

]
lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to
be used. If the parameter "normalize-characters" of the

DOMConfiguration

object attached to the

Node.ownerDocument

is

true

, this method
will also fully normalize the characters of the

Text

nodes.

Note:

In cases where the document contains

CDATASections

, the normalize operation alone may not be
sufficient, since XPointers do not differentiate between

Text

nodes and

CDATASection

nodes.

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 3

---

#### boolean isSupported​(
String
feature,

String
version)

Tests whether the DOM implementation implements a specific feature and
that feature is supported by this node, as specified in .

**Parameters:**
- feature

- The name of the feature to test.
- version

- This is the version number of the feature to test.

**Returns:**
- Returns

true

if the specified feature is
supported on this node,

false

otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### String
getNamespaceURI()

The namespace URI of this node, or

null

if it is
unspecified (see ).

This is not a computed value that is the result of a namespace
lookup based on an examination of the namespace declarations in
scope. It is merely the namespace URI given at creation time.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

Document.createElement()

, this is always

null

.

Note:

Per the

Namespaces in XML

Specification [

XML Namespaces

]
an attribute does not inherit its namespace from the element it is
attached to. If an attribute is not explicitly given a namespace, it
simply has no namespace.

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### String
getPrefix()

The namespace prefix of this node, or

null

if it is
unspecified. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect, including if the node is read-only.

Note that setting this attribute, when permitted, changes the

nodeName

attribute, which holds the qualified name, as
well as the

tagName

and

name

attributes of
the

Element

and

Attr

interfaces, when
applicable.

Setting the prefix to

null

makes it unspecified,
setting it to an empty string is implementation dependent.

Note also that changing the prefix of an attribute that is known to
have a default value, does not make a new attribute with the default
value and the original prefix appear, since the

namespaceURI

and

localName

do not change.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

createElement

from the

Document

interface, this is always

null

.

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### void setPrefix​(
String
prefix)
throws
DOMException

The namespace prefix of this node, or

null

if it is
unspecified. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect, including if the node is read-only.

Note that setting this attribute, when permitted, changes the

nodeName

attribute, which holds the qualified name, as
well as the

tagName

and

name

attributes of
the

Element

and

Attr

interfaces, when
applicable.

Setting the prefix to

null

makes it unspecified,
setting it to an empty string is implementation dependent.

Note also that changing the prefix of an attribute that is known to
have a default value, does not make a new attribute with the default
value and the original prefix appear, since the

namespaceURI

and

localName

do not change.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

createElement

from the

Document

interface, this is always

null

.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified prefix contains an
illegal character according to the XML version in use specified in
the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node is readonly.

NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the specified

prefix

is
malformed per the Namespaces in XML specification, if the

namespaceURI

of this node is

null

, if the
specified prefix is "xml" and the

namespaceURI

of this
node is different from "

http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace

", if this node is an attribute and the specified prefix is "xmlns" and
the

namespaceURI

of this node is different from "

http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/

", or if this node is an attribute and the

qualifiedName

of
this node is "xmlns" [

XML Namespaces

]
.

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### String
getLocalName()

Returns the local part of the qualified name of this node.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

Document.createElement()

, this is always

null

.

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### boolean hasAttributes()

Returns whether this node (if it is an element) has any attributes.

**Returns:**
- Returns

true

if this node has any attributes,

false

otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### String
getBaseURI()

The absolute base URI of this node or

null

if the
implementation wasn't able to obtain an absolute URI. This value is
computed as described in . However, when the

Document

supports the feature "HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, the base URI is computed using first the value of the href
attribute of the HTML BASE element if any, and the value of the

documentURI

attribute from the

Document

interface otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### short compareDocumentPosition​(
Node
other)
throws
DOMException

Compares the reference node, i.e. the node on which this method is
being called, with a node, i.e. the one passed as a parameter, with
regard to their position in the document and according to the
document order.

**Parameters:**
- other

- The node to compare against the reference node.

**Returns:**
- Returns how the node is positioned relatively to the reference
node.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: when the compared nodes are from different DOM
implementations that do not coordinate to return consistent
implementation-specific results.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### String
getTextContent()
throws
DOMException

This attribute returns the text content of this node and its
descendants. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect. On setting, any possible children this node may have
are removed and, if it the new string is not empty or

null

, replaced by a single

Text

node
containing the string this attribute is set to.

On getting, no serialization is performed, the returned string
does not contain any markup. No whitespace normalization is performed
and the returned string does not contain the white spaces in element
content (see the attribute

Text.isElementContentWhitespace

). Similarly, on setting,
no parsing is performed either, the input string is taken as pure
textual content.

The string returned is made of the text content of this node
depending on its type, as defined below:

Node/Content table

Node type

Content

ELEMENT_NODE, ATTRIBUTE_NODE, ENTITY_NODE, ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE,
DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE

concatenation of the

textContent

attribute value of every child node, excluding COMMENT_NODE and
PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE nodes. This is the empty string if the
node has no children.

DOCUMENT_NODE,
DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE, NOTATION_NODE

null

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- DOMSTRING_SIZE_ERR: Raised when it would return more characters than
fit in a

DOMString

variable on the implementation
platform.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### void setTextContent​(
String
textContent)
throws
DOMException

This attribute returns the text content of this node and its
descendants. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect. On setting, any possible children this node may have
are removed and, if it the new string is not empty or

null

, replaced by a single

Text

node
containing the string this attribute is set to.

On getting, no serialization is performed, the returned string
does not contain any markup. No whitespace normalization is performed
and the returned string does not contain the white spaces in element
content (see the attribute

Text.isElementContentWhitespace

). Similarly, on setting,
no parsing is performed either, the input string is taken as pure
textual content.

The string returned is made of the text content of this node
depending on its type, as defined below:

Node/Content table

Node type

Content

ELEMENT_NODE, ATTRIBUTE_NODE, ENTITY_NODE, ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE,
DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE

concatenation of the

textContent

attribute value of every child node, excluding COMMENT_NODE and
PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE nodes. This is the empty string if the
node has no children.

TEXT_NODE, CDATA_SECTION_NODE, COMMENT_NODE,
PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE

nodeValue

DOCUMENT_NODE,
DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE, NOTATION_NODE

null

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised when the node is readonly.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### boolean isSameNode​(
Node
other)

Returns whether this node is the same node as the given one.

This method provides a way to determine whether two

Node

references returned by the implementation reference
the same object. When two

Node

references are references
to the same object, even if through a proxy, the references may be
used completely interchangeably, such that all attributes have the
same values and calling the same DOM method on either reference
always has exactly the same effect.

**Parameters:**
- other

- The node to test against.

**Returns:**
- Returns

true

if the nodes are the same,

false

otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### String
lookupPrefix​(
String
namespaceURI)

Look up the prefix associated to the given namespace URI, starting from
this node. The default namespace declarations are ignored by this
method.

See for details on the algorithm used by this method.

**Parameters:**
- namespaceURI

- The namespace URI to look for.

**Returns:**
- Returns an associated namespace prefix if found or

null

if none is found. If more than one prefix are
associated to the namespace prefix, the returned namespace prefix
is implementation dependent.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### boolean isDefaultNamespace​(
String
namespaceURI)

This method checks if the specified

namespaceURI

is the
default namespace or not.

**Parameters:**
- namespaceURI

- The namespace URI to look for.

**Returns:**
- Returns

true

if the specified

namespaceURI

is the default namespace,

false

otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### String
lookupNamespaceURI​(
String
prefix)

Look up the namespace URI associated to the given prefix, starting from
this node.

See for details on the algorithm used by this method.

**Parameters:**

#### boolean isEqualNode​(
Node
arg)

Tests whether two nodes are equal.

This method tests for equality of nodes, not sameness (i.e.,
whether the two nodes are references to the same object) which can be
tested with

Node.isSameNode()

. All nodes that are the
same will also be equal, though the reverse may not be true.

Two nodes are equal if and only if the following conditions are
satisfied:

- The two nodes are of the same type.
- The following string
attributes are equal:

nodeName

,

localName

,

namespaceURI

,

prefix

,

nodeValue

. This is: they are both

null

, or they have the same
length and are character for character identical.
- The

attributes

NamedNodeMaps

are equal. This
is: they are both

null

, or they have the same length and
for each node that exists in one map there is a node that exists in
the other map and is equal, although not necessarily at the same
index.
- The

childNodes

NodeLists

are equal.
This is: they are both

null

, or they have the same
length and contain equal nodes at the same index. Note that
normalization can affect equality; to avoid this, nodes should be
normalized before being compared.

For two

DocumentType

nodes to be equal, the following
conditions must also be satisfied:

- The following string attributes
are equal:

publicId

,

systemId

,

internalSubset

.
- The

entities

NamedNodeMaps

are equal.
- The

notations

NamedNodeMaps

are equal.

On the other hand, the following do not affect equality: the

ownerDocument

,

baseURI

, and

parentNode

attributes, the

specified

attribute for

Attr

nodes, the

schemaTypeInfo

attribute for

Attr

and

Element

nodes, the

Text.isElementContentWhitespace

attribute for

Text

nodes, as well as any user data or event listeners
registered on the nodes.

Note:

As a general rule, anything not mentioned in the
description above is not significant in consideration of equality
checking. Note that future versions of this specification may take
into account more attributes and implementations conform to this
specification are expected to be updated accordingly.

**Parameters:**
- arg

- The node to compare equality with.

**Returns:**
- Returns

true

if the nodes are equal,

false

otherwise.

- 1.5, DOM Level 3

#### Object
getFeature​(
String
feature,

String
version)

This method returns a specialized object which implements the
specialized APIs of the specified feature and version, as specified
in . The specialized object may also be obtained by using
binding-specific casting methods but is not necessarily expected to,
as discussed in . This method also allow the implementation to
provide specialized objects which do not support the

Node

interface.

**Parameters:**
- feature

- The name of the feature requested. Note that any plus
sign "+" prepended to the name of the feature will be ignored since
it is not significant in the context of this method.
- version

- This is the version number of the feature to test.

**Returns:**
- Returns an object which implements the specialized APIs of
the specified feature and version, if any, or

null

if
there is no object which implements interfaces associated with that
feature. If the

DOMObject

returned by this method
implements the

Node

interface, it must delegate to the
primary core

Node

and not return results inconsistent
with the primary core

Node

such as attributes,
childNodes, etc.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### Object
setUserData​(
String
key,

Object
data,

UserDataHandler
handler)

Associate an object to a key on this node. The object can later be
retrieved from this node by calling

getUserData

with the
same key.

**Parameters:**
- key

- The key to associate the object to.
- data

- The object to associate to the given key, or

null

to remove any existing association to that key.
- handler

- The handler to associate to that key, or

null

.

**Returns:**
- Returns the

DOMUserData

previously associated to
the given key on this node, or

null

if there was none.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### Object
getUserData​(
String
key)

Retrieves the object associated to a key on a this node. The object
must first have been set to this node by calling

setUserData

with the same key.

**Parameters:**
- key

- The key the object is associated to.

**Returns:**
- Returns the

DOMUserData

associated to the given
key on this node, or

null

if there was none.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

public interface
Node
```

The

Node

interface is the primary datatype for the entire
Document Object Model. It represents a single node in the document tree.
While all objects implementing the

Node

interface expose
methods for dealing with children, not all objects implementing the

Node

interface may have children. For example,

Text

nodes may not have children, and adding children to
such nodes results in a

DOMException

being raised.

The attributes

nodeName

,

nodeValue

and

are included as a mechanism to get at node
information without casting down to the specific derived interface. In
cases where there is no obvious mapping of these attributes for a
specific

nodeType

(e.g.,

nodeValue

for an

Element

or

attributes

for a

Comment

), this returns

null

. Note that the specialized interfaces
may contain additional and more convenient mechanisms to get and set the
relevant information.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 3

- hasChildNodes

```java
boolean hasChildNodes()
```

Returns whether this node has any children.

**Returns:** Returns

true

if this node has any children,

false

otherwise.

- cloneNode

```java
Node
cloneNode​(boolean deep)
```

Returns a duplicate of this node, i.e., serves as a generic copy
constructor for nodes. The duplicate node has no parent (

parentNode

is

null

) and no user data. User
data associated to the imported node is not carried over. However, if
any

UserDataHandlers

has been specified along with the
associated data these handlers will be called with the appropriate
parameters before this method returns.

Cloning an

Element

copies all attributes and their
values, including those generated by the XML processor to represent
defaulted attributes, but this method does not copy any children it
contains unless it is a deep clone. This includes text contained in
an the

Element

since the text is contained in a child

Text

node. Cloning an

Attr

directly, as
opposed to be cloned as part of an

Element

cloning
operation, returns a specified attribute (

specified

is

true

). Cloning an

Attr

always clones its
children, since they represent its value, no matter whether this is a
deep clone or not. Cloning an

EntityReference

automatically constructs its subtree if a corresponding

Entity

is available, no matter whether this is a deep
clone or not. Cloning any other type of node simply returns a copy of
this node.

Note that cloning an immutable subtree results in a mutable copy,
but the children of an

EntityReference

clone are readonly
. In addition, clones of unspecified

Attr

nodes are
specified. And, cloning

Document

,

DocumentType

,

Entity

, and

Notation

nodes is implementation dependent.

**Parameters:** deep

- If

true

, recursively clone the subtree under
the specified node; if

false

, clone only the node
itself (and its attributes, if it is an

Element

).
**Returns:** The duplicate node.

- normalize

```java
void normalize()
```

Puts all

Text

nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree
underneath this

Node

, including attribute nodes, into a
"normal" form where only structure (e.g., elements, comments,
processing instructions, CDATA sections, and entity references)
separates

Text

nodes, i.e., there are neither adjacent

Text

nodes nor empty

Text

nodes. This can
be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if
it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as
XPointer [

XPointer

]
lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to
be used. If the parameter "normalize-characters" of the

DOMConfiguration

object attached to the

Node.ownerDocument

is

true

, this method
will also fully normalize the characters of the

Text

nodes.

Note:

In cases where the document contains

CDATASections

, the normalize operation alone may not be
sufficient, since XPointers do not differentiate between

Text

nodes and

CDATASection

nodes.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 3

- isSupported

```java
boolean isSupported​(
String
feature,

String
version)
```

Tests whether the DOM implementation implements a specific feature and
that feature is supported by this node, as specified in .

**Parameters:** feature

- The name of the feature to test.
**Parameters:** version

- This is the version number of the feature to test.
**Returns:** Returns

true

if the specified feature is
supported on this node,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getNamespaceURI

```java
String
getNamespaceURI()
```

The namespace URI of this node, or

null

if it is
unspecified (see ).

This is not a computed value that is the result of a namespace
lookup based on an examination of the namespace declarations in
scope. It is merely the namespace URI given at creation time.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

Document.createElement()

, this is always

null

.

Note:

Per the

Namespaces in XML

Specification [

XML Namespaces

]
an attribute does not inherit its namespace from the element it is
attached to. If an attribute is not explicitly given a namespace, it
simply has no namespace.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getPrefix

```java
String
getPrefix()
```

The namespace prefix of this node, or

null

if it is
unspecified. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect, including if the node is read-only.

Note that setting this attribute, when permitted, changes the

nodeName

attribute, which holds the qualified name, as
well as the

tagName

and

name

attributes of
the

Element

and

Attr

interfaces, when
applicable.

Setting the prefix to

null

makes it unspecified,
setting it to an empty string is implementation dependent.

Note also that changing the prefix of an attribute that is known to
have a default value, does not make a new attribute with the default
value and the original prefix appear, since the

namespaceURI

and

localName

do not change.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

createElement

from the

Document

interface, this is always

null

.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- setPrefix

```java
void setPrefix​(
String
prefix)
throws
DOMException
```

The namespace prefix of this node, or

null

if it is
unspecified. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect, including if the node is read-only.

Note that setting this attribute, when permitted, changes the

nodeName

attribute, which holds the qualified name, as
well as the

tagName

and

name

attributes of
the

Element

and

Attr

interfaces, when
applicable.

Setting the prefix to

null

makes it unspecified,
setting it to an empty string is implementation dependent.

Note also that changing the prefix of an attribute that is known to
have a default value, does not make a new attribute with the default
value and the original prefix appear, since the

namespaceURI

and

localName

do not change.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

createElement

from the

Document

interface, this is always

null

.

**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified prefix contains an
illegal character according to the XML version in use specified in
the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node is readonly.

NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the specified

prefix

is
malformed per the Namespaces in XML specification, if the

namespaceURI

of this node is

null

, if the
specified prefix is "xml" and the

namespaceURI

of this
node is different from "

http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace

", if this node is an attribute and the specified prefix is "xmlns" and
the

namespaceURI

of this node is different from "

http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/

", or if this node is an attribute and the

qualifiedName

of
this node is "xmlns" [

XML Namespaces

]
.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getLocalName

```java
String
getLocalName()
```

Returns the local part of the qualified name of this node.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

Document.createElement()

, this is always

null

.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- hasAttributes

```java
boolean hasAttributes()
```

Returns whether this node (if it is an element) has any attributes.

**Returns:** Returns

true

if this node has any attributes,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getBaseURI

```java
String
getBaseURI()
```

The absolute base URI of this node or

null

if the
implementation wasn't able to obtain an absolute URI. This value is
computed as described in . However, when the

Document

supports the feature "HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, the base URI is computed using first the value of the href
attribute of the HTML BASE element if any, and the value of the

documentURI

attribute from the

Document

interface otherwise.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- compareDocumentPosition

```java
short compareDocumentPosition​(
Node
other)
throws
DOMException
```

being called, with a node, i.e. the one passed as a parameter, with
regard to their position in the document and according to the
document order.

**Parameters:** other

- The node to compare against the reference node.
**Returns:** Returns how the node is positioned relatively to the reference
node.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: when the compared nodes are from different DOM
implementations that do not coordinate to return consistent
implementation-specific results.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getTextContent

```java
String
getTextContent()
throws
DOMException
```

This attribute returns the text content of this node and its
descendants. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect. On setting, any possible children this node may have
are removed and, if it the new string is not empty or

null

, replaced by a single

Text

node
containing the string this attribute is set to.

On getting, no serialization is performed, the returned string
does not contain any markup. No whitespace normalization is performed
and the returned string does not contain the white spaces in element
content (see the attribute

Text.isElementContentWhitespace

). Similarly, on setting,
no parsing is performed either, the input string is taken as pure
textual content.

The string returned is made of the text content of this node
depending on its type, as defined below:

Node/Content table

Node type

Content

ELEMENT_NODE, ATTRIBUTE_NODE, ENTITY_NODE, ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE,
DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE

concatenation of the

platform.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- setTextContent

```java
void setTextContent​(
String
textContent)
throws
DOMException
```

This attribute returns the text content of this node and its
descendants. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect. On setting, any possible children this node may have
are removed and, if it the new string is not empty or

null

, replaced by a single

Text

node
containing the string this attribute is set to.

On getting, no serialization is performed, the returned string
does not contain any markup. No whitespace normalization is performed
and the returned string does not contain the white spaces in element
content (see the attribute

Text.isElementContentWhitespace

). Similarly, on setting,
no parsing is performed either, the input string is taken as pure

The string returned is made of the text content of this node
depending on its type, as defined below:

Node/Content table

Node type

Content

ELEMENT_NODE, ATTRIBUTE_NODE, ENTITY_NODE, ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE,
DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- isSameNode

```java
boolean isSameNode​(
Node
other)
```

Returns whether this node is the same node as the given one.

This method provides a way to determine whether two

Node

references returned by the implementation reference
the same object. When two

Node

references are references
to the same object, even if through a proxy, the references may be
used completely interchangeably, such that all attributes have the
same values and calling the same DOM method on either reference
always has exactly the same effect.

**Parameters:** other

- The node to test against.
**Returns:** Returns

true

if the nodes are the same,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- lookupPrefix

```java
String
lookupPrefix​(
String
namespaceURI)
```

Look up the prefix associated to the given namespace URI, starting from
this node. The default namespace declarations are ignored by this
method.

See for details on the algorithm used by this method.

**Parameters:** namespaceURI

- The namespace URI to look for.
**Returns:** Returns an associated namespace prefix if found or

null

if none is found. If more than one prefix are
associated to the namespace prefix, the returned namespace prefix
is implementation dependent.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- isDefaultNamespace

```java
boolean isDefaultNamespace​(
String
namespaceURI)
```

This method checks if the specified

namespaceURI

is the
default namespace or not.

**Parameters:** namespaceURI

- The namespace URI to look for.
**Returns:** Returns

true

if the specified

namespaceURI

is the default namespace,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- lookupNamespaceURI

```java
String
lookupNamespaceURI​(
String
prefix)
```

Look up the namespace URI associated to the given prefix, starting from
this node.

**Parameters:** prefix

- The prefix to look for. If this parameter is

null

, the method will return the default namespace URI
if any.
**Returns:** Returns the associated namespace URI or

null

if
none is found.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- isEqualNode

```java
boolean isEqualNode​(
Node
arg)
```

Tests whether two nodes are equal.

This method tests for equality of nodes, not sameness (i.e.,
whether the two nodes are references to the same object) which can be
tested with

Node.isSameNode()

. All nodes that are the
same will also be equal, though the reverse may not be true.

Two nodes are equal if and only if the following conditions are
satisfied:

- The two nodes are of the same type.
- The following string
attributes are equal:

nodeName

,

localName

,

namespaceURI

,

prefix

,

nodeValue

. This is: they are both

null

, or they have the same
length and are character for character identical.
- The

attributes

NamedNodeMaps

are equal. This
is: they are both

null

, or they have the same length and
for each node that exists in one map there is a node that exists in
the other map and is equal, although not necessarily at the same
index.
- The

childNodes

NodeLists

are equal.
This is: they are both

null

, or they have the same
length and contain equal nodes at the same index. Note that
normalization can affect equality; to avoid this, nodes should be
normalized before being compared.

For two

DocumentType

nodes to be equal, the following
conditions must also be satisfied:

- The following string attributes
are equal:

publicId

,

systemId

,

internalSubset

.
- The

entities

NamedNodeMaps

are equal.
- The

notations

NamedNodeMaps

are equal.

On the other hand, the following do not affect equality: the

ownerDocument

,

baseURI

, and

parentNode

attributes, the

specified

attribute for

Attr

nodes, the

schemaTypeInfo

attribute for

Attr

and

Element

nodes, the

Text.isElementContentWhitespace

attribute for

Text

nodes, as well as any user data or event listeners
registered on the nodes.

Note:

As a general rule, anything not mentioned in the
description above is not significant in consideration of equality
checking. Note that future versions of this specification may take
into account more attributes and implementations conform to this
specification are expected to be updated accordingly.

**Parameters:** arg

- The node to compare equality with.
**Returns:** Returns

true

if the nodes are equal,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getFeature

```java
Object
getFeature​(
String
feature,

String
version)
```

This method returns a specialized object which implements the
specialized APIs of the specified feature and version, as specified
in . The specialized object may also be obtained by using
binding-specific casting methods but is not necessarily expected to,
as discussed in . This method also allow the implementation to
provide specialized objects which do not support the

Node

interface.

**Parameters:** feature

- The name of the feature requested. Note that any plus
sign "+" prepended to the name of the feature will be ignored since
it is not significant in the context of this method.
**Parameters:** version

- This is the version number of the feature to test.
**Returns:** Returns an object which implements the specialized APIs of
the specified feature and version, if any, or

null

if
there is no object which implements interfaces associated with that
feature. If the

DOMObject

returned by this method
implements the

Node

interface, it must delegate to the
primary core

Node

and not return results inconsistent
with the primary core

Node

such as attributes,
childNodes, etc.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- setUserData

```java
Object
setUserData​(
String
key,

handler)
```

Associate an object to a key on this node. The object can later be
retrieved from this node by calling

getUserData

with the
same key.

**Parameters:** key

- The key to associate the object to.
**Parameters:** data

- The object to associate to the given key, or

null

to remove any existing association to that key.
**Parameters:** handler

- The handler to associate to that key, or

null

.
**Returns:** Returns the

DOMUserData

previously associated to
the given key on this node, or

null

if there was none.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getUserData

```java
Object
getUserData​(
String
key)
```

Retrieves the object associated to a key on a this node. The object
must first have been set to this node by calling

setUserData

with the same key.

**Parameters:** key

- The key the object is associated to.
**Returns:** Returns the

DOMUserData

associated to the given
key on this node, or

null

if there was none.

- hasChildNodes

```java
boolean hasChildNodes()
```

Returns whether this node has any children.

**Returns:** Returns

true

if this node has any children,

false

otherwise.

- cloneNode

```java
Node
cloneNode​(boolean deep)
```

Returns a duplicate of this node, i.e., serves as a generic copy
constructor for nodes. The duplicate node has no parent (

parentNode

is

null

) and no user data. User
data associated to the imported node is not carried over. However, if
any

UserDataHandlers

has been specified along with the
associated data these handlers will be called with the appropriate
parameters before this method returns.

Cloning an

Element

copies all attributes and their
values, including those generated by the XML processor to represent
defaulted attributes, but this method does not copy any children it
contains unless it is a deep clone. This includes text contained in
an the

Element

since the text is contained in a child

Text

node. Cloning an

Attr

directly, as
opposed to be cloned as part of an

Element

cloning
operation, returns a specified attribute (

specified

is

true

). Cloning an

Attr

always clones its
children, since they represent its value, no matter whether this is a
deep clone or not. Cloning an

EntityReference

automatically constructs its subtree if a corresponding

Entity

is available, no matter whether this is a deep
clone or not. Cloning any other type of node simply returns a copy of
this node.

Note that cloning an immutable subtree results in a mutable copy,
but the children of an

EntityReference

clone are readonly
. In addition, clones of unspecified

Attr

nodes are
specified. And, cloning

Document

,

DocumentType

,

Entity

, and

Notation

nodes is implementation dependent.

**Parameters:** deep

- If

true

, recursively clone the subtree under
the specified node; if

false

, clone only the node
itself (and its attributes, if it is an

Element

).
**Returns:** The duplicate node.

- normalize

```java
void normalize()
```

Puts all

Text

nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree
underneath this

Node

, including attribute nodes, into a
"normal" form where only structure (e.g., elements, comments,
processing instructions, CDATA sections, and entity references)
separates

Text

nodes, i.e., there are neither adjacent

Text

nodes nor empty

Text

nodes. This can
be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if
it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as
XPointer [

XPointer

]
lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to
be used. If the parameter "normalize-characters" of the

DOMConfiguration

object attached to the

Node.ownerDocument

is

true

, this method
will also fully normalize the characters of the

Text

nodes.

Note:

In cases where the document contains

CDATASections

, the normalize operation alone may not be
sufficient, since XPointers do not differentiate between

Text

nodes and

CDATASection

nodes.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 3

- isSupported

```java
boolean isSupported​(
String
feature,

String
version)
```

Tests whether the DOM implementation implements a specific feature and
that feature is supported by this node, as specified in .

**Parameters:** feature

- The name of the feature to test.
**Parameters:** version

- This is the version number of the feature to test.
**Returns:** Returns

true

if the specified feature is
supported on this node,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getNamespaceURI

```java
String
getNamespaceURI()
```

The namespace URI of this node, or

null

if it is
unspecified (see ).

This is not a computed value that is the result of a namespace
lookup based on an examination of the namespace declarations in
scope. It is merely the namespace URI given at creation time.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

Document.createElement()

, this is always

null

.

Note:

Per the

Namespaces in XML

Specification [

XML Namespaces

]
an attribute does not inherit its namespace from the element it is
attached to. If an attribute is not explicitly given a namespace, it
simply has no namespace.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getPrefix

```java
String
getPrefix()
```

The namespace prefix of this node, or

null

if it is
unspecified. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect, including if the node is read-only.

Note that setting this attribute, when permitted, changes the

nodeName

attribute, which holds the qualified name, as
well as the

tagName

and

name

attributes of
the

Element

and

Attr

interfaces, when
applicable.

Setting the prefix to

null

makes it unspecified,
setting it to an empty string is implementation dependent.

Note also that changing the prefix of an attribute that is known to
have a default value, does not make a new attribute with the default
value and the original prefix appear, since the

namespaceURI

and

localName

do not change.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

createElement

from the

Document

interface, this is always

null

.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- setPrefix

```java
void setPrefix​(
String
prefix)
throws
DOMException
```

The namespace prefix of this node, or

null

if it is
unspecified. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect, including if the node is read-only.

Note that setting this attribute, when permitted, changes the

nodeName

attribute, which holds the qualified name, as
well as the

tagName

and

name

attributes of
the

Element

and

Attr

interfaces, when
applicable.

Setting the prefix to

null

makes it unspecified,
setting it to an empty string is implementation dependent.

Note also that changing the prefix of an attribute that is known to
have a default value, does not make a new attribute with the default
value and the original prefix appear, since the

namespaceURI

and

localName

do not change.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

createElement

from the

Document

interface, this is always

null

.

**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified prefix contains an
illegal character according to the XML version in use specified in
the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node is readonly.

NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the specified

prefix

is
malformed per the Namespaces in XML specification, if the

namespaceURI

of this node is

null

, if the
specified prefix is "xml" and the

namespaceURI

of this
node is different from "

http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace

", if this node is an attribute and the specified prefix is "xmlns" and
the

namespaceURI

of this node is different from "

http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/

", or if this node is an attribute and the

qualifiedName

of
this node is "xmlns" [

XML Namespaces

]
.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getLocalName

```java
String
getLocalName()
```

Returns the local part of the qualified name of this node.

For nodes of any type other than

ELEMENT_NODE

and

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

and nodes created with a DOM Level 1
method, such as

Document.createElement()

, this is always

null

.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- hasAttributes

```java
boolean hasAttributes()
```

Returns whether this node (if it is an element) has any attributes.

**Returns:** Returns

true

if this node has any attributes,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getBaseURI

```java
String
getBaseURI()
```

The absolute base URI of this node or

null

if the
implementation wasn't able to obtain an absolute URI. This value is
computed as described in . However, when the

Document

supports the feature "HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, the base URI is computed using first the value of the href
attribute of the HTML BASE element if any, and the value of the

documentURI

attribute from the

Document

interface otherwise.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- compareDocumentPosition

```java
short compareDocumentPosition​(
Node
other)
throws
DOMException
```

being called, with a node, i.e. the one passed as a parameter, with
regard to their position in the document and according to the
document order.

**Parameters:** other

- The node to compare against the reference node.
**Returns:** Returns how the node is positioned relatively to the reference
node.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: when the compared nodes are from different DOM
implementations that do not coordinate to return consistent
implementation-specific results.

- getTextContent

```java
String
getTextContent()
throws
DOMException
```

This attribute returns the text content of this node and its
descendants. When it is defined to be

null

, setting it
has no effect. On setting, any possible children this node may have
are removed and, if it the new string is not empty or

null

, replaced by a single

Text

node
containing the string this attribute is set to.

On getting, no serialization is performed, the returned string
does not contain any markup. No whitespace normalization is performed
and the returned string does not contain the white spaces in element
content (see the attribute

Text.isElementContentWhitespace

). Similarly, on setting,
no parsing is performed either, the input string is taken as pure
textual content.

The string returned is made of the text content of this node
depending on its type, as defined below:

Node/Content table

Node type

Content

ELEMENT_NODE, ATTRIBUTE_NODE, ENTITY_NODE, ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE,
DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE

concatenation of the

textContent

attribute value of every child node, excluding COMMENT_NODE and
PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE nodes. This is the empty string if the
node has no children.

TEXT_NODE, CDATA_SECTION_NODE, COMMENT_NODE,
PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE

nodeValue

DOCUMENT_NODE,
DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE, NOTATION_NODE

**Throws:** DOMException

- DOMSTRING_SIZE_ERR: Raised when it would return more characters than
fit in a

DOMString

variable on the implementation
platform.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- setTextContent

```java
void setTextContent​(
String
textContent)
throws

```

This attribute returns the text content of this node and its
descendants. When it is defined to be

, setting it
has no effect. On setting, any possible children this node may have
are removed and, if it the new string is not empty or

null

- isSameNode

```java
boolean isSameNode​(
Node
other)
```

Returns whether this node is the same node as the given one.

This method provides a way to determine whether two

Node

references returned by the implementation reference
the same object. When two

Node

references are references
to the same object, even if through a proxy, the references may be
used completely interchangeably, such that all attributes have the
same values and calling the same DOM method on either reference
always has exactly the same effect.

**Parameters:** other

- The node to test against.
**Returns:** Returns

true

if the nodes are the same,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- lookupPrefix

```java
String
lookupPrefix​(

this node. The default namespace declarations are ignored by this
method.

See for details on the algorithm used by this method.

**Parameters:** namespaceURI

- The namespace URI to look for.
**Returns:** Returns an associated namespace prefix if found or

null

if none is found. If more than one prefix are
associated to the namespace prefix, the returned namespace prefix
is implementation dependent.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- isDefaultNamespace

```java
boolean isDefaultNamespace​(
String
namespaceURI)
```

This method checks if the specified

namespaceURI

is the
default namespace or not.

**Parameters:** namespaceURI

- The namespace URI to look for.
**Returns:** Returns

true

if the specified

namespaceURI

is the default namespace,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- lookupNamespaceURI

```java
String
lookupNamespaceURI​(
String
prefix)
```

Look up the namespace URI associated to the given prefix, starting from
this node.

See for details on the algorithm used by this method.

**Parameters:** prefix

- The prefix to look for. If this parameter is

null

, the method will return the default namespace URI
if any.
**Returns:** Returns the associated namespace URI or

null

if
none is found.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- isEqualNode

```java
boolean isEqualNode​(
Node
arg)
```

Tests whether two nodes are equal.

This method tests for equality of nodes, not sameness (i.e.,
whether the two nodes are references to the same object) which can be
tested with

Node.isSameNode()

. All nodes that are the
same will also be equal, though the reverse may not be true.

Two nodes are equal if and only if the following conditions are
satisfied:

- The two nodes are of the same type.
- The following string
attributes are equal:

nodeName

,

localName

,

namespaceURI

,

prefix

,

nodeValue

. This is: they are both

null

, or they have the same
length and are character for character identical.
- The

attributes

NamedNodeMaps

are equal. This
is: they are both

null

, or they have the same length and
for each node that exists in one map there is a node that exists in
the other map and is equal, although not necessarily at the same
index.
- The

childNodes

NodeLists

are equal.
This is: they are both

null

, or they have the same
length and contain equal nodes at the same index. Note that
normalization can affect equality; to avoid this, nodes should be
normalized before being compared.

For two

DocumentType

nodes to be equal, the following
conditions must also be satisfied:

- The following string attributes
are equal:

publicId

,

systemId

,

internalSubset

.
- The

entities

NamedNodeMaps

are equal.
- The

notations

NamedNodeMaps

are equal.

On the other hand, the following do not affect equality: the

ownerDocument

,

baseURI

, and

parentNode

attributes, the

specified

attribute for

Attr

nodes, the

schemaTypeInfo

attribute for

Attr

and

Element

nodes, the

Text.isElementContentWhitespace

attribute for

Text

nodes, as well as any user data or event listeners
registered on the nodes.

Note:

As a general rule, anything not mentioned in the
description above is not significant in consideration of equality
checking. Note that future versions of this specification may take
into account more attributes and implementations conform to this
specification are expected to be updated accordingly.

**Parameters:** arg

- The node to compare equality with.
**Returns:** Returns

true

if the nodes are equal,

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getFeature

```java
Object
getFeature​(
String
feature,

String
version)
```

This method returns a specialized object which implements the
specialized APIs of the specified feature and version, as specified
in . The specialized object may also be obtained by using
binding-specific casting methods but is not necessarily expected to,
as discussed in . This method also allow the implementation to
provide specialized objects which do not support the

Node

interface.

**Parameters:** feature

- The name of the feature requested. Note that any plus
sign "+" prepended to the name of the feature will be ignored since
it is not significant in the context of this method.
**Parameters:** version

- This is the version number of the feature to test.
**Returns:** Returns an object which implements the specialized APIs of
the specified feature and version, if any, or

null

if
there is no object which implements interfaces associated with that
feature. If the

DOMObject

returned by this method
implements the

Node

interface, it must delegate to the
primary core

Node

and not return results inconsistent
with the primary core

Node

such as attributes,
childNodes, etc.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- setUserData

```java
Object
setUserData​(
String
key,

null

.
**Returns:** Returns the

DOMUserData

previously associated to
the given key on this node, or

null

if there was none.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getUserData

```java
Object
getUserData​(
String
key)
```

Retrieves the object associated to a key on a this node. The object
must first have been set to this node by calling

setUserData

with the same key.

) and no user data. User
data associated to the imported node is not carried over. However, if
any

UserDataHandlers

has been specified along with the
associated data these handlers will be called with the appropriate
parameters before this method returns.

Cloning an

Element

copies all attributes and their
values, including those generated by the XML processor to represent
defaulted attributes, but this method does not copy any children it
contains unless it is a deep clone. This includes text contained in
an the

Element

since the text is contained in a child

Text

node. Cloning an

Attr

directly, as
opposed to be cloned as part of an

Element

cloning
operation, returns a specified attribute (

specified

is

true

). Cloning an

Attr

always clones its
children, since they represent its value, no matter whether this is a
deep clone or not. Cloning an

EntityReference

automatically constructs its subtree if a corresponding

Entity

is available, no matter whether this is a deep
clone or not. Cloning any other type of node simply returns a copy of
this node.

Note that cloning an immutable subtree results in a mutable copy,
but the children of an

EntityReference

clone are readonly
. In addition, clones of unspecified

Attr

nodes are
specified. And, cloning

Document

,

DocumentType

,

Entity

, and

Notation

nodes is implementation dependent.

**Parameters:** deep

- If

true

, recursively clone the subtree under
the specified node; if

false

, clone only the node
itself (and its attributes, if it is an

Element

).
**Returns:** The duplicate node.

normalize

```java

```

Puts all

Text

nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree
underneath this

Node

, including attribute nodes, into a
"normal" form where only structure (e.g., elements, comments,
processing instructions, CDATA sections, and entity references)
separates

Text

nodes, i.e., there are neither adjacent

Text

nodes nor empty

Text

nodes. This can
be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if
it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as
XPointer [

]
lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to
be used. If the parameter "normalize-characters" of the

DOMConfiguration

object attached to the

Note:

In cases where the document contains

tested with

Node.isSameNode()

. All nodes that are the
same will also be equal, though the reverse may not be true.

Two nodes are equal if and only if the following conditions are
satisfied:

- The two nodes are of the same type.
- The following string
attributes are equal:

nodeName

,

localName

,

namespaceURI

,

prefix

,
