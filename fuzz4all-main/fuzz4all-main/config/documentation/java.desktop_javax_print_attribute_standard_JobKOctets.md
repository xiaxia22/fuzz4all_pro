### Class Description

```java
public final class
JobKOctets

extends
IntegerSyntax

implements
PrintRequestAttribute
,
PrintJobAttribute
```

Class

JobKOctets

is an integer valued printing attribute class that
specifies the total size of the document(s) in K octets, i.e., in units of
1024 octets requested to be processed in the job. The value must be rounded
up, so that a job between 1 and 1024 octets must be indicated as being 1K
octets, 1025 to 2048 must be 2K octets, etc. For a multidoc print job (a job
with multiple documents), the

JobKOctets

value is computed by adding
up the individual documents' sizes in octets, then rounding up to the next K
octets value.

The

JobKOctets

attribute describes the size of the job. This
attribute is not intended to be a counter; it is intended to be useful
routing and scheduling information if known. The printer may try to compute
the

JobKOctets

attribute's value if it is not supplied in the Print
Request. Even if the client does supply a value for the

JobKOctets

attribute in the Print Request, the printer may choose to change the value if
the printer is able to compute a value which is more accurate than the client
supplied value. The printer may be able to determine the correct value for
the

JobKOctets

attribute either right at job submission time or at
any later point in time.

The

JobKOctets

value must not include the multiplicative factors
contributed by the number of copies specified by the

Copies

attribute, independent of whether the device can process multiple copies
without making multiple passes over the job or document data and independent
of whether the output is collated or not. Thus the value is independent of
the implementation and indicates the size of the document(s) measured in K
octets independent of the number of copies.

The

JobKOctets

value must also not include the multiplicative factor
due to a copies instruction embedded in the document data. If the document
data actually includes replications of the document data, this value will
include such replication. In other words, this value is always the size of
the source document data, rather than a measure of the hardcopy output to be
produced.

The size of a doc is computed based on the print data representation class as
specified by the doc's

DocFlavor

, as shown in
the table below.

specified.
