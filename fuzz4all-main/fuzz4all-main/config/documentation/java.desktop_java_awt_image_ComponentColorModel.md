### Class Description

```java
public class
ComponentColorModel

extends
ColorModel
```

A

ColorModel

class that works with pixel values that
represent color and alpha information as separate samples and that
store each sample in a separate data element. This class can be
used with an arbitrary

ColorSpace

. The number of
color samples in the pixel values must be same as the number of
color components in the

ColorSpace

. There may be a
single alpha sample.

For those methods that use
a primitive array pixel representation of type

transferType

,
the array length is the same as the number of color and alpha samples.
Color samples are stored first in the array followed by the alpha
sample, if present. The order of the color samples is specified
by the

ColorSpace

. Typically, this order reflects the
name of the color space type. For example, for

TYPE_RGB

,
index 0 corresponds to red, index 1 to green, and index 2 to blue.

The translation from pixel sample values to color/alpha components for
display or processing purposes is based on a one-to-one correspondence of
samples to components.
Depending on the transfer type used to create an instance of

ComponentColorModel

, the pixel sample values
represented by that instance may be signed or unsigned and may
be of integral type or float or double (see below for details).
The translation from sample values to normalized color/alpha components
must follow certain rules. For float and double samples, the translation
is an identity, i.e. normalized component values are equal to the
corresponding sample values. For integral samples, the translation
should be only a simple scale and offset, where the scale and offset
constants may be different for each component. The result of
applying the scale and offset constants is a set of color/alpha
component values, which are guaranteed to fall within a certain
range. Typically, the range for a color component will be the range
defined by the

getMinValue

and

getMaxValue

methods of the

ColorSpace

class. The range for an
alpha component should be 0.0 to 1.0.

Instances of

ComponentColorModel

created with transfer types

DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT

,
and

DataBuffer.TYPE_INT

have pixel sample values which
are treated as unsigned integral values.
The number of bits in a color or alpha sample of a pixel value might not
be the same as the number of bits for the corresponding color or alpha
sample passed to the

ComponentColorModel(ColorSpace, int[], boolean, boolean, int, int)

constructor. In
that case, this class assumes that the least significant n bits of a sample
value hold the component value, where n is the number of significant bits
for the component passed to the constructor. It also assumes that
any higher-order bits in a sample value are zero. Thus, sample values
range from 0 to 2

n

- 1. This class maps these sample values
to normalized color component values such that 0 maps to the value
obtained from the

ColorSpace's getMinValue

method for each component and 2

n

- 1 maps to the value
obtained from

getMaxValue

. To create a

ComponentColorModel

with a different color sample mapping
requires subclassing this class and overriding the

getNormalizedComponents(Object, float[], int)

method.
The mapping for an alpha sample always maps 0 to 0.0 and
2

n

- 1 to 1.0.

For instances with unsigned sample values,
the unnormalized color/alpha component representation is only
supported if two conditions hold. First, sample value 0 must
map to normalized component value 0.0 and sample value 2

n

- 1
to 1.0. Second the min/max range of all color components of the

ColorSpace

must be 0.0 to 1.0. In this case, the
component representation is the n least
significant bits of the corresponding sample. Thus each component is
an unsigned integral value between 0 and 2

n

- 1, where
n is the number of significant bits for a particular component.
If these conditions are not met, any method taking an unnormalized
component argument will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

.

Instances of

ComponentColorModel

created with transfer types

DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT

, and

DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE

have pixel sample values which
are treated as signed short, float, or double values.
Such instances do not support the unnormalized color/alpha component
representation, so any methods taking such a representation as an argument
will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

when called on one
of these instances. The normalized component values of instances
of this class have a range which depends on the transfer
type as follows: for float samples, the full range of the float data
type; for double samples, the full range of the float data type
(resulting from casting double to float); for short samples,
from approximately -maxVal to +maxVal, where maxVal is the per
component maximum value for the

ColorSpace

(-32767 maps to -maxVal, 0 maps to 0.0, and 32767 maps
to +maxVal). A subclass may override the scaling for short sample
values to normalized component values by overriding the

getNormalizedComponents(Object, float[], int)

method.
For float and double samples, the normalized component values are
taken to be equal to the corresponding sample values, and subclasses
should not attempt to add any non-identity scaling for these transfer
types.

Instances of

ComponentColorModel

created with transfer types

DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT

, and

DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE

use all the bits of all sample values. Thus all color/alpha components
have 16 bits when using

DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT

, 32 bits when
using

DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT

, and 64 bits when using

DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE

. When the

ComponentColorModel(ColorSpace, int[], boolean, boolean, int, int)

form of constructor is used with one of these transfer types, the
bits array argument is ignored.

It is possible to have color/alpha sample values
which cannot be reasonably interpreted as component values for rendering.
This can happen when

ComponentColorModel

is subclassed to
override the mapping of unsigned sample values to normalized color
component values or when signed sample values outside a certain range
are used. (As an example, specifying an alpha component as a signed
short value outside the range 0 to 32767, normalized range 0.0 to 1.0, can
lead to unexpected results.) It is the
responsibility of applications to appropriately scale pixel data before
rendering such that color components fall within the normalized range
of the

ColorSpace

(obtained using the

getMinValue

and

getMaxValue

methods of the

ColorSpace

class)
and the alpha component is between 0.0 and 1.0. If color or alpha
component values fall outside these ranges, rendering results are
indeterminate.

Methods that use a single int pixel representation throw
an

IllegalArgumentException

, unless the number of components
for the

ComponentColorModel

is one and the component
value is unsigned -- in other words, a single color component using
a transfer type of

DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT

, or

DataBuffer.TYPE_INT

and no alpha.

A

ComponentColorModel

can be used in conjunction with a

ComponentSampleModel

, a

BandedSampleModel

,
or a

PixelInterleavedSampleModel

to construct a

BufferedImage

.

```java
public class
ComponentColorModel

extends
ColorModel
```

A

ColorModel

class that works with pixel values that
represent color and alpha information as separate samples and that
store each sample in a separate data element. This class can be
used with an arbitrary

ColorSpace

. The number of
color samples in the pixel values must be same as the number of
color components in the

ColorSpace

. There may be a
single alpha sample.

For those methods that use
a primitive array pixel representation of type

transferType

,
the array length is the same as the number of color and alpha samples.
Color samples are stored first in the array followed by the alpha
sample, if present. The order of the color samples is specified
by the

ColorSpace

. Typically, this order reflects the
name of the color space type. For example, for

TYPE_RGB

,
index 0 corresponds to red, index 1 to green, and index 2 to blue.

The translation from pixel sample values to color/alpha components for
display or processing purposes is based on a one-to-one correspondence of
samples to components.
Depending on the transfer type used to create an instance of

ComponentColorModel

, the pixel sample values
represented by that instance may be signed or unsigned and may
be of integral type or float or double (see below for details).
The translation from sample values to normalized color/alpha components
must follow certain rules. For float and double samples, the translation
is an identity, i.e. normalized component values are equal to the
corresponding sample values. For integral samples, the translation
should be only a simple scale and offset, where the scale and offset
constants may be different for each component. The result of
applying the scale and offset constants is a set of color/alpha
component values, which are guaranteed to fall within a certain
range. Typically, the range for a color component will be the range
defined by the

getMinValue

and

getMaxValue

methods of the

ColorSpace

class. The range for an
alpha component should be 0.0 to 1.0.

Instances of

ComponentColorModel

created with transfer types

DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT

,
and

DataBuffer.TYPE_INT

have pixel sample values which
are treated as unsigned integral values.
The number of bits in a color or alpha sample of a pixel value might not
be the same as the number of bits for the corresponding color or alpha
sample passed to the

ComponentColorModel(ColorSpace, int[], boolean, boolean, int, int)

constructor. In
that case, this class assumes that the least significant n bits of a sample
value hold the component value, where n is the number of significant bits
for the component passed to the constructor. It also assumes that
any higher-order bits in a sample value are zero. Thus, sample values
range from 0 to 2

n

- 1. This class maps these sample values
to normalized color component values such that 0 maps to the value
obtained from the

ColorSpace's getMinValue

method for each component and 2

n

- 1 maps to the value
obtained from

getMaxValue

. To create a

ComponentColorModel

with a different color sample mapping
requires subclassing this class and overriding the

getNormalizedComponents(Object, float[], int)

method.
The mapping for an alpha sample always maps 0 to 0.0 and
2

n

- 1 to 1.0.

For instances with unsigned sample values,
the unnormalized color/alpha component representation is only
supported if two conditions hold. First, sample value 0 must
map to normalized component value 0.0 and sample value 2

n

- 1
to 1.0. Second the min/max range of all color components of the

ColorSpace

must be 0.0 to 1.0. In this case, the
component representation is the n least
significant bits of the corresponding sample. Thus each component is
an unsigned integral value between 0 and 2

n

- 1, where
n is the number of significant bits for a particular component.
If these conditions are not met, any method taking an unnormalized
component argument will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

.

Instances of

ComponentColorModel

created with transfer types

DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT

, and

DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE

have pixel sample values which
are treated as signed short, float, or double values.
Such instances do not support the unnormalized color/alpha component
representation, so any methods taking such a representation as an argument
will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

when called on one
of these instances. The normalized component values of instances
of this class have a range which depends on the transfer
type as follows: for float samples, the full range of the float data
type; for double samples, the full range of the float data type
(resulting from casting double to float); for short samples,
from approximately -maxVal to +maxVal, where maxVal is the per
component maximum value for the

ColorSpace

(-32767 maps to -maxVal, 0 maps to 0.0, and 32767 maps
to +maxVal). A subclass may override the scaling for short sample
values to normalized component values by overriding the

getNormalizedComponents(Object, float[], int)

method.
For float and double samples, the normalized component values are
taken to be equal to the corresponding sample values, and subclasses
should not attempt to add any non-identity scaling for these transfer
types.

Instances of

ComponentColorModel

created with transfer types

DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT

, and

DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE

use all the bits of all sample values. Thus all color/alpha components
have 16 bits when using

DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT

, 32 bits when
using

DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT

, and 64 bits when using

DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE

. When the

ComponentColorModel(ColorSpace, int[], boolean, boolean, int, int)

form of constructor is used with one of these transfer types, the
bits array argument is ignored.

It is possible to have color/alpha sample values
which cannot be reasonably interpreted as component values for rendering.
This can happen when

ComponentColorModel

is subclassed to
override the mapping of unsigned sample values to normalized color
component values or when signed sample values outside a certain range
are used. (As an example, specifying an alpha component as a signed
short value outside the range 0 to 32767, normalized range 0.0 to 1.0, can
lead to unexpected results.) It is the
responsibility of applications to appropriately scale pixel data before
rendering such that color components fall within the normalized range
of the

ColorSpace

(obtained using the

getMinValue

and

getMaxValue

methods of the

ColorSpace

class)
and the alpha component is between 0.0 and 1.0. If color or alpha
component values fall outside these ranges, rendering results are
indeterminate.

Methods that use a single int pixel representation throw
an

IllegalArgumentException

, unless the number of components
for the

ComponentColorModel

is one and the component
value is unsigned -- in other words, a single color component using
a transfer type of

DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT

, or

DataBuffer.TYPE_INT

and no alpha.

range from 0 to 2

n

- 1. This class maps these sample values
to normalized color component values such that 0 maps to the value
obtained from the

ColorSpace's getMinValue

method for each component and 2

n

- 1 maps to the value
obtained from

getMaxValue

. To create a

component representation is the n least

an unsigned integral value between 0 and 2

n is the number of significant bits for a particular component.
If these conditions are not met, any method taking an unnormalized

have 16 bits when using

DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT

, 32 bits when
using

DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT

, and 64 bits when using

DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE

. When the

ComponentColorModel(ColorSpace, int[], boolean, boolean, int, int)

form of constructor is used with one of these transfer types, the
bits array argument is ignored.

It is possible to have color/alpha sample values
which cannot be reasonably interpreted as component values for rendering.
This can happen when

ComponentColorModel

is subclassed to
override the mapping of unsigned sample values to normalized color
component values or when signed sample values outside a certain range
are used. (As an example, specifying an alpha component as a signed
short value outside the range 0 to 32767, normalized range 0.0 to 1.0, can
lead to unexpected results.) It is the
responsibility of applications to appropriately scale pixel data before
rendering such that color components fall within the normalized range
of the

ColorSpace

(obtained using the

getMinValue

and

getMaxValue

methods of the

ColorSpace

class)
and the alpha component is between 0.0 and 1.0. If color or alpha
component values fall outside these ranges, rendering results are
indeterminate.

Methods that use a single int pixel representation throw
an

IllegalArgumentException

, unless the number of components
for the

ComponentColorModel

is one and the component
value is unsigned -- in other words, a single color component using
a transfer type of

DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT

, or

DataBuffer.TYPE_INT

and no alpha.

A

ComponentColorModel

can be used in conjunction with a

ComponentSampleModel

, a

BandedSampleModel

,
or a

PixelInterleavedSampleModel

to construct a

BufferedImage

.

For those methods that use
a primitive array pixel representation of type

transferType

,
the array length is the same as the number of color and alpha samples.
Color samples are stored first in the array followed by the alpha
sample, if present. The order of the color samples is specified
by the

ColorSpace

. Typically, this order reflects the
name of the color space type. For example, for

TYPE_RGB

,
index 0 corresponds to red, index 1 to green, and index 2 to blue.

The translation from pixel sample values to color/alpha components for
display or processing purposes is based on a one-to-one correspondence of
samples to components.
Depending on the transfer type used to create an instance of

ComponentColorModel

, the pixel sample values
represented by that instance may be signed or unsigned and may
be of integral type or float or double (see below for details).
The translation from sample values to normalized color/alpha components
must follow certain rules. For float and double samples, the translation
is an identity, i.e. normalized component values are equal to the
corresponding sample values. For integral samples, the translation
should be only a simple scale and offset, where the scale and offset
constants may be different for each component. The result of
applying the scale and offset constants is a set of color/alpha
component values, which are guaranteed to fall within a certain
range. Typically, the range for a color component will be the range
defined by the

getMinValue

and

getMaxValue

methods of the

ColorSpace

class. The range for an
alpha component should be 0.0 to 1.0.

Instances of

ComponentColorModel

created with transfer types

DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE

,

DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT

,
and

DataBuffer.TYPE_INT

have pixel sample values which
are treated as unsigned integral values.
The number of bits in a color or alpha sample of a pixel value might not
be the same as the number of bits for the corresponding color or alpha
sample passed to the

ComponentColorModel(ColorSpace, int[], boolean, boolean, int, int)

constructor. In
that case, this class assumes that the least significant n bits of a sample
value hold the component value, where n is the number of significant bits
for the component passed to the constructor. It also assumes that
any higher-order bits in a sample value are zero. Thus, sample values
range from 0 to 2

n

- 1. This class maps these sample values
to normalized color component values such that 0 maps to the value
obtained from the

ColorSpace's getMinValue

method for each component and 2

n

- 1 maps to the value
obtained from

getMaxValue

. To create a

ComponentColorModel

with a different color sample mapping
requires subclassing this class and overriding the

getNormalizedComponents(Object, float[], int)

method.
The mapping for an alpha sample always maps 0 to 0.0 and
2

n

- 1 to 1.0.

For instances with unsigned sample values,
the unnormalized color/alpha component representation is only
supported if two conditions hold. First, sample value 0 must
map to normalized component value 0.0 and sample value 2

n

- 1
to 1.0. Second the min/max range of all color components of the

ColorSpace

must be 0.0 to 1.0. In this case, the
component representation is the n least
significant bits of the corresponding sample. Thus each component is
an unsigned integral value between 0 and 2

n

- 1, where
n is the number of significant bits for a particular component.
If these conditions are not met, any method taking an unnormalized
component argument will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

.

ComponentColorModel

created with transfer types

DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT

Such instances do not support the unnormalized color/alpha component
representation, so any methods taking such a representation as an argument
will throw an

IllegalArgumentException

when called on one
of these instances. The normalized component values of instances
of this class have a range which depends on the transfer
type as follows: for float samples, the full range of the float data
type; for double samples, the full range of the float data type
(resulting from casting double to float); for short samples,
from approximately -maxVal to +maxVal, where maxVal is the per
component maximum value for the

ColorSpace

(-32767 maps to -maxVal, 0 maps to 0.0, and 32767 maps
to +maxVal). A subclass may override the scaling for short sample
values to normalized component values by overriding the

getNormalizedComponents(Object, float[], int)

method.
For float and double samples, the normalized component values are
taken to be equal to the corresponding sample values, and subclasses
should not attempt to add any non-identity scaling for these transfer
types.

range from 0 to 2

component representation is the n least

an unsigned integral value between 0 and 2

.

**Overrides:** coerceData

in class

ColorModel
**Parameters:** raster

- the

WritableRaster

data
**Parameters:** isAlphaPremultiplied

-

true

if the alpha is
premultiplied;

false

otherwise
**Returns:** a

ColorModel

object that represents the
coerced data.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

raster

is

null

and data coercion is required.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the transfer type of
this

ComponentColorModel

is not one of the supported transfer types:

DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE

,

#### coerceData

public

ColorModel

coerceData​(

WritableRaster

raster,
boolean isAlphaPremultiplied)

Forces the raster data to match the state specified in the

isAlphaPremultiplied

variable, assuming the data
is currently correctly described by this

ColorModel

.
It may multiply or divide the color raster data by alpha, or
do nothing if the data is in the correct state. If the data needs
to be coerced, this method also returns an instance of
this

ColorModel

with
the

isAlphaPremultiplied

flag set appropriately.
Since

ColorModel

can be subclassed, subclasses inherit
the implementation of this method and if they don't override it
then they throw an exception if they use an unsupported

transferType

.
