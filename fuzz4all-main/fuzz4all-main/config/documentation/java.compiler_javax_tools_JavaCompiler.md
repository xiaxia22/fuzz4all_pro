# Interface JavaCompiler

### Class Description

```java
public interface
JavaCompiler

extends
Tool
,
OptionChecker
```

Interface to invoke Java™ programming language compilers from
programs.

The compiler might generate diagnostics during compilation (for
example, error messages). If a diagnostic listener is provided,
the diagnostics will be supplied to the listener. If no listener
is provided, the diagnostics will be formatted in an unspecified
format and written to the default output, which is

System.err

unless otherwise specified. Even if a diagnostic
listener is supplied, some diagnostics might not fit in a

Diagnostic

and will be written to the default output.

A compiler tool has an associated standard file manager, which
is the file manager that is native to the tool (or built-in). The
standard file manager can be obtained by calling

getStandardFileManager

.

A compiler tool must function with any file manager as long as
any additional requirements as detailed in the methods below are
met. If no file manager is provided, the compiler tool will use a
standard file manager such as the one returned by

getStandardFileManager

.

An instance implementing this interface must conform to

The Java™ Language Specification

and generate class files conforming to

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

.
The versions of these
specifications are defined in the

Tool

interface.

Additionally, an instance of this interface supporting

SourceVersion.RELEASE_6

or higher must also support

annotation processing

.

The compiler relies on two services:

diagnostic listener

and

file manager

. Although most classes and
interfaces in this package defines an API for compilers (and
tools in general) the interfaces

DiagnosticListener

,

JavaFileManager

,

FileObject

, and

JavaFileObject

are not intended to be used in
applications. Instead these interfaces are intended to be
implemented and used to provide customized services for a
compiler and thus defines an SPI for compilers.

There are a number of classes and interfaces in this package
which are designed to ease the implementation of the SPI to
customize the behavior of a compiler:

**StandardJavaFileManager:** Every compiler which implements this interface provides a
standard file manager for operating on regular

files

. The StandardJavaFileManager interface
defines additional methods for creating file objects from
regular files.

The standard file manager serves two purposes:

- basic building block for customizing how a compiler reads
and writes files
- sharing between multiple compilation tasks

Reusing a file manager can potentially reduce overhead of
scanning the file system and reading jar files. Although there
might be no reduction in overhead, a standard file manager must
work with multiple sequential compilations making the following
example a recommended coding pattern:

```java
File[] files1 = ... ; // input for first compilation task
File[] files2 = ... ; // input for second compilation task

JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();
StandardJavaFileManager fileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null);

Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject>
compilationUnits1 =
fileManager.getJavaFileObjectsFromFiles(
Arrays.asList
(files1));
compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, null, null, null, compilationUnits1).call();

Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject>
compilationUnits2 =
fileManager.getJavaFileObjects(files2); // use alternative method
// reuse the same file manager to allow caching of jar files
compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, null, null, null, compilationUnits2).call();

fileManager.close();
```
**DiagnosticCollector:** Used to collect diagnostics in a list, for example:

```java
Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject>
compilationUnits = ...;
JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();

DiagnosticCollector<JavaFileObject> diagnostics = new DiagnosticCollector<JavaFileObject>();

StandardJavaFileManager fileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(diagnostics, null, null);
compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, diagnostics, null, null, compilationUnits).call();

for (
Diagnostic<? extends JavaFileObject>
diagnostic : diagnostics.getDiagnostics())
System.out.format("Error on line %d in %s%n",
diagnostic.getLineNumber(),
diagnostic.getSource().toUri());

fileManager.close();
```
**ForwardingJavaFileManager , ForwardingFileObject , and ForwardingJavaFileObject:** Subclassing is not available for overriding the behavior of a
standard file manager as it is created by calling a method on a
compiler, not by invoking a constructor. Instead forwarding
(or delegation) should be used. These classes makes it easy to
forward most calls to a given file manager or file object while
allowing customizing behavior. For example, consider how to
log all calls to

JavaFileManager.flush()

:

```java
final Logger logger = ...;

Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject>
compilationUnits = ...;
JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();
StandardJavaFileManager stdFileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null);
JavaFileManager fileManager = new ForwardingJavaFileManager(stdFileManager) {
public void flush() throws IOException {
logger.entering(StandardJavaFileManager.class.getName(), "flush");
super.flush();
logger.exiting(StandardJavaFileManager.class.getName(), "flush");
}
};
compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, null, null, null, compilationUnits).call();
```
**SimpleJavaFileObject:** This class provides a basic file object implementation which
can be used as building block for creating file objects. For
example, here is how to define a file object which represent
source code stored in a string:

```java
/**
* A file object used to represent source coming from a string.

*
/
public class JavaSourceFromString extends SimpleJavaFileObject {
/**
* The source code of this "file".

*
/
final String code;

/**
* Constructs a new JavaSourceFromString.
*
@
param name the name of the compilation unit represented by this file object
*
@
param code the source code for the compilation unit represented by this file object

*
/
JavaSourceFromString(String name, String code) {
super(
URI.create
("string:///" + name.replace('.','/') + Kind.SOURCE.extension),
Kind.SOURCE);
this.code = code;
}

@
Override
public CharSequence getCharContent(boolean ignoreEncodingErrors) {
return code;
}
}
```

Creates a future for a compilation task with the given
components and arguments. The compilation might not have
completed as described in the CompilationTask interface.

If a file manager is provided, it must be able to handle all
locations defined in

StandardLocation

.

Note that annotation processing can process both the
compilation units of source code to be compiled, passed with
the

compilationUnits

parameter, as well as class
files, whose names are passed with the

classes

parameter.

**Parameters:**
- out

- a Writer for additional output from the compiler;
use

System.err

if

null
- fileManager

- a file manager; if

null

use the
compiler's standard filemanager
- diagnosticListener

- a diagnostic listener; if

null

use the compiler's default method for reporting
diagnostics
- options

- compiler options,

null

means no options
- classes

- names of classes to be processed by annotation
processing,

null

means no class names
- compilationUnits

- the compilation units to compile,

null

means no compilation units

**Returns:**
- an object representing the compilation

**Throws:**
- RuntimeException

- if an unrecoverable error
occurred in a user supplied component. The

cause

will be the error in
user code.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if any of the options are invalid,
or if any of the given compilation units are of other kind than

source

Returns a new instance of the standard file manager implementation
for this tool. The file manager will use the given diagnostic
listener for producing any non-fatal diagnostics. Fatal errors
will be signaled with the appropriate exceptions.

The standard file manager will be automatically reopened if
it is accessed after calls to

flush

or

close

.
The standard file manager must be usable with other tools.

**Parameters:**
- diagnosticListener

- a diagnostic listener for non-fatal
diagnostics; if

null

use the compiler's default method
for reporting diagnostics

StandardJavaFileManager stdFileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null);
JavaFileManager fileManager = new ForwardingJavaFileManager(stdFileManager) {
public void flush() throws IOException {
logger.entering(StandardJavaFileManager.class.getName(), "flush");
super.flush();
logger.exiting(StandardJavaFileManager.class.getName(), "flush");
}
};
compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, null, null, null, compilationUnits).call();
```
**SimpleJavaFileObject:** This class provides a basic file object implementation which
can be used as building block for creating file objects. For
example, here is how to define a file object which represent
source code stored in a string:

```java
/**
* A file object used to represent source coming from a string.

*
/
public class JavaSourceFromString extends SimpleJavaFileObject {
/**
* The source code of this "file".

*
/
final String code;

/**
* Constructs a new JavaSourceFromString.
*
@
param name the name of the compilation unit represented by this file object
*
@
param code the source code for the compilation unit represented by this file object

*
/
JavaSourceFromString(String name, String code) {
super(
URI.create
("string:///" + name.replace('.','/') + Kind.SOURCE.extension),
Kind.SOURCE);
this.code = code;

**SimpleJavaFileObject:** This class provides a basic file object implementation which
can be used as building block for creating file objects. For
example, here is how to define a file object which represent
source code stored in a string:

```java
/**
* A file object used to represent source coming from a string.

*
/
public class JavaSourceFromString extends SimpleJavaFileObject {
/**
* The source code of this "file".

*
/
final String code;

/**
* Constructs a new JavaSourceFromString.
*
@
param name the name of the compilation unit represented by this file object
*
@
param code the source code for the compilation unit represented by this file object

*
/
JavaSourceFromString(String name, String code) {
super(
URI.create
("string:///" + name.replace('.','/') + Kind.SOURCE.extension),
Kind.SOURCE);
this.code = code;
}

@
Override
public CharSequence getCharContent(boolean ignoreEncodingErrors) {
return code;
}
}
```

A compiler tool must function with any file manager as long as
any additional requirements as detailed in the methods below are
met. If no file manager is provided, the compiler tool will use a
standard file manager such as the one returned by

getStandardFileManager

.

An instance implementing this interface must conform to

The Java™ Language Specification

and generate class files conforming to

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

.
The versions of these
specifications are defined in the

Tool

interface.

Additionally, an instance of this interface supporting

SourceVersion.RELEASE_6

or higher must also support

annotation processing

.

The compiler relies on two services:

diagnostic listener

and

file manager

. Although most classes and
interfaces in this package defines an API for compilers (and
tools in general) the interfaces

DiagnosticListener

,

JavaFileManager

,

FileObject

, and

JavaFileObject

are not intended to be used in
applications. Instead these interfaces are intended to be
implemented and used to provide customized services for a
compiler and thus defines an SPI for compilers.

There are a number of classes and interfaces in this package
which are designed to ease the implementation of the SPI to
customize the behavior of a compiler:

**StandardJavaFileManager:** Every compiler which implements this interface provides a
standard file manager for operating on regular

files

. The StandardJavaFileManager interface
defines additional methods for creating file objects from
regular files.

The standard file manager serves two purposes:

- basic building block for customizing how a compiler reads
and writes files
- sharing between multiple compilation tasks

Reusing a file manager can potentially reduce overhead of
scanning the file system and reading jar files. Although there
might be no reduction in overhead, a standard file manager must
work with multiple sequential compilations making the following
example a recommended coding pattern:

```java
File[] files1 = ... ; // input for first compilation task
File[] files2 = ... ; // input for second compilation task

JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();
StandardJavaFileManager fileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null);

Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject>
compilationUnits1 =
fileManager.getJavaFileObjectsFromFiles(
Arrays.asList
(files1));
compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, null, null, null, compilationUnits1).call();

Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject>
compilationUnits2 =
fileManager.getJavaFileObjects(files2); // use alternative method
// reuse the same file manager to allow caching of jar files
compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, null, null, null, compilationUnits2).call();

fileManager.close();
```
**DiagnosticCollector:** Used to collect diagnostics in a list, for example:

```java
Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject>
compilationUnits = ...;
JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();

DiagnosticCollector<JavaFileObject> diagnostics = new DiagnosticCollector<JavaFileObject>();

StandardJavaFileManager fileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(diagnostics, null, null);
compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, diagnostics, null, null, compilationUnits).call();

for (
Diagnostic<? extends JavaFileObject>
diagnostic : diagnostics.getDiagnostics())
System.out.format("Error on line %d in %s%n",
diagnostic.getLineNumber(),
diagnostic.getSource().toUri());

fileManager.close();
```
**ForwardingJavaFileManager , ForwardingFileObject , and ForwardingJavaFileObject:** Subclassing is not available for overriding the behavior of a
standard file manager as it is created by calling a method on a
compiler, not by invoking a constructor. Instead forwarding
(or delegation) should be used. These classes makes it easy to
forward most calls to a given file manager or file object while
allowing customizing behavior. For example, consider how to
log all calls to

JavaFileManager.flush()

:

```java
final Logger logger = ...;

Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject>
compilationUnits = ...;
JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();
StandardJavaFileManager stdFileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null);
JavaFileManager fileManager = new ForwardingJavaFileManager(stdFileManager) {
public void flush() throws IOException {
logger.entering(StandardJavaFileManager.class.getName(), "flush");
super.flush();
logger.exiting(StandardJavaFileManager.class.getName(), "flush");
}
};
compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, null, null, null, compilationUnits).call();
```
**SimpleJavaFileObject:** This class provides a basic file object implementation which

*
/
public class JavaSourceFromString extends SimpleJavaFileObject {
/**
* The source code of this "file".

*
/
final String code;

/**
* Constructs a new JavaSourceFromString.
*
@
param name the name of the compilation unit represented by this file object
*
@
param code the source code for the compilation unit represented by this file object

*
/
JavaSourceFromString(String name, String code) {
super(
URI.create
("string:///" + name.replace('.','/') + Kind.SOURCE.extension),
Kind.SOURCE);
this.code = code;
}

@
Override
public CharSequence getCharContent(boolean ignoreEncodingErrors) {
return code;
}
}
```

Method Detail

- getTask

```java
JavaCompiler.CompilationTask
getTask​(
Writer
out,

JavaFileManager
fileManager,

DiagnosticListener
<? super
JavaFileObject

```

Creates a future for a compilation task with the given
components and arguments. The compilation might not have
completed as described in the CompilationTask interface.

If a file manager is provided, it must be able to handle all
locations defined in

StandardLocation

.

Note that annotation processing can process both the
compilation units of source code to be compiled, passed with
the

compilationUnits

parameter, as well as class
files, whose names are passed with the

classes

parameter.

**Parameters:** out

- a Writer for additional output from the compiler;
use

System.err

if

null
**Parameters:** fileManager

- a file manager; if

null

use the
compiler's standard filemanager
**Parameters:** diagnosticListener

- a diagnostic listener; if

null

use the compiler's default method for reporting
diagnostics
**Parameters:** options

- compiler options,

null

means no options
**Parameters:** classes

- names of classes to be processed by annotation
processing,

null

means no class names
**Parameters:** compilationUnits

- the compilation units to compile,

null

means no compilation units
**Returns:** an object representing the compilation
**Throws:** RuntimeException

- if an unrecoverable error
occurred in a user supplied component. The

cause

will be the error in
user code.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if any of the options are invalid,
or if any of the given compilation units are of other kind than

source

- getStandardFileManager

```java

Locale
locale,

Charset
charset)
```

Returns a new instance of the standard file manager implementation
for this tool. The file manager will use the given diagnostic
listener for producing any non-fatal diagnostics. Fatal errors
will be signaled with the appropriate exceptions.

The standard file manager will be automatically reopened if
it is accessed after calls to

flush

or

close

.
The standard file manager must be usable with other tools.

**Parameters:** diagnosticListener

- a diagnostic listener for non-fatal
diagnostics; if

null

use the compiler's default method
for reporting diagnostics
**Parameters:** locale
