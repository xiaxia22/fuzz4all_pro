# Class Package

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\Package.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Package

extends
Object

implements
AnnotatedElement
```

Represents metadata about a run-time package associated with a class loader.
Metadata includes annotations, versioning, and sealing.

Annotations for the run-time package are read from

package-info.class

at the same code source as classes in the run-time package.

The set of classes that make up the run-time package may implement a
particular specification. The specification title, version, and vendor
(indicating the owner/maintainer of the specification) can be provided
when the

Package

is defined. An application can ask if the

Package

is compatible with a particular specification version
by using the

Package.isCompatibleWith(String)

method. In addition, information about the actual classes that make up the
run-time package can be provided when the Package is defined.
This information consists of an implementation title, version, and vendor
(indicating the supplier of the classes).

A

Package

may be explicitly defined with
the

ClassLoader.definePackage(String, String, String, String,
String, String, String, URL)

method.
The caller supplies the specification and implementation titles, versions, and
vendors. The caller also indicates whether the package is

sealed

.
If a

Package

is not explicitly defined for a run-time package when
a class in that run-time package is defined, then a

Package

is
automatically defined by the class's defining class loader, as follows.

A

Package

automatically defined for classes in a named module has
the following properties:

- The name of the package is derived from the

binary names

of the classes. Since classes in a named module must be in a named package,
the derived name is never empty.
- The package is sealed with the

module location

as the code source, if known.
- The specification and implementation titles, versions, and vendors
are unspecified.
- Any annotations on the package are read from

package-info.class

as specified above.

A

Package

automatically defined for classes in an unnamed module
has the following properties:

- The name of the package is either

""

(for classes in an unnamed package)
or derived from the

binary names

of the classes
(for classes in a named package).
- The package is not sealed.
- The specification and implementation titles, versions, and vendors
are unspecified.
- Any annotations on the package are read from

package-info.class

as specified above.

A

Package

can be obtained with the

Package.getPackage(String)

and

ClassLoader.getDefinedPackage(String)

methods.
Every

Package

defined by a class loader can be obtained
with the

Package.getPackages()

and

ClassLoader.getDefinedPackages()

methods.

### Method Details

#### public
String
getName()

Return the name of this package.

**Returns:**
- The fully-qualified name of this package as defined in section 6.5.3 of

The Java™ Language Specification

,
for example,

java.lang

---

#### public
String
getSpecificationTitle()

Return the title of the specification that this package implements.

**Returns:**
- the specification title,

null

is returned if it is not known.

---

#### public
String
getSpecificationVersion()

Returns the version number of the specification
that this package implements.
This version string must be a sequence of non-negative decimal
integers separated by "."'s and may have leading zeros.
When version strings are compared the most significant
numbers are compared.

Specification version numbers use a syntax that consists of non-negative
decimal integers separated by periods ".", for example "2.0" or
"1.2.3.4.5.6.7". This allows an extensible number to be used to represent
major, minor, micro, etc. versions. The version specification is described
by the following formal grammar:

---

#### public
String
getSpecificationVendor()

Return the name of the organization, vendor,
or company that owns and maintains the specification
of the classes that implement this package.

**Returns:**
- the specification vendor,

null

is returned if it is not known.

---

#### public
String
getImplementationTitle()

Return the title of this package.

**Returns:**
- the title of the implementation,

null

is returned if it is not known.

---

#### public
String
getImplementationVersion()

Return the version of this implementation. It consists of any string
assigned by the vendor of this implementation and does
not have any particular syntax specified or expected by the Java
runtime. It may be compared for equality with other
package version strings used for this implementation
by this vendor for this package.

**Returns:**
- the version of the implementation,

null

is returned if it is not known.

---

#### public
String
getImplementationVendor()

Returns the vendor that implemented this package,

null

is returned if it is not known.

**Returns:**
- the vendor that implemented this package,

null

is returned if it is not known.

---

#### public boolean isSealed()

Returns true if this package is sealed.

**Returns:**
- true if the package is sealed, false otherwise

---

#### public boolean isSealed​(
URL
url)

Returns true if this package is sealed with respect to the specified
code source

url

.

**Parameters:**
- url

- the code source URL

**Returns:**
- true if this package is sealed with respect to the given

url

---

#### public boolean isCompatibleWith​(
String
desired)
throws
NumberFormatException

Compare this package's specification version with a
desired version. It returns true if
this packages specification version number is greater than or equal
to the desired version number.

Version numbers are compared by sequentially comparing corresponding
components of the desired and specification strings.
Each component is converted as a decimal integer and the values
compared.
If the specification value is greater than the desired
value true is returned. If the value is less false is returned.
If the values are equal the period is skipped and the next pair of
components is compared.

**Parameters:**
- desired

- the version string of the desired version.

**Returns:**
- true if this package's version number is greater
than or equal to the desired version number

**Throws:**
- NumberFormatException

- if the current version is not known or
the desired or current version is not of the correct dotted form.

for a

Package

of the given name.

Calling this method is equivalent to calling

ClassLoader.getPackage(java.lang.String)

on a

ClassLoader

instance which is the caller's class loader.

**Parameters:**
- name

- A package name, such as "

java.lang

".

**Returns:**
- The

Package

of the given name defined by the caller's
class loader or its ancestors, or

null

if not found.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

name

Package

object of the same package name, each defined by
a different class loader in the class loader hierarchy.

Calling this method is equivalent to calling

ClassLoader.getPackages()

on a

ClassLoader

instance which is the caller's class loader.

**Returns:**
- The array of

Package

objects defined by this
class loader and its ancestors

This information consists of an implementation title, version, and vendor
(indicating the supplier of the classes).

A

Package

may be explicitly defined with
the

ClassLoader.definePackage(String, String, String, String,
String, String, String, URL)

method.
The caller supplies the specification and implementation titles, versions, and

sealed

.
If a

Package

is not explicitly defined for a run-time package when
a class in that run-time package is defined, then a

Package

is
automatically defined by the class's defining class loader, as follows.

A

as specified above.

A

Package

automatically defined for classes in an unnamed module
has the following properties:

- The name of the package is either

""

(for classes in an unnamed package)
or derived from the

binary names

of the classes
(for classes in a named package).
- The package is not sealed.
- The specification and implementation titles, versions, and vendors

A

Package

can be obtained with the

and

ClassLoader.getDefinedPackage(String)

methods.
Every

Package

defined by a class loader can be obtained
with the

Package.getPackages()

and

ClassLoader.getDefinedPackages()

methods.

**Implementation Note:** The

builtin class loaders

do not explicitly define

Package

objects for packages in

named modules

. Instead those packages are automatically defined
and have no specification and implementation versioning information.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getName

```java
public
String
getName()
```

Return the name of this package.

**Returns:** The fully-qualified name of this package as defined in section 6.5.3 of

The Java™ Language Specification

,
for example,

java.lang

- getSpecificationTitle

```java
public
String
getSpecificationTitle()
```

Return the title of the specification that this package implements.

**Returns:** the specification title,

null

is returned if it is not known.

- getSpecificationVersion

```java
public
String
getSpecificationVersion()
```

Returns the version number of the specification
that this package implements.
This version string must be a sequence of non-negative decimal
integers separated by "."'s and may have leading zeros.
When version strings are compared the most significant
numbers are compared.

Specification version numbers use a syntax that consists of non-negative
decimal integers separated by periods ".", for example "2.0" or
"1.2.3.4.5.6.7". This allows an extensible number to be used to represent
major, minor, micro, etc. versions. The version specification is described
by the following formal grammar:

**Returns:** the specification version,

null

is returned if it is not known.

- getSpecificationVendor

```java
public
String
getSpecificationVendor()
```

Return the name of the organization, vendor,
or company that owns and maintains the specification
of the classes that implement this package.

**Returns:** the specification vendor,

null

is returned if it is not known.

- getImplementationTitle

```java
public
String
getImplementationTitle()
```

Return the title of this package.

**Returns:** the title of the implementation,

null

is returned if it is not known.

- getImplementationVersion

```java
public
String
getImplementationVersion()
```

Return the version of this implementation. It consists of any string
assigned by the vendor of this implementation and does
not have any particular syntax specified or expected by the Java
runtime. It may be compared for equality with other
package version strings used for this implementation
by this vendor for this package.

**Returns:** the version of the implementation,

null

is returned if it is not known.

- getImplementationVendor

```java
public
String
getImplementationVendor()
```

Returns the vendor that implemented this package,

null

is returned if it is not known.

**Returns:** the vendor that implemented this package,

null

is returned if it is not known.

- isSealed

```java
public boolean isSealed()
```

Returns true if this package is sealed.

**Returns:** true if the package is sealed, false otherwise

- isSealed

```java
public boolean isSealed​(
URL
url)
```

Returns true if this package is sealed with respect to the specified
code source

url

.

**Parameters:** url

- the code source URL
**Returns:** true if this package is sealed with respect to the given

url

- isCompatibleWith

```java
public boolean isCompatibleWith​(
String
desired)
throws
NumberFormatException
```

Compare this package's specification version with a
desired version. It returns true if
this packages specification version number is greater than or equal
to the desired version number.

Version numbers are compared by sequentially comparing corresponding
components of the desired and specification strings.
Each component is converted as a decimal integer and the values
compared.
If the specification value is greater than the desired
value true is returned. If the value is less false is returned.
If the values are equal the period is skipped and the next pair of
components is compared.

**Parameters:** desired

- the version string of the desired version.
**Returns:** true if this package's version number is greater
than or equal to the desired version number
**Throws:** NumberFormatException

- if the current version is not known or
the desired or current version is not of the correct dotted form.

- getPackage

```java
@Deprecated
(
since
="9")
public static
Package
getPackage​(
String
name)
```

Deprecated.

If multiple class loaders delegate to each other and define classes
with the same package name, and one such loader relies on the lookup
behavior of

getPackage

to return a

Package

from
a parent loader, then the properties exposed by the

Package

may not be as expected in the rest of the program.
For example, the

Package

will only expose annotations from the

package-info.class

file defined by the parent loader, even if
annotations exist in a

package-info.class

file defined by
a child loader. A more robust approach is to use the

ClassLoader.getDefinedPackage(java.lang.String)

method which returns
a

Package

for the specified class loader.

Finds a package by name in the caller's class loader and its
ancestors.

If the caller's class loader defines a

Package

of the given name,
the

Package

is returned. Otherwise, the ancestors of the
caller's class loader are searched recursively (parent by parent)
for a

Package

of the given name.

Calling this method is equivalent to calling

ClassLoader.getPackage(java.lang.String)

on a

ClassLoader

instance which is the caller's class loader.

**Parameters:** name

- A package name, such as "

java.lang

".
**Returns:** The

Package

of the given name defined by the caller's
class loader or its ancestors, or

null

if not found.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
**See Also:** ClassLoader.getDefinedPackage(java.lang.String)

- getPackages

```java
public static
Package
[] getPackages()
```

Returns all of the

Package

s defined by the caller's class loader
and its ancestors. The returned array may contain more than one

Package

object of the same package name, each defined by
a different class loader in the class loader hierarchy.

Calling this method is equivalent to calling

ClassLoader.getPackages()

on a

ClassLoader

instance which is the caller's class loader.

**Returns:** The array of

Package

objects defined by this
class loader and its ancestors
**See Also:** ClassLoader.getDefinedPackages()

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Return the hash code computed from the package name.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** the hash code computed from the package name.
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the string representation of this Package.
Its value is the string "package " and the package name.
If the package title is defined it is appended.
If the package version is defined it is appended.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** the string representation of the package.

```java
public <A extends
Annotation
> A getAnnotation​(
Class
<A> annotationClass)
```

directly present

or

indirectly present

. This method ignores inherited
annotations.

If there are no specified annotations directly or indirectly
present on this element, the return value is an array of length
0.

The difference between this method and

AnnotatedElement.getDeclaredAnnotation(Class)

is that this method detects if its
argument is a

repeatable annotation type

(JLS 9.6), and if so,
attempts to find one or more annotations of that type by "looking
through" a container annotation if one is present.

The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

getSpecificationVersion

```java
public
String
getSpecificationVersion()
```

Returns the version number of the specification
that this package implements.
This version string must be a sequence of non-negative decimal
integers separated by "."'s and may have leading zeros.
When version strings are compared the most significant
numbers are compared.

Specification version numbers use a syntax that consists of non-negative
decimal integers separated by periods ".", for example "2.0" or
"1.2.3.4.5.6.7". This allows an extensible number to be used to represent
major, minor, micro, etc. versions. The version specification is described
by the following formal grammar:

**Returns:** the specification version,

null

is returned if it is not known.

getPackage

```java
@Deprecated
(
since
="9")
public static
Package
getPackage​(
String
name)
```

Deprecated.

If multiple class loaders delegate to each other and define classes
with the same package name, and one such loader relies on the lookup
behavior of

getPackage

to return a

Package

from
a parent loader, then the properties exposed by the

Package

may not be as expected in the rest of the program.
For example, the

Package

will only expose annotations from the

package-info.class

file defined by the parent loader, even if
annotations exist in a

package-info.class

file defined by
a child loader. A more robust approach is to use the

ClassLoader.getDefinedPackage(java.lang.String)

method which returns
a

Package

for the specified class loader.

Finds a package by name in the caller's class loader and its
ancestors.

If the caller's class loader defines a

Package

of the given name,
the

Package

is returned. Otherwise, the ancestors of the
caller's class loader are searched recursively (parent by parent)
for a

Package

of the given name.

Calling this method is equivalent to calling

ClassLoader.getPackage(java.lang.String)

on a

ClassLoader

instance which is the caller's class loader.

**Parameters:** name

- A package name, such as "

java.lang

".
**Returns:** The

Package

of the given name defined by the caller's
class loader or its ancestors, or

null

if not found.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is

null

.
