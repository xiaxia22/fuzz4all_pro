# Class AttachProvider

**Source:** `jdk.attach\com\sun\tools\attach\spi\AttachProvider.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
AttachProvider

extends
Object
```

Attach provider class for attaching to a Java virtual machine.

An attach provider is a concrete subclass of this class that has a
zero-argument constructor and implements the abstract methods specified
below.

An attach provider implementation is typically tied to a Java virtual
machine implementation, version, or even mode of operation. That is, a specific
provider implementation will typically only be capable of attaching to
a specific Java virtual machine implementation or version. For example, Sun's
JDK implementation ships with provider implementations that can only attach to
Sun's

HotSpot

virtual machine. In general, if an environment
consists of Java virtual machines of different versions and from different
vendors then there will be an attach provider implementation for each

family

of implementations or versions.

An attach provider is identified by its

name

and

type

. The

name

is typically, but not required to
be, a name that corresponds to the VM vendor. The Sun JDK implementation,
for example, ships with attach providers that use the name

"sun"

. The

type

typically corresponds to the attach mechanism. For example, an
implementation that uses the Doors inter-process communication mechanism
might use the type

"doors"

. The purpose of the name and type is to
identify providers in environments where there are multiple providers
installed.

AttachProvider implementations are loaded and instantiated at the first
invocation of the

providers

method. This method
attempts to load all provider implementations that are installed on the
platform.

All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple
concurrent threads.

#### public abstract
VirtualMachine
attachVirtualMachine​(
String
id)
throws
AttachNotSupportedException
,

IOException

Attaches to a Java virtual machine.

A Java virtual machine is identified by an abstract identifier. The
nature of this identifier is platform dependent but in many cases it will be the
string representation of the process identifier (or pid).

This method parses the identifier and maps the identifier to a Java
virtual machine (in an implementation dependent manner). If the identifier
cannot be parsed by the provider then an

AttachNotSupportedException

is thrown. Once parsed this method attempts to attach to the Java virtual machine.
If the provider detects that the identifier corresponds to a Java virtual machine
that does not exist, or it corresponds to a Java virtual machine that does not support
the attach mechanism implemented by this provider, or it detects that the
Java virtual machine is a version to which this provider cannot attach, then
an

AttachNotSupportedException

is thrown.

**Parameters:**
- id

- The abstract identifier that identifies the Java virtual machine.

**Returns:**
- VirtualMachine representing the target virtual machine.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

AttachPermission

("

attachVirtualMachine

"), or other permission
required by the implementation.
- AttachNotSupportedException

- If the identifier cannot be parsed, or it corresponds to
to a Java virtual machine that does not exist, or it
corresponds to a Java virtual machine which this
provider cannot attach.
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
- NullPointerException

- If

id

is

null

---

#### public
VirtualMachine
attachVirtualMachine​(
VirtualMachineDescriptor
vmd)
throws
AttachNotSupportedException
,

IOException

Attaches to a Java virtual machine.

A Java virtual machine can be described using a

VirtualMachineDescriptor

.
This method invokes the descriptor's

provider()

method
to check that it is equal to this provider. It then attempts to attach to the
Java virtual machine.

**Parameters:**
- vmd

- The virtual machine descriptor

**Returns:**
- VirtualMachine representing the target virtual machine.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

AttachPermission

("

attachVirtualMachine

"), or other permission
required by the implementation.
- AttachNotSupportedException

- If the descriptor's

provider()

method returns a provider that is not this provider, or it does not
correspond to a Java virtual machine to which this provider can attach.
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
- NullPointerException

- If

vmd

is

null

---

#### public abstract
List
<
VirtualMachineDescriptor
> listVirtualMachines()

Lists the Java virtual machines known to this provider.

This method returns a list of

VirtualMachineDescriptor

elements. Each

VirtualMachineDescriptor

describes a Java virtual machine
to which this provider can

potentially

attach. There isn't any
guarantee that invoking

attachVirtualMachine

on each descriptor in the list will succeed.

**Returns:**
- The list of virtual machine descriptors which describe the
Java virtual machines known to this provider (may be empty).

---

#### public static
List
<
AttachProvider
> providers()

Returns a list of the installed attach providers.

An AttachProvider is installed on the platform if:

- It is installed in a JAR file that is visible to the defining
class loader of the AttachProvider type (usually, but not required
to be, the

system
class loader

).
- The JAR file contains a provider configuration named

com.sun.tools.attach.spi.AttachProvider

in the resource directory

META-INF/services

.
- The provider configuration file lists the full-qualified class
name of the AttachProvider implementation.

The format of the provider configuration file is one fully-qualified
class name per line. Space and tab characters surrounding each class name,
as well as blank lines are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

0x23

), and on each line all characters following
the first comment character are ignored. The file must be encoded in
UTF-8.

AttachProvider implementations are loaded and instantiated
(using the zero-arg constructor) at the first invocation of this method.
The list returned by the first invocation of this method is the list
of providers. Subsequent invocations of this method return a list of the same
providers. The list is unmodifiable.

**Returns:**
- A list of the installed attach providers.

is thrown. Once parsed this method attempts to attach to the Java virtual machine.
If the provider detects that the identifier corresponds to a Java virtual machine
that does not exist, or it corresponds to a Java virtual machine that does not support
the attach mechanism implemented by this provider, or it detects that the
Java virtual machine is a version to which this provider cannot attach, then
an

AttachNotSupportedException

is thrown.

attachVirtualMachine

```java
public
VirtualMachine
attachVirtualMachine​(
VirtualMachineDescriptor
vmd)
throws
AttachNotSupportedException
,

IOException
```

Attaches to a Java virtual machine.

A Java virtual machine can be described using a

VirtualMachineDescriptor

.
This method invokes the descriptor's

provider()

method
to check that it is equal to this provider. It then attempts to attach to the
Java virtual machine.

**Parameters:** vmd

- The virtual machine descriptor
**Returns:** VirtualMachine representing the target virtual machine.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

AttachPermission

("

attachVirtualMachine

"), or other permission
required by the implementation.
**Throws:** AttachNotSupportedException

- If the descriptor's

provider()

method returns a provider that is not this provider, or it does not
correspond to a Java virtual machine to which this provider can attach.
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

vmd

is

null

```

Lists the Java virtual machines known to this provider.

This method returns a list of

VirtualMachineDescriptor

elements. Each

VirtualMachineDescriptor

describes a Java virtual machine
to which this provider can

potentially

attach. There isn't any
guarantee that invoking

attachVirtualMachine

on each descriptor in the list will succeed.

**Returns:** The list of virtual machine descriptors which describe the
Java virtual machines known to this provider (may be empty).

Returns a list of the installed attach providers.

An AttachProvider is installed on the platform if:

- It is installed in a JAR file that is visible to the defining
class loader of the AttachProvider type (usually, but not required
to be, the

system
class loader

).
- The JAR file contains a provider configuration named

com.sun.tools.attach.spi.AttachProvider

in the resource directory

META-INF/services

.
- The provider configuration file lists the full-qualified class
name of the AttachProvider implementation.

The format of the provider configuration file is one fully-qualified
class name per line. Space and tab characters surrounding each class name,
as well as blank lines are ignored. The comment character is

'#'

(

0x23

), and on each line all characters following
the first comment character are ignored. The file must be encoded in
UTF-8.

AttachProvider implementations are loaded and instantiated
(using the zero-arg constructor) at the first invocation of this method.
The list returned by the first invocation of this method is the list
of providers. Subsequent invocations of this method return a list of the same
providers. The list is unmodifiable.

**Returns:** A list of the installed attach providers.
