# Class URLConnection

**Source:** `java.base\java\net\URLConnection.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
URLConnection

extends
Object
```

The abstract class

URLConnection

is the superclass
of all classes that represent a communications link between the
application and a URL. Instances of this class can be used both to
read from and to write to the resource referenced by the URL.

In general, creating a connection to a URL is a multistep process:

- The connection object is created by invoking the

openConnection

method on a URL.

The setup parameters and general request properties are manipulated.

The actual connection to the remote object is made, using the

connect

method.

The remote object becomes available. The header fields and the contents
of the remote object can be accessed.

The setup parameters are modified using the following methods:

- setAllowUserInteraction

setDoInput

setDoOutput

setIfModifiedSince

setUseCaches

and the general request properties are modified using the method:

- setRequestProperty

Default values for the

AllowUserInteraction

and

UseCaches

parameters can be set using the methods

setDefaultAllowUserInteraction

and

setDefaultUseCaches

.

Each of the above

set

methods has a corresponding

get

method to retrieve the value of the parameter or
general request property. The specific parameters and general
request properties that are applicable are protocol specific.

The following methods are used to access the header fields and
the contents after the connection is made to the remote object:

- getContent

getHeaderField

getInputStream

getOutputStream

Certain header fields are accessed frequently. The methods:

- getContentEncoding

getContentLength

getContentType

getDate

getExpiration

getLastModified

provide convenient access to these fields. The

getContentType

method is used by the

getContent

method to determine the type of the remote
object; subclasses may find it convenient to override the

getContentType

method.

In the common case, all of the pre-connection parameters and
general request properties can be ignored: the pre-connection
parameters and request properties default to sensible values. For
most clients of this interface, there are only two interesting
methods:

getInputStream

and

getContent

,
which are mirrored in the

URL

class by convenience methods.

More information on the request properties and header fields of
an

http

connection can be found at:

```java
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt
```

Invoking the

close()

methods on the

InputStream

or

OutputStream

of an

URLConnection

after a request may free network resources associated with this
instance, unless particular protocol specifications specify different behaviours
for it.

**Direct Known Subclasses:** HttpURLConnection

### Field Details

#### protected
URL
url

The URL represents the remote object on the World Wide Web to
which this connection is opened.

The value of this field can be accessed by the

getURL

method.

The default value of this variable is the value of the URL
argument in the

URLConnection

constructor.

**See Also:**
- getURL()

,

url

---

#### protected boolean doInput

This variable is set by the

setDoInput

method. Its
value is returned by the

getDoInput

method.

A URL connection can be used for input and/or output. Setting the

doInput

flag to

true

indicates that
the application intends to read data from the URL connection.

The default value of this field is

true

.

**See Also:**
- getDoInput()

,

setDoInput(boolean)

---

#### protected boolean doOutput

This variable is set by the

setDoOutput

method. Its
value is returned by the

getDoOutput

method.

A URL connection can be used for input and/or output. Setting the

doOutput

flag to

true

indicates
that the application intends to write data to the URL connection.

The default value of this field is

false

.

**See Also:**
- getDoOutput()

,

setDoOutput(boolean)

---

#### protected boolean allowUserInteraction

If

true

, this

URL

is being examined in
a context in which it makes sense to allow user interactions such
as popping up an authentication dialog. If

false

,
then no user interaction is allowed.

The value of this field can be set by the

setAllowUserInteraction

method.
Its value is returned by the

getAllowUserInteraction

method.
Its default value is the value of the argument in the last invocation
of the

setDefaultAllowUserInteraction

method.

**See Also:**
- getAllowUserInteraction()

,

setAllowUserInteraction(boolean)

,

setDefaultAllowUserInteraction(boolean)

---

#### protected boolean useCaches

If

true

, the protocol is allowed to use caching
whenever it can. If

false

, the protocol must always
try to get a fresh copy of the object.

This field is set by the

setUseCaches

method. Its
value is returned by the

getUseCaches

method.

Its default value is the value given in the last invocation of the

setDefaultUseCaches

method.

The default setting may be overridden per protocol with

setDefaultUseCaches(String,boolean)

.

**See Also:**
- setUseCaches(boolean)

,

getUseCaches()

,

setDefaultUseCaches(boolean)

---

#### protected long ifModifiedSince

Some protocols support skipping the fetching of the object unless
the object has been modified more recently than a certain time.

A nonzero value gives a time as the number of milliseconds since
January 1, 1970, GMT. The object is fetched only if it has been
modified more recently than that time.

This variable is set by the

setIfModifiedSince

method. Its value is returned by the

getIfModifiedSince

method.

The default value of this field is

0

, indicating
that the fetching must always occur.

**See Also:**
- getIfModifiedSince()

,

setIfModifiedSince(long)

---

#### protected boolean connected

If

false

, this connection object has not created a
communications link to the specified URL. If

true

,
the communications link has been established.

---

### Constructor Details

#### protected URLConnection​(
URL
url)

Constructs a URL connection to the specified URL. A connection to
the object referenced by the URL is not created.

**Parameters:**
- url

- the specified URL.

---

### Method Details

#### public static
FileNameMap
getFileNameMap()

Loads filename map (a mimetable) from a data file. It will
first try to load the user-specific table, defined
by "content.types.user.table" property. If that fails,
it tries to load the default built-in table.

**Returns:**
- the FileNameMap

**See Also:**
- setFileNameMap(java.net.FileNameMap)

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public static void setFileNameMap​(
FileNameMap
map)

Sets the FileNameMap.

If there is a security manager, this method first calls
the security manager's

checkSetFactory

method
to ensure the operation is allowed.
This could result in a SecurityException.

**Parameters:**
- map

- the FileNameMap to be set

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkSetFactory

method doesn't allow the operation.

**See Also:**
- SecurityManager.checkSetFactory()

,

getFileNameMap()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public abstract void connect()
throws
IOException

Opens a communications link to the resource referenced by this
URL, if such a connection has not already been established.

If the

connect

method is called when the connection
has already been opened (indicated by the

connected

field having the value

true

), the call is ignored.

URLConnection objects go through two phases: first they are
created, then they are connected. After being created, and
before being connected, various options can be specified
(e.g., doInput and UseCaches). After connecting, it is an
error to try to set them. Operations that depend on being
connected, like getContentLength, will implicitly perform the
connection, if necessary.

**Throws:**
- SocketTimeoutException

- if the timeout expires before
the connection can be established
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while opening the
connection.

**See Also:**
- connected

,

getConnectTimeout()

,

setConnectTimeout(int)

---

#### public void setConnectTimeout​(int timeout)

Sets a specified timeout value, in milliseconds, to be used
when opening a communications link to the resource referenced
by this URLConnection. If the timeout expires before the
connection can be established, a
java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A timeout of zero is
interpreted as an infinite timeout.

Some non-standard implementation of this method may ignore
the specified timeout. To see the connect timeout set, please
call getConnectTimeout().

**Parameters:**
- timeout

- an

int

that specifies the connect
timeout value in milliseconds

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the timeout parameter is negative

**See Also:**
- getConnectTimeout()

,

connect()

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public int getConnectTimeout()

Returns setting for connect timeout.

0 return implies that the option is disabled
(i.e., timeout of infinity).

**Returns:**
- an

int

that indicates the connect timeout
value in milliseconds

**See Also:**
- setConnectTimeout(int)

,

connect()

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public void setReadTimeout​(int timeout)

Sets the read timeout to a specified timeout, in
milliseconds. A non-zero value specifies the timeout when
reading from Input stream when a connection is established to a
resource. If the timeout expires before there is data available
for read, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A
timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout.

Some non-standard implementation of this method ignores the
specified timeout. To see the read timeout set, please call
getReadTimeout().

**Parameters:**
- timeout

- an

int

that specifies the timeout
value to be used in milliseconds

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the timeout parameter is negative

**See Also:**
- getReadTimeout()

,

---

#### public
Object
getContent()
throws
IOException

Retrieves the contents of this URL connection.

This method first determines the content type of the object by
calling the

getContentType

method. If this is
the first time that the application has seen that specific content
type, a content handler for that content type is created.

This is done as follows:

- If the application has set up a content handler factory instance
using the

setContentHandlerFactory

method, the

createContentHandler

method of that instance is called
with the content type as an argument; the result is a content
handler for that content type.

If no

ContentHandlerFactory

has yet been set up,
or if the factory's

createContentHandler

method
returns

null

, then the

ServiceLoader

mechanism is used to locate

ContentHandlerFactory

implementations using the system class
loader. The order that factories are located is implementation
specific, and an implementation is free to cache the located
factories. A

ServiceConfigurationError

,

Error

or

RuntimeException

thrown from the

createContentHandler

, if encountered, will
be propagated to the calling thread. The

createContentHandler

method of each factory, if instantiated, is
invoked, with the content type, until a factory returns non-null,
or all factories have been exhausted.

Failing that, this method tries to load a content handler
class as defined by

ContentHandler

.
If the class does not exist, or is not a subclass of

ContentHandler

, then an

UnknownServiceException

is thrown.

**Returns:**
- the object fetched. The

instanceof

operator
should be used to determine the specific kind of object
returned.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while
getting the content.
- UnknownServiceException

- if the protocol does not support
the content type.

**See Also:**
- ContentHandlerFactory.createContentHandler(java.lang.String)

,

getContentType()

,

setContentHandlerFactory(java.net.ContentHandlerFactory)

---

#### public
Object
getContent​(
Class
<?>[] classes)
throws
IOException

Retrieves the contents of this URL connection.

**Parameters:**
- classes

- the

Class

array
indicating the requested types

**Returns:**
- the object fetched that is the first match of the type
specified in the classes array. null if none of
the requested types are supported.
The

instanceof

operator should be used to
determine the specific kind of object returned.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while
getting the content.
- UnknownServiceException

- if the protocol does not support
the content type.

**See Also:**
- getContent()

,

ContentHandlerFactory.createContentHandler(java.lang.String)

,

getContent(java.lang.Class[])

,

setContentHandlerFactory(java.net.ContentHandlerFactory)

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public
Permission
getPermission()
throws
IOException

Returns a permission object representing the permission
necessary to make the connection represented by this
object. This method returns null if no permission is
required to make the connection. By default, this method
returns

java.security.AllPermission

. Subclasses
should override this method and return the permission
that best represents the permission required to make
a connection to the URL. For example, a

URLConnection

representing a

file:

URL would return a

java.io.FilePermission

object.

The permission returned may dependent upon the state of the
connection. For example, the permission before connecting may be
different from that after connecting. For example, an HTTP
sever, say foo.com, may redirect the connection to a different
host, say bar.com. Before connecting the permission returned by
the connection will represent the permission needed to connect
to foo.com, while the permission returned after connecting will
be to bar.com.

Permissions are generally used for two purposes: to protect
caches of objects obtained through URLConnections, and to check
the right of a recipient to learn about a particular URL. In
the first case, the permission should be obtained

after

the object has been obtained. For example, in an
HTTP connection, this will represent the permission to connect
to the host from which the data was ultimately fetched. In the
second case, the permission should be obtained and tested

before

connecting.

**Returns:**
- the permission object representing the permission
necessary to make the connection represented by this
URLConnection.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if the computation of the permission
requires network or file I/O and an exception occurs while
computing it.

---

#### public
InputStream
getInputStream()
throws
IOException

Returns an input stream that reads from this open connection.

A SocketTimeoutException can be thrown when reading from the
returned input stream if the read timeout expires before data
is available for read.

**Returns:**
- an input stream that reads from this open connection.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while
creating the input stream.
- UnknownServiceException

- if the protocol does not support
input.

**See Also:**
- setReadTimeout(int)

,

getReadTimeout()

---

#### public
OutputStream
getOutputStream()
throws
IOException

Returns an output stream that writes to this connection.

---

#### public void setUseCaches​(boolean usecaches)

Sets the value of the

useCaches

field of this

URLConnection

to the specified value.

Some protocols do caching of documents. Occasionally, it is important
to be able to "tunnel through" and ignore the caches (e.g., the
"reload" button in a browser). If the UseCaches flag on a connection
is true, the connection is allowed to use whatever caches it can.
If false, caches are to be ignored.

#### public void setRequestProperty​(
String
key,

String
value)

Sets the general request property. If a property with the key already
exists, overwrite its value with the new value.

#### public
String
getRequestProperty​(
String
key)

Returns the value of the named general request property for this
connection.

**Parameters:**
- key

- the keyword by which the request is known (e.g., "Accept").

**Returns:**
- the value of the named general request property for this
connection. If key is null, then null is returned.

**Throws:**

Returns an unmodifiable Map of general request
properties for this connection. The Map keys
are Strings that represent the request-header
field names. Each Map value is a unmodifiable List
of Strings that represents the corresponding
field values.

**Returns:**
- a Map of the general request properties for this connection.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if already connected

**Since:**
- 1.4

key,

String
value)

Sets the default value of a general request property. When a

URLConnection

is created, it is initialized with
these properties.

**Parameters:**
- key

- the keyword by which the request is known
(e.g., "

Accept

").
- value

- the value associated with the key.

#### public static void setContentHandlerFactory​(
ContentHandlerFactory
fac)

Sets the

ContentHandlerFactory

of an
application. It can be called at most once by an application.

The

ContentHandlerFactory

instance is used to
construct a content handler from a content type.

If there is a security manager, this method first calls
the security manager's

checkSetFactory

method
to ensure the operation is allowed.
This could result in a SecurityException.

**Parameters:**
- fac

- the desired factory.

**Throws:**
- Error

- if the factory has already been defined.
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkSetFactory

method doesn't allow the operation.

**See Also:**
- ContentHandlerFactory

,

getContent()

,

SecurityManager.checkSetFactory()

---

#### public static
String
guessContentTypeFromName​(
String
fname)

Tries to determine the content type of an object, based
on the specified "file" component of a URL.
This is a convenience method that can be used by
subclasses that override the

getContentType

method.

**Parameters:**
- fname

- a filename.

**Returns:**
- a guess as to what the content type of the object is,
based upon its file name.

**See Also:**
- getContentType()

---

#### public static
String
guessContentTypeFromStream​(
InputStream
is)
throws
IOException

Tries to determine the type of an input stream based on the
characters at the beginning of the input stream. This method can
be used by subclasses that override the

getContentType

method.

Ideally, this routine would not be needed. But many

http

servers return the incorrect content type; in
addition, there are many nonstandard extensions. Direct inspection
of the bytes to determine the content type is often more accurate
than believing the content type claimed by the

http

server.

**Parameters:**
- is

- an input stream that supports marks.

**Returns:**
- a guess at the content type, or

null

if none
can be determined.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while reading the
input stream.

**See Also:**
- InputStream.mark(int)

,

InputStream.markSupported()

The abstract class

URLConnection

is the superclass
of all classes that represent a communications link between the
application and a URL. Instances of this class can be used both to
read from and to write to the resource referenced by the URL.

In general, creating a connection to a URL is a multistep process:

- The connection object is created by invoking the

openConnection

method on a URL.

The setup parameters and general request properties are manipulated.

The actual connection to the remote object is made, using the

connect

method.

The remote object becomes available. The header fields and the contents
of the remote object can be accessed.

The setup parameters are modified using the following methods:

- setAllowUserInteraction

setDoInput

setDoOutput

setIfModifiedSince

setUseCaches

and the general request properties are modified using the method:

- setRequestProperty

Default values for the

AllowUserInteraction

and

UseCaches

parameters can be set using the methods

setDefaultAllowUserInteraction

and

setDefaultUseCaches

.

Each of the above

set

methods has a corresponding

get

method to retrieve the value of the parameter or
general request property. The specific parameters and general
request properties that are applicable are protocol specific.

The following methods are used to access the header fields and
the contents after the connection is made to the remote object:

- getContent

getHeaderField

getInputStream

getOutputStream

Certain header fields are accessed frequently. The methods:

- getContentEncoding

getContentLength

getContentType

getDate

getExpiration

getLastModified

provide convenient access to these fields. The

getContentType

method is used by the

getContent

method to determine the type of the remote
object; subclasses may find it convenient to override the

getContentType

method.

In the common case, all of the pre-connection parameters and
general request properties can be ignored: the pre-connection
parameters and request properties default to sensible values. For
most clients of this interface, there are only two interesting
methods:

#### Methods declared in class java.lang. Object

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- url

```java
protected
URL
url
```

The URL represents the remote object on the World Wide Web to
which this connection is opened.

The value of this field can be accessed by the

getURL

method.

The default value of this variable is the value of the URL
argument in the

URLConnection

constructor.

**See Also:** getURL()

,

url

- doInput

```java
protected boolean doInput
```

This variable is set by the

setDoInput

method. Its
value is returned by the

getDoInput

method.

A URL connection can be used for input and/or output. Setting the

doInput

flag to

true

indicates that
the application intends to read data from the URL connection.

The default value of this field is

true

.

**See Also:** getDoInput()

,

setDoInput(boolean)

- doOutput

```java
protected boolean doOutput
```

This variable is set by the

setDoOutput

method. Its
value is returned by the

getDoOutput

method.

A URL connection can be used for input and/or output. Setting the

doOutput

flag to

true

indicates
that the application intends to write data to the URL connection.

The default value of this field is

false

.

**See Also:** getDoOutput()

,

setDoOutput(boolean)

- allowUserInteraction

```java
protected boolean allowUserInteraction
```

If

true

, this

URL

is being examined in
a context in which it makes sense to allow user interactions such
as popping up an authentication dialog. If

false

,
then no user interaction is allowed.

The value of this field can be set by the

setAllowUserInteraction

method.
Its value is returned by the

getAllowUserInteraction

method.
Its default value is the value of the argument in the last invocation
of the

setDefaultAllowUserInteraction

method.

**See Also:** getAllowUserInteraction()

,

setAllowUserInteraction(boolean)

,

setDefaultAllowUserInteraction(boolean)

- useCaches

```java
protected boolean useCaches
```

If

true

, the protocol is allowed to use caching
whenever it can. If

false

, the protocol must always
try to get a fresh copy of the object.

This field is set by the

setUseCaches

method. Its
value is returned by the

getUseCaches

method.

Its default value is the value given in the last invocation of the

setDefaultUseCaches

method.

The default setting may be overridden per protocol with

setDefaultUseCaches(String,boolean)

.

**See Also:** setUseCaches(boolean)

,

getUseCaches()

,

setDefaultUseCaches(boolean)

- ifModifiedSince

```java
protected long ifModifiedSince
```

Some protocols support skipping the fetching of the object unless
the object has been modified more recently than a certain time.

A nonzero value gives a time as the number of milliseconds since
January 1, 1970, GMT. The object is fetched only if it has been
modified more recently than that time.

This variable is set by the

setIfModifiedSince

method. Its value is returned by the

getIfModifiedSince

method.

The default value of this field is

0

, indicating
that the fetching must always occur.

**See Also:** getIfModifiedSince()

,

setIfModifiedSince(long)

- connected

```java
protected boolean connected
```

If

false

, this connection object has not created a
communications link to the specified URL. If

true

,
the communications link has been established.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- URLConnection

```java
protected URLConnection​(
URL
url)
```

Constructs a URL connection to the specified URL. A connection to
the object referenced by the URL is not created.

**Parameters:** url

- the specified URL.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getFileNameMap

```java
public static
FileNameMap
getFileNameMap()
```

Loads filename map (a mimetable) from a data file. It will
first try to load the user-specific table, defined
by "content.types.user.table" property. If that fails,
it tries to load the default built-in table.

**Returns:** the FileNameMap
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** setFileNameMap(java.net.FileNameMap)

- setFileNameMap

```java
public static void setFileNameMap​(
FileNameMap
map)
```

Sets the FileNameMap.

If there is a security manager, this method first calls
the security manager's

checkSetFactory

method
to ensure the operation is allowed.
This could result in a SecurityException.

**Parameters:** map

- the FileNameMap to be set
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkSetFactory

method doesn't allow the operation.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkSetFactory()

,

getFileNameMap()

- connect

```java
public abstract void connect()
throws
IOException
```

Opens a communications link to the resource referenced by this
URL, if such a connection has not already been established.

If the

connect

method is called when the connection
has already been opened (indicated by the

connected

field having the value

true

), the call is ignored.

URLConnection objects go through two phases: first they are
created, then they are connected. After being created, and
before being connected, various options can be specified
(e.g., doInput and UseCaches). After connecting, it is an
error to try to set them. Operations that depend on being
connected, like getContentLength, will implicitly perform the
connection, if necessary.

**Throws:** SocketTimeoutException

- if the timeout expires before
the connection can be established
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while opening the
connection.
**See Also:** connected

,

getConnectTimeout()

,

setConnectTimeout(int)

- setConnectTimeout

```java
public void setConnectTimeout​(int timeout)
```

Sets a specified timeout value, in milliseconds, to be used
when opening a communications link to the resource referenced
by this URLConnection. If the timeout expires before the
connection can be established, a
java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A timeout of zero is
interpreted as an infinite timeout.

Some non-standard implementation of this method may ignore
the specified timeout. To see the connect timeout set, please
call getConnectTimeout().

**Parameters:** timeout

- an

int

that specifies the connect
timeout value in milliseconds
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the timeout parameter is negative
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** getConnectTimeout()

,

connect()

- getConnectTimeout

```java
public int getConnectTimeout()
```

Returns setting for connect timeout.

0 return implies that the option is disabled
(i.e., timeout of infinity).

**Returns:** an

int

that indicates the connect timeout
value in milliseconds
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** setConnectTimeout(int)

,

connect()

- setReadTimeout

```java
public void setReadTimeout​(int timeout)
```

Sets the read timeout to a specified timeout, in
milliseconds. A non-zero value specifies the timeout when
reading from Input stream when a connection is established to a
resource. If the timeout expires before there is data available
for read, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A
timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout.

Some non-standard implementation of this method ignores the
specified timeout. To see the read timeout set, please call
getReadTimeout().

**Parameters:** timeout

- an

int

that specifies the timeout
value to be used in milliseconds
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the timeout parameter is negative
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** getReadTimeout()

,

InputStream.read()

- getReadTimeout

```java
public int getReadTimeout()
```

Returns setting for read timeout. 0 return implies that the
option is disabled (i.e., timeout of infinity).

**Returns:** an

int

that indicates the read timeout
value in milliseconds
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** setReadTimeout(int)

,

InputStream.read()

- getURL

```java
public
URL
getURL()
```

Returns the value of this

URLConnection

's

URL

field.

**Returns:** the value of this

URLConnection

's

URL

field.
**See Also:** url

- getContentLength

```java
public int getContentLength()
```

Returns the value of the

content-length

header field.

Note

:

getContentLengthLong()

should be preferred over this method, since it returns a

long

instead and is therefore more portable.

**Returns:** the content length of the resource that this connection's URL
references,

-1

if the content length is not known,
or if the content length is greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE.

- getContentLengthLong

```java
public long getContentLengthLong()
```

Returns the value of the

content-length

header field as a
long.

**Returns:** the content length of the resource that this connection's URL
references, or

-1

if the content length is
not known.
**Since:** 1.7

- getContentType

```java
public
String
getContentType()
```

Returns the value of the

content-type

header field.

**Returns:** the content type of the resource that the URL references,
or

null

if not known.
**See Also:** getHeaderField(java.lang.String)

- getContentEncoding

```java
public
String
getContentEncoding()
```

Returns the value of the

content-encoding

header field.

**Returns:** the content encoding of the resource that the URL references,

- getDate

```java
public long getDate()
```

Returns the value of the

date

header field.

**Returns:** the sending date of the resource that the URL references,
or

0

if not known. The value returned is the
number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 GMT.
**See Also:** getHeaderField(java.lang.String)

- getLastModified

```java
public long getLastModified()
```

Returns the value of the

last-modified

header field.
The result is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 GMT.

**Returns:** the date the resource referenced by this

URLConnection

was last modified, or 0 if not known.
**See Also:** getHeaderField(java.lang.String)

- getHeaderField

```java
public
String
getHeaderField​(
String
name)
```

Returns the value of the named header field.

If called on a connection that sets the same header multiple times
with possibly different values, only the last value is returned.

- getHeaderFieldInt

```java
public int getHeaderFieldInt​(
String
name,
int Default)
```

Returns the value of the named field parsed as a number.

- getContent

```java
public
Object
getContent()
throws
IOException
```

Retrieves the contents of this URL connection.

This method first determines the content type of the object by
calling the

getContentType

method. If this is
the first time that the application has seen that specific content
type, a content handler for that content type is created.

This is done as follows:

- If the application has set up a content handler factory instance
using the

setContentHandlerFactory

method, the

createContentHandler

method of that instance is called
with the content type as an argument; the result is a content
handler for that content type.

If no

ContentHandlerFactory

has yet been set up,
or if the factory's

createContentHandler

method
returns

null

, then the

ServiceLoader

mechanism is used to locate

ContentHandlerFactory

implementations using the system class
loader. The order that factories are located is implementation
specific, and an implementation is free to cache the located
factories. A

ServiceConfigurationError

,

Error

or

RuntimeException

thrown from the

createContentHandler

, if encountered, will
be propagated to the calling thread. The

createContentHandler

method of each factory, if instantiated, is
invoked, with the content type, until a factory returns non-null,
or all factories have been exhausted.

Failing that, this method tries to load a content handler
class as defined by

ContentHandler

.
If the class does not exist, or is not a subclass of

ContentHandler

, then an

UnknownServiceException

is thrown.

**Returns:** the object fetched. The

instanceof

operator
should be used to determine the specific kind of object
returned.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while
getting the content.
**Throws:** UnknownServiceException

- if the protocol does not support
the content type.
**See Also:** ContentHandlerFactory.createContentHandler(java.lang.String)

,

getContentType()

,

setContentHandlerFactory(java.net.ContentHandlerFactory)

- getContent

```java
public
Object
getContent​(
Class
<?>[] classes)
throws
IOException
```

Retrieves the contents of this URL connection.

**Parameters:** classes

- the

Class

array
indicating the requested types
**Returns:** the object fetched that is the first match of the type
specified in the classes array. null if none of
the requested types are supported.
The

instanceof

operator should be used to
determine the specific kind of object returned.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while
getting the content.
**Throws:** UnknownServiceException

- if the protocol does not support
the content type.

- getPermission

```java
public
Permission
getPermission()
throws
IOException
```

Returns a permission object representing the permission
necessary to make the connection represented by this
object. This method returns null if no permission is
required to make the connection. By default, this method
returns

java.security.AllPermission

. Subclasses
should override this method and return the permission
that best represents the permission required to make
a connection to the URL. For example, a

URLConnection

representing a

file:

URL would return a

java.io.FilePermission

object.

The permission returned may dependent upon the state of the
connection. For example, the permission before connecting may be
different from that after connecting. For example, an HTTP
sever, say foo.com, may redirect the connection to a different
host, say bar.com. Before connecting the permission returned by
the connection will represent the permission needed to connect
to foo.com, while the permission returned after connecting will
be to bar.com.

Permissions are generally used for two purposes: to protect
caches of objects obtained through URLConnections, and to check
the right of a recipient to learn about a particular URL. In
the first case, the permission should be obtained

after

the object has been obtained. For example, in an
HTTP connection, this will represent the permission to connect
to the host from which the data was ultimately fetched. In the
second case, the permission should be obtained and tested

before

connecting.

**Returns:** the permission object representing the permission
necessary to make the connection represented by this
URLConnection.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the computation of the permission
requires network or file I/O and an exception occurs while
computing it.

- getInputStream

```java
public
InputStream
getInputStream()
throws
IOException
```

Returns an input stream that reads from this open connection.

A SocketTimeoutException can be thrown when reading from the
returned input stream if the read timeout expires before data
is available for read.

**Returns:** an input stream that reads from this open connection.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while
creating the input stream.

- setUseCaches

```java
public void setUseCaches​(boolean usecaches)
```

Sets the value of the

useCaches

- setContentHandlerFactory

```java
public static void setContentHandlerFactory​(
ContentHandlerFactory
fac)
```

Sets the

ContentHandlerFactory

of an
application. It can be called at most once by an application.

The

ContentHandlerFactory

instance is used to
construct a content handler from a content type.

If there is a security manager, this method first calls
the security manager's

checkSetFactory

method
to ensure the operation is allowed.
This could result in a SecurityException.

**Parameters:** fac

- the desired factory.
**Throws:** Error

- if the factory has already been defined.

- guessContentTypeFromName

```java
public static
String
guessContentTypeFromName​(
String
fname)
```

Tries to determine the content type of an object, based
on the specified "file" component of a URL.
This is a convenience method that can be used by
subclasses that override the

getContentType

method.

**Parameters:** fname

- a filename.
**Returns:** a guess as to what the content type of the object is,
based upon its file name.
**See Also:** getContentType()

- guessContentTypeFromStream

```java
public static
String
guessContentTypeFromStream​(
InputStream
is)
throws
IOException
```

Tries to determine the type of an input stream based on the
characters at the beginning of the input stream. This method can
be used by subclasses that override the

getContentType

method.

Ideally, this routine would not be needed. But many

http

servers return the incorrect content type; in
addition, there are many nonstandard extensions. Direct inspection
of the bytes to determine the content type is often more accurate
than believing the content type claimed by the

http

server.

**Parameters:** is

- an input stream that supports marks.
**Returns:** a guess at the content type, or

null

if none
can be determined.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while reading the
input stream.

Some protocols support skipping the fetching of the object unless
the object has been modified more recently than a certain time.

A nonzero value gives a time as the number of milliseconds since
January 1, 1970, GMT. The object is fetched only if it has been
modified more recently than that time.

This variable is set by the

setIfModifiedSince

method. Its value is returned by the

getIfModifiedSince

method.

The default value of this field is

0

, indicating
that the fetching must always occur.

Constructor Detail

- URLConnection

```java
protected URLConnection​(
URL
url)
```

Constructs a URL connection to the specified URL. A connection to
the object referenced by the URL is not created.

**Parameters:** url

- the specified URL.

---

#### Constructor Detail

URLConnection

```java
protected URLConnection​(
URL
url)
```

Constructs a URL connection to the specified URL. A connection to
the object referenced by the URL is not created.

**Parameters:** url

- the specified URL.

---

#### URLConnection

protected URLConnection​(

URL

url)

Constructs a URL connection to the specified URL. A connection to
the object referenced by the URL is not created.

Method Detail

- getFileNameMap

```java
public static
FileNameMap
getFileNameMap()
```

Loads filename map (a mimetable) from a data file. It will
first try to load the user-specific table, defined
by "content.types.user.table" property. If that fails,
it tries to load the default built-in table.

**Returns:** the FileNameMap
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** setFileNameMap(java.net.FileNameMap)

- setFileNameMap

```java
public static void setFileNameMap​(
FileNameMap
map)
```

Sets the FileNameMap.

If there is a security manager, this method first calls
the security manager's

checkSetFactory

method
to ensure the operation is allowed.
This could result in a SecurityException.

**Parameters:** map

- the FileNameMap to be set
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkSetFactory

method doesn't allow the operation.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** SecurityManager.checkSetFactory()

,

getFileNameMap()

- connect

```java
public abstract void connect()
throws
IOException
```

Opens a communications link to the resource referenced by this
URL, if such a connection has not already been established.

If the

connect

method is called when the connection
has already been opened (indicated by the

connected

field having the value

true

), the call is ignored.

URLConnection objects go through two phases: first they are
created, then they are connected. After being created, and
before being connected, various options can be specified
(e.g., doInput and UseCaches). After connecting, it is an
error to try to set them. Operations that depend on being
connected, like getContentLength, will implicitly perform the
connection, if necessary.

**Throws:** SocketTimeoutException

- if the timeout expires before
the connection can be established
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while opening the
connection.
**See Also:** connected

,

getConnectTimeout()

,

setConnectTimeout(int)

- setConnectTimeout

```java
public void setConnectTimeout​(int timeout)
```

Sets a specified timeout value, in milliseconds, to be used
when opening a communications link to the resource referenced
by this URLConnection. If the timeout expires before the
connection can be established, a
java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A timeout of zero is
interpreted as an infinite timeout.

Some non-standard implementation of this method may ignore
the specified timeout. To see the connect timeout set, please
call getConnectTimeout().

**Parameters:** timeout

- an

int

that specifies the connect
timeout value in milliseconds
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the timeout parameter is negative
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** getConnectTimeout()

**See Also:** setConnectTimeout(int)

,

connect()

- setReadTimeout

```java
public void setReadTimeout​(int timeout)
```

Sets the read timeout to a specified timeout, in
milliseconds. A non-zero value specifies the timeout when
reading from Input stream when a connection is established to a
resource. If the timeout expires before there is data available
for read, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A
timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout.

Some non-standard implementation of this method ignores the
specified timeout. To see the read timeout set, please call
getReadTimeout().

**Parameters:** timeout

- an

int

that specifies the timeout
value to be used in milliseconds
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the timeout parameter is negative

**See Also:** getHeaderFieldKey(int)

- getContent

```java
public
Object
getContent()
throws
IOException
```

Retrieves the contents of this URL connection.

This method first determines the content type of the object by
calling the

getContentType

method. If this is
the first time that the application has seen that specific content
type, a content handler for that content type is created.

This is done as follows:

- If the application has set up a content handler factory instance
using the

setContentHandlerFactory

method, the

createContentHandler

method of that instance is called
with the content type as an argument; the result is a content
handler for that content type.

If no

ContentHandlerFactory

has yet been set up,
or if the factory's

createContentHandler

method
returns

null

, then the

ServiceLoader

mechanism is used to locate

ContentHandlerFactory

implementations using the system class
loader. The order that factories are located is implementation
specific, and an implementation is free to cache the located
factories. A

ServiceConfigurationError

,

Error

or

RuntimeException

thrown from the

createContentHandler

, if encountered, will
be propagated to the calling thread. The

createContentHandler

method of each factory, if instantiated, is
invoked, with the content type, until a factory returns non-null,
or all factories have been exhausted.

Failing that, this method tries to load a content handler
class as defined by

ContentHandler

.
If the class does not exist, or is not a subclass of

ContentHandler

, then an

UnknownServiceException

is thrown.

**Returns:** the object fetched. The

instanceof

operator
should be used to determine the specific kind of object
returned.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while
getting the content.
**Throws:** UnknownServiceException

- if the protocol does not support
the content type.
**See Also:** ContentHandlerFactory.createContentHandler(java.lang.String)

,

getContentType()

,

setContentHandlerFactory(java.net.ContentHandlerFactory)

- getContent

```java
public
Object
getContent​(
Class
<?>[] classes)
throws
IOException
```

Retrieves the contents of this URL connection.

**Parameters:** classes

- the

Class

array
indicating the requested types
**Returns:** the object fetched that is the first match of the type
specified in the classes array. null if none of
the requested types are supported.
The

instanceof

operator should be used to
determine the specific kind of object returned.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while
getting the content.
**Throws:** UnknownServiceException

- if the protocol does not support
the content type.
**Since:** 1.3

setContentHandlerFactory(java.net.ContentHandlerFactory)

- getPermission

```java
public
Permission
getPermission()
throws
IOException
```

Returns a permission object representing the permission
necessary to make the connection represented by this
object. This method returns null if no permission is
required to make the connection. By default, this method
returns

java.security.AllPermission

. Subclasses
should override this method and return the permission
that best represents the permission required to make
a connection to the URL. For example, a

URLConnection

representing a

file:

URL would return a

java.io.FilePermission

object.

The permission returned may dependent upon the state of the
connection. For example, the permission before connecting may be
different from that after connecting. For example, an HTTP
sever, say foo.com, may redirect the connection to a different
host, say bar.com. Before connecting the permission returned by
the connection will represent the permission needed to connect
to foo.com, while the permission returned after connecting will
be to bar.com.

Permissions are generally used for two purposes: to protect
caches of objects obtained through URLConnections, and to check
the right of a recipient to learn about a particular URL. In
the first case, the permission should be obtained

after

the object has been obtained. For example, in an
HTTP connection, this will represent the permission to connect
to the host from which the data was ultimately fetched. In the
second case, the permission should be obtained and tested

before

connecting.

**Returns:** the permission object representing the permission
necessary to make the connection represented by this
URLConnection.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the computation of the permission
requires network or file I/O and an exception occurs while
computing it.

- getInputStream

```java
public
InputStream
getInputStream()
throws
IOException
```

Returns an input stream that reads from this open connection.

A SocketTimeoutException can be thrown when reading from the
returned input stream if the read timeout expires before data
is available for read.

**Returns:** an input stream that reads from this open connection.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while
creating the input stream.
**Throws:** UnknownServiceException

- if the protocol does not support
input.

,

getReadTimeout()

- getOutputStream

```java
public

- setUseCaches

```java
public void setUseCaches​(boolean usecaches)
```

Sets the value of the

useCaches

field of this

URLConnection

to the specified value.

Some protocols do caching of documents. Occasionally, it is important
to be able to "tunnel through" and ignore the caches (e.g., the
"reload" button in a browser). If the UseCaches flag on a connection
is true, the connection is allowed to use whatever caches it can.
If false, caches are to be ignored.

- guessContentTypeFromName

```java
public static
String
guessContentTypeFromName​(
String
fname)
```

Tries to determine the content type of an object, based
on the specified "file" component of a URL.
This is a convenience method that can be used by
subclasses that override the

getContentType

method.

**Parameters:** fname

- a filename.
**Returns:** a guess as to what the content type of the object is,
based upon its file name.
**See Also:** getContentType()

- guessContentTypeFromStream

```java
public static
String
guessContentTypeFromStream​(
InputStream
is)
throws
IOException
```

Tries to determine the type of an input stream based on the
characters at the beginning of the input stream. This method can
be used by subclasses that override the

getContentType

method.

Ideally, this routine would not be needed. But many

http

servers return the incorrect content type; in
addition, there are many nonstandard extensions. Direct inspection
of the bytes to determine the content type is often more accurate
than believing the content type claimed by the

http

server.

**Parameters:** is

- an input stream that supports marks.
**Returns:** a guess at the content type, or

null

if none
can be determined.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while reading the
input stream.

#### Method Detail

getFileNameMap

```java
public static
FileNameMap
getFileNameMap()
```

Loads filename map (a mimetable) from a data file. It will
first try to load the user-specific table, defined
by "content.types.user.table" property. If that fails,
it tries to load the default built-in table.

**Returns:** the FileNameMap
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** setFileNameMap(java.net.FileNameMap)

setFileNameMap

```java
public static void setFileNameMap​(
FileNameMap
map)
```

Sets the FileNameMap.

If there is a security manager, this method first calls
the security manager's

checkSetFactory

method
to ensure the operation is allowed.
This could result in a SecurityException.

**Parameters:** map

- the FileNameMap to be set
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkSetFactory

method doesn't allow the operation.

connect

```java
public abstract void connect()
throws
IOException
```

Opens a communications link to the resource referenced by this
URL, if such a connection has not already been established.

If the

connect

method is called when the connection
has already been opened (indicated by the

connected

field having the value

true

), the call is ignored.

URLConnection objects go through two phases: first they are
created, then they are connected. After being created, and
before being connected, various options can be specified
(e.g., doInput and UseCaches). After connecting, it is an
error to try to set them. Operations that depend on being
connected, like getContentLength, will implicitly perform the
connection, if necessary.

**Throws:** SocketTimeoutException

- if the timeout expires before
the connection can be established
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while opening the
connection.

getContent

```java

Retrieves the contents of this URL connection.

This method first determines the content type of the object by
calling the

the first time that the application has seen that specific content
type, a content handler for that content type is created.

This is done as follows:

- If the application has set up a content handler factory instance
using the

setContentHandlerFactory

method, the

createContentHandler

method of that instance is called
with the content type as an argument; the result is a content
handler for that content type.

If no

ContentHandlerFactory

has yet been set up,
or if the factory's

createContentHandler

method
returns

null

, then the

ServiceLoader

mechanism is used to locate

ContentHandlerFactory

implementations using the system class
loader. The order that factories are located is implementation
specific, and an implementation is free to cache the located
factories. A

or

RuntimeException

thrown from the

createContentHandler

, if encountered, will
be propagated to the calling thread. The

createContentHandler

method of each factory, if instantiated, is
invoked, with the content type, until a factory returns non-null,
or all factories have been exhausted.

Failing that, this method tries to load a content handler

getPermission

```java
public
Permission
getPermission()
throws

```

Returns a permission object representing the permission
necessary to make the connection represented by this
object. This method returns null if no permission is
required to make the connection. By default, this method
returns

java.security.AllPermission

. Subclasses
should override this method and return the permission
that best represents the permission required to make
a connection to the URL. For example, a

URLConnection

representing a

file:

URL would return a

java.io.FilePermission

object.

The permission returned may dependent upon the state of the
connection. For example, the permission before connecting may be
different from that after connecting. For example, an HTTP
sever, say foo.com, may redirect the connection to a different
host, say bar.com. Before connecting the permission returned by
the connection will represent the permission needed to connect
to foo.com, while the permission returned after connecting will
be to bar.com.

Permissions are generally used for two purposes: to protect
caches of objects obtained through URLConnections, and to check
the right of a recipient to learn about a particular URL. In
the first case, the permission should be obtained

after

the object has been obtained. For example, in an
HTTP connection, this will represent the permission to connect
to the host from which the data was ultimately fetched. In the
second case, the permission should be obtained and tested

before

connecting.

**Returns:** the permission object representing the permission
necessary to make the connection represented by this
URLConnection.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the computation of the permission
requires network or file I/O and an exception occurs while
computing it.

getPermission()
throws

IOException

Returns a permission object representing the permission
necessary to make the connection represented by this
object. This method returns null if no permission is
required to make the connection. By default, this method
returns

java.security.AllPermission

should override this method and return the permission
that best represents the permission required to make
a connection to the URL. For example, a

URLConnection

representing a

file:

URL would return a

java.io.FilePermission

object.

The permission returned may dependent upon the state of the
connection. For example, the permission before connecting may be
different from that after connecting. For example, an HTTP
sever, say foo.com, may redirect the connection to a different
host, say bar.com. Before connecting the permission returned by
