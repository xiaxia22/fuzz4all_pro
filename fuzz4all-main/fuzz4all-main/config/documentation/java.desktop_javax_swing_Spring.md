# Class Spring

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\Spring.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Spring

extends
Object
```

An instance of the

Spring

class holds three properties that
characterize its behavior: the

minimum

,

preferred

, and

maximum

values. Each of these properties may be involved in
defining its fourth,

value

, property based on a series of rules.

An instance of the

Spring

class can be visualized as a
mechanical spring that provides a corrective force as the spring is compressed
or stretched away from its preferred value. This force is modelled
as linear function of the distance from the preferred value, but with
two different constants -- one for the compressional force and one for the
tensional one. Those constants are specified by the minimum and maximum
values of the spring such that a spring at its minimum value produces an
equal and opposite force to that which is created when it is at its
maximum value. The difference between the

preferred

and

minimum

values, therefore, represents the ease with which the
spring can be compressed and the difference between its

maximum

and

preferred

values, indicates the ease with which the

Spring

can be extended.
See the

sum(javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring)

method for details.

By defining simple arithmetic operations on

Spring

s,
the behavior of a collection of

Spring

s
can be reduced to that of an ordinary (non-compound)

Spring

. We define
the "+", "-",

max

, and

min

operators on

Spring

s so that, in each case, the result is a

Spring

whose characteristics bear a useful mathematical relationship to its constituent
springs.

A

Spring

can be treated as a pair of intervals
with a single common point: the preferred value.
The following rules define some of the
arithmetic operators that can be applied to intervals
(

[a, b]

refers to the interval
from

a

to

b

,
where

a <= b

).

```java
[a1, b1] + [a2, b2] = [a1 + a2, b1 + b2]

-[a, b] = [-b, -a]

max([a1, b1], [a2, b2]) = [max(a1, a2), max(b1, b2)]
```

If we denote

Spring

s as

[a, b, c]

,
where

a <= b <= c

, we can define the same
arithmetic operators on

Spring

s:

```java
[a1, b1, c1] + [a2, b2, c2] = [a1 + a2, b1 + b2, c1 + c2]

-[a, b, c] = [-c, -b, -a]

max([a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]) = [max(a1, a2), max(b1, b2), max(c1, c2)]
```

With both intervals and

Spring

s we can define "-" and

min

in terms of negation:

```java
X - Y = X + (-Y)

min(X, Y) = -max(-X, -Y)
```

For the static methods in this class that embody the arithmetic
operators, we do not actually perform the operation in question as
that would snapshot the values of the properties of the method's arguments
at the time the static method is called. Instead, the static methods
create a new

Spring

instance containing references to
the method's arguments so that the characteristics of the new spring track the
potentially changing characteristics of the springs from which it
was made. This is a little like the idea of a

lazy value

in a functional language.

SpringLayout

then set so that they are have a strain equal to that of the sum. The formulas are
evaluated so as to take rounding errors into account and ensure that the sum of
the

value

s of

s1

is exactly equal to
the

value

of

s3

.

minimum

,

preferred

,

maximum

and

value

properties are each multiples of the properties of the
argument spring,

s

. Minimum and maximum properties are
swapped when

factor

minimum

,

preferred

,

maximum

**Returns:**
- a spring whose properties are defined by the horizontal component
of the component's size methods.

minimum

,

preferred

,

maximum

and

value

whose methods call the appropriate size methods of the supplied component.
The minimum, preferred, maximum and value properties of the returned spring
therefore report the current state of the appropriate properties in the
component and track them as they change.

**Parameters:**

Spring

class holds three properties that
characterize its behavior: the

minimum

preferred

defining its fourth,

value

, property based on a series of rules.

tensional one. Those constants are specified by the minimum and maximum
values of the spring such that a spring at its minimum value produces an
equal and opposite force to that which is created when it is at its
maximum value. The difference between the

preferred

and

minimum

values, therefore, represents the ease with which the
spring can be compressed and the difference between its

maximum

and

preferred

values, indicates the ease with which the

Spring

can be extended.
See the

sum(javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring)

method for details.

By defining simple arithmetic operations on

Spring

s,
the behavior of a collection of

Spring

s
can be reduced to that of an ordinary (non-compound)

Spring

. We define
the "+", "-",

max

, and

min

operators on

Spring

s so that, in each case, the result is a

Spring

whose characteristics bear a useful mathematical relationship to its constituent

A

with a single common point: the preferred value.
The following rules define some of the
arithmetic operators that can be applied to intervals
(

[a, b]

refers to the interval
from

a

to

b

,
where

a <= b

).

```java
[a1, b1] + [a2, b2] = [a1 + a2, b1 + b2]

-[a, b] = [-b, -a]

max([a1, b1], [a2, b2]) = [max(a1, a2), max(b1, b2)]
```

If we denote

Spring

s as

[a, b, c]

,
where

a <= b <= c

, we can define the same
arithmetic operators on

Spring

s:

```java
[a1, b1, c1] + [a2, b2, c2] = [a1 + a2, b1 + b2, c1 + c2]

-[a, b, c] = [-c, -b, -a]

max([a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]) = [max(a1, a2), max(b1, b2), max(c1, c2)]
```

With both intervals and

Spring

s we can define "-" and

min

in terms of negation:

```java
X - Y = X + (-Y)

min(X, Y) = -max(-X, -Y)
```

For the static methods in this class that embody the arithmetic
operators, we do not actually perform the operation in question as

[a, b, c]

,
where

a <= b <= c

, we can define the same
arithmetic operators on

Spring

s:

```java
[a1, b1, c1] + [a2, b2, c2] = [a1 + a2, b1 + b2, c1 + c2]

-[a, b, c] = [-c, -b, -a]

max([a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]) = [max(a1, a2), max(b1, b2), max(c1, c2)]
```

With both intervals and

Spring

s we can define "-" and

min

in terms of negation:

```java
X - Y = X + (-Y)

min(X, Y) = -max(-X, -Y)
```

For the static methods in this class that embody the arithmetic
operators, we do not actually perform the operation in question as
that would snapshot the values of the properties of the method's arguments
at the time the static method is called. Instead, the static methods
create a new

Spring

instance containing references to
the method's arguments so that the characteristics of the new spring track the
potentially changing characteristics of the springs from which it
was made. This is a little like the idea of a

lazy value

in a functional language.

Returns a spring whose

minimum

,

preferred

,

maximum

and

value

properties are defined by the widths of the

minimumSize

and

size

properties
of the supplied component. The returned spring is a 'wrapper' implementation
whose methods call the appropriate size methods of the supplied component.
The minimum, preferred, maximum and value properties of the returned spring
therefore report the current state of the appropriate properties in the
component and track them as they change.

**Parameters:** c

,
the

strains

of

s1

,

s2

, and

s3

are maintained
at the same level (to within the precision implied by their integer

value

s).
The strain of a spring in compression is:

```java
value - pref
------------
pref - min

and the strain of a spring in tension is:

```java
value - pref
------------
max - pref
```

When

setValue

is called on the sum spring,

s3

, the strain
in

s3

is calculated using one of the formulas above. Once the strain of
the sum is known, the

value

s of

s1

and

s2

are
then set so that they are have a strain equal to that of the sum. The formulas are
evaluated so as to take rounding errors into account and ensure that the sum of
the

value

s of

s1
