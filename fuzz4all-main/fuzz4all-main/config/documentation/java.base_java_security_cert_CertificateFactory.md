# Class CertificateFactory

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\cert\CertificateFactory.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
CertificateFactory

extends
Object
```

This class defines the functionality of a certificate factory, which is
used to generate certificate, certification path (

CertPath

)
and certificate revocation list (CRL) objects from their encodings.

For encodings consisting of multiple certificates, use

generateCertificates

when you want to
parse a collection of possibly unrelated certificates. Otherwise,
use

generateCertPath

when you want to generate
a

CertPath

(a certificate chain) and subsequently
validate it with a

CertPathValidator

.

A certificate factory for X.509 must return certificates that are an
instance of

java.security.cert.X509Certificate

, and CRLs
that are an instance of

java.security.cert.X509CRL

.

The following example reads a file with Base64 encoded certificates,
which are each bounded at the beginning by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----, and
bounded at the end by -----END CERTIFICATE-----. We convert the

FileInputStream

(which does not support

mark

and

reset

) to a

BufferedInputStream

(which
supports those methods), so that each call to

generateCertificate

consumes only one certificate, and the
read position of the input stream is positioned to the next certificate in
the file:

```java
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filename);
BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);

CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");

while (bis.available() > 0) {
Certificate cert = cf.generateCertificate(bis);
System.out.println(cert.toString());
}
```

The following example parses a PKCS#7-formatted certificate reply stored
in a file and extracts all the certificates from it:

```java
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filename);
CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
Collection c = cf.generateCertificates(fis);
Iterator i = c.iterator();
while (i.hasNext()) {
Certificate cert = (Certificate)i.next();
System.out.println(cert);
}
```

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard

CertificateFactory

type:

- X.509

and the following standard

CertPath

encodings:

- PKCS7
- PkiPath

The type and encodings are described in the

CertificateFactory section

and the

CertPath Encodings section

of the
Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.
Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
other types or encodings are supported.

---

#### public final
Certificate
generateCertificate​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CertificateException

Generates a certificate object and initializes it with
the data read from the input stream

inStream

.

In order to take advantage of the specialized certificate format
supported by this certificate factory,
the returned certificate object can be typecast to the corresponding
certificate class. For example, if this certificate
factory implements X.509 certificates, the returned certificate object
can be typecast to the

X509Certificate

class.

In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 certificates, the
certificate provided in

inStream

must be DER-encoded and
may be supplied in binary or printable (Base64) encoding. If the
certificate is provided in Base64 encoding, it must be bounded at
the beginning by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----, and must be bounded at
the end by -----END CERTIFICATE-----.

Note that if the given input stream does not support

mark

and

reset

, this method will
consume the entire input stream. Otherwise, each call to this
method consumes one certificate and the read position of the
input stream is positioned to the next available byte after
the inherent end-of-certificate marker. If the data in the input stream
does not contain an inherent end-of-certificate marker (other
than EOF) and there is trailing data after the certificate is parsed, a

CertificateException

is thrown.

**Parameters:**
- inStream

- an input stream with the certificate data.

**Returns:**
- a certificate object initialized with the data
from the input stream.

**Throws:**
- CertificateException

- on parsing errors.

---

#### public final
Iterator
<
String
> getCertPathEncodings()

Returns an iteration of the

CertPath

encodings supported
by this certificate factory, with the default encoding first. See
the CertPath Encodings section in the

Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification

for information about standard encoding names and their formats.

Attempts to modify the returned

Iterator

via its

remove

method result in an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Returns:**
- an

Iterator

over the names of the supported

CertPath

encodings (as

String

s)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public final
CertPath
generateCertPath​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CertificateException

Generates a

CertPath

object and initializes it with
the data read from the

InputStream

inStream. The data
is assumed to be in the default encoding. The name of the default
encoding is the first element of the

Iterator

returned by
the

getCertPathEncodings

method.

**Parameters:**
- inStream

- an

InputStream

containing the data

**Returns:**
- a

CertPath

initialized with the data from the

InputStream

**Throws:**
- CertificateException

- if an exception occurs while decoding

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public final
CertPath
generateCertPath​(
InputStream
inStream,

String
encoding)
throws
CertificateException

Generates a

CertPath

object and initializes it with
the data read from the

InputStream

inStream. The data
is assumed to be in the specified encoding. See
the CertPath Encodings section in the

Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification

for information about standard encoding names and their formats.

**Parameters:**
- inStream

- an

InputStream

containing the data
- encoding

- the encoding used for the data

**Returns:**
- a

CertPath

initialized with the data from the

InputStream

**Throws:**
- CertificateException

- if an exception occurs while decoding or
the encoding requested is not supported

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public final
CertPath
generateCertPath​(
List
<? extends
Certificate
> certificates)
throws
CertificateException

Generates a

CertPath

object and initializes it with
a

List

of

Certificate

s.

The certificates supplied must be of a type supported by the

CertificateFactory

. They will be copied out of the supplied

List

object.

**Parameters:**
- certificates

- a

List

of

Certificate

s

**Returns:**
- a

CertPath

initialized with the supplied list of
certificates

**Throws:**
- CertificateException

- if an exception occurs

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public final
Collection
<? extends
Certificate
> generateCertificates​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CertificateException

Returns a (possibly empty) collection view of the certificates read
from the given input stream

inStream

.

In order to take advantage of the specialized certificate format
supported by this certificate factory, each element in
the returned collection view can be typecast to the corresponding
certificate class. For example, if this certificate
factory implements X.509 certificates, the elements in the returned
collection can be typecast to the

X509Certificate

class.

In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 certificates,

inStream

may contain a sequence of DER-encoded certificates
in the formats described for

generateCertificate

.
In addition,

inStream

may contain a PKCS#7 certificate
chain. This is a PKCS#7

SignedData

object, with the only
significant field being

certificates

. In particular, the
signature and the contents are ignored. This format allows multiple
certificates to be downloaded at once. If no certificates are present,
an empty collection is returned.

Note that if the given input stream does not support

mark

and

reset

, this method will
consume the entire input stream.

**Parameters:**
- inStream

- the input stream with the certificates.

**Returns:**
- a (possibly empty) collection view of
java.security.cert.Certificate objects
initialized with the data from the input stream.

**Throws:**
- CertificateException

- on parsing errors.

---

#### public final
CRL
generateCRL​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CRLException

Generates a certificate revocation list (CRL) object and initializes it
with the data read from the input stream

inStream

.

In order to take advantage of the specialized CRL format
supported by this certificate factory,
the returned CRL object can be typecast to the corresponding
CRL class. For example, if this certificate
factory implements X.509 CRLs, the returned CRL object
can be typecast to the

X509CRL

class.

Note that if the given input stream does not support

mark

and

reset

, this method will
consume the entire input stream. Otherwise, each call to this
method consumes one CRL and the read position of the input stream
is positioned to the next available byte after the inherent
end-of-CRL marker. If the data in the
input stream does not contain an inherent end-of-CRL marker (other
than EOF) and there is trailing data after the CRL is parsed, a

CRLException

is thrown.

**Parameters:**
- inStream

- an input stream with the CRL data.

**Returns:**
- a CRL object initialized with the data
from the input stream.

**Throws:**
- CRLException

- on parsing errors.

---

#### public final
Collection
<? extends
CRL
> generateCRLs​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CRLException

Returns a (possibly empty) collection view of the CRLs read
from the given input stream

inStream

.

In order to take advantage of the specialized CRL format
supported by this certificate factory, each element in
the returned collection view can be typecast to the corresponding
CRL class. For example, if this certificate
factory implements X.509 CRLs, the elements in the returned
collection can be typecast to the

X509CRL

class.

In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 CRLs,

inStream

may contain a sequence of DER-encoded CRLs.
In addition,

inStream

may contain a PKCS#7 CRL
set. This is a PKCS#7

SignedData

object, with the only
significant field being

crls

. In particular, the
signature and the contents are ignored. This format allows multiple
CRLs to be downloaded at once. If no CRLs are present,
an empty collection is returned.

Note that if the given input stream does not support

mark

and

reset

, this method will
consume the entire input stream.

**Parameters:**
- inStream

- the input stream with the CRLs.

**Returns:**
- a (possibly empty) collection view of
java.security.cert.CRL objects initialized with the data from the input
stream.

**Throws:**
- CRLException

- on parsing errors.

- generateCertificate

```java
public final
Certificate
generateCertificate​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CertificateException
```

Generates a certificate object and initializes it with
the data read from the input stream

inStream

.

In order to take advantage of the specialized certificate format
supported by this certificate factory,
the returned certificate object can be typecast to the corresponding
certificate class. For example, if this certificate
factory implements X.509 certificates, the returned certificate object
can be typecast to the

X509Certificate

class.

In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 certificates, the
certificate provided in

inStream

must be DER-encoded and
may be supplied in binary or printable (Base64) encoding. If the
certificate is provided in Base64 encoding, it must be bounded at
the beginning by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----, and must be bounded at
the end by -----END CERTIFICATE-----.

Note that if the given input stream does not support

mark

and

reset

, this method will
consume the entire input stream. Otherwise, each call to this
method consumes one certificate and the read position of the
input stream is positioned to the next available byte after
the inherent end-of-certificate marker. If the data in the input stream
does not contain an inherent end-of-certificate marker (other
than EOF) and there is trailing data after the certificate is parsed, a

CertificateException

is thrown.

**Parameters:** inStream

- an input stream with the certificate data.
**Returns:** a certificate object initialized with the data
from the input stream.
**Throws:** CertificateException

- on parsing errors.

- getCertPathEncodings

```java
public final
Iterator
<
String
> getCertPathEncodings()
```

Returns an iteration of the

CertPath

encodings supported
by this certificate factory, with the default encoding first. See
the CertPath Encodings section in the

Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification

for information about standard encoding names and their formats.

Attempts to modify the returned

Iterator

via its

remove

method result in an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

**Returns:** an

Iterator

over the names of the supported

CertPath

encodings (as

String

s)
**Since:** 1.4

- generateCertPath

```java
public final
CertPath
generateCertPath​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CertificateException
```

Generates a

CertPath

object and initializes it with
the data read from the

InputStream

inStream. The data
is assumed to be in the default encoding. The name of the default
encoding is the first element of the

Iterator

returned by
the

getCertPathEncodings

method.

**Parameters:** inStream

- an

InputStream

containing the data
**Returns:** a

CertPath

initialized with the data from the

InputStream
**Throws:** CertificateException

- if an exception occurs while decoding
**Since:** 1.4

- generateCertPath

```java
public final
CertPath
generateCertPath​(
InputStream
inStream,

String
encoding)
throws
CertificateException
```

Generates a

CertPath

object and initializes it with
the data read from the

InputStream

inStream. The data
is assumed to be in the specified encoding. See
the CertPath Encodings section in the

Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification

for information about standard encoding names and their formats.

**Parameters:** inStream

- an

InputStream

containing the data
**Parameters:** encoding

- the encoding used for the data
**Returns:** a

CertPath

initialized with the data from the

InputStream
**Throws:** CertificateException

- if an exception occurs while decoding or
the encoding requested is not supported
**Since:** 1.4

- generateCertPath

```java
public final
CertPath
generateCertPath​(
List
<? extends
Certificate
> certificates)
throws
CertificateException
```

Generates a

CertPath

object and initializes it with
a

List

of

Certificate

s.

The certificates supplied must be of a type supported by the

CertificateFactory

. They will be copied out of the supplied

List

object.

**Parameters:** certificates

- a

List

of

Certificate

s
**Returns:** a

CertPath

initialized with the supplied list of
certificates
**Throws:** CertificateException

- if an exception occurs
**Since:** 1.4

- generateCertificates

```java
public final
Collection
<? extends
Certificate
> generateCertificates​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CertificateException
```

Returns a (possibly empty) collection view of the certificates read
from the given input stream

inStream

.

In order to take advantage of the specialized certificate format
supported by this certificate factory, each element in
the returned collection view can be typecast to the corresponding
certificate class. For example, if this certificate
factory implements X.509 certificates, the elements in the returned
collection can be typecast to the

X509Certificate

class.

In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 certificates,

inStream

may contain a sequence of DER-encoded certificates
in the formats described for

generateCertificate

.
In addition,

inStream

may contain a PKCS#7 certificate
chain. This is a PKCS#7

SignedData

object, with the only
significant field being

certificates

. In particular, the
signature and the contents are ignored. This format allows multiple
certificates to be downloaded at once. If no certificates are present,
an empty collection is returned.

Note that if the given input stream does not support

mark

and

reset

, this method will
consume the entire input stream.

**Parameters:** inStream

- the input stream with the certificates.
**Returns:** a (possibly empty) collection view of
java.security.cert.Certificate objects
initialized with the data from the input stream.
**Throws:** CertificateException

- on parsing errors.

- generateCRL

```java
public final
CRL
generateCRL​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CRLException
```

Generates a certificate revocation list (CRL) object and initializes it
with the data read from the input stream

inStream

.

In order to take advantage of the specialized CRL format
supported by this certificate factory,
the returned CRL object can be typecast to the corresponding
CRL class. For example, if this certificate
factory implements X.509 CRLs, the returned CRL object
can be typecast to the

X509CRL

class.

Note that if the given input stream does not support

mark

and

reset

, this method will
consume the entire input stream. Otherwise, each call to this
method consumes one CRL and the read position of the input stream
is positioned to the next available byte after the inherent
end-of-CRL marker. If the data in the
input stream does not contain an inherent end-of-CRL marker (other
than EOF) and there is trailing data after the CRL is parsed, a

CRLException

is thrown.

**Parameters:** inStream

- an input stream with the CRL data.
**Returns:** a CRL object initialized with the data
from the input stream.
**Throws:** CRLException

- on parsing errors.

- generateCRLs

```java
public final
Collection
<? extends
CRL
> generateCRLs​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CRLException
```

Returns a (possibly empty) collection view of the CRLs read
from the given input stream

inStream

.

In order to take advantage of the specialized CRL format
supported by this certificate factory, each element in
the returned collection view can be typecast to the corresponding
CRL class. For example, if this certificate
factory implements X.509 CRLs, the elements in the returned
collection can be typecast to the

X509CRL

class.

In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 CRLs,

inStream

may contain a sequence of DER-encoded CRLs.
In addition,

inStream

may contain a PKCS#7 CRL
set. This is a PKCS#7

SignedData

object, with the only
significant field being

crls

. In particular, the
signature and the contents are ignored. This format allows multiple
CRLs to be downloaded at once. If no CRLs are present,
an empty collection is returned.

Note that if the given input stream does not support

mark

and

reset

, this method will
consume the entire input stream.

**Parameters:** inStream

- the input stream with the CRLs.
**Returns:** a (possibly empty) collection view of
java.security.cert.CRL objects initialized with the data from the input
stream.
**Throws:** CRLException

- on parsing errors.

CRL class. For example, if this certificate
factory implements X.509 CRLs, the elements in the returned
collection can be typecast to the

X509CRL

class.

In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 CRLs,

inStream

may contain a sequence of DER-encoded CRLs.
In addition,

inStream

may contain a PKCS#7 CRL
set. This is a PKCS#7

SignedData

object, with the only
significant field being

crls

. In particular, the
signature and the contents are ignored. This format allows multiple
CRLs to be downloaded at once. If no CRLs are present,
an empty collection is returned.

Note that if the given input stream does not support

mark

and

reset

, this method will
consume the entire input stream.

**Parameters:** inStream

- the input stream with the CRLs.
**Returns:** a (possibly empty) collection view of
java.security.cert.CRL objects initialized with the data from the input
stream.
**Throws:** CRLException

- on parsing errors.

generateCertificate

```java
public final
Certificate
generateCertificate​(
InputStream
inStream)
throws
CertificateException
```

Generates a certificate object and initializes it with
the data read from the input stream

inStream

.

In order to take advantage of the specialized certificate format
supported by this certificate factory,
the returned certificate object can be typecast to the corresponding
certificate class. For example, if this certificate
factory implements X.509 certificates, the returned certificate object
can be typecast to the

X509Certificate

class.

In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 certificates, the
certificate provided in

inStream

must be DER-encoded and
may be supplied in binary or printable (Base64) encoding. If the
certificate is provided in Base64 encoding, it must be bounded at
the beginning by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----, and must be bounded at
the end by -----END CERTIFICATE-----.

Note that if the given input stream does not support

mark

and

reset

, this method will
consume the entire input stream. Otherwise, each call to this
method consumes one certificate and the read position of the
input stream is positioned to the next available byte after
the inherent end-of-certificate marker. If the data in the input stream
does not contain an inherent end-of-certificate marker (other
than EOF) and there is trailing data after the certificate is parsed, a

CertificateException

is thrown.

**Parameters:** inStream

- an input stream with the certificate data.
**Returns:** a certificate object initialized with the data
from the input stream.
**Throws:** CertificateException
