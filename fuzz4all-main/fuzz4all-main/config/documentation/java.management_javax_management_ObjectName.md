# Class ObjectName

**Source:** `java.management\javax\management\ObjectName.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ObjectName

extends
Object

implements
Comparable
<
ObjectName
>,
QueryExp
```

Represents the object name of an MBean, or a pattern that can
match the names of several MBeans. Instances of this class are
immutable.

An instance of this class can be used to represent:

- An object name
- An object name pattern, within the context of a query

An object name consists of two parts, the domain and the key
properties.

The

domain

is a string of characters not including
the character colon (

:

). It is recommended that the domain
should not contain the string "

//

", which is reserved for future use.

If the domain includes at least one occurrence of the wildcard
characters asterisk (

*

) or question mark
(

?

), then the object name is a pattern. The asterisk
matches any sequence of zero or more characters, while the question
mark matches any single character.

If the domain is empty, it will be replaced in certain contexts
by the

default domain

of the MBean server in which the
ObjectName is used.

The

key properties

are an unordered set of keys and
associated values.

Each

key

is a nonempty string of characters which may
not contain any of the characters comma (

,

), equals
(

=

), colon, asterisk, or question mark. The same key
may not occur twice in a given ObjectName.

Each

value

associated with a key is a string of
characters that is either unquoted or quoted.

An

unquoted value

is a possibly empty string of
characters which may not contain any of the characters comma,
equals, colon, or quote.

If the

unquoted value

contains at least one occurrence
of the wildcard characters asterisk or question mark, then the object
name is a

property value pattern

. The asterisk matches any
sequence of zero or more characters, while the question mark matches
any single character.

A

quoted value

consists of a quote (

"

),
followed by a possibly empty string of characters, followed by
another quote. Within the string of characters, the backslash
(

\

) has a special meaning. It must be followed by
one of the following characters:

- Another backslash. The second backslash has no special
meaning and the two characters represent a single backslash.
- The character 'n'. The two characters represent a newline
('\n' in Java).
- A quote. The two characters represent a quote, and that quote
is not considered to terminate the quoted value. An ending closing
quote must be present for the quoted value to be valid.
- A question mark (?) or asterisk (*). The two characters represent
a question mark or asterisk respectively.

A quote may not appear inside a quoted value except immediately
after an odd number of consecutive backslashes.

The quotes surrounding a quoted value, and any backslashes
within that value, are considered to be part of the value.

If the

quoted value

contains at least one occurrence of
the characters asterisk or question mark and they are not preceded
by a backslash, then they are considered as wildcard characters and
the object name is a

property value pattern

. The asterisk
matches any sequence of zero or more characters, while the question
mark matches any single character.

An ObjectName may be a

property list pattern

. In this
case it may have zero or more keys and associated values. It matches
a nonpattern ObjectName whose domain matches and that contains the
same keys and associated values, as well as possibly other keys and
values.

An ObjectName is a

property value pattern

when at least
one of its

quoted

or

unquoted

key property values
contains the wildcard characters asterisk or question mark as described
above. In this case it has one or more keys and associated values, with
at least one of the values containing wildcard characters. It matches a
nonpattern ObjectName whose domain matches and that contains the same
keys whose values match; if the property value pattern is also a
property list pattern then the nonpattern ObjectName can contain
other keys and values.

An ObjectName is a

property pattern

if it is either a

property list pattern

or a

property value pattern

or both.

An ObjectName is a pattern if its domain contains a wildcard or
if the ObjectName is a property pattern.

If an ObjectName is not a pattern, it must contain at least one
key with its associated value.

Examples of ObjectName patterns are:

- *:type=Foo,name=Bar

to match names in any domain whose
exact set of keys is

type=Foo,name=Bar

.
- d:type=Foo,name=Bar,*

to match names in the domain

d

that have the keys

type=Foo,name=Bar

plus
zero or more other keys.
- *:type=Foo,name=Bar,*

to match names in any domain
that has the keys

type=Foo,name=Bar

plus zero or
more other keys.
- d:type=F?o,name=Bar

will match e.g.

d:type=Foo,name=Bar

and

d:type=Fro,name=Bar

.
- d:type=F*o,name=Bar

will match e.g.

d:type=Fo,name=Bar

and

d:type=Frodo,name=Bar

.
- d:type=Foo,name="B*"

will match e.g.

d:type=Foo,name="Bling"

. Wildcards are recognized even
inside quotes, and like other special characters can be escaped
with

\

.

An ObjectName can be written as a String with the following
elements in order:

- The domain.

A colon (

:

).

A key property list as defined below.

A key property list written as a String is a comma-separated
list of elements. Each element is either an asterisk or a key
property. A key property consists of a key, an equals
(

=

), and the associated value.

At most one element of a key property list may be an asterisk.
If the key property list contains an asterisk element, the
ObjectName is a property list pattern.

Spaces have no special significance in a String representing an
ObjectName. For example, the String:

```java
domain: key1 = value1 , key2 = value2
```

represents an ObjectName with two keys. The name of each key
contains six characters, of which the first and last are spaces.
The value associated with the key

" key1 "

also begins and ends with a space.

In addition to the restrictions on characters spelt out above,
no part of an ObjectName may contain a newline character
(

'\n'

), whether the domain, a key, or a value, whether
quoted or unquoted. The newline character can be represented in a
quoted value with the sequence

\n

.

The rules on special characters and quoting apply regardless of
which constructor is used to make an ObjectName.

To avoid collisions between MBeans supplied by different
vendors, a useful convention is to begin the domain name with the
reverse DNS name of the organization that specifies the MBeans,
followed by a period and a string whose interpretation is
determined by that organization. For example, MBeans specified by

example.com

would have
domains such as

com.example.MyDomain

. This is essentially
the same convention as for Java-language package names.

---

#### public static
ObjectName
getInstance​(
ObjectName
name)

Return an instance of ObjectName that can be used anywhere
the given object can be used. The returned object may be of a
subclass of ObjectName. If

name

is of a subclass
of ObjectName, it is not guaranteed that the returned object
will be of the same class.

The returned value may or may not be identical to

name

. Calling this method twice with the same
parameters may return the same object or two equal but not
identical objects.

Since ObjectName is immutable, it is not usually useful to
make a copy of an ObjectName. The principal use of this method
is to guard against a malicious caller who might pass an
instance of a subclass with surprising behavior to sensitive
code. Such code can call this method to obtain an ObjectName
that is known not to have surprising behavior.

**Parameters:**
- name

- an instance of the ObjectName class or of a subclass

**Returns:**
- an instance of ObjectName or a subclass that is known to
have the same semantics. If

name

respects the
semantics of ObjectName, then the returned object is equal
(though not necessarily identical) to

name

.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- The

name

is null.

---

#### public boolean isPattern()

Checks whether the object name is a pattern.

An object name is a pattern if its domain contains a
wildcard or if the object name is a property pattern.

**Returns:**
- True if the name is a pattern, otherwise false.

---

#### public boolean isDomainPattern()

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the domain part.

**Returns:**
- True if the name is a domain pattern, otherwise false.

---

#### public boolean isPropertyPattern()

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the key properties.

An object name is a pattern on the key properties if it is a
pattern on the key property list (e.g. "d:k=v,*") or on the
property values (e.g. "d:k=*") or on both (e.g. "d:k=*,*").

**Returns:**
- True if the name is a property pattern, otherwise false.

---

#### public boolean isPropertyListPattern()

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the key property list.

For example, "d:k=v,*" and "d:k=*,*" are key property list patterns
whereas "d:k=*" is not.

- True if the name is a property list pattern, otherwise false.

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public boolean isPropertyValuePattern()

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the value part
of at least one of the key properties.

For example, "d:k=*" and "d:k=*,*" are property value patterns
whereas "d:k=v,*" is not.

**Returns:**
- True if the name is a property value pattern, otherwise false.

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public boolean isPropertyValuePattern​(
String

---

#### public
String
getCanonicalName()

Returns the canonical form of the name; that is, a string
representation where the properties are sorted in lexical
order.

More precisely, the canonical form of the name is a String
consisting of the

domain part

, a colon
(

:

), the

canonical key property list

, and
a

pattern indication

.

The

canonical key property list

is the same string
as described for

getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString()

.

The

pattern indication

is:

- empty for an ObjectName
that is not a property list pattern;

an asterisk for an ObjectName
that is a property list pattern with no keys; or

a comma and an
asterisk (

,*

) for an ObjectName that is a property
list pattern with at least one key.

is null.

---

#### public
Hashtable
<
String
,​
String
> getKeyPropertyList()

Returns the key properties as a Hashtable. The returned
value is a Hashtable in which each key is a key in the
ObjectName's key property list and each value is the associated
value.

The returned value may be unmodifiable. If it is
modifiable, changing it has no effect on this ObjectName.

**Returns:**
- The table of key properties.

---

#### public
String
getKeyPropertyListString()

Returns a string representation of the list of key
properties specified at creation time. If this ObjectName was
constructed with the constructor

ObjectName(String)

,
the key properties in the returned String will be in the same
order as in the argument to the constructor.

**Returns:**
- The key property list string. This string is
independent of whether the ObjectName is a pattern.

---

#### public
String
getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString()

Returns a string representation of the list of key properties,
in which the key properties are sorted in lexical order. This
is used in lexicographic comparisons performed in order to
select MBeans based on their key property list. Lexical order
is the order implied by

String.compareTo(String)

.

**Returns:**
- The canonical key property list string. This string is
independent of whether the ObjectName is a pattern.

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string representation of the object name. The

.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- object

- The object name that the current object name is to be
compared with.

**Returns:**
- True if

object

is an ObjectName whose
canonical form is equal to that of this ObjectName.

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### public int hashCode()

Returns a hash code for this object name.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a hash code value for this object.

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public static
String
quote​(
String
s)

Returns a quoted form of the given String, suitable for
inclusion in an ObjectName. The returned value can be used as
the value associated with a key in an ObjectName. The String

s

may contain any character. Appropriate quoting
ensures that the returned value is legal in an ObjectName.

The returned value consists of a quote ('"'), a sequence of
characters corresponding to the characters of

s

,
and another quote. Characters in

s

appear
unchanged within the returned value except:

- A quote ('"') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by a quote.
- An asterisk ('*') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by an
asterisk.
- A question mark ('?') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by
a question mark.
- A backslash ('\') is replaced by two backslashes.
- A newline character (the character '\n' in Java) is replaced
by a backslash followed by the character '\n'.

**Parameters:**
- s

- the String to be quoted.

**Returns:**
- the quoted String.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

s

is null.

---

#### public static
String
unquote​(
String
q)

Returns an unquoted form of the given String. If

q

is a String returned by

quote(s)

,
then

unquote(q).equals(s)

. If there is no String

s

for which

quote(s).equals(q)

, then
unquote(q) throws an IllegalArgumentException.

These rules imply that there is a one-to-one mapping between
quoted and unquoted forms.

**Parameters:**
- q

- the String to be unquoted.

**Returns:**
- the unquoted String.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

q

could not
have been returned by the

quote(java.lang.String)

method, for instance
if it does not begin and end with a quote (").
- NullPointerException

- if

q

is null.

---

#### public boolean apply​(
ObjectName
name)

Test whether this ObjectName, which may be a pattern,
matches another ObjectName. If

name

is a pattern,
the result is false. If this ObjectName is a pattern, the
result is true if and only if

name

matches the
pattern. If neither this ObjectName nor

name

is
a pattern, the result is true if and only if the two
ObjectNames are equal as described for the

equals(Object)

method.

**Specified by:**
- apply

in interface

QueryExp

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the MBean to compare to.

**Returns:**
- True if

name

matches this ObjectName.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

name

is null.

---

#### public int compareTo​(
ObjectName
name)

Compares two ObjectName instances. The ordering relation between
ObjectNames is not completely specified but is intended to be such
that a sorted list of ObjectNames will appear in an order that is
convenient for a person to read.

In particular, if the two ObjectName instances have different
domains then their order is the lexicographical order of the domains.
The ordering of the key property list remains unspecified.

For example, the ObjectName instances below:

- Shapes:type=Square,name=3
- Colors:type=Red,name=2
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=2
- Colors:type=Red,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=1
- Colors:type=Blue,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=2
- JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=scalene,name=1

could be ordered as follows:

- Colors:type=Blue,name=1
- Colors:type=Red,name=1
- Colors:type=Red,name=2
- JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate
- Shapes:type=Square,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=2
- Shapes:type=Square,name=3
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=scalene,name=1
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=2

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

ObjectName

QueryExp

```java
public class
ObjectName

extends
Object

implements
Comparable
<
ObjectName
>,
QueryExp
```

Represents the object name of an MBean, or a pattern that can
match the names of several MBeans. Instances of this class are
immutable.

An instance of this class can be used to represent:

- An object name
- An object name pattern, within the context of a query

An object name consists of two parts, the domain and the key
properties.

The

domain

is a string of characters not including
the character colon (

:

). It is recommended that the domain
should not contain the string "

//

", which is reserved for future use.

If the domain includes at least one occurrence of the wildcard
characters asterisk (

*

) or question mark
(

?

), then the object name is a pattern. The asterisk
matches any sequence of zero or more characters, while the question
mark matches any single character.

If the domain is empty, it will be replaced in certain contexts
by the

default domain

of the MBean server in which the
ObjectName is used.

The

key properties

are an unordered set of keys and
associated values.

Each

key

is a nonempty string of characters which may
not contain any of the characters comma (

,

), equals
(

=

), colon, asterisk, or question mark. The same key
may not occur twice in a given ObjectName.

Each

value

associated with a key is a string of
characters that is either unquoted or quoted.

An

unquoted value

is a possibly empty string of
characters which may not contain any of the characters comma,
equals, colon, or quote.

If the

unquoted value

contains at least one occurrence
of the wildcard characters asterisk or question mark, then the object
name is a

property value pattern

. The asterisk matches any
sequence of zero or more characters, while the question mark matches
any single character.

A

quoted value

consists of a quote (

"

),
followed by a possibly empty string of characters, followed by
another quote. Within the string of characters, the backslash
(

\

) has a special meaning. It must be followed by
one of the following characters:

- Another backslash. The second backslash has no special
meaning and the two characters represent a single backslash.
- The character 'n'. The two characters represent a newline
('\n' in Java).
- A quote. The two characters represent a quote, and that quote
is not considered to terminate the quoted value. An ending closing
quote must be present for the quoted value to be valid.
- A question mark (?) or asterisk (*). The two characters represent
a question mark or asterisk respectively.

A quote may not appear inside a quoted value except immediately
after an odd number of consecutive backslashes.

The quotes surrounding a quoted value, and any backslashes
within that value, are considered to be part of the value.

If the

quoted value

contains at least one occurrence of
the characters asterisk or question mark and they are not preceded
by a backslash, then they are considered as wildcard characters and
the object name is a

property value pattern

. The asterisk
matches any sequence of zero or more characters, while the question
mark matches any single character.

An ObjectName may be a

property list pattern

. In this
case it may have zero or more keys and associated values. It matches
a nonpattern ObjectName whose domain matches and that contains the
same keys and associated values, as well as possibly other keys and
values.

An ObjectName is a

property value pattern

when at least
one of its

quoted

or

unquoted

key property values
contains the wildcard characters asterisk or question mark as described
above. In this case it has one or more keys and associated values, with
at least one of the values containing wildcard characters. It matches a
nonpattern ObjectName whose domain matches and that contains the same
keys whose values match; if the property value pattern is also a
property list pattern then the nonpattern ObjectName can contain
other keys and values.

An ObjectName is a

property pattern

if it is either a

property list pattern

or a

property value pattern

or both.

An ObjectName is a pattern if its domain contains a wildcard or
if the ObjectName is a property pattern.

If an ObjectName is not a pattern, it must contain at least one
key with its associated value.

Examples of ObjectName patterns are:

- *:type=Foo,name=Bar

to match names in any domain whose
exact set of keys is

type=Foo,name=Bar

.
- d:type=Foo,name=Bar,*

to match names in the domain

d

that have the keys

type=Foo,name=Bar

plus
zero or more other keys.
- *:type=Foo,name=Bar,*

to match names in any domain
that has the keys

type=Foo,name=Bar

plus zero or
more other keys.
- d:type=F?o,name=Bar

will match e.g.

d:type=Foo,name=Bar

and

d:type=Fro,name=Bar

.
- d:type=F*o,name=Bar

will match e.g.

d:type=Fo,name=Bar

and

d:type=Frodo,name=Bar

.
- d:type=Foo,name="B*"

will match e.g.

d:type=Foo,name="Bling"

. Wildcards are recognized even
inside quotes, and like other special characters can be escaped
with

\

.

An ObjectName can be written as a String with the following
elements in order:

- The domain.

A colon (

:

).

A key property list as defined below.

A key property list written as a String is a comma-separated
list of elements. Each element is either an asterisk or a key
property. A key property consists of a key, an equals
(

=

), and the associated value.

At most one element of a key property list may be an asterisk.
If the key property list contains an asterisk element, the
ObjectName is a property list pattern.

Spaces have no special significance in a String representing an
ObjectName. For example, the String:

```java
domain: key1 = value1 , key2 = value2
```

represents an ObjectName with two keys. The name of each key
contains six characters, of which the first and last are spaces.
The value associated with the key

" key1 "

also begins and ends with a space.

In addition to the restrictions on characters spelt out above,
no part of an ObjectName may contain a newline character
(

'\n'

), whether the domain, a key, or a value, whether
quoted or unquoted. The newline character can be represented in a
quoted value with the sequence

\n

.

The rules on special characters and quoting apply regardless of
which constructor is used to make an ObjectName.

To avoid collisions between MBeans supplied by different
vendors, a useful convention is to begin the domain name with the
reverse DNS name of the organization that specifies the MBeans,
followed by a period and a string whose interpretation is
determined by that organization. For example, MBeans specified by

example.com

would have
domains such as

com.example.MyDomain

. This is essentially
the same convention as for Java-language package names.

QueryExp

Represents the object name of an MBean, or a pattern that can
match the names of several MBeans. Instances of this class are
immutable.

An instance of this class can be used to represent:

- An object name
- An object name pattern, within the context of a query

An object name consists of two parts, the domain and the key
properties.

The

domain

is a string of characters not including
the character colon (

:

). It is recommended that the domain
should not contain the string "

//

", which is reserved for future use.

If the domain includes at least one occurrence of the wildcard
characters asterisk (

*

) or question mark
(

?

), then the object name is a pattern. The asterisk
matches any sequence of zero or more characters, while the question
mark matches any single character.

If the domain is empty, it will be replaced in certain contexts
by the

default domain

of the MBean server in which the
ObjectName is used.

The

key properties

are an unordered set of keys and
associated values.

Each

key

is a nonempty string of characters which may
not contain any of the characters comma (

,

), equals
(

=

), colon, asterisk, or question mark. The same key
may not occur twice in a given ObjectName.

Each

value

associated with a key is a string of
characters that is either unquoted or quoted.

An

unquoted value

is a possibly empty string of
characters which may not contain any of the characters comma,
equals, colon, or quote.

If the

unquoted value

contains at least one occurrence
of the wildcard characters asterisk or question mark, then the object
name is a

property value pattern

. The asterisk matches any
sequence of zero or more characters, while the question mark matches
any single character.

A

quoted value

consists of a quote (

"

),
followed by a possibly empty string of characters, followed by
another quote. Within the string of characters, the backslash
(

\

) has a special meaning. It must be followed by
one of the following characters:

- Another backslash. The second backslash has no special
meaning and the two characters represent a single backslash.
- The character 'n'. The two characters represent a newline
('\n' in Java).
- A quote. The two characters represent a quote, and that quote
is not considered to terminate the quoted value. An ending closing
quote must be present for the quoted value to be valid.
- A question mark (?) or asterisk (*). The two characters represent
a question mark or asterisk respectively.

A quote may not appear inside a quoted value except immediately
after an odd number of consecutive backslashes.

The quotes surrounding a quoted value, and any backslashes
within that value, are considered to be part of the value.

If the

quoted value

contains at least one occurrence of
the characters asterisk or question mark and they are not preceded
by a backslash, then they are considered as wildcard characters and
the object name is a

property value pattern

. The asterisk
matches any sequence of zero or more characters, while the question
mark matches any single character.

An ObjectName may be a

property list pattern

. In this
case it may have zero or more keys and associated values. It matches
a nonpattern ObjectName whose domain matches and that contains the
same keys and associated values, as well as possibly other keys and
values.

An ObjectName is a

property value pattern

when at least
one of its

quoted

or

unquoted

key property values
contains the wildcard characters asterisk or question mark as described
above. In this case it has one or more keys and associated values, with
at least one of the values containing wildcard characters. It matches a
nonpattern ObjectName whose domain matches and that contains the same
keys whose values match; if the property value pattern is also a
property list pattern then the nonpattern ObjectName can contain
other keys and values.

An ObjectName is a

property pattern

if it is either a

property list pattern

or a

property value pattern

or both.

An ObjectName is a pattern if its domain contains a wildcard or
if the ObjectName is a property pattern.

If an ObjectName is not a pattern, it must contain at least one
key with its associated value.

Examples of ObjectName patterns are:

- *:type=Foo,name=Bar

to match names in any domain whose
exact set of keys is

type=Foo,name=Bar

.
- d:type=Foo,name=Bar,*

to match names in the domain

d

that have the keys

type=Foo,name=Bar

plus
zero or more other keys.
- *:type=Foo,name=Bar,*

to match names in any domain
that has the keys

type=Foo,name=Bar

plus zero or
more other keys.
- d:type=F?o,name=Bar

will match e.g.

d:type=Foo,name=Bar

and

d:type=Fro,name=Bar

.
- d:type=F*o,name=Bar

will match e.g.

d:type=Fo,name=Bar

and

d:type=Frodo,name=Bar

.
- d:type=Foo,name="B*"

will match e.g.

d:type=Foo,name="Bling"

. Wildcards are recognized even
inside quotes, and like other special characters can be escaped
with

\

.

An ObjectName can be written as a String with the following
elements in order:

- The domain.

A colon (

:

).

A key property list as defined below.

A key property list written as a String is a comma-separated
list of elements. Each element is either an asterisk or a key
property. A key property consists of a key, an equals
(

=

), and the associated value.

At most one element of a key property list may be an asterisk.
If the key property list contains an asterisk element, the
ObjectName is a property list pattern.

Spaces have no special significance in a String representing an
ObjectName. For example, the String:

```java
domain: key1 = value1 , key2 = value2
```

represents an ObjectName with two keys. The name of each key
contains six characters, of which the first and last are spaces.
The value associated with the key

" key1 "

also begins and ends with a space.

In addition to the restrictions on characters spelt out above,
no part of an ObjectName may contain a newline character
(

'\n'

), whether the domain, a key, or a value, whether
quoted or unquoted. The newline character can be represented in a
quoted value with the sequence

\n

.

The rules on special characters and quoting apply regardless of
which constructor is used to make an ObjectName.

An instance of this class can be used to represent:

An object name

An object name pattern, within the context of a query

An object name consists of two parts, the domain and the key
properties.

The

domain

is a string of characters not including
the character colon (

:

). It is recommended that the domain
should not contain the string "

//

", which is reserved for future use.

If the domain includes at least one occurrence of the wildcard
characters asterisk (

matches any sequence of zero or more characters, while the question
mark matches any single character.

If the domain is empty, it will be replaced in certain contexts
by the

default domain

of the MBean server in which the
ObjectName is used.

The

key properties

are an unordered set of keys and
associated values.

Each

key

is a nonempty string of characters which may
not contain any of the characters comma (

,

), equals
(

=

), colon, asterisk, or question mark. The same key
may not occur twice in a given ObjectName.

Each

value

associated with a key is a string of
characters that is either unquoted or quoted.

An

unquoted value

is a possibly empty string of
characters which may not contain any of the characters comma,
equals, colon, or quote.

If the

unquoted value

contains at least one occurrence
of the wildcard characters asterisk or question mark, then the object
name is a

property value pattern

. The asterisk matches any
sequence of zero or more characters, while the question mark matches
any single character.

A

quoted value

consists of a quote (

followed by a possibly empty string of characters, followed by
another quote. Within the string of characters, the backslash

The quotes surrounding a quoted value, and any backslashes
within that value, are considered to be part of the value.

If the

quoted value

contains at least one occurrence of
the characters asterisk or question mark and they are not preceded
by a backslash, then they are considered as wildcard characters and
the object name is a

property value pattern

. The asterisk
matches any sequence of zero or more characters, while the question
mark matches any single character.

An ObjectName may be a

property list pattern

. In this
case it may have zero or more keys and associated values. It matches
a nonpattern ObjectName whose domain matches and that contains the
same keys and associated values, as well as possibly other keys and
values.

An ObjectName is a

property value pattern

when at least
one of its

quoted

or

unquoted

key property values
contains the wildcard characters asterisk or question mark as described

at least one of the values containing wildcard characters. It matches a
nonpattern ObjectName whose domain matches and that contains the same
keys whose values match; if the property value pattern is also a
property list pattern then the nonpattern ObjectName can contain
other keys and values.

An ObjectName is a

property pattern

if it is either a

property list pattern

or a

property value pattern

or both.

An ObjectName is a pattern if its domain contains a wildcard or
if the ObjectName is a property pattern.

If an ObjectName is not a pattern, it must contain at least one
key with its associated value.

Examples of ObjectName patterns are:

- *:type=Foo,name=Bar

to match names in any domain whose
exact set of keys is

type=Foo,name=Bar

.
- d:type=Foo,name=Bar,*

to match names in the domain

d

that have the keys

type=Foo,name=Bar

plus
zero or more other keys.
- *:type=Foo,name=Bar,*

to match names in any domain
that has the keys

type=Foo,name=Bar

plus zero or
more other keys.
- d:type=F?o,name=Bar

will match e.g.

d:type=Foo,name=Bar

and

d:type=Fro,name=Bar

.
- d:type=F*o,name=Bar

will match e.g.

d:type=Fo,name=Bar

and

d:type=Frodo,name=Bar

.
- d:type=Foo,name="B*"

will match e.g.

d:type=Foo,name="Bling"

- getInstance

```java
public static
ObjectName
getInstance​(
ObjectName
name)
```

Return an instance of ObjectName that can be used anywhere
the given object can be used. The returned object may be of a
subclass of ObjectName. If

name

is of a subclass
of ObjectName, it is not guaranteed that the returned object
will be of the same class.

The returned value may or may not be identical to

name

. Calling this method twice with the same
parameters may return the same object or two equal but not
identical objects.

Since ObjectName is immutable, it is not usually useful to
make a copy of an ObjectName. The principal use of this method
is to guard against a malicious caller who might pass an
instance of a subclass with surprising behavior to sensitive
code. Such code can call this method to obtain an ObjectName
that is known not to have surprising behavior.

**Parameters:** name

- an instance of the ObjectName class or of a subclass
**Returns:** an instance of ObjectName or a subclass that is known to
have the same semantics. If

name

respects the
semantics of ObjectName, then the returned object is equal
(though not necessarily identical) to

name

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- The

name

is null.

- isPattern

```java
public boolean isPattern()
```

Checks whether the object name is a pattern.

An object name is a pattern if its domain contains a
wildcard or if the object name is a property pattern.

**Returns:** True if the name is a pattern, otherwise false.

- isDomainPattern

```java
public boolean isDomainPattern()
```

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the domain part.

**Returns:** True if the name is a domain pattern, otherwise false.

- isPropertyPattern

```java
public boolean isPropertyPattern()
```

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the key properties.

An object name is a pattern on the key properties if it is a
pattern on the key property list (e.g. "d:k=v,*") or on the
property values (e.g. "d:k=*") or on both (e.g. "d:k=*,*").

**Returns:** True if the name is a property pattern, otherwise false.

- isPropertyListPattern

```java
public boolean isPropertyListPattern()
```

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the key property list.

For example, "d:k=v,*" and "d:k=*,*" are key property list patterns
whereas "d:k=*" is not.

**Returns:** True if the name is a property list pattern, otherwise false.
**Since:** 1.6

- isPropertyValuePattern

```java
public boolean isPropertyValuePattern()
```

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the value part
of at least one of the key properties.

For example, "d:k=*" and "d:k=*,*" are property value patterns
whereas "d:k=v,*" is not.

**Returns:** True if the name is a property value pattern, otherwise false.
**Since:** 1.6

- isPropertyValuePattern

```java
public boolean isPropertyValuePattern​(
String
property)
```

Checks whether the value associated with a key in a key
property is a pattern.

**Parameters:** property

- The property whose value is to be checked.
**Returns:** True if the value associated with the given key property
is a pattern, otherwise false.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

property

is null.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If

property

is not
a valid key property for this ObjectName.
**Since:** 1.6

- getCanonicalName

```java
public
String
getCanonicalName()
```

Returns the canonical form of the name; that is, a string
representation where the properties are sorted in lexical
order.

More precisely, the canonical form of the name is a String
consisting of the

domain part

, a colon
(

:

), the

canonical key property list

, and
a

pattern indication

.

The

canonical key property list

is the same string
as described for

getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString()

.

The

pattern indication

is:

- empty for an ObjectName
that is not a property list pattern;

an asterisk for an ObjectName
that is a property list pattern with no keys; or

a comma and an
asterisk (

,*

) for an ObjectName that is a property
list pattern with at least one key.

**Returns:** The canonical form of the name.

- getDomain

```java
public
String
getDomain()
```

Returns the domain part.

**Returns:** The domain.

- getKeyProperty

```java
public
String
getKeyProperty​(
String
property)
```

Obtains the value associated with a key in a key property.

**Parameters:** property

- The property whose value is to be obtained.
**Returns:** The value of the property, or null if there is no such
property in this ObjectName.

- If

property

is null.

- getKeyPropertyList

```java
public
Hashtable
<
String
,​
String
> getKeyPropertyList()
```

Returns the key properties as a Hashtable. The returned
value is a Hashtable in which each key is a key in the
ObjectName's key property list and each value is the associated
value.

The returned value may be unmodifiable. If it is
modifiable, changing it has no effect on this ObjectName.

**Returns:** The table of key properties.

- getKeyPropertyListString

```java
public
String
getKeyPropertyListString()
```

Returns a string representation of the list of key
properties specified at creation time. If this ObjectName was
constructed with the constructor

ObjectName(String)

,
the key properties in the returned String will be in the same
order as in the argument to the constructor.

**Returns:** The key property list string. This string is
independent of whether the ObjectName is a pattern.

- getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString

```java
public
String
getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString()
```

Returns a string representation of the list of key properties,
in which the key properties are sorted in lexical order. This
is used in lexicographic comparisons performed in order to
select MBeans based on their key property list. Lexical order
is the order implied by

String.compareTo(String)

.

**Returns:** The canonical key property list string. This string is
independent of whether the ObjectName is a pattern.

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of the object name. The
format of this string is not specified, but users can expect
that two ObjectNames return the same string if and only if they
are equal.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of this object name.

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
object)
```

Compares the current object name with another object name. Two
ObjectName instances are equal if and only if their canonical
forms are equal. The canonical form is the string described
for

getCanonicalName()

.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** object

- The object name that the current object name is to be
compared with.
**Returns:** True if

object

is an ObjectName whose
canonical form is equal to that of this ObjectName.
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns a hash code for this object name.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** a hash code value for this object.
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- quote

```java
public static
String
quote​(
String
s)
```

Returns a quoted form of the given String, suitable for
inclusion in an ObjectName. The returned value can be used as
the value associated with a key in an ObjectName. The String

s

may contain any character. Appropriate quoting
ensures that the returned value is legal in an ObjectName.

The returned value consists of a quote ('"'), a sequence of
characters corresponding to the characters of

s

,
and another quote. Characters in

s

appear
unchanged within the returned value except:

- A quote ('"') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by a quote.
- An asterisk ('*') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by an
asterisk.
- A question mark ('?') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by
a question mark.
- A backslash ('\') is replaced by two backslashes.
- A newline character (the character '\n' in Java) is replaced
by a backslash followed by the character '\n'.

**Parameters:** s

- the String to be quoted.
**Returns:** the quoted String.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

s

is null.

- unquote

```java
public static
String
unquote​(
String
q)
```

Returns an unquoted form of the given String. If

q

is a String returned by

quote(s)

,
then

unquote(q).equals(s)

. If there is no String

s

for which

quote(s).equals(q)

, then
unquote(q) throws an IllegalArgumentException.

These rules imply that there is a one-to-one mapping between
quoted and unquoted forms.

**Parameters:** q

- the String to be unquoted.
**Returns:** the unquoted String.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

q

could not
have been returned by the

quote(java.lang.String)

method, for instance
if it does not begin and end with a quote (").
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

q

is null.

- apply

```java
public boolean apply​(
ObjectName
name)
```

Test whether this ObjectName, which may be a pattern,
matches another ObjectName. If

name

is a pattern,
the result is false. If this ObjectName is a pattern, the
result is true if and only if

name

matches the
pattern. If neither this ObjectName nor

name

is
a pattern, the result is true if and only if the two
ObjectNames are equal as described for the

equals(Object)

method.

**Specified by:** apply

in interface

QueryExp
**Parameters:** name

- The name of the MBean to compare to.
**Returns:** True if

name

matches this ObjectName.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is null.

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
ObjectName
name)
```

Compares two ObjectName instances. The ordering relation between
ObjectNames is not completely specified but is intended to be such
that a sorted list of ObjectNames will appear in an order that is
convenient for a person to read.

In particular, if the two ObjectName instances have different
domains then their order is the lexicographical order of the domains.
The ordering of the key property list remains unspecified.

For example, the ObjectName instances below:

- Shapes:type=Square,name=3
- Colors:type=Red,name=2
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=2
- Colors:type=Red,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=1
- Colors:type=Blue,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=2
- JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=scalene,name=1

could be ordered as follows:

- Colors:type=Blue,name=1
- Colors:type=Red,name=1
- Colors:type=Red,name=2
- JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate
- Shapes:type=Square,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=2
- Shapes:type=Square,name=3
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=scalene,name=1
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=2

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

will be of the same class.

The returned value may or may not be identical to

name

. Calling this method twice with the same
parameters may return the same object or two equal but not
identical objects.

Since ObjectName is immutable, it is not usually useful to
make a copy of an ObjectName. The principal use of this method
is to guard against a malicious caller who might pass an
instance of a subclass with surprising behavior to sensitive
code. Such code can call this method to obtain an ObjectName
that is known not to have surprising behavior.

**Parameters:** name

- an instance of the ObjectName class or of a subclass
**Returns:** an instance of ObjectName or a subclass that is known to
have the same semantics. If

name

respects the
semantics of ObjectName, then the returned object is equal
(though not necessarily identical) to

name

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- The

name

is null.

- isPattern

```java
public boolean isPattern()
```

Checks whether the object name is a pattern.

An object name is a pattern if its domain contains a
wildcard or if the object name is a property pattern.

**Returns:** True if the name is a pattern, otherwise false.

```java
public boolean isDomainPattern()
```

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the domain part.

**Returns:** True if the name is a domain pattern, otherwise false.

- isPropertyPattern

```java
public boolean isPropertyPattern()
```

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the key properties.

An object name is a pattern on the key properties if it is a
pattern on the key property list (e.g. "d:k=v,*") or on the
property values (e.g. "d:k=*") or on both (e.g. "d:k=*,*").

**Returns:** True if the name is a property pattern, otherwise false.

- isPropertyListPattern

```java
public boolean isPropertyListPattern()
```

Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the key property list.

For example, "d:k=v,*" and "d:k=*,*" are key property list patterns
whereas "d:k=*" is not.

**Returns:** True if the name is a property list pattern, otherwise false.
**Since:** 1.6

- isPropertyValuePattern

```java
public boolean isPropertyValuePattern()
```

representation where the properties are sorted in lexical
order.

More precisely, the canonical form of the name is a String
consisting of the

domain part

, a colon
(

:

), the

canonical key property list

, and
a

pattern indication

.

The

canonical key property list

is the same string
as described for

getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString()

.

The

pattern indication

is:

- empty for an ObjectName
that is not a property list pattern;

an asterisk for an ObjectName
that is a property list pattern with no keys; or

a comma and an
asterisk (

,*

) for an ObjectName that is a property

- getKeyPropertyListString

```java
public
String
getKeyPropertyListString()
```

Returns a string representation of the list of key
properties specified at creation time. If this ObjectName was
constructed with the constructor

ObjectName(String)

,
the key properties in the returned String will be in the same
order as in the argument to the constructor.

**Returns:** The key property list string. This string is
independent of whether the ObjectName is a pattern.

- getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString

```java
public
String
getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString()
```

Returns a string representation of the list of key properties,
in which the key properties are sorted in lexical order. This
is used in lexicographic comparisons performed in order to
select MBeans based on their key property list. Lexical order
is the order implied by

String.compareTo(String)

.

**Returns:** The canonical key property list string. This string is
independent of whether the ObjectName is a pattern.

- toString

```java
public

**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- quote

```java
public static
String
quote​(
String
s)
```

Returns a quoted form of the given String, suitable for
inclusion in an ObjectName. The returned value can be used as
the value associated with a key in an ObjectName. The String

s

may contain any character. Appropriate quoting
ensures that the returned value is legal in an ObjectName.

The returned value consists of a quote ('"'), a sequence of
characters corresponding to the characters of

s

,
and another quote. Characters in

s

appear
unchanged within the returned value except:

- A quote ('"') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by a quote.
- An asterisk ('*') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by an
asterisk.
- A question mark ('?') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by
a question mark.
- A backslash ('\') is replaced by two backslashes.
- A newline character (the character '\n' in Java) is replaced
by a backslash followed by the character '\n'.

**Parameters:** s

- the String to be quoted.
**Returns:** the quoted String.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

s

is null.

- unquote

```java
public static
String
unquote​(
String
q)
```

Returns an unquoted form of the given String. If

q

is a String returned by

quote(s)

,
then

unquote(q).equals(s)

. If there is no String

s

for which

quote(s).equals(q)

, then
unquote(q) throws an IllegalArgumentException.

These rules imply that there is a one-to-one mapping between
quoted and unquoted forms.

**Parameters:** q

- the String to be unquoted.
**Returns:** the unquoted String.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

q

could not
have been returned by the

quote(java.lang.String)

method, for instance
if it does not begin and end with a quote (").
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

q

is null.

- apply

```java
public boolean apply​(
ObjectName
name)
```

Test whether this ObjectName, which may be a pattern,
matches another ObjectName. If

name

is a pattern,
the result is false. If this ObjectName is a pattern, the
result is true if and only if

name

matches the
pattern. If neither this ObjectName nor

name

is
a pattern, the result is true if and only if the two
ObjectNames are equal as described for the

equals(Object)

method.

**Specified by:** apply

in interface

QueryExp
**Parameters:** name

- The name of the MBean to compare to.
**Returns:** True if

name

matches this ObjectName.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

name

is null.

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
ObjectName
name)
```

Compares two ObjectName instances. The ordering relation between
ObjectNames is not completely specified but is intended to be such
that a sorted list of ObjectNames will appear in an order that is
convenient for a person to read.

In particular, if the two ObjectName instances have different
domains then their order is the lexicographical order of the domains.
The ordering of the key property list remains unspecified.

For example, the ObjectName instances below:

- Shapes:type=Square,name=3
- Colors:type=Red,name=2
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=2
- Colors:type=Red,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=1
- Colors:type=Blue,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=2
- JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=scalene,name=1

could be ordered as follows:

getCanonicalName()

.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** object

- The object name that the current object name is to be
compared with.
**Returns:** True if

object

is an ObjectName whose
canonical form is equal to that of this ObjectName.
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

#### equals

public boolean equals​(

Object

object)

Compares the current object name with another object name. Two
ObjectName instances are equal if and only if their canonical
forms are equal. The canonical form is the string described
for

getCanonicalName()

.

hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns a hash code for this object name.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** a hash code value for this object.
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### hashCode

public int hashCode()

Returns a hash code for this object name.

quote

```java
public static
String
quote​(
String
s)
```

Returns a quoted form of the given String, suitable for
inclusion in an ObjectName. The returned value can be used as
the value associated with a key in an ObjectName. The String

s

may contain any character. Appropriate quoting
ensures that the returned value is legal in an ObjectName.

The returned value consists of a quote ('"'), a sequence of
characters corresponding to the characters of

s

,
and another quote. Characters in

s

appear
unchanged within the returned value except:

- A quote ('"') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by a quote.
- An asterisk ('*') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by an
asterisk.
- A question mark ('?') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by
a question mark.
- A backslash ('\') is replaced by two backslashes.
- A newline character (the character '\n' in Java) is replaced
by a backslash followed by the character '\n'.

**Parameters:** s

- the String to be quoted.
**Returns:** the quoted String.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

s

is null.

unquote

```java
public static
String
unquote​(
String
q)
```

Returns an unquoted form of the given String. If

q

is a String returned by

quote(s)

,
then

unquote(q).equals(s)

. If there is no String

s

for which

quote(s).equals(q)

, then
unquote(q) throws an IllegalArgumentException.

These rules imply that there is a one-to-one mapping between
quoted and unquoted forms.

**Parameters:** q

- the String to be unquoted.
**Returns:** the unquoted String.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

q

could not
have been returned by the

quote(java.lang.String)

method, for instance
if it does not begin and end with a quote (").
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

q

is null.

apply

```java
public boolean apply​(
ObjectName
name)
```

Test whether this ObjectName, which may be a pattern,
matches another ObjectName. If

name

is a pattern,
the result is false. If this ObjectName is a pattern, the
result is true if and only if

name

matches the
pattern. If neither this ObjectName nor

name

is
a pattern, the result is true if and only if the two
ObjectNames are equal as described for the

equals(Object)

method.

**Specified by:** apply

in interface

compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
ObjectName
name)
```

Compares two ObjectName instances. The ordering relation between
ObjectNames is not completely specified but is intended to be such
that a sorted list of ObjectNames will appear in an order that is
convenient for a person to read.

In particular, if the two ObjectName instances have different
domains then their order is the lexicographical order of the domains.
The ordering of the key property list remains unspecified.

For example, the ObjectName instances below:

- Shapes:type=Square,name=3
- Colors:type=Red,name=2
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=2
- Colors:type=Red,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=1
- Colors:type=Blue,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=2
- JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=scalene,name=1

could be ordered as follows:

- Colors:type=Blue,name=1
- Colors:type=Red,name=1
- Colors:type=Red,name=2
- JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate
- Shapes:type=Square,name=1
- Shapes:type=Square,name=2
- Shapes:type=Square,name=3
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=scalene,name=1
- Shapes:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=2

**Specified by:** compareTo
