# Class JulianFields

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\temporal\JulianFields.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
JulianFields

extends
Object
```

A set of date fields that provide access to Julian Days.

The Julian Day is a standard way of expressing date and time commonly used in the scientific community.
It is expressed as a decimal number of whole days where days start at midday.
This class represents variations on Julian Days that count whole days from midnight.

The fields are implemented relative to

EPOCH_DAY

.
The fields are supported, and can be queried and set if

EPOCH_DAY

is available.
The fields work with all chronologies.

**Implementation Requirements:** This is an immutable and thread-safe class.
**Since:** 1.8

### Field Details

#### public static final
TemporalField
JULIAN_DAY

Julian Day field.

This is an integer-based version of the Julian Day Number.
Julian Day is a well-known system that represents the count of whole days since day 0,
which is defined to be January 1, 4713 BCE in the Julian calendar, and -4713-11-24 Gregorian.
The field has "JulianDay" as 'name', and 'DAYS' as 'baseUnit'.
The field always refers to the local date-time, ignoring the offset or zone.

For date-times, 'JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' assumes the same value from
midnight until just before the next midnight.
When 'JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' is applied to a date-time, the time of day portion remains unaltered.
'JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' and 'JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' only apply to

Temporal

objects that
can be converted into

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

.
An

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

is thrown for any other type of object.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a Julian Day field.
In

strict mode

and

smart mode

the Julian Day value is validated against the range of valid values.
In

lenient mode

no validation occurs.

Astronomical and Scientific Notes

The standard astronomical definition uses a fraction to indicate the time-of-day,
where each day is counted from midday to midday. For example,
a fraction of 0 represents midday, a fraction of 0.25
represents 18:00, a fraction of 0.5 represents midnight and a fraction
of 0.75 represents 06:00.

By contrast, this implementation has no fractional part, and counts
days from midnight to midnight.
This implementation uses an integer and days starting at midnight.
The integer value for the Julian Day Number is the astronomical Julian Day value at midday
of the date in question.
This amounts to the astronomical Julian Day, rounded to an integer

JDN = floor(JD + 0.5)

.

```java
| ISO date | Julian Day Number | Astronomical Julian Day |
| 1970-01-01T00:00 | 2,440,588 | 2,440,587.5 |
| 1970-01-01T06:00 | 2,440,588 | 2,440,587.75 |
| 1970-01-01T12:00 | 2,440,588 | 2,440,588.0 |
| 1970-01-01T18:00 | 2,440,588 | 2,440,588.25 |
| 1970-01-02T00:00 | 2,440,589 | 2,440,588.5 |
| 1970-01-02T06:00 | 2,440,589 | 2,440,588.75 |
| 1970-01-02T12:00 | 2,440,589 | 2,440,589.0 |
```

Julian Days are sometimes taken to imply Universal Time or UTC, but this
implementation always uses the Julian Day number for the local date,
regardless of the offset or time-zone.

---

#### public static final
TemporalField
MODIFIED_JULIAN_DAY

Modified Julian Day field.

This is an integer-based version of the Modified Julian Day Number.
Modified Julian Day (MJD) is a well-known system that counts days continuously.
It is defined relative to astronomical Julian Day as

MJD = JD - 2400000.5

.
Each Modified Julian Day runs from midnight to midnight.
The field always refers to the local date-time, ignoring the offset or zone.

For date-times, 'MODIFIED_JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' assumes the same value from
midnight until just before the next midnight.
When 'MODIFIED_JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' is applied to a date-time, the time of day portion remains unaltered.
'MODIFIED_JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' and 'MODIFIED_JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' only apply to

Temporal

objects
that can be converted into

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

.
An

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

is thrown for any other type of object.

This implementation is an integer version of MJD with the decimal part rounded to floor.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a Modified Julian Day field.
In

strict mode

and

smart mode

the Modified Julian Day value is validated against the range of valid values.
In

lenient mode

no validation occurs.

Astronomical and Scientific Notes

```java
| ISO date | Modified Julian Day | Decimal MJD |
| 1970-01-01T00:00 | 40,587 | 40,587.0 |
| 1970-01-01T06:00 | 40,587 | 40,587.25 |
| 1970-01-01T12:00 | 40,587 | 40,587.5 |

RATA_DIE

Rata Die field.

Rata Die counts whole days continuously starting day 1 at midnight at the beginning of 0001-01-01 (ISO).
The field always refers to the local date-time, ignoring the offset or zone.

For date-times, 'RATA_DIE.getFrom()' assumes the same value from
midnight until just before the next midnight.
When 'RATA_DIE.adjustInto()' is applied to a date-time, the time of day portion remains unaltered.
'RATA_DIE.adjustInto()' and 'RATA_DIE.getFrom()' only apply to

By contrast, this implementation has no fractional part, and counts
days from midnight to midnight.
This implementation uses an integer and days starting at midnight.

of the date in question.
This amounts to the astronomical Julian Day, rounded to an integer

Julian Days are sometimes taken to imply Universal Time or UTC, but this
implementation always uses the Julian Day number for the local date,
regardless of the offset or time-zone.

This is an integer-based version of the Julian Day Number.
Julian Day is a well-known system that represents the count of whole days since day 0,
which is defined to be January 1, 4713 BCE in the Julian calendar, and -4713-11-24 Gregorian.
The field has "JulianDay" as 'name', and 'DAYS' as 'baseUnit'.
The field always refers to the local date-time, ignoring the offset or zone.

For date-times, 'JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' assumes the same value from
midnight until just before the next midnight.
When 'JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' is applied to a date-time, the time of day portion remains unaltered.
'JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' and 'JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' only apply to

Temporal

objects that
can be converted into

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

.
An

is thrown for any other type of object.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a Julian Day field.
In

and

smart mode

the Julian Day value is validated against the range of valid values.

Astronomical and Scientific Notes

The standard astronomical definition uses a fraction to indicate the time-of-day,
where each day is counted from midday to midday. For example,
a fraction of 0 represents midday, a fraction of 0.25
represents 18:00, a fraction of 0.5 represents midnight and a fraction
of 0.75 represents 06:00.

By contrast, this implementation has no fractional part, and counts
