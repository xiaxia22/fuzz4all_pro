# Class Phaser

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\concurrent\Phaser.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Phaser

extends
Object
```

A reusable synchronization barrier, similar in functionality to

CyclicBarrier

and

CountDownLatch

but supporting
more flexible usage.

Registration.

Unlike the case for other barriers, the
number of parties

registered

to synchronize on a phaser
may vary over time. Tasks may be registered at any time (using
methods

register()

,

bulkRegister(int)

, or forms of
constructors establishing initial numbers of parties), and
optionally deregistered upon any arrival (using

arriveAndDeregister()

). As is the case with most basic
synchronization constructs, registration and deregistration affect
only internal counts; they do not establish any further internal
bookkeeping, so tasks cannot query whether they are registered.
(However, you can introduce such bookkeeping by subclassing this
class.)

Synchronization.

Like a

CyclicBarrier

, a

Phaser

may be repeatedly awaited. Method

arriveAndAwaitAdvance()

has effect analogous to

CyclicBarrier.await

. Each
generation of a phaser has an associated phase number. The phase
number starts at zero, and advances when all parties arrive at the
phaser, wrapping around to zero after reaching

Integer.MAX_VALUE

. The use of phase numbers enables independent
control of actions upon arrival at a phaser and upon awaiting
others, via two kinds of methods that may be invoked by any
registered party:

- Arrival.

Methods

arrive()

and

arriveAndDeregister()

record arrival. These methods
do not block, but return an associated

arrival phase
number

; that is, the phase number of the phaser to which
the arrival applied. When the final party for a given phase
arrives, an optional action is performed and the phase
advances. These actions are performed by the party
triggering a phase advance, and are arranged by overriding
method

onAdvance(int, int)

, which also controls
termination. Overriding this method is similar to, but more
flexible than, providing a barrier action to a

CyclicBarrier

.

Waiting.

Method

awaitAdvance(int)

requires an
argument indicating an arrival phase number, and returns when
the phaser advances to (or is already at) a different phase.
Unlike similar constructions using

CyclicBarrier

,
method

awaitAdvance

continues to wait even if the
waiting thread is interrupted. Interruptible and timeout
versions are also available, but exceptions encountered while
tasks wait interruptibly or with timeout do not change the
state of the phaser. If necessary, you can perform any
associated recovery within handlers of those exceptions,
often after invoking

forceTermination

. Phasers may
also be used by tasks executing in a

ForkJoinPool

.
Progress is ensured if the pool's parallelismLevel can
accommodate the maximum number of simultaneously blocked
parties.

Termination.

A phaser may enter a

termination

state, that may be checked using method

isTerminated()

. Upon
termination, all synchronization methods immediately return without
waiting for advance, as indicated by a negative return value.
Similarly, attempts to register upon termination have no effect.
Termination is triggered when an invocation of

onAdvance

returns

true

. The default implementation returns

true

if a deregistration has caused the number of registered
parties to become zero. As illustrated below, when phasers control
actions with a fixed number of iterations, it is often convenient
to override this method to cause termination when the current phase
number reaches a threshold. Method

forceTermination()

is
also available to abruptly release waiting threads and allow them
to terminate.

Tiering.

Phasers may be

tiered

(i.e.,
constructed in tree structures) to reduce contention. Phasers with
large numbers of parties that would otherwise experience heavy
synchronization contention costs may instead be set up so that
groups of sub-phasers share a common parent. This may greatly
increase throughput even though it incurs greater per-operation
overhead.

In a tree of tiered phasers, registration and deregistration of
child phasers with their parent are managed automatically.
Whenever the number of registered parties of a child phaser becomes
non-zero (as established in the

Phaser(Phaser,int)

constructor,

register()

, or

bulkRegister(int)

), the
child phaser is registered with its parent. Whenever the number of
registered parties becomes zero as the result of an invocation of

arriveAndDeregister()

, the child phaser is deregistered
from its parent.

Monitoring.

While synchronization methods may be invoked
only by registered parties, the current state of a phaser may be
monitored by any caller. At any given moment there are

getRegisteredParties()

parties in total, of which

getArrivedParties()

have arrived at the current phase (

getPhase()

). When the remaining (

getUnarrivedParties()

)
parties arrive, the phase advances. The values returned by these
methods may reflect transient states and so are not in general
useful for synchronization control. Method

toString()

returns snapshots of these state queries in a form convenient for
informal monitoring.

Sample usages:

A

Phaser

may be used instead of a

CountDownLatch

to control a one-shot action serving a variable number of parties.
The typical idiom is for the method setting this up to first
register, then start all the actions, then deregister, as in:

```java
void runTasks(List<Runnable> tasks) {
Phaser startingGate = new Phaser(1); // "1" to register self
// create and start threads
for (Runnable task : tasks) {
startingGate.register();
new Thread(() -> {
startingGate.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
task.run();
}).start();
}

// deregister self to allow threads to proceed
startingGate.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

One way to cause a set of threads to repeatedly perform actions
for a given number of iterations is to override

onAdvance

:

```java
void startTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, int iterations) {
Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
return phase >= iterations - 1 || registeredParties == 0;
}
};
phaser.register();
for (Runnable task : tasks) {
phaser.register();
new Thread(() -> {
do {
task.run();
phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
} while (!phaser.isTerminated());
}).start();
}
// allow threads to proceed; don't wait for them
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

If the main task must later await termination, it
may re-register and then execute a similar loop:

```java
// ...
phaser.register();
while (!phaser.isTerminated())
phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
```

Related constructions may be used to await particular phase numbers
in contexts where you are sure that the phase will never wrap around

Integer.MAX_VALUE

. For example:

```java
void awaitPhase(Phaser phaser, int phase) {
int p = phaser.register(); // assumes caller not already registered
while (p < phase) {
if (phaser.isTerminated())
// ... deal with unexpected termination
else
p = phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
}
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

To create a set of

n

tasks using a tree of phasers, you
could use code of the following form, assuming a Task class with a
constructor accepting a

Phaser

that it registers with upon
construction. After invocation of

build(new Task[n], 0, n,
new Phaser())

, these tasks could then be started, for example by
submitting to a pool:

```java
void build(Task[] tasks, int lo, int hi, Phaser ph) {
if (hi - lo > TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
for (int i = lo; i < hi; i += TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
int j = Math.min(i + TASKS_PER_PHASER, hi);
build(tasks, i, j, new Phaser(ph));
}
} else {
for (int i = lo; i < hi; ++i)
tasks[i] = new Task(ph);
// assumes new Task(ph) performs ph.register()
}
}
```

The best value of

TASKS_PER_PHASER

depends mainly on
expected synchronization rates. A value as low as four may
be appropriate for extremely small per-phase task bodies (thus
high rates), or up to hundreds for extremely large ones.

Implementation notes

: This implementation restricts the
maximum number of parties to 65535. Attempts to register additional
parties result in

IllegalStateException

. However, you can and
should create tiered phasers to accommodate arbitrarily large sets
of participants.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public Phaser()

Creates a new phaser with no initially registered parties, no
parent, and initial phase number 0. Any thread using this
phaser will need to first register for it.

---

#### public Phaser​(int parties)

Creates a new phaser with the given number of registered
unarrived parties, no parent, and initial phase number 0.

**Parameters:**
- parties

- the number of parties required to advance to the
next phase

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if parties less than zero
or greater than the maximum number of parties supported

---

#### public Phaser​(
Phaser
parent)

Equivalent to

Phaser(parent, 0)

.

**Parameters:**
- parent

- the parent phaser

---

#### public Phaser​(
Phaser
parent,
int parties)

Creates a new phaser with the given parent and number of
registered unarrived parties. When the given parent is non-null
and the given number of parties is greater than zero, this
child phaser is registered with its parent.

**Parameters:**
- parent

- the parent phaser
- parties

- the number of parties required to advance to the
next phase

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if parties less than zero
or greater than the maximum number of parties supported

---

### Method Details

#### public int register()

Adds a new unarrived party to this phaser. If an ongoing
invocation of

onAdvance(int, int)

is in progress, this method
may await its completion before returning. If this phaser has
a parent, and this phaser previously had no registered parties,
this child phaser is also registered with its parent. If
this phaser is terminated, the attempt to register has
no effect, and a negative value is returned.

**Returns:**
- the arrival phase number to which this registration
applied. If this value is negative, then this phaser has
terminated, in which case registration has no effect.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if attempting to register more
than the maximum supported number of parties

---

#### public int bulkRegister​(int parties)

Adds the given number of new unarrived parties to this phaser.
If an ongoing invocation of

onAdvance(int, int)

is in progress,
this method may await its completion before returning. If this
phaser has a parent, and the given number of parties is greater
than zero, and this phaser previously had no registered
parties, this child phaser is also registered with its parent.
If this phaser is terminated, the attempt to register has no
effect, and a negative value is returned.

**Parameters:**
- parties

- the number of additional parties required to
advance to the next phase

**Returns:**
- the arrival phase number to which this registration
applied. If this value is negative, then this phaser has
terminated, in which case registration has no effect.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if attempting to register more
than the maximum supported number of parties
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

parties < 0

---

#### public int arrive()

Arrives at this phaser, without waiting for others to arrive.

It is a usage error for an unregistered party to invoke this
method. However, this error may result in an

IllegalStateException

only upon some subsequent operation on
this phaser, if ever.

**Returns:**
- the arrival phase number, or a negative value if terminated

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if not terminated and the number
of unarrived parties would become negative

---

#### public int arriveAndDeregister()

Arrives at this phaser and deregisters from it without waiting
for others to arrive. Deregistration reduces the number of
parties required to advance in future phases. If this phaser
has a parent, and deregistration causes this phaser to have
zero parties, this phaser is also deregistered from its parent.

It is a usage error for an unregistered party to invoke this
method. However, this error may result in an

IllegalStateException

only upon some subsequent operation on
this phaser, if ever.

**Returns:**
- the arrival phase number, or a negative value if terminated

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if not terminated and the number
of registered or unarrived parties would become negative

---

#### public int arriveAndAwaitAdvance()

Arrives at this phaser and awaits others. Equivalent in effect
to

awaitAdvance(arrive())

. If you need to await with
interruption or timeout, you can arrange this with an analogous
construction using one of the other forms of the

awaitAdvance

method. If instead you need to deregister upon
arrival, use

awaitAdvance(arriveAndDeregister())

.

It is a usage error for an unregistered party to invoke this
method. However, this error may result in an

IllegalStateException

only upon some subsequent operation on
this phaser, if ever.

**Returns:**
- the arrival phase number, or the (negative)

current phase

if terminated

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if not terminated and the number
of unarrived parties would become negative

---

#### public int awaitAdvance​(int phase)

Awaits the phase of this phaser to advance from the given phase
value, returning immediately if the current phase is not equal
to the given phase value or this phaser is terminated.

**Parameters:**
- phase

- an arrival phase number, or negative value if
terminated; this argument is normally the value returned by a
previous call to

arrive

or

arriveAndDeregister

.

**Returns:**
- the next arrival phase number, or the argument if it is
negative, or the (negative)

current phase

if terminated

---

#### public int awaitAdvanceInterruptibly​(int phase)
throws
InterruptedException

Awaits the phase of this phaser to advance from the given phase
value, throwing

InterruptedException

if interrupted
while waiting, or returning immediately if the current phase is
not equal to the given phase value or this phaser is
terminated.

**Parameters:**
- phase

- an arrival phase number, or negative value if
terminated; this argument is normally the value returned by a
previous call to

arrive

or

arriveAndDeregister

.

**Returns:**
- the next arrival phase number, or the argument if it is
negative, or the (negative)

current phase

if terminated

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if thread interrupted while waiting

---

#### public int awaitAdvanceInterruptibly​(int phase,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException
,

TimeoutException

Awaits the phase of this phaser to advance from the given phase
value or the given timeout to elapse, throwing

InterruptedException

if interrupted while waiting, or
returning immediately if the current phase is not equal to the
given phase value or this phaser is terminated.

**Parameters:**
- phase

- an arrival phase number, or negative value if
terminated; this argument is normally the value returned by a
previous call to

arrive

or

arriveAndDeregister

.
- timeout

- how long to wait before giving up, in units of

unit
- unit

- a

TimeUnit

determining how to interpret the

timeout

parameter

**Returns:**
- the next arrival phase number, or the argument if it is
negative, or the (negative)

current phase

if terminated

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if thread interrupted while waiting
- TimeoutException

- if timed out while waiting

---

#### public void forceTermination()

Forces this phaser to enter termination state. Counts of
registered parties are unaffected. If this phaser is a member
of a tiered set of phasers, then all of the phasers in the set
are terminated. If this phaser is already terminated, this
method has no effect. This method may be useful for
coordinating recovery after one or more tasks encounter
unexpected exceptions.

---

#### public final int getPhase()

Returns the current phase number. The maximum phase number is

Integer.MAX_VALUE

, after which it restarts at
zero. Upon termination, the phase number is negative,
in which case the prevailing phase prior to termination
may be obtained via

getPhase() + Integer.MIN_VALUE

.

**Returns:**
- the phase number, or a negative value if terminated

---

#### public int getRegisteredParties()

Returns the number of parties registered at this phaser.

**Returns:**
- the number of parties

---

#### public int getArrivedParties()

Returns the number of registered parties that have arrived at
the current phase of this phaser. If this phaser has terminated,
the returned value is meaningless and arbitrary.

**Returns:**
- the number of arrived parties

---

#### public int getUnarrivedParties()

Returns the number of registered parties that have not yet
arrived at the current phase of this phaser. If this phaser has
terminated, the returned value is meaningless and arbitrary.

**Returns:**
- the number of unarrived parties

---

#### public
Phaser
getParent()

Returns the parent of this phaser, or

null

if none.

**Returns:**
- the parent of this phaser, or

null

if none

---

#### public
Phaser
getRoot()

Returns the root ancestor of this phaser, which is the same as
this phaser if it has no parent.

**Returns:**
- the root ancestor of this phaser

---

#### public boolean isTerminated()

Returns

true

if this phaser has been terminated.

**Returns:**
- true

if this phaser has been terminated

---

#### protected boolean onAdvance​(int phase,
int registeredParties)

Overridable method to perform an action upon impending phase
advance, and to control termination. This method is invoked
upon arrival of the party advancing this phaser (when all other
waiting parties are dormant). If this method returns

true

, this phaser will be set to a final termination state
upon advance, and subsequent calls to

isTerminated()

will return true. Any (unchecked) Exception or Error thrown by
an invocation of this method is propagated to the party
attempting to advance this phaser, in which case no advance
occurs.

The arguments to this method provide the state of the phaser
prevailing for the current transition. The effects of invoking
arrival, registration, and waiting methods on this phaser from
within

onAdvance

are unspecified and should not be
relied on.

If this phaser is a member of a tiered set of phasers, then

onAdvance

is invoked only for its root phaser on each
advance.

To support the most common use cases, the default
implementation of this method returns

true

when the
number of registered parties has become zero as the result of a
party invoking

arriveAndDeregister

. You can disable
this behavior, thus enabling continuation upon future
registrations, by overriding this method to always return

false

:

```java
Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int parties) { return false; }
}
```

**Parameters:**
- phase

- the current phase number on entry to this method,
before this phaser is advanced
- registeredParties

- the current number of registered parties

**Returns:**
- true

if this phaser should terminate

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string identifying this phaser, as well as its
state. The state, in brackets, includes the String

"phase = "

followed by the phase number,

"parties = "

followed by the number of registered parties, and

"arrived = "

followed by the number of arrived parties.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a string identifying this phaser, as well as its state

the phaser advances to (or is already at) a different phase.
Unlike similar constructions using

CyclicBarrier

,
method

awaitAdvance

continues to wait even if the
waiting thread is interrupted. Interruptible and timeout
versions are also available, but exceptions encountered while
tasks wait interruptibly or with timeout do not change the
state of the phaser. If necessary, you can perform any
associated recovery within handlers of those exceptions,
often after invoking

forceTermination

. Phasers may
also be used by tasks executing in a

ForkJoinPool

.
Progress is ensured if the pool's parallelismLevel can
accommodate the maximum number of simultaneously blocked
parties.

Termination.

A phaser may enter a

termination

state, that may be checked using method

isTerminated()

. Upon
termination, all synchronization methods immediately return without
waiting for advance, as indicated by a negative return value.
Similarly, attempts to register upon termination have no effect.
Termination is triggered when an invocation of

onAdvance

returns

true

. The default implementation returns

true

if a deregistration has caused the number of registered
parties to become zero. As illustrated below, when phasers control
actions with a fixed number of iterations, it is often convenient
to override this method to cause termination when the current phase
number reaches a threshold. Method

forceTermination()

is
also available to abruptly release waiting threads and allow them
to terminate.

large numbers of parties that would otherwise experience heavy
synchronization contention costs may instead be set up so that
groups of sub-phasers share a common parent. This may greatly

In a tree of tiered phasers, registration and deregistration of
child phasers with their parent are managed automatically.
Whenever the number of registered parties of a child phaser becomes
non-zero (as established in the

Phaser(Phaser,int)

bulkRegister(int)

), the
child phaser is registered with its parent. Whenever the number of
registered parties becomes zero as the result of an invocation of

arriveAndDeregister()

, the child phaser is deregistered
from its parent.

Monitoring.

While synchronization methods may be invoked
only by registered parties, the current state of a phaser may be
monitored by any caller. At any given moment there are

getRegisteredParties()

parties in total, of which

getArrivedParties()

have arrived at the current phase (

getPhase()

). When the remaining (

getUnarrivedParties()

)
parties arrive, the phase advances. The values returned by these
methods may reflect transient states and so are not in general
useful for synchronization control. Method

returns snapshots of these state queries in a form convenient for

startingGate.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
task.run();
}).start();
}

// deregister self to allow threads to proceed
startingGate.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

One way to cause a set of threads to repeatedly perform actions
for a given number of iterations is to override

onAdvance

:

```java
void startTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, int iterations) {
Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
return phase >= iterations - 1 || registeredParties == 0;
}
};
phaser.register();
for (Runnable task : tasks) {
phaser.register();
new Thread(() -> {
do {
task.run();
phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
} while (!phaser.isTerminated());
}).start();
}
// allow threads to proceed; don't wait for them
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

If the main task must later await termination, it
may re-register and then execute a similar loop:

```java
// ...
phaser.register();
while (!phaser.isTerminated())
phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
```

Related constructions may be used to await particular phase numbers
in contexts where you are sure that the phase will never wrap around

Integer.MAX_VALUE

. For example:

```java
void awaitPhase(Phaser phaser, int phase) {
int p = phaser.register(); // assumes caller not already registered
while (p < phase) {
if (phaser.isTerminated())
// ... deal with unexpected termination
else
p = phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
}
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

To create a set of

n

tasks using a tree of phasers, you
could use code of the following form, assuming a Task class with a
constructor accepting a

Phaser

that it registers with upon
construction. After invocation of

build(new Task[n], 0, n,
new Phaser())

, these tasks could then be started, for example by
submitting to a pool:

```java
void build(Task[] tasks, int lo, int hi, Phaser ph) {
if (hi - lo > TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
for (int i = lo; i < hi; i += TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
int j = Math.min(i + TASKS_PER_PHASER, hi);
build(tasks, i, j, new Phaser(ph));
}
} else {
for (int i = lo; i < hi; ++i)
tasks[i] = new Task(ph);
// assumes new Task(ph) performs ph.register()
}
}
```

tasks wait interruptibly or with timeout do not change the
state of the phaser. If necessary, you can perform any
associated recovery within handlers of those exceptions,
often after invoking

forceTermination

. Phasers may
also be used by tasks executing in a

ForkJoinPool

.
Progress is ensured if the pool's parallelismLevel can
accommodate the maximum number of simultaneously blocked
parties.

Termination.

A phaser may enter a

termination

state, that may be checked using method

isTerminated()

. Upon
termination, all synchronization methods immediately return without
waiting for advance, as indicated by a negative return value.
Similarly, attempts to register upon termination have no effect.
Termination is triggered when an invocation of

onAdvance

returns

true

. The default implementation returns

true

if a deregistration has caused the number of registered
parties to become zero. As illustrated below, when phasers control
actions with a fixed number of iterations, it is often convenient
to override this method to cause termination when the current phase
number reaches a threshold. Method

forceTermination()

is
also available to abruptly release waiting threads and allow them
to terminate.

Tiering.

Phasers may be

tiered

(i.e.,
constructed in tree structures) to reduce contention. Phasers with
large numbers of parties that would otherwise experience heavy
synchronization contention costs may instead be set up so that
groups of sub-phasers share a common parent. This may greatly
increase throughput even though it incurs greater per-operation
overhead.

In a tree of tiered phasers, registration and deregistration of
child phasers with their parent are managed automatically.
Whenever the number of registered parties of a child phaser becomes
non-zero (as established in the

Phaser(Phaser,int)

constructor,

register()

, or

bulkRegister(int)

), the
child phaser is registered with its parent. Whenever the number of
registered parties becomes zero as the result of an invocation of

arriveAndDeregister()

, the child phaser is deregistered
from its parent.

Monitoring.

While synchronization methods may be invoked
only by registered parties, the current state of a phaser may be
monitored by any caller. At any given moment there are

getRegisteredParties()

parties in total, of which

getArrivedParties()

have arrived at the current phase (

getPhase()

). When the remaining (

getUnarrivedParties()

)
parties arrive, the phase advances. The values returned by these
methods may reflect transient states and so are not in general
useful for synchronization control. Method

toString()

returns snapshots of these state queries in a form convenient for
informal monitoring.

Sample usages:

A

Phaser

may be used instead of a

CountDownLatch

to control a one-shot action serving a variable number of parties.
The typical idiom is for the method setting this up to first
register, then start all the actions, then deregister, as in:

```java
void runTasks(List<Runnable> tasks) {
Phaser startingGate = new Phaser(1); // "1" to register self
// create and start threads
for (Runnable task : tasks) {
startingGate.register();
new Thread(() -> {
startingGate.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
task.run();
}).start();
}

// deregister self to allow threads to proceed
startingGate.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

One way to cause a set of threads to repeatedly perform actions
for a given number of iterations is to override

onAdvance

:

```java
void startTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, int iterations) {
Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
return phase >= iterations - 1 || registeredParties == 0;
}
};
phaser.register();
for (Runnable task : tasks) {
phaser.register();
new Thread(() -> {
do {
task.run();
phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
} while (!phaser.isTerminated());
}).start();
}
// allow threads to proceed; don't wait for them
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

If the main task must later await termination, it
may re-register and then execute a similar loop:

```java
// ...
phaser.register();
while (!phaser.isTerminated())
phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
```

Related constructions may be used to await particular phase numbers
in contexts where you are sure that the phase will never wrap around

Integer.MAX_VALUE

. For example:

```java
void awaitPhase(Phaser phaser, int phase) {
int p = phaser.register(); // assumes caller not already registered
while (p < phase) {
if (phaser.isTerminated())
// ... deal with unexpected termination
else
p = phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
}
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

To create a set of

n

tasks using a tree of phasers, you
could use code of the following form, assuming a Task class with a
constructor accepting a

Phaser

that it registers with upon
construction. After invocation of

build(new Task[n], 0, n,
new Phaser())

, these tasks could then be started, for example by
submitting to a pool:

```java
void build(Task[] tasks, int lo, int hi, Phaser ph) {
if (hi - lo > TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
for (int i = lo; i < hi; i += TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
int j = Math.min(i + TASKS_PER_PHASER, hi);
build(tasks, i, j, new Phaser(ph));
}
} else {
for (int i = lo; i < hi; ++i)
tasks[i] = new Task(ph);
// assumes new Task(ph) performs ph.register()
}
}
```

The best value of

TASKS_PER_PHASER

depends mainly on
expected synchronization rates. A value as low as four may
be appropriate for extremely small per-phase task bodies (thus
high rates), or up to hundreds for extremely large ones.

Implementation notes

: This implementation restricts the
maximum number of parties to 65535. Attempts to register additional
parties result in

IllegalStateException

. However, you can and
should create tiered phasers to accommodate arbitrarily large sets
of participants.

Registration.

Unlike the case for other barriers, the
number of parties

registered

to synchronize on a phaser
may vary over time. Tasks may be registered at any time (using
methods

register()

,

bulkRegister(int)

, or forms of
constructors establishing initial numbers of parties), and
optionally deregistered upon any arrival (using

arriveAndDeregister()

). As is the case with most basic
synchronization constructs, registration and deregistration affect
only internal counts; they do not establish any further internal
bookkeeping, so tasks cannot query whether they are registered.
(However, you can introduce such bookkeeping by subclassing this
class.)

Synchronization.

Like a

CyclicBarrier

, a

Phaser

may be repeatedly awaited. Method

arriveAndAwaitAdvance()

has effect analogous to

CyclicBarrier.await

. Each
generation of a phaser has an associated phase number. The phase
number starts at zero, and advances when all parties arrive at the
phaser, wrapping around to zero after reaching

Integer.MAX_VALUE

. The use of phase numbers enables independent
control of actions upon arrival at a phaser and upon awaiting
others, via two kinds of methods that may be invoked by any
registered party:

- Arrival.

Methods

arrive()

and

arriveAndDeregister()

record arrival. These methods
do not block, but return an associated

arrival phase
number

; that is, the phase number of the phaser to which
the arrival applied. When the final party for a given phase
arrives, an optional action is performed and the phase
advances. These actions are performed by the party
triggering a phase advance, and are arranged by overriding
method

onAdvance(int, int)

, which also controls
termination. Overriding this method is similar to, but more
flexible than, providing a barrier action to a

CyclicBarrier

.

Waiting.

Method

awaitAdvance(int)

requires an
argument indicating an arrival phase number, and returns when
the phaser advances to (or is already at) a different phase.
Unlike similar constructions using

CyclicBarrier

,
method

awaitAdvance

continues to wait even if the
waiting thread is interrupted. Interruptible and timeout
versions are also available, but exceptions encountered while
tasks wait interruptibly or with timeout do not change the
state of the phaser. If necessary, you can perform any
associated recovery within handlers of those exceptions,
often after invoking

forceTermination

. Phasers may
also be used by tasks executing in a

ForkJoinPool

.
Progress is ensured if the pool's parallelismLevel can
accommodate the maximum number of simultaneously blocked
parties.

Termination.

A phaser may enter a

termination

state, that may be checked using method

isTerminated()

. Upon
termination, all synchronization methods immediately return without
waiting for advance, as indicated by a negative return value.
Similarly, attempts to register upon termination have no effect.
Termination is triggered when an invocation of

onAdvance

returns

true

. The default implementation returns

true

if a deregistration has caused the number of registered
parties to become zero. As illustrated below, when phasers control
actions with a fixed number of iterations, it is often convenient
to override this method to cause termination when the current phase
number reaches a threshold. Method

forceTermination()

is
also available to abruptly release waiting threads and allow them
to terminate.

Phasers may be

tiered

constructed in tree structures) to reduce contention. Phasers with
large numbers of parties that would otherwise experience heavy
synchronization contention costs may instead be set up so that
groups of sub-phasers share a common parent. This may greatly
increase throughput even though it incurs greater per-operation
overhead.

In a tree of tiered phasers, registration and deregistration of
child phasers with their parent are managed automatically.
Whenever the number of registered parties of a child phaser becomes
non-zero (as established in the

Phaser(Phaser,int)

constructor,

register()

, or

bulkRegister(int)

), the
child phaser is registered with its parent. Whenever the number of
registered parties becomes zero as the result of an invocation of

arriveAndDeregister()

, the child phaser is deregistered
from its parent.

Monitoring.

While synchronization methods may be invoked
only by registered parties, the current state of a phaser may be
monitored by any caller. At any given moment there are

getRegisteredParties()

parties in total, of which

getArrivedParties()

have arrived at the current phase (

getPhase()

). When the remaining (

getUnarrivedParties()

)
parties arrive, the phase advances. The values returned by these
methods may reflect transient states and so are not in general
useful for synchronization control. Method

returns snapshots of these state queries in a form convenient for

startingGate.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
task.run();
}).start();
}

// deregister self to allow threads to proceed
startingGate.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

One way to cause a set of threads to repeatedly perform actions
for a given number of iterations is to override

onAdvance

:

```java
void startTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, int iterations) {
Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
return phase >= iterations - 1 || registeredParties == 0;
}
};
phaser.register();
for (Runnable task : tasks) {
phaser.register();
new Thread(() -> {
do {
task.run();
phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
} while (!phaser.isTerminated());
}).start();
}
// allow threads to proceed; don't wait for them
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

may re-register and then execute a similar loop:

while (p < phase) {
if (phaser.isTerminated())
// ... deal with unexpected termination
else
p = phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
}
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

int j = Math.min(i + TASKS_PER_PHASER, hi);
build(tasks, i, j, new Phaser(ph));
}
} else {
for (int i = lo; i < hi; ++i)
tasks[i] = new Task(ph);
// assumes new Task(ph) performs ph.register()

register, then start all the actions, then deregister, as in:

```java
void runTasks(List<Runnable> tasks) {
Phaser startingGate = new Phaser(1); // "1" to register self
// create and start threads
for (Runnable task : tasks) {
startingGate.register();
new Thread(() -> {
startingGate.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
task.run();
}).start();
}

// deregister self to allow threads to proceed
startingGate.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

One way to cause a set of threads to repeatedly perform actions
for a given number of iterations is to override

onAdvance

:

```java
void startTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, int iterations) {
Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
return phase >= iterations - 1 || registeredParties == 0;
}
};
phaser.register();
for (Runnable task : tasks) {
phaser.register();
new Thread(() -> {
do {
task.run();
phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
} while (!phaser.isTerminated());
}).start();
}
// allow threads to proceed; don't wait for them
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

If the main task must later await termination, it
may re-register and then execute a similar loop:

```java
// ...
phaser.register();
while (!phaser.isTerminated())
phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
```

Related constructions may be used to await particular phase numbers
in contexts where you are sure that the phase will never wrap around

Integer.MAX_VALUE

. For example:

```java
void awaitPhase(Phaser phaser, int phase) {
int p = phaser.register(); // assumes caller not already registered
while (p < phase) {
if (phaser.isTerminated())
// ... deal with unexpected termination
else
p = phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
}
phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

To create a set of

n

tasks using a tree of phasers, you
could use code of the following form, assuming a Task class with a
constructor accepting a

Phaser

that it registers with upon
construction. After invocation of

build(new Task[n], 0, n,
new Phaser())

, these tasks could then be started, for example by
submitting to a pool:

```java
void build(Task[] tasks, int lo, int hi, Phaser ph) {
if (hi - lo > TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
for (int i = lo; i < hi; i += TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
int j = Math.min(i + TASKS_PER_PHASER, hi);
build(tasks, i, j, new Phaser(ph));
}
} else {
for (int i = lo; i < hi; ++i)
tasks[i] = new Task(ph);
// assumes new Task(ph) performs ph.register()
}
}
```

The best value of

TASKS_PER_PHASER

depends mainly on
expected synchronization rates. A value as low as four may
be appropriate for extremely small per-phase task bodies (thus
high rates), or up to hundreds for extremely large ones.

Implementation notes

: This implementation restricts the
maximum number of parties to 65535. Attempts to register additional
parties result in

IllegalStateException

. However, you can and
should create tiered phasers to accommodate arbitrarily large sets
of participants.

In a tree of tiered phasers, registration and deregistration of
child phasers with their parent are managed automatically.
Whenever the number of registered parties of a child phaser becomes
non-zero (as established in the

Phaser(Phaser,int)

constructor,

register()

, or

bulkRegister(int)

), the
child phaser is registered with its parent. Whenever the number of
registered parties becomes zero as the result of an invocation of

arriveAndDeregister()

, the child phaser is deregistered
from its parent.

Monitoring.

While synchronization methods may be invoked
only by registered parties, the current state of a phaser may be
monitored by any caller. At any given moment there are

getRegisteredParties()

parties in total, of which

getArrivedParties()

have arrived at the current phase (

getPhase()

). When the remaining (

getUnarrivedParties()

)
parties arrive, the phase advances. The values returned by these
methods may reflect transient states and so are not in general
useful for synchronization control. Method

toString()

returns snapshots of these state queries in a form convenient for
informal monitoring.

Sample usages:

A

Phaser

may be used instead of a

CountDownLatch

to control a one-shot action serving a variable number of parties.
The typical idiom is for the method setting this up to first
register, then start all the actions, then deregister, as in:

```java
void runTasks(List<Runnable> tasks) {
Phaser startingGate = new Phaser(1); // "1" to register self
// create and start threads
for (Runnable task : tasks) {
startingGate.register();
new Thread(() -> {
startingGate.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
task.run();
}).start();
}

// deregister self to allow threads to proceed
startingGate.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

}
};
phaser.register();
for (Runnable task : tasks) {
phaser.register();
new Thread(() -> {
do {
task.run();
phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();

- if parties less than zero
or greater than the maximum number of parties supported

- Phaser

```java
public Phaser​(
Phaser
parent)
```

Equivalent to

Phaser(parent, 0)

.

**Parameters:** parent

- the parent phaser

- Phaser

```java
public Phaser​(
Phaser
parent,
int parties)
```

Creates a new phaser with the given parent and number of
registered unarrived parties. When the given parent is non-null
and the given number of parties is greater than zero, this
child phaser is registered with its parent.

**Parameters:** parent

- the parent phaser
**Parameters:** parties

- the number of parties required to advance to the
next phase
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if parties less than zero
or greater than the maximum number of parties supported

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- register

```java
public int register()
```

Adds a new unarrived party to this phaser. If an ongoing
invocation of

onAdvance(int, int)

is in progress, this method
may await its completion before returning. If this phaser has
a parent, and this phaser previously had no registered parties,
this child phaser is also registered with its parent. If
this phaser is terminated, the attempt to register has
no effect, and a negative value is returned.

**Returns:** the arrival phase number to which this registration
applied. If this value is negative, then this phaser has
terminated, in which case registration has no effect.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if attempting to register more
than the maximum supported number of parties

- bulkRegister

```java
public int bulkRegister​(int parties)
```

Adds the given number of new unarrived parties to this phaser.
If an ongoing invocation of

onAdvance(int, int)

is in progress,
this method may await its completion before returning. If this
phaser has a parent, and the given number of parties is greater
than zero, and this phaser previously had no registered
parties, this child phaser is also registered with its parent.
If this phaser is terminated, the attempt to register has no
effect, and a negative value is returned.

**Parameters:** parties

- the number of additional parties required to
advance to the next phase
**Returns:** the arrival phase number to which this registration
applied. If this value is negative, then this phaser has
terminated, in which case registration has no effect.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if attempting to register more
than the maximum supported number of parties
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

parties < 0

- arrive

```java
public int arrive()
```

Arrives at this phaser, without waiting for others to arrive.

It is a usage error for an unregistered party to invoke this
method. However, this error may result in an

IllegalStateException

only upon some subsequent operation on
this phaser, if ever.

**Returns:** the arrival phase number, or a negative value if terminated
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if not terminated and the number
of unarrived parties would become negative

- arriveAndDeregister

```java
public int arriveAndDeregister()
```

Arrives at this phaser and deregisters from it without waiting
for others to arrive. Deregistration reduces the number of
parties required to advance in future phases. If this phaser
has a parent, and deregistration causes this phaser to have
zero parties, this phaser is also deregistered from its parent.

It is a usage error for an unregistered party to invoke this
method. However, this error may result in an

IllegalStateException

only upon some subsequent operation on
this phaser, if ever.

**Returns:** the arrival phase number, or a negative value if terminated
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if not terminated and the number
of registered or unarrived parties would become negative

- arriveAndAwaitAdvance

```java
public int arriveAndAwaitAdvance()
```

Arrives at this phaser and awaits others. Equivalent in effect
to

awaitAdvance(arrive())

. If you need to await with
interruption or timeout, you can arrange this with an analogous
construction using one of the other forms of the

awaitAdvance

method. If instead you need to deregister upon
arrival, use

awaitAdvance(arriveAndDeregister())

.

It is a usage error for an unregistered party to invoke this
method. However, this error may result in an

IllegalStateException

only upon some subsequent operation on
this phaser, if ever.

**Returns:** the arrival phase number, or the (negative)

current phase

if terminated
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if not terminated and the number
of unarrived parties would become negative

- awaitAdvance

```java
public int awaitAdvance​(int phase)
```

Awaits the phase of this phaser to advance from the given phase
value, returning immediately if the current phase is not equal
to the given phase value or this phaser is terminated.

**Parameters:** phase

- an arrival phase number, or negative value if
terminated; this argument is normally the value returned by a
previous call to

arrive

or

arriveAndDeregister

.
**Returns:** the next arrival phase number, or the argument if it is
negative, or the (negative)

current phase

if terminated

- awaitAdvanceInterruptibly

```java
public int awaitAdvanceInterruptibly​(int phase)
throws
InterruptedException
```

Awaits the phase of this phaser to advance from the given phase
value, throwing

InterruptedException

if interrupted
while waiting, or returning immediately if the current phase is
not equal to the given phase value or this phaser is
terminated.

**Parameters:** phase

- an arrival phase number, or negative value if
terminated; this argument is normally the value returned by a
previous call to

arrive

or

arriveAndDeregister

.
**Returns:** the next arrival phase number, or the argument if it is
negative, or the (negative)

current phase

if terminated
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if thread interrupted while waiting

- awaitAdvanceInterruptibly

```java
public int awaitAdvanceInterruptibly​(int phase,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException
,

TimeoutException
```

Awaits the phase of this phaser to advance from the given phase
value or the given timeout to elapse, throwing

InterruptedException

if interrupted while waiting, or
returning immediately if the current phase is not equal to the
given phase value or this phaser is terminated.

**Parameters:** phase

- an arrival phase number, or negative value if
terminated; this argument is normally the value returned by a
previous call to

arrive

or

arriveAndDeregister

.
**Parameters:** timeout

- how long to wait before giving up, in units of

unit
**Parameters:** unit

- a

TimeUnit

determining how to interpret the

timeout

parameter
**Returns:** the next arrival phase number, or the argument if it is
negative, or the (negative)

current phase

if terminated
**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if thread interrupted while waiting
**Throws:** TimeoutException

- if timed out while waiting

- forceTermination

```java
public void forceTermination()
```

Forces this phaser to enter termination state. Counts of
registered parties are unaffected. If this phaser is a member
of a tiered set of phasers, then all of the phasers in the set
are terminated. If this phaser is already terminated, this
method has no effect. This method may be useful for
coordinating recovery after one or more tasks encounter
unexpected exceptions.

- getPhase

```java
public final int getPhase()
```

Returns the current phase number. The maximum phase number is

Integer.MAX_VALUE

, after which it restarts at
zero. Upon termination, the phase number is negative,
in which case the prevailing phase prior to termination
may be obtained via

getPhase() + Integer.MIN_VALUE

.

**Returns:** the phase number, or a negative value if terminated

- getRegisteredParties

```java
public int getRegisteredParties()
```

Returns the number of parties registered at this phaser.

**Returns:** the number of parties

- getArrivedParties

```java
public int getArrivedParties()
```

Returns the number of registered parties that have arrived at
the current phase of this phaser. If this phaser has terminated,
the returned value is meaningless and arbitrary.

**Returns:** the number of arrived parties

- getUnarrivedParties

```java
public int getUnarrivedParties()
```

Returns the number of registered parties that have not yet
arrived at the current phase of this phaser. If this phaser has
terminated, the returned value is meaningless and arbitrary.

**Returns:** the number of unarrived parties

- getParent

```java
public
Phaser
getParent()
```

Returns the parent of this phaser, or

null

if none.

**Returns:** the parent of this phaser, or

null

if none

- getRoot

```java
public
Phaser
getRoot()
```

Returns the root ancestor of this phaser, which is the same as
this phaser if it has no parent.

**Returns:** the root ancestor of this phaser

- isTerminated

```java
public boolean isTerminated()
```

Returns

true

if this phaser has been terminated.

**Returns:** true

if this phaser has been terminated

- onAdvance

```java
protected boolean onAdvance​(int phase,
int registeredParties)
```

Overridable method to perform an action upon impending phase
advance, and to control termination. This method is invoked
upon arrival of the party advancing this phaser (when all other
waiting parties are dormant). If this method returns

true

, this phaser will be set to a final termination state
upon advance, and subsequent calls to

isTerminated()

will return true. Any (unchecked) Exception or Error thrown by
an invocation of this method is propagated to the party
attempting to advance this phaser, in which case no advance
occurs.

The arguments to this method provide the state of the phaser
prevailing for the current transition. The effects of invoking
arrival, registration, and waiting methods on this phaser from
within

onAdvance

are unspecified and should not be
relied on.

If this phaser is a member of a tiered set of phasers, then

onAdvance

is invoked only for its root phaser on each
advance.

To support the most common use cases, the default
implementation of this method returns

true

when the
number of registered parties has become zero as the result of a
party invoking

arriveAndDeregister

. You can disable
this behavior, thus enabling continuation upon future
registrations, by overriding this method to always return

false

:

```java
Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int parties) { return false; }
}
```

**Parameters:** phase

- the current phase number on entry to this method,
before this phaser is advanced
**Parameters:** registeredParties

- the current number of registered parties
**Returns:** true

if this phaser should terminate

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string identifying this phaser, as well as its
state. The state, in brackets, includes the String

"phase = "

followed by the phase number,

"parties = "

followed by the number of registered parties, and

"arrived = "

followed by the number of arrived parties.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string identifying this phaser, as well as its state

prevailing for the current transition. The effects of invoking
arrival, registration, and waiting methods on this phaser from
within

onAdvance

are unspecified and should not be
relied on.

If this phaser is a member of a tiered set of phasers, then

onAdvance

is invoked only for its root phaser on each
advance.

To support the most common use cases, the default
implementation of this method returns

true

when the
number of registered parties has become zero as the result of a
party invoking

arriveAndDeregister

. You can disable
this behavior, thus enabling continuation upon future
registrations, by overriding this method to always return

false

:

```java
Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int parties) { return false; }
}
```

**Parameters:** phase

- the current phase number on entry to this method,
before this phaser is advanced
**Parameters:** registeredParties

- the current number of registered parties
**Returns:** true

if this phaser should terminate

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string identifying this phaser, as well as its
state. The state, in brackets, includes the String

"phase = "

followed by the phase number,

"parties = "

followed by the number of registered parties, and

"arrived = "

followed by the number of arrived parties.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string identifying this phaser, as well as its state

#### Method Detail

register

```java
public int register()
```

Adds a new unarrived party to this phaser. If an ongoing
invocation of

onAdvance(int, int)

is in progress, this method
may await its completion before returning. If this phaser has
a parent, and this phaser previously had no registered parties,
this child phaser is also registered with its parent. If
this phaser is terminated, the attempt to register has
no effect, and a negative value is returned.

**Returns:** the arrival phase number to which this registration
applied. If this value is negative, then this phaser has
terminated, in which case registration has no effect.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if attempting to register more
than the maximum supported number of parties

---

#### register

public int register()

Adds a new unarrived party to this phaser. If an ongoing
invocation of

onAdvance(int, int)

is in progress, this method
may await its completion before returning. If this phaser has
a parent, and this phaser previously had no registered parties,
this child phaser is also registered with its parent. If
this phaser is terminated, the attempt to register has
no effect, and a negative value is returned.

bulkRegister

```java
public int bulkRegister​(int parties)
```

Adds the given number of new unarrived parties to this phaser.
If an ongoing invocation of

onAdvance(int, int)

is in progress,
this method may await its completion before returning. If this
phaser has a parent, and the given number of parties is greater
than zero, and this phaser previously had no registered
parties, this child phaser is also registered with its parent.
If this phaser is terminated, the attempt to register has no
effect, and a negative value is returned.

**Parameters:** parties

- the number of additional parties required to
advance to the next phase
**Returns:** the arrival phase number to which this registration
applied. If this value is negative, then this phaser has
terminated, in which case registration has no effect.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if attempting to register more
than the maximum supported number of parties
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

parties < 0

will return true. Any (unchecked) Exception or Error thrown by
an invocation of this method is propagated to the party
attempting to advance this phaser, in which case no advance
occurs.

The arguments to this method provide the state of the phaser
prevailing for the current transition. The effects of invoking
