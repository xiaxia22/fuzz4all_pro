# Class SerialArray

**Source:** `java.sql.rowset\javax\sql\rowset\serial\SerialArray.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
SerialArray

extends
Object

implements
Array
,
Serializable
,
Cloneable
```

A serialized version of an

Array

object, which is the mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL

ARRAY

value.

The

SerialArray

class provides a constructor for creating
a

SerialArray

instance from an

Array

object,
methods for getting the base type and the SQL name for the base type, and
methods for copying all or part of a

SerialArray

object.

Note: In order for this class to function correctly, a connection to the
data source
must be available in order for the SQL

Array

object to be
materialized (have all of its elements brought to the client server)
if necessary. At this time, logical pointers to the data in the data source,
such as locators, are not currently supported.

Thread safety

A SerialArray is not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. If a
SerialArray is to be used by more than one thread then access to the
SerialArray should be controlled by appropriate synchronization.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

,

Cloneable

,

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public SerialArray​(
Array
array,

Map
<
String
,​
Class
<?>> map)
throws
SerialException
,

SQLException

Constructs a new

SerialArray

object from the given

Array

object, using the given type map for the custom
mapping of each element when the elements are SQL UDTs.

This method does custom mapping if the array elements are a UDT
and the given type map has an entry for that UDT.
Custom mapping is recursive,
meaning that if, for instance, an element of an SQL structured type
is an SQL structured type that itself has an element that is an SQL
structured type, each structured type that has a custom mapping will be
mapped according to the given type map.

The new

SerialArray

object contains the same elements as the

Array

object
from which it is built, except when the base type is the SQL type

STRUCT

,

ARRAY

,

BLOB

,

CLOB

,

DATALINK

or

JAVA_OBJECT

.
In this case, each element in the new

SerialArray

object is the appropriate serialized form,
that is, a

SerialStruct

,

SerialArray

,

SerialBlob

,

SerialClob

,

SerialDatalink

, or

SerialJavaObject

object.

Note: (1) The

Array

object from which a

SerialArray

object is created must have materialized the SQL

ARRAY

value's
data on the client before it is passed to the constructor. Otherwise,
the new

SerialArray

object will contain no data.

Note: (2) If the

Array

contains

java.sql.Types.JAVA_OBJECT

types, the

SerialJavaObject

constructor is called where checks
are made to ensure this object is serializable.

Note: (3) The

Array

object supplied to this constructor cannot
return

null

for any

Array.getArray()

methods.

SerialArray

cannot serialize null array values.

**Parameters:**
- array

- the

Array

object to be serialized
- map

- a

java.util.Map

object in which
each entry consists of 1) a

String

object
giving the fully qualified name of a UDT (an SQL structured type or
distinct type) and 2) the

Class

object for the

SQLData

implementation
that defines how the UDT is to be mapped. The

map

parameter does not have any effect for

Blob

,

Clob

,

DATALINK

, or

JAVA_OBJECT

types.

**Throws:**
- SerialException

- if an error occurs serializing the

Array

object
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or if the

array

or the

map

values are

null

---

#### public SerialArray​(
Array
array)
throws
SerialException
,

SQLException

Constructs a new

SerialArray

object from the given

Array

object.

This constructor does not do custom mapping. If the base type of the array
is an SQL structured type and custom mapping is desired, the constructor

SerialArray(Array array, Map map)

should be used.

The new

SerialArray

object contains the same elements as the

Array

object
from which it is built, except when the base type is the SQL type

BLOB

,

CLOB

,

DATALINK

or

JAVA_OBJECT

.
In this case, each element in the new

SerialArray

object is the appropriate serialized form,
that is, a

SerialBlob

,

SerialClob

,

SerialDatalink

, or

SerialJavaObject

object.

Note: (1) The

Array

object from which a

SerialArray

object is created must have materialized the SQL

ARRAY

value's
data on the client before it is passed to the constructor. Otherwise,
the new

SerialArray

object will contain no data.

Note: (2) The

Array

object supplied to this constructor cannot
return

null

for any

Array.getArray()

methods.

SerialArray

cannot serialize

null

array values.

**Parameters:**
- array

- the

Array

object to be serialized

**Throws:**
- SerialException

- if an error occurs serializing the

Array

object
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs or the

array

parameter is

null

.

Constructs a new

SerialArray

object from the given

Array

object, using the given type map for the custom
mapping of each element when the elements are SQL UDTs.

This method does custom mapping if the array elements are a UDT
and the given type map has an entry for that UDT.
Custom mapping is recursive,
meaning that if, for instance, an element of an SQL structured type
is an SQL structured type that itself has an element that is an SQL
structured type, each structured type that has a custom mapping will be
mapped according to the given type map.

The new

SerialArray

object contains the same elements as the

Array

object
from which it is built, except when the base type is the SQL type

STRUCT

,

ARRAY

,

BLOB

,

CLOB

,

DATALINK

or

JAVA_OBJECT

.
In this case, each element in the new

SerialArray

object is the appropriate serialized form,
that is, a

SerialStruct

,

,

SerialBlob

,

SerialClob

,

SerialDatalink

, or

SerialJavaObject

object.

Note: (1) The

Array

object from which a

SerialArray

object is created must have materialized the SQL

ARRAY

value's
data on the client before it is passed to the constructor. Otherwise,
the new

SerialArray

object will contain no data.

Note: (2) If the

Array

contains

java.sql.Types.JAVA_OBJECT

types, the

SerialJavaObject

constructor is called where checks
are made to ensure this object is serializable.

Note: (3) The

Array

object supplied to this constructor cannot
return

null

for any

Array.getArray()

methods.

SerialArray

cannot serialize null array values.

**Parameters:** array

- the

Array

object to be serialized
**Parameters:** map

- a

java.util.Map

object in which
each entry consists of 1) a

String

object
giving the fully qualified name of a UDT (an SQL structured type or

index

and containing up to

count

successive
elements. This method uses
the specified map for type map customizations unless the base type of the
array does not match a user-defined type (UDT) in

map

, in
which case it uses the
standard mapping. This version of the method

getResultSet

uses
either the given type map or the standard mapping; it never uses the type
map associated with the connection.

**Specified by:** getResultSet

in interface

Array
**Parameters:** index

- the index into this

SerialArray

object
of the first element to be copied; the index of the
first element in the array is

0
**Parameters:** count

- the number of consecutive elements to be copied, starting
at the given index
**Parameters:** map

- a

java.util.Map

object in which
each entry consists of 1) a

String

object
giving the fully qualified name of a UDT and 2) the

Class

object for the

SQLData

implementation
that defines how the UDT is to be mapped
**Returns:** a

ResultSet

object containing the designated
elements in this

SerialArray

object, with a
separate row for each element
**Throws:** SerialException

- if called with the cause set to

UnsupportedOperationException
