# Class IsoFields

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\temporal\IsoFields.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
IsoFields

extends
Object
```

Fields and units specific to the ISO-8601 calendar system,
including quarter-of-year and week-based-year.

This class defines fields and units that are specific to the ISO calendar system.

Quarter of year

The ISO-8601 standard is based on the standard civic 12 month year.
This is commonly divided into four quarters, often abbreviated as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.

January, February and March are in Q1.
April, May and June are in Q2.
July, August and September are in Q3.
October, November and December are in Q4.

The complete date is expressed using three fields:

- DAY_OF_QUARTER

- the day within the quarter, from 1 to 90, 91 or 92

QUARTER_OF_YEAR

- the quarter within the year, from 1 to 4

YEAR

- the standard ISO year

Week based years

The ISO-8601 standard was originally intended as a data interchange format,
defining a string format for dates and times. However, it also defines an
alternate way of expressing the date, based on the concept of week-based-year.

The date is expressed using three fields:

- DAY_OF_WEEK

- the standard field defining the
day-of-week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7)

WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR

- the week within the week-based-year

WEEK_BASED_YEAR

- the week-based-year

The week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year.
It differs from the standard year in that it always starts on a Monday.

The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard
ISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year.

- If January 1st is Monday then week 1 starts on January 1st

If January 1st is Tuesday then week 1 starts on December 31st of the previous standard year

If January 1st is Wednesday then week 1 starts on December 30th of the previous standard year

If January 1st is Thursday then week 1 starts on December 29th of the previous standard year

If January 1st is Friday then week 1 starts on January 4th

If January 1st is Saturday then week 1 starts on January 3rd

If January 1st is Sunday then week 1 starts on January 2nd

There are 52 weeks in most week-based years, however on occasion there are 53 weeks.

### Field Details

#### public static final
TemporalField
DAY_OF_QUARTER

The field that represents the day-of-quarter.

This field allows the day-of-quarter value to be queried and set.
The day-of-quarter has values from 1 to 90 in Q1 of a standard year, from 1 to 91
in Q1 of a leap year, from 1 to 91 in Q2 and from 1 to 92 in Q3 and Q4.

The day-of-quarter can only be calculated if the day-of-year, month-of-year and year
are available.

When setting this field, the value is allowed to be partially lenient, taking any
value from 1 to 92. If the quarter has less than 92 days, then day 92, and
potentially day 91, is in the following quarter.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year,
quarter-of-year and day-of-quarter.

In

strict mode

, all three fields are
validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field
is validated from 1 to 90, 91 or 92 depending on the year and quarter.

In

smart mode

, all three fields are
validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field is
validated between 1 and 92, ignoring the actual range based on the year and quarter.
If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by one day, then the resulting date
is one day later. If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by two days,
then the resulting date is two days later.

In

lenient mode

, only the year is validated
against the range of valid values. The resulting date is calculated equivalent to
the following three stage approach. First, create a date on the first of January
in the requested year. Then take the quarter-of-year, subtract one, and add the
amount in quarters to the date. Finally, take the day-of-quarter, subtract one,
and add the amount in days to the date.

This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.

---

#### public static final
TemporalField
QUARTER_OF_YEAR

The field that represents the quarter-of-year.

This field allows the quarter-of-year value to be queried and set.
The quarter-of-year has values from 1 to 4.

The quarter-of-year can only be calculated if the month-of-year is available.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year,
quarter-of-year and day-of-quarter.
See

DAY_OF_QUARTER

for details.

This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.

---

#### public static final
TemporalField
WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR

The field that represents the week-of-week-based-year.

This field allows the week of the week-based-year value to be queried and set.
The week-of-week-based-year has values from 1 to 52, or 53 if the
week-based-year has 53 weeks.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a
week-based-year, week-of-week-based-year and day-of-week.

In

strict mode

, all three fields are
validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year
field is validated from 1 to 52 or 53 depending on the week-based-year.

In

smart mode

, all three fields are
validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year
field is validated between 1 and 53, ignoring the week-based-year.
If the week-of-week-based-year is 53, but the week-based-year only has
52 weeks, then the resulting date is in week 1 of the following week-based-year.

In

lenient mode

, only the week-based-year
is validated against the range of valid values. If the day-of-week is outside
the range 1 to 7, then the resulting date is adjusted by a suitable number of
weeks to reduce the day-of-week to the range 1 to 7. If the week-of-week-based-year
value is outside the range 1 to 52, then any excess weeks are added or subtracted
from the resulting date.

This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.

---

#### public static final
TemporalField
WEEK_BASED_YEAR

The field that represents the week-based-year.

This field allows the week-based-year value to be queried and set.

The field has a range that matches

LocalDate.MAX

and

LocalDate.MIN

.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a
week-based-year, week-of-week-based-year and day-of-week.
See

WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR

for details.

This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.

---

#### public static final
TemporalUnit
WEEK_BASED_YEARS

The unit that represents week-based-years for the purpose of addition and subtraction.

This allows a number of week-based-years to be added to, or subtracted from, a date.
The unit is equal to either 52 or 53 weeks.
The estimated duration of a week-based-year is the same as that of a standard ISO
year at

365.2425 Days

.

The rules for addition add the number of week-based-years to the existing value
for the week-based-year field. If the resulting week-based-year only has 52 weeks,
then the date will be in week 1 of the following week-based-year.

This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.

---

#### public static final
TemporalUnit
QUARTER_YEARS

Unit that represents the concept of a quarter-year.
For the ISO calendar system, it is equal to 3 months.
The estimated duration of a quarter-year is one quarter of

365.2425 Days

.

This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- DAY_OF_QUARTER

```java
public static final
TemporalField
DAY_OF_QUARTER
```

The field that represents the day-of-quarter.

This field allows the day-of-quarter value to be queried and set.
The day-of-quarter has values from 1 to 90 in Q1 of a standard year, from 1 to 91
in Q1 of a leap year, from 1 to 91 in Q2 and from 1 to 92 in Q3 and Q4.

The day-of-quarter can only be calculated if the day-of-year, month-of-year and year
are available.

When setting this field, the value is allowed to be partially lenient, taking any
value from 1 to 92. If the quarter has less than 92 days, then day 92, and
potentially day 91, is in the following quarter.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year,
quarter-of-year and day-of-quarter.

In

strict mode

, all three fields are
validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field
is validated from 1 to 90, 91 or 92 depending on the year and quarter.

In

smart mode

, all three fields are
validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field is
validated between 1 and 92, ignoring the actual range based on the year and quarter.
If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by one day, then the resulting date
is one day later. If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by two days,
then the resulting date is two days later.

In

lenient mode

, only the year is validated
against the range of valid values. The resulting date is calculated equivalent to
the following three stage approach. First, create a date on the first of January
in the requested year. Then take the quarter-of-year, subtract one, and add the
amount in quarters to the date. Finally, take the day-of-quarter, subtract one,
and add the amount in days to the date.

This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.

- QUARTER_OF_YEAR

```java
public static final
TemporalField
QUARTER_OF_YEAR
```

The field that represents the quarter-of-year.

This field allows the quarter-of-year value to be queried and set.
The quarter-of-year has values from 1 to 4.

The quarter-of-year can only be calculated if the month-of-year is available.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year,
quarter-of-year and day-of-quarter.

- WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR

```java
public static final
TemporalField
WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR
```

The field that represents the week-of-week-based-year.

This field allows the week of the week-based-year value to be queried and set.
The week-of-week-based-year has values from 1 to 52, or 53 if the
week-based-year has 53 weeks.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a
week-based-year, week-of-week-based-year and day-of-week.

In

strict mode

, all three fields are
validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year
field is validated from 1 to 52 or 53 depending on the week-based-year.

In

smart mode

, all three fields are
validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year
field is validated between 1 and 53, ignoring the week-based-year.
If the week-of-week-based-year is 53, but the week-based-year only has
52 weeks, then the resulting date is in week 1 of the following week-based-year.

In

lenient mode

, only the week-based-year
is validated against the range of valid values. If the day-of-week is outside
the range 1 to 7, then the resulting date is adjusted by a suitable number of
weeks to reduce the day-of-week to the range 1 to 7. If the week-of-week-based-year
value is outside the range 1 to 52, then any excess weeks are added or subtracted
from the resulting date.

This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.

- WEEK_BASED_YEAR

The unit is equal to either 52 or 53 weeks.
The estimated duration of a week-based-year is the same as that of a standard ISO
year at

365.2425 Days

.

The rules for addition add the number of week-based-years to the existing value
for the week-based-year field. If the resulting week-based-year only has 52 weeks,
then the date will be in week 1 of the following week-based-year.

WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR

The field that represents the week-of-week-based-year.

This field allows the week of the week-based-year value to be queried and set.
The week-of-week-based-year has values from 1 to 52, or 53 if the
week-based-year has 53 weeks.

In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a
week-based-year, week-of-week-based-year and day-of-week.

In

strict mode

, all three fields are
validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year
field is validated from 1 to 52 or 53 depending on the week-based-year.

In

smart mode

, all three fields are
validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year
field is validated between 1 and 53, ignoring the week-based-year.
If the week-of-week-based-year is 53, but the week-based-year only has
52 weeks, then the resulting date is in week 1 of the following week-based-year.

In

lenient mode

, only the week-based-year
is validated against the range of valid values. If the day-of-week is outside
the range 1 to 7, then the resulting date is adjusted by a suitable number of
weeks to reduce the day-of-week to the range 1 to 7. If the week-of-week-based-year
