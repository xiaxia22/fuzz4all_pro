# Class DragSource

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\dnd\DragSource.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
DragSource

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

The

DragSource

is the entity responsible
for the initiation of the Drag
and Drop operation, and may be used in a number of scenarios:

- 1 default instance per JVM for the lifetime of that JVM.

1 instance per class of potential Drag Initiator object (e.g
TextField). [implementation dependent]

1 per instance of a particular

Component

, or application specific
object associated with a

Component

instance in the GUI. [implementation dependent]

Some other arbitrary association. [implementation dependent]

Once the

DragSource

is
obtained, a

DragGestureRecognizer

should
also be obtained to associate the

DragSource

with a particular

Component

.

The initial interpretation of the user's gesture,
and the subsequent starting of the drag operation
are the responsibility of the implementing

Component

, which is usually
implemented by a

DragGestureRecognizer

.

When a drag gesture occurs, the

DragSource

's
startDrag() method shall be
invoked in order to cause processing
of the user's navigational
gestures and delivery of Drag and Drop
protocol notifications. A

DragSource

shall only
permit a single Drag and Drop operation to be
current at any one time, and shall
reject any further startDrag() requests
by throwing an

IllegalDnDOperationException

until such time as the extant operation is complete.

The startDrag() method invokes the
createDragSourceContext() method to
instantiate an appropriate

DragSourceContext

and associate the

DragSourceContextPeer

with that.

If the Drag and Drop System is
unable to initiate a drag operation for
some reason, the startDrag() method throws
a

java.awt.dnd.InvalidDnDOperationException

to signal such a condition. Typically this
exception is thrown when the underlying platform
system is either not in a state to
initiate a drag, or the parameters specified are invalid.

Note that during the drag, the
set of operations exposed by the source
at the start of the drag operation may not change
until the operation is complete.
The operation(s) are constant for the
duration of the operation with respect to the

DragSource

.
