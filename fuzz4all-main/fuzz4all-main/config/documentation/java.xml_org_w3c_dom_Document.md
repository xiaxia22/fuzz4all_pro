# Interface Document

**Source:** `java.xml\org\w3c\dom\Document.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Document

extends
Node
```

The

Document

interface represents the entire HTML or XML
document. Conceptually, it is the root of the document tree, and provides
the primary access to the document's data.

Since elements, text nodes, comments, processing instructions, etc.
cannot exist outside the context of a

Document

, the

Document

interface also contains the factory methods needed
to create these objects. The

Node

objects created have a

ownerDocument

attribute which associates them with the

Document

within whose context they were created.

See also the

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification

.

**All Superinterfaces:** Node

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### DocumentType
getDoctype()

The Document Type Declaration (see

DocumentType

)
associated with this document. For XML documents without a document
type declaration this returns

null

. For HTML documents,
a

DocumentType

object may be returned, independently of
the presence or absence of document type declaration in the HTML
document.

This provides direct access to the

DocumentType

node,
child node of this

Document

. This node can be set at
document creation time and later changed through the use of child
nodes manipulation methods, such as

Node.insertBefore

,
or

Node.replaceChild

. Note, however, that while some
implementations may instantiate different types of

Document

objects supporting additional features than the
"Core", such as "HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, based on the

DocumentType

specified at creation time,
changing it afterwards is very unlikely to result in a change of the
features supported.

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 3

---

#### DOMImplementation
getImplementation()

The

DOMImplementation

object that handles this document. A
DOM application may use objects from multiple implementations.

---

#### Element
getDocumentElement()

This is a convenience attribute that allows direct access to the child
node that is the document element of the document.

---

#### Element
createElement​(
String
tagName)
throws
DOMException

Creates an element of the type specified. Note that the instance
returned implements the

Element

interface, so attributes
can be specified directly on the returned object.

In addition, if there are known attributes with default values,

Attr

nodes representing them are automatically created
and attached to the element.

To create an element with a qualified name and namespace URI, use
the

createElementNS

method.

**Parameters:**
- tagName

- The name of the element type to instantiate. For XML,
this is case-sensitive, otherwise it depends on the
case-sensitivity of the markup language in use. In that case, the
name is mapped to the canonical form of that markup by the DOM
implementation.

**Returns:**
- A new

Element

object with the

nodeName

attribute set to

tagName

, and

localName

,

prefix

, and

namespaceURI

set to

null

.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

---

#### DocumentFragment
createDocumentFragment()

Creates an empty

DocumentFragment

object.

**Returns:**
- A new

DocumentFragment

.

---

#### Text
createTextNode​(
String
data)

Creates a

Text

node given the specified string.

**Parameters:**
- data

- The data for the node.

**Returns:**
- The new

Text

object.

---

#### Comment
createComment​(
String
data)

Creates a

Comment

node given the specified string.

**Parameters:**
- data

- The data for the node.

**Returns:**
- The new

Comment

object.

---

#### CDATASection
createCDATASection​(
String
data)
throws
DOMException

Creates a

CDATASection

node whose value is the specified
string.

**Parameters:**
- data

- The data for the

CDATASection

contents.

**Returns:**
- The new

CDATASection

object.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

---

#### ProcessingInstruction
createProcessingInstruction​(
String
target,

String
data)
throws
DOMException

Creates a

ProcessingInstruction

node given the specified
name and data strings.

**Parameters:**
- target

- The target part of the processing instruction.Unlike

Document.createElementNS

or

Document.createAttributeNS

, no namespace well-formed
checking is done on the target name. Applications should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the parameter "
namespaces" set to

true

in order to ensure that the
target name is namespace well-formed.
- data

- The data for the node.

**Returns:**
- The new

ProcessingInstruction

object.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified target is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

---

#### Attr
createAttribute​(
String
name)
throws
DOMException

Creates an

Attr

of the given name. Note that the

Attr

instance can then be set on an

Element

using the

setAttributeNode

method.

To create an attribute with a qualified name and namespace URI, use
the

createAttributeNS

method.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the attribute.

**Returns:**
- A new

Attr

object with the

nodeName

attribute set to

name

, and

localName

,

prefix

, and

namespaceURI

set to

null

. The value of the attribute is the empty string.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

---

#### EntityReference
createEntityReference​(
String
name)
throws
DOMException

Creates an

EntityReference

object. In addition, if the
referenced entity is known, the child list of the

EntityReference

node is made the same as that of the
corresponding

Entity

node.

Note:

If any descendant of the

Entity

node has
an unbound namespace prefix, the corresponding descendant of the
created

EntityReference

node is also unbound; (its

namespaceURI

is

null

). The DOM Level 2 and
3 do not support any mechanism to resolve namespace prefixes in this
case.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The name of the entity to reference.Unlike

Document.createElementNS

or

Document.createAttributeNS

, no namespace well-formed
checking is done on the entity name. Applications should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the parameter "
namespaces" set to

true

in order to ensure that the
entity name is namespace well-formed.

**Returns:**
- The new

EntityReference

object.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

---

#### NodeList
getElementsByTagName​(
String
tagname)

Returns a

NodeList

of all the

Elements

in
document order with a given tag name and are contained in the
document.

**Parameters:**
- tagname

- The name of the tag to match on. The special value "*"
matches all tags. For XML, the

tagname

parameter is
case-sensitive, otherwise it depends on the case-sensitivity of the
markup language in use.

**Returns:**
- A new

NodeList

object containing all the matched

Elements

.

---

#### Node
importNode​(
Node
importedNode,
boolean deep)
throws
DOMException

Imports a node from another document to this document, without altering
or removing the source node from the original document; this method
creates a new copy of the source node. The returned node has no
parent; (

parentNode

is

null

).

For all nodes, importing a node creates a node object owned by the
importing document, with attribute values identical to the source
node's

nodeName

and

nodeType

, plus the
attributes related to namespaces (

prefix

,

localName

, and

namespaceURI

). As in the

cloneNode

operation, the source node is not altered.
User data associated to the imported node is not carried over.
However, if any

UserDataHandlers

has been specified
along with the associated data these handlers will be called with the
appropriate parameters before this method returns.

Additional information is copied as appropriate to the

nodeType

, attempting to mirror the behavior expected if
a fragment of XML or HTML source was copied from one document to
another, recognizing that the two documents may have different DTDs
in the XML case. The following list describes the specifics for each
type of node.

**ATTRIBUTE_NODE:** The

ownerElement

attribute
is set to

null

and the

specified

flag is
set to

true

on the generated

Attr

. The
descendants of the source

Attr

are recursively imported
and the resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect on

Attr

nodes; they always carry their children with them
when imported.
**DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE:** If the

deep

option
was set to

true

, the descendants of the source

DocumentFragment

are recursively imported and the
resulting nodes reassembled under the imported

DocumentFragment

to form the corresponding subtree.
Otherwise, this simply generates an empty

DocumentFragment

.
**DOCUMENT_NODE:** Document

nodes cannot be imported.
**DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE:** DocumentType

nodes cannot be imported.
**ELEMENT_NODE:** Specified

attribute nodes of the source element are imported, and the generated

Attr

nodes are attached to the generated

Element

. Default attributes are

not

copied, though if the document being imported into defines default
attributes for this element name, those are assigned. If the

importNode

deep

parameter was set to

true

, the descendants of the source element are
recursively imported and the resulting nodes reassembled to form the
corresponding subtree.
**ENTITY_NODE:** Entity

nodes can be
imported, however in the current release of the DOM the

DocumentType

is readonly. Ability to add these imported
nodes to a

DocumentType

will be considered for addition
to a future release of the DOM.On import, the

publicId

,

systemId

, and

notationName

attributes are
copied. If a

deep

import is requested, the descendants
of the the source

Entity

are recursively imported and
the resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
**ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE:** Only the

EntityReference

itself is
copied, even if a

deep

import is requested, since the
source and destination documents might have defined the entity
differently. If the document being imported into provides a
definition for this entity name, its value is assigned.
**NOTATION_NODE:** Notation

nodes can be imported, however in the current
release of the DOM the

DocumentType

is readonly. Ability
to add these imported nodes to a

DocumentType

will be
considered for addition to a future release of the DOM.On import, the

publicId

and

systemId

attributes are copied.
Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect on this type
of nodes since they cannot have any children.
**PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE:** The imported node copies its

target

and

data

values from those of the
source node.Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect
on this type of nodes since they cannot have any children.
**TEXT_NODE,
CDATA_SECTION_NODE, COMMENT_NODE:** These three types of nodes inheriting
from

CharacterData

copy their

data

and

length

attributes from those of the source node.Note
that the

deep

parameter has no effect on these types of
nodes since they cannot have any children.

**ATTRIBUTE_NODE:**
- The

ownerElement

attribute
is set to

null

and the

specified

flag is
set to

true

on the generated

Attr

. The
descendants of the source

Attr

are recursively imported
and the resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect on

Attr

nodes; they always carry their children with them
when imported.

**DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE:**
- If the

deep

option
was set to

true

, the descendants of the source

DocumentFragment

are recursively imported and the
resulting nodes reassembled under the imported

DocumentFragment

to form the corresponding subtree.
Otherwise, this simply generates an empty

DocumentFragment

.

**DOCUMENT_NODE:**
- Document

nodes cannot be imported.

**DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE:**
- DocumentType

nodes cannot be imported.

**ELEMENT_NODE:**
- Specified

attribute nodes of the source element are imported, and the generated

Attr

nodes are attached to the generated

Element

. Default attributes are

not

copied, though if the document being imported into defines default
attributes for this element name, those are assigned. If the

importNode

deep

parameter was set to

true

, the descendants of the source element are
recursively imported and the resulting nodes reassembled to form the
corresponding subtree.

**ENTITY_NODE:**
- Entity

nodes can be
imported, however in the current release of the DOM the

DocumentType

is readonly. Ability to add these imported
nodes to a

DocumentType

will be considered for addition
to a future release of the DOM.On import, the

publicId

,

systemId

, and

notationName

attributes are
copied. If a

deep

import is requested, the descendants
of the the source

Entity

are recursively imported and
the resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.

**ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE:**
- Only the

EntityReference

itself is
copied, even if a

deep

import is requested, since the
source and destination documents might have defined the entity
differently. If the document being imported into provides a
definition for this entity name, its value is assigned.

**NOTATION_NODE:**
- Notation

nodes can be imported, however in the current
release of the DOM the

DocumentType

is readonly. Ability
to add these imported nodes to a

DocumentType

will be
considered for addition to a future release of the DOM.On import, the

publicId

and

systemId

attributes are copied.
Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect on this type
of nodes since they cannot have any children.

**PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE:**
- The imported node copies its

target

and

data

values from those of the
source node.Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect
on this type of nodes since they cannot have any children.

**TEXT_NODE,
CDATA_SECTION_NODE, COMMENT_NODE:**
- These three types of nodes inheriting
from

CharacterData

copy their

data

and

length

attributes from those of the source node.Note
that the

deep

parameter has no effect on these types of
nodes since they cannot have any children.

#### NodeList
getElementsByTagNameNS​(
String
namespaceURI,

String
localName)

Returns a

NodeList

of all the

Elements

with a
given local name and namespace URI in document order.

**Parameters:**
- namespaceURI

- The namespace URI of the elements to match on. The
special value

---

#### Element
getElementById​(
String
elementId)

Returns the

Element

that has an ID attribute with the
given value. If no such element exists, this returns

null

. If more than one element has an ID attribute with that value, what
is returned is undefined.

The DOM implementation is expected to use the attribute

Attr.isId

to determine if an attribute is of type ID.

Note:

Attributes with the name "ID" or "id" are not of type
ID unless so defined.

**Parameters:**
- elementId

- The unique

id

value for an element.

**Returns:**
- The matching element or

null

if there is none.

**Since:**
- 1.4, DOM Level 2

---

#### String
getInputEncoding()

An attribute specifying the encoding used for this document at the time
of the parsing. This is

null

when it is not known, such
as when the

Document

was created in memory.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### String
getXmlEncoding()

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, the encoding of this document. This is

null

when
unspecified or when it is not known, such as when the

Document

was created in memory.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### boolean getXmlStandalone()

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, whether this document is standalone. This is

false

when
unspecified.

Note:

No verification is done on the value when setting
this attribute. Applications should use

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the "validate"
parameter to verify if the value matches the

validity
constraint for standalone document declaration

as defined in [

XML 1.0

].

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### void setXmlStandalone​(boolean xmlStandalone)
throws
DOMException

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, whether this document is standalone. This is

false

when
unspecified.

Note:

No verification is done on the value when setting
this attribute. Applications should use

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the "validate"
parameter to verify if the value matches the

validity
constraint for standalone document declaration

as defined in [

XML 1.0

].

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document does not support the
"XML" feature.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### String
getXmlVersion()

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, the version number of this document. If there is no declaration and if
this document supports the "XML" feature, the value is

"1.0"

. If this document does not support the "XML"
feature, the value is always

null

. Changing this
attribute will affect methods that check for invalid characters in
XML names. Application should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

in order to check for
invalid characters in the

Node

s that are already part of
this

Document

.

DOM applications may use the

DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version)

method
with parameter values "XMLVersion" and "1.0" (respectively) to
determine if an implementation supports [

XML 1.0

]. DOM
applications may use the same method with parameter values
"XMLVersion" and "1.1" (respectively) to determine if an
implementation supports [

XML 1.1

]. In both
cases, in order to support XML, an implementation must also support
the "XML" feature defined in this specification.

Document

objects supporting a version of the "XMLVersion" feature must not
raise a

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR

exception for the same version
number when using

Document.xmlVersion

.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### void setXmlVersion​(
String
xmlVersion)
throws
DOMException

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, the version number of this document. If there is no declaration and if
this document supports the "XML" feature, the value is

"1.0"

. If this document does not support the "XML"
feature, the value is always

null

. Changing this
attribute will affect methods that check for invalid characters in
XML names. Application should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

in order to check for
invalid characters in the

Node

s that are already part of
this

Document

.

DOM applications may use the

DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version)

method
with parameter values "XMLVersion" and "1.0" (respectively) to
determine if an implementation supports [

XML 1.0

]. DOM
applications may use the same method with parameter values
"XMLVersion" and "1.1" (respectively) to determine if an
implementation supports [

XML 1.1

]. In both
cases, in order to support XML, an implementation must also support
the "XML" feature defined in this specification.

Document

objects supporting a version of the "XMLVersion" feature must not
raise a

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR

exception for the same version
number when using

Document.xmlVersion

.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the version is set to a value that is
not supported by this

Document

or if this document
does not support the "XML" feature.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### boolean getStrictErrorChecking()

An attribute specifying whether error checking is enforced or not. When
set to

false

, the implementation is free to not test
every possible error case normally defined on DOM operations, and not
raise any

DOMException

on DOM operations or report
errors while using

Document.normalizeDocument()

. In case
of error, the behavior is undefined. This attribute is

true

by default.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### void setStrictErrorChecking​(boolean strictErrorChecking)

An attribute specifying whether error checking is enforced or not. When
set to

false

, the implementation is free to not test
every possible error case normally defined on DOM operations, and not
raise any

DOMException

on DOM operations or report
errors while using

Document.normalizeDocument()

. In case
of error, the behavior is undefined. This attribute is

true

by default.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### String
getDocumentURI()

The location of the document or

null

if undefined or if
the

Document

was created using

DOMImplementation.createDocument

. No lexical checking is
performed when setting this attribute; this could result in a

null

value returned when using

Node.baseURI

.

Beware that when the

Document

supports the feature
"HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, the href attribute of the HTML BASE element takes precedence over
this attribute when computing

Node.baseURI

.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### void setDocumentURI​(
String
documentURI)

The location of the document or

null

if undefined or if
the

Document

was created using

DOMImplementation.createDocument

. No lexical checking is
performed when setting this attribute; this could result in a

null

value returned when using

Node.baseURI

.

Beware that when the

Document

supports the feature
"HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, the href attribute of the HTML BASE element takes precedence over
this attribute when computing

Node.baseURI

.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### Node
adoptNode​(
Node
source)
throws
DOMException

Attempts to adopt a node from another document to this document. If
supported, it changes the

ownerDocument

of the source
node, its children, as well as the attached attribute nodes if there
are any. If the source node has a parent it is first removed from the
child list of its parent. This effectively allows moving a subtree
from one document to another (unlike

importNode()

which
create a copy of the source node instead of moving it). When it
fails, applications should use

Document.importNode()

instead. Note that if the adopted node is already part of this
document (i.e. the source and target document are the same), this
method still has the effect of removing the source node from the
child list of its parent, if any. The following list describes the
specifics for each type of node.

**ATTRIBUTE_NODE:** The

ownerElement

attribute is set to

null

and
the

specified

flag is set to

true

on the
adopted

Attr

. The descendants of the source

Attr

are recursively adopted.
**DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE:** The
descendants of the source node are recursively adopted.
**DOCUMENT_NODE:** Document

nodes cannot be adopted.
**DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE:** DocumentType

nodes cannot be adopted.
**ELEMENT_NODE:** Specified

attribute nodes of the source element are adopted. Default attributes
are discarded, though if the document being adopted into defines
default attributes for this element name, those are assigned. The
descendants of the source element are recursively adopted.
**ENTITY_NODE:** Entity

nodes cannot be adopted.
**ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE:** Only
the

EntityReference

node itself is adopted, the
descendants are discarded, since the source and destination documents
might have defined the entity differently. If the document being
imported into provides a definition for this entity name, its value
is assigned.
**NOTATION_NODE:** Notation

nodes cannot be
adopted.
**PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE, TEXT_NODE, CDATA_SECTION_NODE,
COMMENT_NODE:** These nodes can all be adopted. No specifics.

Note:

Since it does not create new nodes unlike the

Document.importNode()

method, this method does not raise
an

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR

exception, and applications
should use the

Document.normalizeDocument()

method to
check if an imported name is not an XML name according to the XML
version in use.

**ATTRIBUTE_NODE:**
- The

ownerElement

attribute is set to

null

and
the

specified

flag is set to

true

on the
adopted

Attr

. The descendants of the source

Attr

are recursively adopted.

**DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE:**
- The
descendants of the source node are recursively adopted.

**DOCUMENT_NODE:**
- Document

nodes cannot be adopted.

**DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE:**
- DocumentType

nodes cannot be adopted.

**ELEMENT_NODE:**
- Specified

attribute nodes of the source element are adopted. Default attributes
are discarded, though if the document being adopted into defines
default attributes for this element name, those are assigned. The
descendants of the source element are recursively adopted.

**ENTITY_NODE:**
- Entity

nodes cannot be adopted.

**ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE:**
- Only
the

EntityReference

node itself is adopted, the
descendants are discarded, since the source and destination documents
might have defined the entity differently. If the document being
imported into provides a definition for this entity name, its value
is assigned.

**NOTATION_NODE:**
- Notation

nodes cannot be
adopted.

**PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE, TEXT_NODE, CDATA_SECTION_NODE,
COMMENT_NODE:**
- These nodes can all be adopted. No specifics.

#### DOMConfiguration
getDomConfig()

The configuration used when

Document.normalizeDocument()

is invoked.

**Since:**
- 1.5, DOM Level 3

---

#### void normalizeDocument()

This method acts as if the document was going through a save and load
cycle, putting the document in a "normal" form. As a consequence,
this method updates the replacement tree of

EntityReference

nodes and normalizes

Text

nodes, as defined in the method

Node.normalize()

.

Otherwise, the actual result depends on the features being set on
the

Document.domConfig

object and governing what
operations actually take place. Noticeably this method could also
make the document namespace well-formed according to the algorithm
described in , check the character normalization, remove the

CDATASection

nodes, etc. See

DOMConfiguration

for details.

```java
// Keep in the document
the information defined // in the XML Information Set (Java example)
DOMConfiguration docConfig = myDocument.getDomConfig();
docConfig.setParameter("infoset", Boolean.TRUE);
myDocument.normalizeDocument();
```

Mutation events, when supported, are generated to reflect the
changes occurring on the document.

If errors occur during the invocation of this method, such as an
attempt to update a read-only node or a

Node.nodeName

contains an invalid character according to the XML version in use,
errors or warnings (

DOMError.SEVERITY_ERROR

or

DOMError.SEVERITY_WARNING

) will be reported using the

DOMErrorHandler

object associated with the "error-handler
" parameter. Note this method might also report fatal errors (

DOMError.SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR

) if an implementation
cannot recover from an error.

#### Node
renameNode​(
Node
n,

String
namespaceURI,

String
qualifiedName)
throws
DOMException

Rename an existing node of type

ELEMENT_NODE

or

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

.

When possible this simply changes the name of the given node,
otherwise this creates a new node with the specified name and
replaces the existing node with the new node as described below.

If simply changing the name of the given node is not possible, the
following operations are performed: a new node is created, any
registered event listener is registered on the new node, any user
data attached to the old node is removed from that node, the old node
is removed from its parent if it has one, the children are moved to
the new node, if the renamed node is an

Element

its
attributes are moved to the new node, the new node is inserted at the
position the old node used to have in its parent's child nodes list
if it has one, the user data that was attached to the old node is
attached to the new node.

When the node being renamed is an

Element

only the
specified attributes are moved, default attributes originated from
the DTD are updated according to the new element name. In addition,
the implementation may update default attributes from other schemas.
Applications should use

Document.normalizeDocument()

to
guarantee these attributes are up-to-date.

When the node being renamed is an

Attr

that is
attached to an

Element

, the node is first removed from
the

Element

attributes map. Then, once renamed, either
by modifying the existing node or creating a new one as described
above, it is put back.

In addition,

- a user data event

NODE_RENAMED

is fired,
- when the implementation supports the feature "MutationNameEvents",
each mutation operation involved in this method fires the appropriate
event, and in the end the event {

http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events

,

DOMElementNameChanged

} or {

http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events

,

DOMAttributeNameChanged

} is fired.

**Parameters:**
- n

- The node to rename.
- namespaceURI

- The new namespace URI.
- qualifiedName

- The new qualified name.

**Returns:**
- The renamed node. This is either the specified node or the new
node that was created to replace the specified node.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised when the type of the specified node is
neither

ELEMENT_NODE

nor

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

,
or if the implementation does not support the renaming of the
document element.

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the new qualified name is not an
XML name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised when the specified node was created
from a different document than this document.

NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the

qualifiedName

is a
malformed qualified name, if the

qualifiedName

has a
prefix and the

namespaceURI

is

null

, or
if the

qualifiedName

has a prefix that is "xml" and
the

namespaceURI

is different from "

http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace

" [

XML Namespaces

]
. Also raised, when the node being renamed is an attribute, if the

qualifiedName

, or its prefix, is "xmlns" and the

namespaceURI

is different from "

http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/

".

#### Methods declared in interface org.w3c.dom. Node

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getDoctype

```java
DocumentType
getDoctype()
```

The Document Type Declaration (see

DocumentType

)
associated with this document. For XML documents without a document
type declaration this returns

null

. For HTML documents,
a

DocumentType

object may be returned, independently of
the presence or absence of document type declaration in the HTML
document.

This provides direct access to the

DocumentType

node,
child node of this

Document

. This node can be set at
document creation time and later changed through the use of child
nodes manipulation methods, such as

Node.insertBefore

,
or

Node.replaceChild

. Note, however, that while some
implementations may instantiate different types of

Document

objects supporting additional features than the
"Core", such as "HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, based on the

DocumentType

specified at creation time,
changing it afterwards is very unlikely to result in a change of the
features supported.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 3

- getImplementation

```java
DOMImplementation
getImplementation()
```

The

DOMImplementation

object that handles this document. A
DOM application may use objects from multiple implementations.

- getDocumentElement

```java
Element
getDocumentElement()
```

This is a convenience attribute that allows direct access to the child
node that is the document element of the document.

- createElement

```java
Element
createElement​(
String
tagName)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates an element of the type specified. Note that the instance
returned implements the

Element

interface, so attributes
can be specified directly on the returned object.

In addition, if there are known attributes with default values,

Attr

nodes representing them are automatically created
and attached to the element.

To create an element with a qualified name and namespace URI, use
the

createElementNS

method.

**Parameters:** tagName

- The name of the element type to instantiate. For XML,
this is case-sensitive, otherwise it depends on the
case-sensitivity of the markup language in use. In that case, the
name is mapped to the canonical form of that markup by the DOM
implementation.
**Returns:** A new

Element

object with the

nodeName

attribute set to

tagName

, and

localName

,

prefix

, and

namespaceURI

set to

null

.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

- createDocumentFragment

```java
DocumentFragment
createDocumentFragment()
```

Creates an empty

DocumentFragment

object.

**Returns:** A new

DocumentFragment

.

- createTextNode

```java
Text
createTextNode​(
String
data)
```

Creates a

Text

node given the specified string.

**Parameters:** data

- The data for the node.
**Returns:** The new

Text

object.

- createComment

```java
Comment
createComment​(
String
data)
```

Creates a

Comment

node given the specified string.

**Parameters:** data

- The data for the node.
**Returns:** The new

Comment

object.

- createCDATASection

```java
CDATASection
createCDATASection​(
String
data)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates a

CDATASection

node whose value is the specified
string.

**Parameters:** data

- The data for the

CDATASection

contents.
**Returns:** The new

CDATASection

object.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

- createProcessingInstruction

```java
ProcessingInstruction
createProcessingInstruction​(
String
target,

String
data)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates a

ProcessingInstruction

node given the specified
name and data strings.

**Parameters:** target

- The target part of the processing instruction.Unlike

Document.createElementNS

or

Document.createAttributeNS

, no namespace well-formed
checking is done on the target name. Applications should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the parameter "
namespaces" set to

true

in order to ensure that the
target name is namespace well-formed.
**Parameters:** data

- The data for the node.
**Returns:** The new

ProcessingInstruction

object.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified target is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

- createAttribute

```java
Attr
createAttribute​(
String
name)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates an

Attr

of the given name. Note that the

Attr

instance can then be set on an

Element

using the

setAttributeNode

method.

To create an attribute with a qualified name and namespace URI, use
the

createAttributeNS

method.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the attribute.
**Returns:** A new

Attr

object with the

nodeName

attribute set to

name

, and

localName

,

prefix

, and

namespaceURI

set to

null

. The value of the attribute is the empty string.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

- createEntityReference

```java
EntityReference
createEntityReference​(
String
name)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates an

EntityReference

object. In addition, if the
referenced entity is known, the child list of the

EntityReference

node is made the same as that of the
corresponding

Entity

node.

Note:

If any descendant of the

Entity

node has
an unbound namespace prefix, the corresponding descendant of the
created

EntityReference

node is also unbound; (its

namespaceURI

is

null

). The DOM Level 2 and
3 do not support any mechanism to resolve namespace prefixes in this
case.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the entity to reference.Unlike

Document.createElementNS

or

Document.createAttributeNS

, no namespace well-formed
checking is done on the entity name. Applications should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the parameter "
namespaces" set to

true

in order to ensure that the
entity name is namespace well-formed.
**Returns:** The new

EntityReference

object.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

- getElementsByTagName

```java
NodeList
getElementsByTagName​(
String
tagname)
```

Returns a

NodeList

of all the

Elements

in
document order with a given tag name and are contained in the
document.

**Parameters:** tagname

- The name of the tag to match on. The special value "*"
matches all tags. For XML, the

tagname

parameter is
case-sensitive, otherwise it depends on the case-sensitivity of the
markup language in use.
**Returns:** A new

NodeList

object containing all the matched

Elements

.

- importNode

```java
Node
importNode​(
Node
importedNode,
boolean deep)
throws
DOMException
```

Imports a node from another document to this document, without altering
or removing the source node from the original document; this method
creates a new copy of the source node. The returned node has no
parent; (

parentNode

is

null

).

For all nodes, importing a node creates a node object owned by the
importing document, with attribute values identical to the source
node's

nodeName

and

nodeType

, plus the
attributes related to namespaces (

prefix

,

localName

, and

namespaceURI

). As in the

cloneNode

operation, the source node is not altered.
User data associated to the imported node is not carried over.
However, if any

UserDataHandlers

has been specified
along with the associated data these handlers will be called with the
appropriate parameters before this method returns.

Additional information is copied as appropriate to the

nodeType

, attempting to mirror the behavior expected if
a fragment of XML or HTML source was copied from one document to
another, recognizing that the two documents may have different DTDs
in the XML case. The following list describes the specifics for each
type of node.

**ATTRIBUTE_NODE:** The

ownerElement

attribute
is set to

null

and the

specified

flag is
set to

true

on the generated

Attr

. The
descendants of the source

Attr

are recursively imported
and the resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect on

Attr

nodes; they always carry their children with them
when imported.
**DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE:** If the

deep

option
was set to

true

, the descendants of the source

DocumentFragment

are recursively imported and the
resulting nodes reassembled under the imported

DocumentFragment

to form the corresponding subtree.
Otherwise, this simply generates an empty

DocumentFragment

.
**DOCUMENT_NODE:** Document

nodes cannot be imported.
**DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE:** DocumentType

nodes cannot be imported.
**ELEMENT_NODE:** Specified

attribute nodes of the source element are imported, and the generated

Attr

nodes are attached to the generated

Element

. Default attributes are

not

copied, though if the document being imported into defines default
attributes for this element name, those are assigned. If the

importNode

deep

parameter was set to

true

, the descendants of the source element are
recursively imported and the resulting nodes reassembled to form the
corresponding subtree.
**ENTITY_NODE:** Entity

nodes can be
imported, however in the current release of the DOM the

DocumentType

is readonly. Ability to add these imported
nodes to a

DocumentType

will be considered for addition
to a future release of the DOM.On import, the

publicId

,

systemId

, and

notationName

attributes are
copied. If a

deep

import is requested, the descendants
of the the source

Entity

are recursively imported and
the resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
**ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE:** Only the

EntityReference

itself is
copied, even if a

deep

import is requested, since the
source and destination documents might have defined the entity
differently. If the document being imported into provides a
definition for this entity name, its value is assigned.
**NOTATION_NODE:** Notation

nodes can be imported, however in the current
release of the DOM the

DocumentType

is readonly. Ability
to add these imported nodes to a

DocumentType

will be
considered for addition to a future release of the DOM.On import, the

publicId

and

systemId

attributes are copied.
Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect on this type
of nodes since they cannot have any children.
**PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE:** The imported node copies its

target

and

data

values from those of the
source node.Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect
on this type of nodes since they cannot have any children.
**TEXT_NODE,
CDATA_SECTION_NODE, COMMENT_NODE:** These three types of nodes inheriting
from

CharacterData

copy their

data

and

length

attributes from those of the source node.Note
that the

deep

parameter has no effect on these types of
nodes since they cannot have any children.

**Parameters:** importedNode

- The node to import.
**Parameters:** deep

- If

true

, recursively import the subtree under
the specified node; if

false

, import only the node
itself, as explained above. This has no effect on nodes that cannot
have any children, and on

Attr

, and

EntityReference

nodes.
**Returns:** The imported node that belongs to this

Document

.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the type of node being imported is not
supported.

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if one of the imported names is not
an XML name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute. This may happen when
importing an XML 1.1 [

XML 1.1

] element
into an XML 1.0 document, for instance.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- createElementNS

```java
Element
createElementNS​(
String
namespaceURI,

String
qualifiedName)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates an element of the given qualified name and namespace URI.

Per [

XML Namespaces

NodeList
getElementsByTagNameNS​(
String
namespaceURI,

String
localName)
```

Returns a

NodeList

of all the

Elements

with a
given local name and namespace URI in document order.

**Parameters:** namespaceURI

- The namespace URI of the elements to match on. The
special value

"*"

matches all namespaces.
**Parameters:** localName

- The local name of the elements to match on. The
special value "*" matches all local names.
**Returns:** A new

NodeList

object containing all the matched

Elements

.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getElementById

```java
Element
getElementById​(
String
elementId)
```

Returns the

Element

that has an ID attribute with the
given value. If no such element exists, this returns

null

. If more than one element has an ID attribute with that value, what
is returned is undefined.

The DOM implementation is expected to use the attribute

Attr.isId

to determine if an attribute is of type ID.

Note:

Attributes with the name "ID" or "id" are not of type
ID unless so defined.

**Parameters:** elementId

- The unique

id

value for an element.
**Returns:** The matching element or

null

if there is none.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getInputEncoding

```java
String
getInputEncoding()
```

An attribute specifying the encoding used for this document at the time
of the parsing. This is

null

when it is not known, such
as when the

Document

was created in memory.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getXmlEncoding

```java
String
getXmlEncoding()
```

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, the encoding of this document. This is

null

when
unspecified or when it is not known, such as when the

Document

was created in memory.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getXmlStandalone

```java
boolean getXmlStandalone()
```

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, whether this document is standalone. This is

false

when
unspecified.

Note:

No verification is done on the value when setting
this attribute. Applications should use

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the "validate"
parameter to verify if the value matches the

validity
constraint for standalone document declaration

as defined in [

XML 1.0

].

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- setXmlStandalone

```java
void setXmlStandalone​(boolean xmlStandalone)
throws
DOMException
```

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, whether this document is standalone. This is

false

when
unspecified.

Note:

No verification is done on the value when setting
this attribute. Applications should use

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the "validate"
parameter to verify if the value matches the

validity
constraint for standalone document declaration

as defined in [

XML 1.0

].

**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document does not support the
"XML" feature.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getXmlVersion

```java
String
getXmlVersion()
```

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, the version number of this document. If there is no declaration and if
this document supports the "XML" feature, the value is

"1.0"

. If this document does not support the "XML"
feature, the value is always

null

. Changing this
attribute will affect methods that check for invalid characters in
XML names. Application should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

in order to check for
invalid characters in the

Node

s that are already part of
this

Document

.

DOM applications may use the

DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version)

method
with parameter values "XMLVersion" and "1.0" (respectively) to
determine if an implementation supports [

XML 1.0

]. DOM
applications may use the same method with parameter values
"XMLVersion" and "1.1" (respectively) to determine if an
implementation supports [

XML 1.1

]. In both
cases, in order to support XML, an implementation must also support
the "XML" feature defined in this specification.

Document

objects supporting a version of the "XMLVersion" feature must not
raise a

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR

exception for the same version
number when using

Document.xmlVersion

.

- setXmlVersion

```java
void setXmlVersion​(
String
xmlVersion)
throws
DOMException
```

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, the version number of this document. If there is no declaration and if
this document supports the "XML" feature, the value is

"1.0"

. If this document does not support the "XML"
feature, the value is always

null

. Changing this
attribute will affect methods that check for invalid characters in
XML names. Application should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

in order to check for
invalid characters in the

Node

s that are already part of
this

Document

.

DOM applications may use the

DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version)

method
with parameter values "XMLVersion" and "1.0" (respectively) to
determine if an implementation supports [

XML 1.0

]. DOM
applications may use the same method with parameter values
"XMLVersion" and "1.1" (respectively) to determine if an
implementation supports [

XML 1.1

]. In both
cases, in order to support XML, an implementation must also support
the "XML" feature defined in this specification.

Document

objects supporting a version of the "XMLVersion" feature must not
raise a

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR

exception for the same version
number when using

Document.xmlVersion

.

**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the version is set to a value that is
not supported by this

Document

or if this document
does not support the "XML" feature.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getStrictErrorChecking

```java
boolean getStrictErrorChecking()
```

An attribute specifying whether error checking is enforced or not. When
set to

false

, the implementation is free to not test
every possible error case normally defined on DOM operations, and not
raise any

DOMException

on DOM operations or report
errors while using

Document.normalizeDocument()

. In case
of error, the behavior is undefined. This attribute is

true

by default.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- setStrictErrorChecking

```java
void setStrictErrorChecking​(boolean strictErrorChecking)
```

An attribute specifying whether error checking is enforced or not. When
set to

false

, the implementation is free to not test
every possible error case normally defined on DOM operations, and not
raise any

DOMException

on DOM operations or report
errors while using

Document.normalizeDocument()

. In case
of error, the behavior is undefined. This attribute is

true

by default.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getDocumentURI

```java
String
getDocumentURI()
```

The location of the document or

null

if undefined or if
the

Document

was created using

DOMImplementation.createDocument

. No lexical checking is
performed when setting this attribute; this could result in a

null

value returned when using

Node.baseURI

.

Beware that when the

Document

supports the feature
"HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, the href attribute of the HTML BASE element takes precedence over
this attribute when computing

Node.baseURI

.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- setDocumentURI

```java
void setDocumentURI​(
String
documentURI)
```

The location of the document or

null

if undefined or if
the

Document

was created using

DOMImplementation.createDocument

. No lexical checking is
performed when setting this attribute; this could result in a

null

value returned when using

Node.baseURI

.

Beware that when the

Document

supports the feature
"HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, the href attribute of the HTML BASE element takes precedence over
this attribute when computing

Node.baseURI

.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- adoptNode

```java
Node
adoptNode​(
Node
source)
throws
DOMException
```

Attempts to adopt a node from another document to this document. If
supported, it changes the

ownerDocument

of the source
node, its children, as well as the attached attribute nodes if there
are any. If the source node has a parent it is first removed from the
child list of its parent. This effectively allows moving a subtree
from one document to another (unlike

importNode()

which
create a copy of the source node instead of moving it). When it
fails, applications should use

Document.importNode()

instead. Note that if the adopted node is already part of this
document (i.e. the source and target document are the same), this
method still has the effect of removing the source node from the
child list of its parent, if any. The following list describes the
specifics for each type of node.

**ATTRIBUTE_NODE:** The

ownerElement

attribute is set to

null

and
the

specified

flag is set to

true

on the
adopted

Attr

. The descendants of the source

Attr

are recursively adopted.
**DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE:** The
descendants of the source node are recursively adopted.
**DOCUMENT_NODE:** Document

nodes cannot be adopted.
**DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE:** DocumentType

nodes cannot be adopted.
**ELEMENT_NODE:** Specified

attribute nodes of the source element are adopted. Default attributes
are discarded, though if the document being adopted into defines
default attributes for this element name, those are assigned. The
descendants of the source element are recursively adopted.
**ENTITY_NODE:** Entity

nodes cannot be adopted.
**ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE:** Only
the

EntityReference

node itself is adopted, the
descendants are discarded, since the source and destination documents
might have defined the entity differently. If the document being
imported into provides a definition for this entity name, its value
is assigned.
**NOTATION_NODE:** Notation

nodes cannot be
adopted.
**PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE, TEXT_NODE, CDATA_SECTION_NODE,
COMMENT_NODE:** These nodes can all be adopted. No specifics.

Note:

Since it does not create new nodes unlike the

Document.importNode()

method, this method does not raise
an

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR

exception, and applications
should use the

Document.normalizeDocument()

method to
check if an imported name is not an XML name according to the XML
version in use.

**Parameters:** source

- The node to move into this document.
**Returns:** The adopted node, or

null

if this operation
fails, such as when the source node comes from a different
implementation.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the source node is of type

DOCUMENT

,

DOCUMENT_TYPE

.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised when the source node is
readonly.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getDomConfig

```java
DOMConfiguration
getDomConfig()
```

The configuration used when

Document.normalizeDocument()

is invoked.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- normalizeDocument

```java
void normalizeDocument()
```

This method acts as if the document was going through a save and load
cycle, putting the document in a "normal" form. As a consequence,
this method updates the replacement tree of

EntityReference

nodes and normalizes

Text

nodes, as defined in the method

Node.normalize()

.

Otherwise, the actual result depends on the features being set on
the

Document.domConfig

object and governing what
operations actually take place. Noticeably this method could also
make the document namespace well-formed according to the algorithm
described in , check the character normalization, remove the

CDATASection

nodes, etc. See

DOMConfiguration

for details.

```java
// Keep in the document
the information defined // in the XML Information Set (Java example)
DOMConfiguration docConfig = myDocument.getDomConfig();
docConfig.setParameter("infoset", Boolean.TRUE);
myDocument.normalizeDocument();
```

Mutation events, when supported, are generated to reflect the
changes occurring on the document.

If errors occur during the invocation of this method, such as an
attempt to update a read-only node or a

Node.nodeName

contains an invalid character according to the XML version in use,
errors or warnings (

DOMError.SEVERITY_ERROR

or

DOMError.SEVERITY_WARNING

) will be reported using the

DOMErrorHandler

object associated with the "error-handler
" parameter. Note this method might also report fatal errors (

DOMError.SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR

) if an implementation
cannot recover from an error.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- renameNode

```java
Node
renameNode​(
Node
n,

String
namespaceURI,

String
qualifiedName)
throws
DOMException
```

Rename an existing node of type

ELEMENT_NODE

or

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

.

When possible this simply changes the name of the given node,
otherwise this creates a new node with the specified name and
replaces the existing node with the new node as described below.

If simply changing the name of the given node is not possible, the
following operations are performed: a new node is created, any
registered event listener is registered on the new node, any user
data attached to the old node is removed from that node, the old node
is removed from its parent if it has one, the children are moved to
the new node, if the renamed node is an

Element

its
attributes are moved to the new node, the new node is inserted at the
position the old node used to have in its parent's child nodes list
if it has one, the user data that was attached to the old node is
attached to the new node.

When the node being renamed is an

Element

only the
specified attributes are moved, default attributes originated from
the DTD are updated according to the new element name. In addition,
the implementation may update default attributes from other schemas.
Applications should use

Document.normalizeDocument()

to
guarantee these attributes are up-to-date.

When the node being renamed is an

Attr

that is
attached to an

Element

, the node is first removed from
the

Element

attributes map. Then, once renamed, either
by modifying the existing node or creating a new one as described
above, it is put back.

In addition,

- a user data event

NODE_RENAMED

is fired,
- when the implementation supports the feature "MutationNameEvents",
each mutation operation involved in this method fires the appropriate
event, and in the end the event {

http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events

,

DOMElementNameChanged

} or {

http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events

,

DOMAttributeNameChanged

} is fired.

**Parameters:** n

- The node to rename.
**Parameters:** namespaceURI

- The new namespace URI.
**Parameters:** qualifiedName

- The new qualified name.
**Returns:** The renamed node. This is either the specified node or the new
node that was created to replace the specified node.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised when the type of the specified node is
neither

ELEMENT_NODE

nor

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

,
or if the implementation does not support the renaming of the
document element.

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the new qualified name is not an
XML name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised when the specified node was created
from a different document than this document.

NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the

qualifiedName

is a
malformed qualified name, if the

qualifiedName

has a
prefix and the

namespaceURI

is

null

, or
if the

qualifiedName

has a prefix that is "xml" and
the

namespaceURI

is different from "

http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace

" [

XML Namespaces

]
. Also raised, when the node being renamed is an attribute, if the

qualifiedName

, or its prefix, is "xmlns" and the

namespaceURI

is different from "

http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/

".
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

Method Detail

- getDoctype

```java
DocumentType
getDoctype()
```

The Document Type Declaration (see

DocumentType

)
associated with this document. For XML documents without a document
type declaration this returns

null

. For HTML documents,
a

DocumentType

object may be returned, independently of
the presence or absence of document type declaration in the HTML
document.

This provides direct access to the

DocumentType

node,
child node of this

Document

. This node can be set at
document creation time and later changed through the use of child
nodes manipulation methods, such as

Node.insertBefore

,
or

Node.replaceChild

. Note, however, that while some
implementations may instantiate different types of

Document

objects supporting additional features than the
"Core", such as "HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, based on the

DocumentType

specified at creation time,
changing it afterwards is very unlikely to result in a change of the
features supported.

**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 3

- getImplementation

```java
DOMImplementation
getImplementation()
```

The

DOMImplementation

object that handles this document. A
DOM application may use objects from multiple implementations.

- getDocumentElement

```java
Element
getDocumentElement()
```

This is a convenience attribute that allows direct access to the child
node that is the document element of the document.

- createElement

```java
Element
createElement​(
String
tagName)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates an element of the type specified. Note that the instance
returned implements the

Element

interface, so attributes
can be specified directly on the returned object.

In addition, if there are known attributes with default values,

Attr

nodes representing them are automatically created
and attached to the element.

To create an element with a qualified name and namespace URI, use
the

createElementNS

method.

**Parameters:** tagName

- The name of the element type to instantiate. For XML,
this is case-sensitive, otherwise it depends on the
case-sensitivity of the markup language in use. In that case, the
name is mapped to the canonical form of that markup by the DOM
implementation.
**Returns:** A new

Element

object with the

nodeName

attribute set to

tagName

, and

localName

,

prefix

, and

namespaceURI

set to

null

.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

- createDocumentFragment

```java
DocumentFragment
createDocumentFragment()
```

Creates an empty

DocumentFragment

object.

**Returns:** A new

DocumentFragment

.

- createTextNode

```java
Text
createTextNode​(
String
data)
```

Creates a

Text

node given the specified string.

**Parameters:** data

- The data for the node.
**Returns:** The new

Text

object.

- createComment

Comment

object.

- createCDATASection

```java
CDATASection
createCDATASection​(
String
data)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates a

CDATASection

node whose value is the specified
string.

**Parameters:** data

- The data for the

CDATASection

contents.
**Returns:** The new

CDATASection

object.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

- createProcessingInstruction

```java
ProcessingInstruction
createProcessingInstruction​(
String
target,

String
data)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates a

ProcessingInstruction

node given the specified
name and data strings.

**Parameters:** target

- The target part of the processing instruction.Unlike

Document.createElementNS

or

Document.createAttributeNS

, no namespace well-formed
checking is done on the target name. Applications should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the parameter "
namespaces" set to

true

in order to ensure that the
target name is namespace well-formed.
**Parameters:** data

- The data for the node.
**Returns:** The new

ProcessingInstruction

object.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified target is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

- createAttribute

```java
Attr
createAttribute​(
String
name)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates an

Attr

of the given name. Note that the

Attr

instance can then be set on an

Element

using the

setAttributeNode

method.

To create an attribute with a qualified name and namespace URI, use
the

createAttributeNS

method.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the attribute.
**Returns:** A new

Attr

object with the

nodeName

attribute set to

name

, and

localName

,

prefix

, and

namespaceURI

set to

null

. The value of the attribute is the empty string.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

- createEntityReference

```java
EntityReference
createEntityReference​(
String
name)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates an

EntityReference

object. In addition, if the
referenced entity is known, the child list of the

EntityReference

node is made the same as that of the
corresponding

Entity

node.

Note:

If any descendant of the

Entity

node has
an unbound namespace prefix, the corresponding descendant of the
created

EntityReference

node is also unbound; (its

namespaceURI

is

null

). The DOM Level 2 and
3 do not support any mechanism to resolve namespace prefixes in this
case.

**Parameters:** name

- The name of the entity to reference.Unlike

Document.createElementNS

or

Document.createAttributeNS

, no namespace well-formed
checking is done on the entity name. Applications should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the parameter "
namespaces" set to

true

in order to ensure that the
entity name is namespace well-formed.
**Returns:** The new

EntityReference

object.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name is not an XML
name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

- getElementsByTagName

NodeList
getElementsByTagName​(
String
tagname)
```

Returns a

NodeList

of all the

Elements

in
document order with a given tag name and are contained in the
document.

**Parameters:** tagname

- The name of the tag to match on. The special value "*"
matches all tags. For XML, the

tagname

parameter is
case-sensitive, otherwise it depends on the case-sensitivity of the
markup language in use.
**Returns:** A new

NodeList

object containing all the matched

Elements

.

- importNode

```java
Node
importNode​(
Node
importedNode,
boolean deep)
throws
DOMException
```

Imports a node from another document to this document, without altering
or removing the source node from the original document; this method
creates a new copy of the source node. The returned node has no
parent; (

parentNode

is

null

).

For all nodes, importing a node creates a node object owned by the
importing document, with attribute values identical to the source
node's

nodeName

and

nodeType

, plus the
attributes related to namespaces (

prefix

,

localName

, and

namespaceURI

). As in the

cloneNode

operation, the source node is not altered.
User data associated to the imported node is not carried over.
However, if any

UserDataHandlers

has been specified
along with the associated data these handlers will be called with the
appropriate parameters before this method returns.

Additional information is copied as appropriate to the

nodeType

, attempting to mirror the behavior expected if
a fragment of XML or HTML source was copied from one document to
another, recognizing that the two documents may have different DTDs
in the XML case. The following list describes the specifics for each
type of node.

**ATTRIBUTE_NODE:** The

ownerElement

attribute
is set to

null

and the

specified

flag is
set to

true

on the generated

Attr

. The
descendants of the source

Attr

are recursively imported
and the resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect on

Attr

nodes; they always carry their children with them
when imported.
**DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE:** If the

deep

option
was set to

true

, the descendants of the source

DocumentFragment

are recursively imported and the
resulting nodes reassembled under the imported

DocumentFragment

to form the corresponding subtree.
Otherwise, this simply generates an empty

DocumentFragment

.
**DOCUMENT_NODE:** Document

nodes cannot be imported.
**DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE:** DocumentType

nodes cannot be imported.
**ELEMENT_NODE:** Specified

attribute nodes of the source element are imported, and the generated

Attr

nodes are attached to the generated

Element

. Default attributes are

not

copied, though if the document being imported into defines default
attributes for this element name, those are assigned. If the

importNode

deep

parameter was set to

true

, the descendants of the source element are
recursively imported and the resulting nodes reassembled to form the
corresponding subtree.
**ENTITY_NODE:** Entity

nodes can be
imported, however in the current release of the DOM the

DocumentType

is readonly. Ability to add these imported
nodes to a

DocumentType

will be considered for addition
to a future release of the DOM.On import, the

publicId

,

systemId

, and

notationName

attributes are
copied. If a

deep

import is requested, the descendants
of the the source

Entity

are recursively imported and
the resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
**ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE:** Only the

EntityReference

itself is
copied, even if a

deep

import is requested, since the
source and destination documents might have defined the entity
differently. If the document being imported into provides a
definition for this entity name, its value is assigned.
**NOTATION_NODE:** Notation

nodes can be imported, however in the current
release of the DOM the

DocumentType

is readonly. Ability
to add these imported nodes to a

DocumentType

will be
considered for addition to a future release of the DOM.On import, the

publicId

and

systemId

attributes are copied.
Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect on this type
of nodes since they cannot have any children.
**PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE:** The imported node copies its

target

and

data

values from those of the
source node.Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect
on this type of nodes since they cannot have any children.
**TEXT_NODE,
CDATA_SECTION_NODE, COMMENT_NODE:** These three types of nodes inheriting
from

CharacterData

copy their

data

and

length

attributes from those of the source node.Note
that the

deep

parameter has no effect on these types of
nodes since they cannot have any children.

**Parameters:** importedNode

- The node to import.
**Parameters:** deep

- If

true

, recursively import the subtree under
the specified node; if

false

, import only the node
itself, as explained above. This has no effect on nodes that cannot
have any children, and on

Attr

, and

EntityReference

nodes.
**Returns:** The imported node that belongs to this

Document

.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the type of node being imported is not
supported.

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if one of the imported names is not
an XML name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute. This may happen when
importing an XML 1.1 [

XML 1.1

] element
into an XML 1.0 document, for instance.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- createElementNS

```java
Element
createElementNS​(
String
namespaceURI,

String
qualifiedName)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates an element of the given qualified name and namespace URI.

Per [

XML Namespaces

String
namespaceURI,

String
localName)
```

Returns a

NodeList

of all the

Elements

with a
given local name and namespace URI in document order.

**Parameters:** namespaceURI

- The namespace URI of the elements to match on. The
special value

"*"

matches all namespaces.

.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getElementById

```java
Element
getElementById​(
String
elementId)
```

Returns the

Element

that has an ID attribute with the
given value. If no such element exists, this returns

null

. If more than one element has an ID attribute with that value, what
is returned is undefined.

The DOM implementation is expected to use the attribute

Attr.isId

to determine if an attribute is of type ID.

Note:

Attributes with the name "ID" or "id" are not of type
ID unless so defined.

**Parameters:** elementId

- The unique

id

value for an element.
**Returns:** The matching element or

null

if there is none.
**Since:** 1.4, DOM Level 2

- getInputEncoding

```java
String
getInputEncoding()
```

An attribute specifying the encoding used for this document at the time
of the parsing. This is

null

when it is not known, such
as when the

Document

was created in memory.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getXmlEncoding

```java
String
getXmlEncoding()
```

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, the encoding of this document. This is

null

when
unspecified or when it is not known, such as when the

Document

was created in memory.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getXmlStandalone

```java
boolean getXmlStandalone()
```

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, whether this document is standalone. This is

false

when
unspecified.

Note:

No verification is done on the value when setting
this attribute. Applications should use

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the "validate"
parameter to verify if the value matches the

validity
constraint for standalone document declaration

as defined in [

XML 1.0

].

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- setXmlStandalone

```java
void setXmlStandalone​(boolean xmlStandalone)
throws
DOMException
```

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, whether this document is standalone. This is

false

when
unspecified.

Note:

No verification is done on the value when setting
this attribute. Applications should use

Document.normalizeDocument()

with the "validate"
parameter to verify if the value matches the

validity
constraint for standalone document declaration

as defined in [

XML 1.0

].

**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document does not support the
"XML" feature.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getXmlVersion

```java
String
getXmlVersion()
```

An attribute specifying, as part of the

XML declaration

, the version number of this document. If there is no declaration and if
this document supports the "XML" feature, the value is

"1.0"

. If this document does not support the "XML"
feature, the value is always

null

. Changing this
attribute will affect methods that check for invalid characters in
XML names. Application should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

in order to check for
invalid characters in the

Node

s that are already part of
this

Document

.

DOM applications may use the

DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version)

method
with parameter values "XMLVersion" and "1.0" (respectively) to
determine if an implementation supports [

XML 1.0

]. DOM
applications may use the same method with parameter values
"XMLVersion" and "1.1" (respectively) to determine if an
implementation supports [

XML 1.1

]. In both
cases, in order to support XML, an implementation must also support
the "XML" feature defined in this specification.

Document

objects supporting a version of the "XMLVersion" feature must not
raise a

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR

exception for the same version
number when using

Document.xmlVersion

.

- setXmlVersion

```java
void setXmlVersion​(
String
xmlVersion)
throws
DOMException
```

XML declaration

, the version number of this document. If there is no declaration and if
this document supports the "XML" feature, the value is

"1.0"

. If this document does not support the "XML"
feature, the value is always

null

. Changing this
attribute will affect methods that check for invalid characters in
XML names. Application should invoke

Document.normalizeDocument()

in order to check for
invalid characters in the

Node

s that are already part of
this

Document

.

DOM applications may use the

DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version)

method
with parameter values "XMLVersion" and "1.0" (respectively) to
determine if an implementation supports [

XML 1.0

]. DOM
applications may use the same method with parameter values
"XMLVersion" and "1.1" (respectively) to determine if an
implementation supports [

XML 1.1

]. In both
cases, in order to support XML, an implementation must also support
the "XML" feature defined in this specification.

Document

objects supporting a version of the "XMLVersion" feature must not
raise a

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR

exception for the same version
number when using

Document.xmlVersion

.

**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the version is set to a value that is
not supported by this

Document

or if this document
does not support the "XML" feature.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getStrictErrorChecking

```java
boolean getStrictErrorChecking()
```

An attribute specifying whether error checking is enforced or not. When
set to

false

, the implementation is free to not test
every possible error case normally defined on DOM operations, and not
raise any

DOMException

on DOM operations or report
errors while using

Document.normalizeDocument()

. In case
of error, the behavior is undefined. This attribute is

true

by default.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- setStrictErrorChecking

```java
void setStrictErrorChecking​(boolean strictErrorChecking)
```

An attribute specifying whether error checking is enforced or not. When
set to

false

, the implementation is free to not test
every possible error case normally defined on DOM operations, and not
raise any

DOMException

on DOM operations or report
errors while using

Document.normalizeDocument()

. In case
of error, the behavior is undefined. This attribute is

true

by default.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getDocumentURI

```java
String
getDocumentURI()
```

The location of the document or

null

if undefined or if
the

Document

was created using

DOMImplementation.createDocument

. No lexical checking is
performed when setting this attribute; this could result in a

null

value returned when using

Node.baseURI

.

Beware that when the

Document

supports the feature
"HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, the href attribute of the HTML BASE element takes precedence over
this attribute when computing

Node.baseURI

.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- setDocumentURI

```java
void setDocumentURI​(
String
documentURI)
```

The location of the document or

null

if undefined or if
the

Document

was created using

DOMImplementation.createDocument

. No lexical checking is
performed when setting this attribute; this could result in a

null

value returned when using

Node.baseURI

.

Beware that when the

Document

supports the feature
"HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, the href attribute of the HTML BASE element takes precedence over
this attribute when computing

Node.baseURI

.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- adoptNode

```java
Node
adoptNode​(
Node
source)
throws
DOMException
```

Attempts to adopt a node from another document to this document. If
supported, it changes the

ownerDocument

of the source
node, its children, as well as the attached attribute nodes if there
are any. If the source node has a parent it is first removed from the
child list of its parent. This effectively allows moving a subtree
from one document to another (unlike

importNode()

which
create a copy of the source node instead of moving it). When it
fails, applications should use

Document.importNode()

instead. Note that if the adopted node is already part of this
document (i.e. the source and target document are the same), this
method still has the effect of removing the source node from the
child list of its parent, if any. The following list describes the
specifics for each type of node.

**ATTRIBUTE_NODE:** The

ownerElement

attribute is set to

null

and
the

specified

flag is set to

true

on the
adopted

Attr

. The descendants of the source

Attr

are recursively adopted.
**DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE:** The
descendants of the source node are recursively adopted.
**DOCUMENT_NODE:** Document

nodes cannot be adopted.
**DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE:** DocumentType

nodes cannot be adopted.
**ELEMENT_NODE:** Specified

attribute nodes of the source element are adopted. Default attributes
are discarded, though if the document being adopted into defines
default attributes for this element name, those are assigned. The
descendants of the source element are recursively adopted.
**ENTITY_NODE:** Entity

nodes cannot be adopted.
**ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE:** Only
the

EntityReference

node itself is adopted, the
descendants are discarded, since the source and destination documents
might have defined the entity differently. If the document being
imported into provides a definition for this entity name, its value
is assigned.
**NOTATION_NODE:** Notation

nodes cannot be
adopted.
**PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE, TEXT_NODE, CDATA_SECTION_NODE,
COMMENT_NODE:** These nodes can all be adopted. No specifics.

Note:

Since it does not create new nodes unlike the

Document.importNode()

method, this method does not raise
an

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR

exception, and applications
should use the

Document.normalizeDocument()

method to
check if an imported name is not an XML name according to the XML
version in use.

**Parameters:** source

- The node to move into this document.
**Returns:** The adopted node, or

null

if this operation
fails, such as when the source node comes from a different
implementation.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the source node is of type

DOCUMENT

,

DOCUMENT_TYPE

.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised when the source node is
readonly.
**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- getDomConfig

```java
DOMConfiguration
getDomConfig()
```

The configuration used when

Document.normalizeDocument()

is invoked.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- normalizeDocument

```java
void normalizeDocument()
```

This method acts as if the document was going through a save and load
cycle, putting the document in a "normal" form. As a consequence,
this method updates the replacement tree of

EntityReference

nodes and normalizes

Text

nodes, as defined in the method

Node.normalize()

.

Otherwise, the actual result depends on the features being set on
the

Document.domConfig

object and governing what
operations actually take place. Noticeably this method could also
make the document namespace well-formed according to the algorithm
described in , check the character normalization, remove the

CDATASection

nodes, etc. See

DOMConfiguration

for details.

```java
// Keep in the document
the information defined // in the XML Information Set (Java example)
DOMConfiguration docConfig = myDocument.getDomConfig();
docConfig.setParameter("infoset", Boolean.TRUE);
myDocument.normalizeDocument();
```

Mutation events, when supported, are generated to reflect the
changes occurring on the document.

If errors occur during the invocation of this method, such as an
attempt to update a read-only node or a

Node.nodeName

contains an invalid character according to the XML version in use,
errors or warnings (

DOMError.SEVERITY_ERROR

or

DOMError.SEVERITY_WARNING

) will be reported using the

DOMErrorHandler

object associated with the "error-handler
" parameter. Note this method might also report fatal errors (

DOMError.SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR

) if an implementation
cannot recover from an error.

**Since:** 1.5, DOM Level 3

- renameNode

```java
Node
renameNode​(
Node
n,

String
namespaceURI,

String
qualifiedName)
throws
DOMException
```

Rename an existing node of type

ELEMENT_NODE

or

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

.

When possible this simply changes the name of the given node,
otherwise this creates a new node with the specified name and
replaces the existing node with the new node as described below.

If simply changing the name of the given node is not possible, the
following operations are performed: a new node is created, any
registered event listener is registered on the new node, any user
data attached to the old node is removed from that node, the old node
is removed from its parent if it has one, the children are moved to
the new node, if the renamed node is an

Element

its
attributes are moved to the new node, the new node is inserted at the
position the old node used to have in its parent's child nodes list
if it has one, the user data that was attached to the old node is
attached to the new node.

When the node being renamed is an

Element

only the
specified attributes are moved, default attributes originated from
the DTD are updated according to the new element name. In addition,
the implementation may update default attributes from other schemas.
Applications should use

Document.normalizeDocument()

to
guarantee these attributes are up-to-date.

When the node being renamed is an

Attr

that is
attached to an

Element

, the node is first removed from
the

Element

attributes map. Then, once renamed, either
by modifying the existing node or creating a new one as described
above, it is put back.

In addition,

- a user data event

NODE_RENAMED

is fired,
- when the implementation supports the feature "MutationNameEvents",
each mutation operation involved in this method fires the appropriate
event, and in the end the event {

http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events

,

DOMElementNameChanged

} or {

http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events

,

DOMAttributeNameChanged

} is fired.

**Parameters:** n

- The node to rename.

#### Method Detail

getDoctype

```java
DocumentType
getDoctype()
```

The Document Type Declaration (see

DocumentType

)
associated with this document. For XML documents without a document
type declaration this returns

null

. For HTML documents,
a

DocumentType

object may be returned, independently of
the presence or absence of document type declaration in the HTML
document.

This provides direct access to the

DocumentType

node,
child node of this

Document

. This node can be set at
document creation time and later changed through the use of child
nodes manipulation methods, such as

Node.insertBefore

,
or

Node.replaceChild

. Note, however, that while some
implementations may instantiate different types of

Document

objects supporting additional features than the
"Core", such as "HTML" [

DOM Level 2 HTML

]
, based on the

DocumentType

specified at creation time,
changing it afterwards is very unlikely to result in a change of the
features supported.

createElement

```java
Element
createElement​(
String
tagName)
throws
DOMException
```

Creates an element of the type specified. Note that the instance
returned implements the

Element

interface, so attributes
can be specified directly on the returned object.

In addition, if there are known attributes with default values,

Attr

nodes representing them are automatically created
and attached to the element.

To create an element with a qualified name and namespace URI, use
the

createElementNS

method.

**Parameters:** tagName

- The name of the element type to instantiate. For XML,
this is case-sensitive, otherwise it depends on the
case-sensitivity of the markup language in use. In that case, the
name is mapped to the canonical form of that markup by the DOM
implementation.
**Returns:** A new

Element

object with the

nodeName

attribute set to

tagName

, and

localName

,

prefix

, and

namespaceURI

set to

null

.
**Throws:** DOMException

importNode

```java
Node
importNode​(
Node
importedNode,
boolean deep)
throws
DOMException
```

Imports a node from another document to this document, without altering
or removing the source node from the original document; this method
creates a new copy of the source node. The returned node has no
parent; (

parentNode

is

null

).

For all nodes, importing a node creates a node object owned by the
importing document, with attribute values identical to the source
node's

nodeName

and

nodeType

, plus the
attributes related to namespaces (

prefix

,

localName

, and

namespaceURI

). As in the

cloneNode

operation, the source node is not altered.
User data associated to the imported node is not carried over.
However, if any

UserDataHandlers

has been specified
along with the associated data these handlers will be called with the
appropriate parameters before this method returns.

Additional information is copied as appropriate to the

nodeType

, attempting to mirror the behavior expected if
a fragment of XML or HTML source was copied from one document to
another, recognizing that the two documents may have different DTDs
in the XML case. The following list describes the specifics for each
type of node.

**ATTRIBUTE_NODE:** The

ownerElement

attribute
is set to

null

and the

specified

flag is
set to

true

on the generated

Attr

. The
descendants of the source

Attr

are recursively imported
and the resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect on

Attr

nodes; they always carry their children with them
when imported.
**DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE:** If the

deep

option
was set to

true

, the descendants of the source

DocumentFragment

are recursively imported and the
resulting nodes reassembled under the imported

DocumentFragment

to form the corresponding subtree.
Otherwise, this simply generates an empty

DocumentFragment

.
**DOCUMENT_NODE:** Document

nodes cannot be imported.
**DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE:** DocumentType

nodes cannot be imported.
**ELEMENT_NODE:** Specified

attribute nodes of the source element are imported, and the generated

Attr

nodes are attached to the generated

Element

. Default attributes are

not

copied, though if the document being imported into defines default
attributes for this element name, those are assigned. If the

importNode

deep

parameter was set to

true

, the descendants of the source element are
recursively imported and the resulting nodes reassembled to form the
corresponding subtree.
**ENTITY_NODE:** Entity

nodes can be
imported, however in the current release of the DOM the

DocumentType

is readonly. Ability to add these imported
nodes to a

DocumentType

will be considered for addition
to a future release of the DOM.On import, the

publicId

,

systemId

, and

notationName

attributes are
copied. If a

deep

import is requested, the descendants
of the the source

Entity

are recursively imported and
the resulting nodes reassembled to form the corresponding subtree.
**ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE:** Only the

EntityReference

itself is
copied, even if a

deep

import is requested, since the
source and destination documents might have defined the entity
differently. If the document being imported into provides a
definition for this entity name, its value is assigned.
**NOTATION_NODE:** Notation

nodes can be imported, however in the current
release of the DOM the

DocumentType

is readonly. Ability
to add these imported nodes to a

DocumentType

will be
considered for addition to a future release of the DOM.On import, the

publicId

and

systemId

attributes are copied.
Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect on this type
of nodes since they cannot have any children.
**PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE:** The imported node copies its

target

and

data

values from those of the
source node.Note that the

deep

parameter has no effect
on this type of nodes since they cannot have any children.
**TEXT_NODE,
CDATA_SECTION_NODE, COMMENT_NODE:** These three types of nodes inheriting
from

CharacterData

copy their

data

and

length

attributes from those of the source node.Note
that the

deep

parameter has no effect on these types of
nodes since they cannot have any children.

**Parameters:** importedNode

- The node to import.
**Parameters:** deep

- If

true

, recursively import the subtree under
the specified node; if

false

, import only the node
itself, as explained above. This has no effect on nodes that cannot
have any children, and on

Attr

, and

EntityReference

nodes.
**Returns:** The imported node that belongs to this

Document

.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the type of node being imported is not
supported.

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if one of the imported names is not
an XML name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute. This may happen when
importing an XML 1.1 [

XML 1.1

] element
into an XML 1.0 document, for instance.

adoptNode

```java
Node
adoptNode​(
Node
source)
throws
DOMException
```

Attempts to adopt a node from another document to this document. If
supported, it changes the

ownerDocument

of the source
node, its children, as well as the attached attribute nodes if there
are any. If the source node has a parent it is first removed from the
child list of its parent. This effectively allows moving a subtree
from one document to another (unlike

importNode()

which
create a copy of the source node instead of moving it). When it
fails, applications should use

Document.importNode()

instead. Note that if the adopted node is already part of this
document (i.e. the source and target document are the same), this
method still has the effect of removing the source node from the
child list of its parent, if any. The following list describes the
specifics for each type of node.

**ATTRIBUTE_NODE:** The

ownerElement

attribute is set to

null

and
the

specified

flag is set to

true

on the
adopted

Attr

. The descendants of the source

Attr

are recursively adopted.
**DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE:** The
descendants of the source node are recursively adopted.
**DOCUMENT_NODE:** Document

nodes cannot be adopted.
**DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE:** DocumentType

nodes cannot be adopted.
**ELEMENT_NODE:** Specified

attribute nodes of the source element are adopted. Default attributes
are discarded, though if the document being adopted into defines
default attributes for this element name, those are assigned. The
descendants of the source element are recursively adopted.
**ENTITY_NODE:** Entity

nodes cannot be adopted.
**ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE:** Only
the

EntityReference

node itself is adopted, the
descendants are discarded, since the source and destination documents
might have defined the entity differently. If the document being
imported into provides a definition for this entity name, its value
is assigned.
**NOTATION_NODE:** Notation

nodes cannot be
adopted.
**PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE, TEXT_NODE, CDATA_SECTION_NODE,
COMMENT_NODE:** These nodes can all be adopted. No specifics.

Note:

Since it does not create new nodes unlike the

Document.importNode()

method, this method does not raise
an

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR

exception, and applications
should use the

Document.normalizeDocument()

method to
check if an imported name is not an XML name according to the XML
version in use.

**Parameters:** source

- The node to move into this document.
**Returns:** The adopted node, or

null

if this operation
fails, such as when the source node comes from a different
implementation.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the source node is of type

DOCUMENT

,

DOCUMENT_TYPE

normalizeDocument

```java

This method acts as if the document was going through a save and load
cycle, putting the document in a "normal" form. As a consequence,
this method updates the replacement tree of

EntityReference

nodes and normalizes

Text

nodes, as defined in the method

Node.normalize()

.

Otherwise, the actual result depends on the features being set on
the

Document.domConfig

object and governing what
operations actually take place. Noticeably this method could also
make the document namespace well-formed according to the algorithm
described in , check the character normalization, remove the

CDATASection

nodes, etc. See

for details.

```java
// Keep in the document
the information defined // in the XML Information Set (Java example)
DOMConfiguration docConfig = myDocument.getDomConfig();

errors or warnings (

renameNode​(
Node
n,

String
namespaceURI,

String

throws
DOMException
```

Rename an existing node of type

ELEMENT_NODE

or

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

.

When possible this simply changes the name of the given node,
otherwise this creates a new node with the specified name and
replaces the existing node with the new node as described below.

If simply changing the name of the given node is not possible, the
following operations are performed: a new node is created, any
registered event listener is registered on the new node, any user
data attached to the old node is removed from that node, the old node
is removed from its parent if it has one, the children are moved to
the new node, if the renamed node is an

Element

its
attributes are moved to the new node, the new node is inserted at the
position the old node used to have in its parent's child nodes list
if it has one, the user data that was attached to the old node is
attached to the new node.

When the node being renamed is an

Element

only the
specified attributes are moved, default attributes originated from
the DTD are updated according to the new element name. In addition,
the implementation may update default attributes from other schemas.
Applications should use

Document.normalizeDocument()

to
guarantee these attributes are up-to-date.

When the node being renamed is an

Attr

that is
attached to an

Element

, the node is first removed from
the

Element

attributes map. Then, once renamed, either
by modifying the existing node or creating a new one as described
above, it is put back.

In addition,

- a user data event

NODE_RENAMED

is fired,
- when the implementation supports the feature "MutationNameEvents",
each mutation operation involved in this method fires the appropriate
event, and in the end the event {

http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events

,

DOMElementNameChanged

} or {

http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events

,

} is fired.

**Parameters:** n

- The node to rename.
**Parameters:** namespaceURI

- The new namespace URI.
**Parameters:** qualifiedName

- The new qualified name.
**Returns:** The renamed node. This is either the specified node or the new
node that was created to replace the specified node.
**Throws:** DOMException

- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised when the type of the specified node is
neither

ELEMENT_NODE

nor

ATTRIBUTE_NODE

,
or if the implementation does not support the renaming of the
document element.

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the new qualified name is not an
XML name according to the XML version in use specified in the

Document.xmlVersion

attribute.

WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised when the specified node was created
from a different document than this document.

NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the

qualifiedName

is a
malformed qualified name, if the

qualifiedName

has a
prefix and the

namespaceURI

is

null

, or
if the

qualifiedName

has a prefix that is "xml" and
the

namespaceURI

is different from "
