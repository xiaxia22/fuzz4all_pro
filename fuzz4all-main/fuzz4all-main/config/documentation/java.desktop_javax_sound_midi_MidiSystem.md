# Class MidiSystem

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\sound\midi\MidiSystem.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
MidiSystem

extends
Object
```

The

MidiSystem

class provides access to the installed MIDI system
resources, including devices such as synthesizers, sequencers, and MIDI input
and output ports. A typical simple MIDI application might begin by invoking
one or more

MidiSystem

methods to learn what devices are installed
and to obtain the ones needed in that application.

The class also has methods for reading files, streams, and URLs that contain
standard MIDI file data or soundbanks. You can query the

MidiSystem

for the format of a specified MIDI file.

You cannot instantiate a

MidiSystem

; all the methods are static.

Properties can be used to specify default MIDI devices. Both system
properties and a properties file are considered. The "sound.properties"
properties file is read from an implementation-specific location (typically
it is the

conf

directory in the Java installation directory).
The optional "javax.sound.config.file" system property can be used to specify
the properties file that will be read as the initial configuration. If a
property exists both as a system property and in the properties file, the
system property takes precedence. If none is specified, a suitable default is
chosen among the available devices. The syntax of the properties file is
specified in

Properties.load

. The
following table lists the available property keys and which methods consider
them:

MIDI System Property Keys

Property Key

Interface

Affected Method

javax.sound.midi.Receiver

Receiver

getReceiver()

javax.sound.midi.Sequencer

Sequencer

getSequencer()

javax.sound.midi.Synthesizer

Synthesizer

getSynthesizer()

javax.sound.midi.Transmitter

Transmitter

getTransmitter()

The property value consists of the provider class name and the device name,
separated by the hash mark ("#"). The provider class name is the
fully-qualified name of a concrete

MIDI device provider

class. The device name is
matched against the

String

returned by the

getName

method of

MidiDevice.Info

. Either the class name, or the device name may be
omitted. If only the class name is specified, the trailing hash mark is
optional.

If the provider class is specified, and it can be successfully retrieved from
the installed providers, the list of

MidiDevice.Info

objects is
retrieved from the provider. Otherwise, or when these devices do not provide
a subsequent match, the list is retrieved from

getMidiDeviceInfo()

to
contain all available

MidiDevice.Info

objects.

If a device name is specified, the resulting list of

MidiDevice.Info

objects is searched: the first one with a matching name, and whose

MidiDevice

implements the respective interface, will be returned. If
no matching

MidiDevice.Info

object is found, or the device name is
not specified, the first suitable device from the resulting list will be
returned. For Sequencer and Synthesizer, a device is suitable if it
implements the respective interface; whereas for Receiver and Transmitter, a
device is suitable if it implements neither Sequencer nor Synthesizer and
provides at least one Receiver or Transmitter, respectively.

For example, the property

javax.sound.midi.Receiver

with a value

"com.sun.media.sound.MidiProvider#SunMIDI1"

will have the following
consequences when

getReceiver

is called: if the class

com.sun.media.sound.MidiProvider

exists in the list of installed MIDI
device providers, the first

Receiver

device with name

"SunMIDI1"

will be returned. If it cannot be found, the first

Receiver

from that provider will be returned, regardless of name. If
there is none, the first

Receiver

with name

"SunMIDI1"

in the
list of all devices (as returned by

getMidiDeviceInfo

) will be
returned, or, if not found, the first

Receiver

that can be found in
the list of all devices is returned. If that fails, too, a

MidiUnavailableException

is thrown.

### Method Details

#### public static
MidiDevice.Info
[] getMidiDeviceInfo()

Obtains an array of information objects representing the set of all MIDI
devices available on the system. A returned information object can then
be used to obtain the corresponding device object, by invoking

getMidiDevice

.

**Returns:**
- an array of

MidiDevice.Info

objects, one for each
installed MIDI device. If no such devices are installed, an array
of length 0 is returned.

---

#### public static
MidiDevice
getMidiDevice​(
MidiDevice.Info
info)
throws
MidiUnavailableException

Obtains the requested MIDI device.

**Parameters:**
- info

- a device information object representing the desired device

**Returns:**
- the requested device

**Throws:**
- MidiUnavailableException

- if the requested device is not available
due to resource restrictions
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the info object does not represent a
MIDI device installed on the system
- NullPointerException

- if

info

is

null

**See Also:**
- getMidiDeviceInfo()

---

#### public static
Receiver
getReceiver()
throws
MidiUnavailableException

Obtains a MIDI receiver from an external MIDI port or other default
device. The returned receiver always implements the

MidiDeviceReceiver

interface.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Receiver

is defined or it
is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
device that provides the default receiver. For details, refer to the

class description

.

If a suitable MIDI port is not available, the Receiver is retrieved from
an installed synthesizer.

If a native receiver provided by the default device does not implement
the

MidiDeviceReceiver

interface, it will be wrapped in a wrapper
class that implements the

MidiDeviceReceiver

interface. The
corresponding

Receiver

method calls will be forwarded to the
native receiver.

If this method returns successfully, the

MidiDevice

the

Receiver

belongs to is opened implicitly, if it is not
already open. It is possible to close an implicitly opened device by
calling

close

on the returned

Receiver

.
All open

Receiver

instances have to be closed in order to release
system resources hold by the

MidiDevice

. For a detailed
description of open/close behaviour see the class description of

MidiDevice

.

**Returns:**
- the default MIDI receiver

**Throws:**
- MidiUnavailableException

- if the default receiver is not available
due to resource restrictions, or no device providing receivers is
installed in the system

---

#### public static
Transmitter
getTransmitter()
throws
MidiUnavailableException

Obtains a MIDI transmitter from an external MIDI port or other default
source. The returned transmitter always implements the

MidiDeviceTransmitter

interface.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Transmitter

is defined or
it is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
device that provides the default transmitter. For details, refer to the

class description

.

If a native transmitter provided by the default device does not implement
the

MidiDeviceTransmitter

interface, it will be wrapped in a
wrapper class that implements the

MidiDeviceTransmitter

interface. The corresponding

Transmitter

method calls will be
forwarded to the native transmitter.

If this method returns successfully, the

MidiDevice

the

Transmitter

belongs to is opened implicitly, if it is not
already open. It is possible to close an implicitly opened device by
calling

close

on the returned

Transmitter

. All open

Transmitter

instances have to be
closed in order to release system resources hold by the

MidiDevice

. For a detailed description of open/close behaviour
see the class description of

MidiDevice

.

**Returns:**
- the default MIDI transmitter

**Throws:**
- MidiUnavailableException

- if the default transmitter is not
available due to resource restrictions, or no device providing
transmitters is installed in the system

---

#### public static
Synthesizer
getSynthesizer()
throws
MidiUnavailableException

Obtains the default synthesizer.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Synthesizer

is defined or
it is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
default synthesizer. For details, refer to the

class description

.

**Returns:**
- the default synthesizer

**Throws:**
- MidiUnavailableException

- if the synthesizer is not available due
to resource restrictions, or no synthesizer is installed in the
system

---

#### public static
Sequencer
getSequencer()
throws
MidiUnavailableException

Obtains the default

Sequencer

, connected to a default device. The
returned

Sequencer

instance is connected to the default

Synthesizer

, as returned by

getSynthesizer()

. If there is
no

Synthesizer

available, or the default

Synthesizer

cannot be opened, the

sequencer

is connected to the default

Receiver

, as returned by

getReceiver()

. The connection is
made by retrieving a

Transmitter

instance from the

Sequencer

and setting its

Receiver

. Closing and
re-opening the sequencer will restore the connection to the default
device.

This method is equivalent to calling

getSequencer(true)

.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Sequencer

is defined or
it is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
default sequencer. For details, refer to the

class description

.

**Returns:**
- the default sequencer, connected to a default Receiver

**Throws:**
- MidiUnavailableException

- if the sequencer is not available due to
resource restrictions, or there is no

Receiver

available
by any installed

MidiDevice

, or no sequencer is installed
in the system

**See Also:**
- getSequencer(boolean)

,

---

#### public static
Sequencer
getSequencer​(boolean connected)
throws
MidiUnavailableException

Obtains the default

Sequencer

, optionally connected to a default
device.

If

connected

is true, the returned

Sequencer

instance is
connected to the default

Synthesizer

, as returned by

getSynthesizer()

. If there is no

Synthesizer

available, or
the default

Synthesizer

cannot be opened, the

sequencer

is connected to the default

Receiver

, as returned by

getReceiver()

. The connection is made by retrieving a

Transmitter

instance from the

Sequencer

and setting its

Receiver

. Closing and re-opening the sequencer will restore the
connection to the default device.

If

connected

is false, the returned

Sequencer

instance is
not connected, it has no open

Transmitters

. In order to play the
sequencer on a MIDI device, or a

Synthesizer

, it is necessary to
get a

Transmitter

and set its

Receiver

.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Sequencer

is defined or
it is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
default sequencer. For details, refer to the

class description

.

**Parameters:**
- connected

- whether or not the returned

Sequencer

is
connected to the default

Synthesizer

**Returns:**
- the default sequencer

**Throws:**
- MidiUnavailableException

- if the sequencer is not available due to
resource restrictions, or no sequencer is installed in the

#### public static
Soundbank
getSoundbank​(
InputStream
stream)
throws
InvalidMidiDataException
,

IOException

Constructs a MIDI sound bank by reading it from the specified stream. The
stream must point to a valid MIDI soundbank file. In general, MIDI
soundbank providers may need to read some data from the stream before
determining whether they support it. These parsers must be able to mark
the stream, read enough data to determine whether they support the
stream, and, if not, reset the stream's read pointer to its original
position. If the input stream does not support this, this method may fail
with an

IOException

.

**Parameters:**
- stream

- the source of the sound bank data

**Returns:**
- the sound bank

**Throws:**
- InvalidMidiDataException

- if the stream does not point to valid
MIDI soundbank data recognized by the system
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurred when loading the soundbank
- NullPointerException

- if

stream

is

null

#### public static
MidiFileFormat
getMidiFileFormat​(
InputStream
stream)
throws
InvalidMidiDataException
,

IOException

Obtains the MIDI file format of the data in the specified input stream.
The stream must point to valid MIDI file data for a file type recognized
by the system.

This method and/or the code it invokes may need to read some data from
the stream to determine whether its data format is supported. The
implementation may therefore need to mark the stream, read enough data to
determine whether it is in a supported format, and reset the stream's
read pointer to its original position. If the input stream does not
permit this set of operations, this method may fail with an

IOException

.

This operation can only succeed for files of a type which can be parsed
by an installed file reader. It may fail with an

InvalidMidiDataException

even for valid files if no compatible
file reader is installed. It will also fail with an

InvalidMidiDataException

if a compatible file reader is
installed, but encounters errors while determining the file format.

**Parameters:**
- stream

- the input stream from which file format information should
be extracted

**Returns:**
- an

MidiFileFormat

object describing the MIDI file format

**Throws:**
- InvalidMidiDataException

- if the stream does not point to valid
MIDI file data recognized by the system
- IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs while accessing the stream

#### public static
Sequence
getSequence​(
InputStream
stream)
throws
InvalidMidiDataException
,

IOException

Obtains a MIDI sequence from the specified input stream. The stream must
point to valid MIDI file data for a file type recognized by the system.

This method and/or the code it invokes may need to read some data from
the stream to determine whether its data format is supported. The
implementation may therefore need to mark the stream, read enough data to

javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem

```java
public class
MidiSystem

extends
Object
```

The

MidiSystem

class provides access to the installed MIDI system
resources, including devices such as synthesizers, sequencers, and MIDI input
and output ports. A typical simple MIDI application might begin by invoking
one or more

MidiSystem

methods to learn what devices are installed
and to obtain the ones needed in that application.

The class also has methods for reading files, streams, and URLs that contain
standard MIDI file data or soundbanks. You can query the

MidiSystem

for the format of a specified MIDI file.

You cannot instantiate a

MidiSystem

; all the methods are static.

Properties can be used to specify default MIDI devices. Both system
properties and a properties file are considered. The "sound.properties"
properties file is read from an implementation-specific location (typically
it is the

conf

directory in the Java installation directory).
The optional "javax.sound.config.file" system property can be used to specify
the properties file that will be read as the initial configuration. If a
property exists both as a system property and in the properties file, the
system property takes precedence. If none is specified, a suitable default is
chosen among the available devices. The syntax of the properties file is
specified in

Properties.load

. The
following table lists the available property keys and which methods consider
them:

javax.sound.midi.Sequencer

Sequencer

getSequencer()

javax.sound.midi.Synthesizer

getTransmitter()

The property value consists of the provider class name and the device name,
separated by the hash mark ("#"). The provider class name is the
fully-qualified name of a concrete

MIDI device provider

class. The device name is
matched against the

String

returned by the

getName

method of

MidiDevice.Info

. Either the class name, or the device name may be
omitted. If only the class name is specified, the trailing hash mark is
optional.

If the provider class is specified, and it can be successfully retrieved from
the installed providers, the list of

MidiDevice.Info

objects is
retrieved from the provider. Otherwise, or when these devices do not provide
a subsequent match, the list is retrieved from

getMidiDeviceInfo()

to
contain all available

MidiDevice.Info

objects.

If a device name is specified, the resulting list of

MidiDevice.Info

objects is searched: the first one with a matching name, and whose

MidiDevice

implements the respective interface, will be returned. If
no matching

MidiDevice.Info

object is found, or the device name is
not specified, the first suitable device from the resulting list will be
returned. For Sequencer and Synthesizer, a device is suitable if it
implements the respective interface; whereas for Receiver and Transmitter, a
device is suitable if it implements neither Sequencer nor Synthesizer and
provides at least one Receiver or Transmitter, respectively.

For example, the property

javax.sound.midi.Receiver

with a value

"com.sun.media.sound.MidiProvider#SunMIDI1"

will have the following
consequences when

getReceiver

is called: if the class

com.sun.media.sound.MidiProvider

exists in the list of installed MIDI
device providers, the first

Receiver

device with name

"SunMIDI1"

will be returned. If it cannot be found, the first

Receiver

from that provider will be returned, regardless of name. If
there is none, the first

Receiver

with name

"SunMIDI1"

in the
list of all devices (as returned by

getMidiDeviceInfo

) will be
returned, or, if not found, the first

Receiver

that can be found in
the list of all devices is returned. If that fails, too, a

MidiUnavailableException

is thrown.

matched against the

String

returned by the

getName

method of

MidiDevice.Info

. Either the class name, or the device name may be
omitted. If only the class name is specified, the trailing hash mark is
optional.

If the provider class is specified, and it can be successfully retrieved from
the installed providers, the list of

MidiDevice.Info

objects is
retrieved from the provider. Otherwise, or when these devices do not provide
a subsequent match, the list is retrieved from

getMidiDeviceInfo()

to
contain all available

MidiDevice.Info

objects.

If a device name is specified, the resulting list of

MidiDevice.Info

objects is searched: the first one with a matching name, and whose

MidiDevice

implements the respective interface, will be returned. If
no matching

MidiDevice.Info

object is found, or the device name is
not specified, the first suitable device from the resulting list will be
returned. For Sequencer and Synthesizer, a device is suitable if it
implements the respective interface; whereas for Receiver and Transmitter, a
device is suitable if it implements neither Sequencer nor Synthesizer and
provides at least one Receiver or Transmitter, respectively.

For example, the property

javax.sound.midi.Receiver

with a value

"com.sun.media.sound.MidiProvider#SunMIDI1"

will have the following
consequences when

getReceiver

is called: if the class

com.sun.media.sound.MidiProvider

exists in the list of installed MIDI
device providers, the first

Receiver

device with name

"SunMIDI1"

will be returned. If it cannot be found, the first

Receiver

from that provider will be returned, regardless of name. If
there is none, the first

Receiver

with name

"SunMIDI1"

in the
list of all devices (as returned by

getMidiDeviceInfo

) will be
returned, or, if not found, the first

Receiver

that can be found in
the list of all devices is returned. If that fails, too, a

MidiUnavailableException

is thrown.

The class also has methods for reading files, streams, and URLs that contain
standard MIDI file data or soundbanks. You can query the

MidiSystem

for the format of a specified MIDI file.

You cannot instantiate a

MidiSystem

; all the methods are static.

Properties can be used to specify default MIDI devices. Both system
properties and a properties file are considered. The "sound.properties"
properties file is read from an implementation-specific location (typically
it is the

conf

directory in the Java installation directory).
The optional "javax.sound.config.file" system property can be used to specify
the properties file that will be read as the initial configuration. If a
property exists both as a system property and in the properties file, the
system property takes precedence. If none is specified, a suitable default is
chosen among the available devices. The syntax of the properties file is
specified in

Properties.load

. The
following table lists the available property keys and which methods consider
them:

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getMidiDeviceInfo

```java
public static
MidiDevice.Info
[] getMidiDeviceInfo()
```

Obtains an array of information objects representing the set of all MIDI
devices available on the system. A returned information object can then
be used to obtain the corresponding device object, by invoking

getMidiDevice

.

**Returns:** an array of

MidiDevice.Info

objects, one for each
installed MIDI device. If no such devices are installed, an array
of length 0 is returned.

- getMidiDevice

```java
public static
MidiDevice
getMidiDevice​(
MidiDevice.Info
info)
throws
MidiUnavailableException
```

Obtains the requested MIDI device.

**Parameters:** info

- a device information object representing the desired device
**Returns:** the requested device
**Throws:** MidiUnavailableException

- if the requested device is not available
due to resource restrictions
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the info object does not represent a
MIDI device installed on the system
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

info

is

null
**See Also:** getMidiDeviceInfo()

- getReceiver

```java
public static
Receiver
getReceiver()
throws
MidiUnavailableException
```

Obtains a MIDI receiver from an external MIDI port or other default
device. The returned receiver always implements the

MidiDeviceReceiver

interface.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Receiver

is defined or it
is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
device that provides the default receiver. For details, refer to the

class description

.

If a suitable MIDI port is not available, the Receiver is retrieved from
an installed synthesizer.

If a native receiver provided by the default device does not implement
the

MidiDeviceReceiver

interface, it will be wrapped in a wrapper
class that implements the

MidiDeviceReceiver

interface. The
corresponding

Receiver

method calls will be forwarded to the
native receiver.

If this method returns successfully, the

MidiDevice

the

Receiver

belongs to is opened implicitly, if it is not
already open. It is possible to close an implicitly opened device by
calling

close

on the returned

Receiver

.
All open

Receiver

instances have to be closed in order to release
system resources hold by the

MidiDevice

. For a detailed
description of open/close behaviour see the class description of

MidiDevice

.

**Returns:** the default MIDI receiver
**Throws:** MidiUnavailableException

- if the default receiver is not available
due to resource restrictions, or no device providing receivers is
installed in the system

- getTransmitter

```java
public static
Transmitter
getTransmitter()
throws
MidiUnavailableException
```

Obtains a MIDI transmitter from an external MIDI port or other default
source. The returned transmitter always implements the

MidiDeviceTransmitter

interface.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Transmitter

is defined or
it is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
device that provides the default transmitter. For details, refer to the

class description

.

If a native transmitter provided by the default device does not implement
the

MidiDeviceTransmitter

interface, it will be wrapped in a
wrapper class that implements the

MidiDeviceTransmitter

interface. The corresponding

Transmitter

method calls will be
forwarded to the native transmitter.

If this method returns successfully, the

MidiDevice

the

Transmitter

belongs to is opened implicitly, if it is not
already open. It is possible to close an implicitly opened device by
calling

close

on the returned

Transmitter

. All open

Transmitter

instances have to be
closed in order to release system resources hold by the

MidiDevice

. For a detailed description of open/close behaviour
see the class description of

MidiDevice

.

**Returns:** the default MIDI transmitter
**Throws:** MidiUnavailableException

- if the default transmitter is not
available due to resource restrictions, or no device providing
transmitters is installed in the system

- getSynthesizer

```java
public static
Synthesizer
getSynthesizer()
throws
MidiUnavailableException
```

Obtains the default synthesizer.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Synthesizer

is defined or
it is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
default synthesizer. For details, refer to the

class description

.

**Returns:** the default synthesizer
**Throws:** MidiUnavailableException

- if the synthesizer is not available due
to resource restrictions, or no synthesizer is installed in the
system

- getSequencer

```java
public static
Sequencer
getSequencer()
throws
MidiUnavailableException
```

Obtains the default

Sequencer

, connected to a default device. The
returned

Sequencer

instance is connected to the default

Synthesizer

, as returned by

getSynthesizer()

. If there is
no

Synthesizer

available, or the default

Synthesizer

cannot be opened, the

sequencer

is connected to the default

Receiver

, as returned by

getReceiver()

. The connection is
made by retrieving a

Transmitter

instance from the

Sequencer

and setting its

Receiver

. Closing and
re-opening the sequencer will restore the connection to the default
device.

This method is equivalent to calling

getSequencer(true)

.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Sequencer

is defined or
it is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
default sequencer. For details, refer to the

class description

.

**Returns:** the default sequencer, connected to a default Receiver
**Throws:** MidiUnavailableException

- if the sequencer is not available due to
resource restrictions, or there is no

Receiver

available

- getReceiver

```java
public static
Receiver
getReceiver()
throws
MidiUnavailableException
```

Obtains a MIDI receiver from an external MIDI port or other default
device. The returned receiver always implements the

MidiDeviceReceiver

interface.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Receiver

is defined or it
is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
device that provides the default receiver. For details, refer to the

class description

.

If a suitable MIDI port is not available, the Receiver is retrieved from
an installed synthesizer.

If a native receiver provided by the default device does not implement
the

MidiDeviceReceiver

interface, it will be wrapped in a wrapper
class that implements the

MidiDeviceReceiver

interface. The
corresponding

Receiver

method calls will be forwarded to the
native receiver.

If this method returns successfully, the

MidiDevice

the

Receiver

belongs to is opened implicitly, if it is not
already open. It is possible to close an implicitly opened device by
calling

close

on the returned

Receiver

.
All open

Receiver

instances have to be closed in order to release
system resources hold by the

MidiDevice

. For a detailed
description of open/close behaviour see the class description of

MidiDevice

.

**Returns:** the default MIDI receiver
**Throws:** MidiUnavailableException

- if the default receiver is not available
due to resource restrictions, or no device providing receivers is
installed in the system

- getTransmitter

```java
public static
Transmitter
getTransmitter()
throws
MidiUnavailableException
```

Obtains a MIDI transmitter from an external MIDI port or other default
source. The returned transmitter always implements the

MidiDeviceTransmitter

interface.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Transmitter

is defined or
it is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
device that provides the default transmitter. For details, refer to the

class description

.

If a native transmitter provided by the default device does not implement
the

MidiDeviceTransmitter

interface, it will be wrapped in a
wrapper class that implements the

MidiDeviceTransmitter

interface. The corresponding

Transmitter

method calls will be
forwarded to the native transmitter.

If this method returns successfully, the

MidiDevice

the

Transmitter

belongs to is opened implicitly, if it is not
already open. It is possible to close an implicitly opened device by
calling

close

on the returned

Transmitter

. All open

Transmitter

instances have to be
closed in order to release system resources hold by the

MidiDevice

. For a detailed description of open/close behaviour
see the class description of

. The connection is
made by retrieving a

Transmitter

instance from the

Sequencer

and setting its

Receiver

. Closing and
re-opening the sequencer will restore the connection to the default
device.

This method is equivalent to calling

getSequencer(true)

.

If the system property

javax.sound.midi.Sequencer

is defined or
it is defined in the file "sound.properties", it is used to identify the
default sequencer. For details, refer to the

class description

Obtains the MIDI file format of the data in the specified input stream.
The stream must point to valid MIDI file data for a file type recognized
by the system.

This method and/or the code it invokes may need to read some data from
the stream to determine whether its data format is supported. The
implementation may therefore need to mark the stream, read enough data to
determine whether it is in a supported format, and reset the stream's
read pointer to its original position. If the input stream does not
permit this set of operations, this method may fail with an

IOException

.

This operation can only succeed for files of a type which can be parsed
by an installed file reader. It may fail with an

InvalidMidiDataException

even for valid files if no compatible
file reader is installed. It will also fail with an

InvalidMidiDataException

if a compatible file reader is
installed, but encounters errors while determining the file format.

**Parameters:** stream

- the input stream from which file format information should
be extracted
**Returns:** an

MidiFileFormat

object describing the MIDI file format
**Throws:** InvalidMidiDataException

- if the stream does not point to valid
MIDI file data recognized by the system
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs while accessing the stream
**Throws:** NullPointerException
