### Class Description

```java
public class
BigDecimal

extends
Number

implements
Comparable
<
BigDecimal
>
```

Immutable, arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. A

BigDecimal

consists of an arbitrary precision integer

unscaled value

and a 32-bit integer

scale

. If zero
or positive, the scale is the number of digits to the right of the
decimal point. If negative, the unscaled value of the number is
multiplied by ten to the power of the negation of the scale. The
value of the number represented by the

BigDecimal

is
therefore

(unscaledValue × 10

-scale

)

.

The

BigDecimal

class provides operations for
arithmetic, scale manipulation, rounding, comparison, hashing, and
format conversion. The

toString()

method provides a
canonical representation of a

BigDecimal

.

The

BigDecimal

class gives its user complete control
over rounding behavior. If no rounding mode is specified and the
exact result cannot be represented, an exception is thrown;
otherwise, calculations can be carried out to a chosen precision
and rounding mode by supplying an appropriate

MathContext

object to the operation. In either case, eight

rounding
modes

are provided for the control of rounding. Using the
integer fields in this class (such as

ROUND_HALF_UP

) to
represent rounding mode is deprecated; the enumeration values
of the

RoundingMode

enum

, (such as

RoundingMode.HALF_UP

) should be used instead.

When a

MathContext

object is supplied with a precision
setting of 0 (for example,

MathContext.UNLIMITED

),
arithmetic operations are exact, as are the arithmetic methods
which take no

MathContext

object. (This is the only
behavior that was supported in releases prior to 5.) As a
corollary of computing the exact result, the rounding mode setting
of a

MathContext

object with a precision setting of 0 is
not used and thus irrelevant. In the case of divide, the exact
quotient could have an infinitely long decimal expansion; for
example, 1 divided by 3. If the quotient has a nonterminating
decimal expansion and the operation is specified to return an exact
result, an

ArithmeticException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
exact result of the division is returned, as done for other
operations.

When the precision setting is not 0, the rules of

BigDecimal

arithmetic are broadly compatible with selected
modes of operation of the arithmetic defined in ANSI X3.274-1996
and ANSI X3.274-1996/AM 1-2000 (section 7.4). Unlike those
standards,

BigDecimal

includes many rounding modes, which
were mandatory for division in

BigDecimal

releases prior
to 5. Any conflicts between these ANSI standards and the

BigDecimal

specification are resolved in favor of

BigDecimal

.

Since the same numerical value can have different
representations (with different scales), the rules of arithmetic
and rounding must specify both the numerical result and the scale
used in the result's representation.

In general the rounding modes and precision setting determine
how operations return results with a limited number of digits when
the exact result has more digits (perhaps infinitely many in the
case of division and square root) than the number of digits returned.

First, the
total number of digits to return is specified by the

MathContext

's

precision

setting; this determines
the result's

precision

. The digit count starts from the
leftmost nonzero digit of the exact result. The rounding mode
determines how any discarded trailing digits affect the returned
result.

For all arithmetic operators , the operation is carried out as
though an exact intermediate result were first calculated and then
rounded to the number of digits specified by the precision setting
(if necessary), using the selected rounding mode. If the exact
result is not returned, some digit positions of the exact result
are discarded. When rounding increases the magnitude of the
returned result, it is possible for a new digit position to be
created by a carry propagating to a leading "9" digit.
For example, rounding the value 999.9 to three digits rounding up
would be numerically equal to one thousand, represented as
100×10

1

. In such cases, the new "1" is
the leading digit position of the returned result.

Besides a logical exact result, each arithmetic operation has a
preferred scale for representing a result. The preferred
scale for each operation is listed in the table below.

Preferred Scales for Results of Arithmetic Operations

Operation

Preferred Scale of Result

Add

max(addend.scale(), augend.scale())

Subtract

max(minuend.scale(), subtrahend.scale())

Multiply

multiplier.scale() + multiplicand.scale()

Divide

dividend.scale() - divisor.scale()

Square root

radicand.scale()/2

These scales are the ones used by the methods which return exact
arithmetic results; except that an exact divide may have to use a
larger scale since the exact result may have more digits. For
example,

1/32

is

0.03125

.

Before rounding, the scale of the logical exact intermediate
result is the preferred scale for that operation. If the exact
numerical result cannot be represented in

precision

digits, rounding selects the set of digits to return and the scale
of the result is reduced from the scale of the intermediate result
to the least scale which can represent the

precision

digits actually returned. If the exact result can be represented
with at most

precision

digits, the representation
of the result with the scale closest to the preferred scale is
returned. In particular, an exactly representable quotient may be
represented in fewer than

precision

digits by removing
trailing zeros and decreasing the scale. For example, rounding to
three digits using the

floor

rounding mode,

19/100 = 0.19 // integer=19, scale=2

but

21/110 = 0.190 // integer=190, scale=3

Note that for add, subtract, and multiply, the reduction in
scale will equal the number of digit positions of the exact result
which are discarded. If the rounding causes a carry propagation to
create a new high-order digit position, an additional digit of the
result is discarded than when no new digit position is created.

Other methods may have slightly different rounding semantics.
For example, the result of the

pow

method using the

specified algorithm

can
occasionally differ from the rounded mathematical result by more
than one unit in the last place, one

ulp

.

Two types of operations are provided for manipulating the scale
of a

BigDecimal

: scaling/rounding operations and decimal
point motion operations. Scaling/rounding operations (

setScale

and

round

) return a

BigDecimal

whose value is approximately (or exactly) equal
to that of the operand, but whose scale or precision is the
specified value; that is, they increase or decrease the precision
of the stored number with minimal effect on its value. Decimal
point motion operations (

movePointLeft

and

movePointRight

) return a

BigDecimal

created from the operand by moving the decimal
point a specified distance in the specified direction.

For the sake of brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used
throughout the descriptions of

BigDecimal

methods. The
pseudo-code expression

(i + j)

is shorthand for "a

BigDecimal

whose value is that of the

BigDecimal

i

added to that of the

BigDecimal

j

." The pseudo-code expression

(i == j)

is
shorthand for "

true

if and only if the

BigDecimal

i

represents the same value as the

BigDecimal

j

." Other pseudo-code expressions
are interpreted similarly. Square brackets are used to represent
the particular

BigInteger

and scale pair defining a

BigDecimal

value; for example [19, 2] is the

BigDecimal

numerically equal to 0.19 having a scale of 2.

All methods and constructors for this class throw

NullPointerException

when passed a

null

object
reference for any input parameter.

---

#### public BigDecimal​(
String
val)

Translates the string representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

. The string representation consists
of an optional sign,

'+'

(

'\u002B'

) or

'-'

(

'\u002D'

), followed by a sequence of
zero or more decimal digits ("the integer"), optionally
followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent.

The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero
or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one
digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed
by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the

significand

.

The exponent consists of the character

'e'

(

'\u0065'

) or

'E'

(

'\u0045'

)
followed by one or more decimal digits. The value of the
exponent must lie between -

Integer.MAX_VALUE

(

Integer.MIN_VALUE

+1) and

Integer.MAX_VALUE

, inclusive.

More formally, the strings this constructor accepts are
described by the following grammar:

The scale of the returned

BigDecimal

will be the
number of digits in the fraction, or zero if the string
contains no decimal point, subject to adjustment for any
exponent; if the string contains an exponent, the exponent is
subtracted from the scale. The value of the resulting scale
must lie between

Integer.MIN_VALUE

and

Integer.MAX_VALUE

, inclusive.

The character-to-digit mapping is provided by

Character.digit(char, int)

set to convert to radix 10. The
String may not contain any extraneous characters (whitespace,
for example).

Examples:

The value of the returned

BigDecimal

is equal to

significand

× 10

exponent

.
For each string on the left, the resulting representation
[

BigInteger

,

scale

] is shown on the right.

"0" [0,0]
"0.00" [0,2]
"123" [123,0]

#### public BigDecimal​(
String
val,

MathContext
mc)

Translates the string representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, with rounding
according to the context settings.

**Parameters:**
- val

- string representation of a

BigDecimal

.

- the context to use.

**Throws:**
- ArithmeticException

rounding mode is

UNNECESSARY

.

---

#### public BigDecimal​(double val)

Translates a

double

into a

BigDecimal

which
is the exact decimal representation of the

double

's
binary floating-point value. The scale of the returned

BigDecimal

is the smallest value such that

(10

scale

× val)

is an integer.

Notes:

- The results of this constructor can be somewhat unpredictable.
One might assume that writing

new BigDecimal(0.1)

in
Java creates a

BigDecimal

which is exactly equal to
0.1 (an unscaled value of 1, with a scale of 1), but it is
actually equal to
0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.
This is because 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a

double

(or, for that matter, as a binary fraction of
any finite length). Thus, the value that is being passed

in

to the constructor is not exactly equal to 0.1,
appearances notwithstanding.

The

String

constructor, on the other hand, is
perfectly predictable: writing

new BigDecimal("0.1")

creates a

BigDecimal

which is

exactly

equal to
0.1, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally
recommended that the

String constructor

be used in preference to this one.

When a

double

must be used as a source for a

BigDecimal

, note that this constructor provides an
exact conversion; it does not give the same result as
converting the

double

to a

String

using the

Double.toString(double)

method and then using the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor. To get that result,
use the

static

valueOf(double)

method.

- if

val

is infinite or NaN.

. The current implementation uses
the core algorithm defined in ANSI standard X3.274-1996 with
rounding according to the context settings. In general, the
returned numerical value is within two ulps of the exact
numerical value for the chosen precision. Note that future
releases may use a different algorithm with a decreased
allowable error bound and increased allowable exponent range.

The X3.274-1996 algorithm is:

- An

ArithmeticException

exception is thrown if

- abs(n) > 999999999

mc.precision == 0

and

n < 0

mc.precision > 0

and

n

has more than

mc.precision

decimal digits

if

n

is zero,

ONE

is returned even if

this

is zero, otherwise

- if

n

is positive, the result is calculated via
the repeated squaring technique into a single accumulator.
The individual multiplications with the accumulator use the
same math context settings as in

mc

except for a
precision increased to

mc.precision + elength + 1

where

elength

is the number of decimal digits in

n

.

if

n

is negative, the result is calculated as if

n

were positive; this value is then divided into one
using the working precision specified above.

The final value from either the positive or negative case
is then rounded to the destination precision.

**Parameters:**

#### public
String
toString()

Returns the string representation of this

BigDecimal

,
using scientific notation if an exponent is needed.

A standard canonical string form of the

BigDecimal

is created as though by the following steps: first, the
absolute value of the unscaled value of the

BigDecimal

is converted to a string in base ten using the characters

'0'

through

'9'

with no leading zeros (except
if its value is zero, in which case a single

'0'

character is used).

Next, an

adjusted exponent

is calculated; this is the
negated scale, plus the number of characters in the converted
unscaled value, less one. That is,

-scale+(ulength-1)

, where

ulength

is the
length of the absolute value of the unscaled value in decimal
digits (its

precision

).

If the scale is greater than or equal to zero and the
adjusted exponent is greater than or equal to

-6

, the
number will be converted to a character form without using
exponential notation. In this case, if the scale is zero then
no decimal point is added and if the scale is positive a
decimal point will be inserted with the scale specifying the
number of characters to the right of the decimal point.

'0'

characters are added to the left of the converted
unscaled value as necessary. If no character precedes the
decimal point after this insertion then a conventional

'0'

character is prefixed.

Otherwise (that is, if the scale is negative, or the
adjusted exponent is less than

-6

), the number will be
converted to a character form using exponential notation. In
this case, if the converted

BigInteger

has more than
one digit a decimal point is inserted after the first digit.
An exponent in character form is then suffixed to the converted
unscaled value (perhaps with inserted decimal point); this
comprises the letter

'E'

followed immediately by the
adjusted exponent converted to a character form. The latter is
in base ten, using the characters

'0'

through

'9'

with no leading zeros, and is always prefixed by a
sign character

'-'

(

'\u002D'

) if the
adjusted exponent is negative,

'+'

(

'\u002B'

) otherwise).

Finally, the entire string is prefixed by a minus sign
character

'-'

(

'\u002D'

) if the unscaled
value is less than zero. No sign character is prefixed if the
unscaled value is zero or positive.

Examples:

For each representation [

unscaled value

,

scale

]
on the left, the resulting string is shown on the right.

```java
[123,0] "123"
[-123,0] "-123"
[123,-1] "1.23E+3"
[123,-3] "1.23E+5"
[123,1] "12.3"
[123,5] "0.00123"
[123,10] "1.23E-8"
[-123,12] "-1.23E-10"
```

Notes:

- There is a one-to-one mapping between the distinguishable

BigDecimal

values and the result of this conversion.
That is, every distinguishable

BigDecimal

value
(unscaled value and scale) has a unique string representation
as a result of using

toString

. If that string
representation is converted back to a

BigDecimal

using
the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, then the original
value will be recovered.

The string produced for a given number is always the same;
it is not affected by locale. This means that it can be used
as a canonical string representation for exchanging decimal
data, or as a key for a Hashtable, etc. Locale-sensitive
number formatting and parsing is handled by the

NumberFormat

class and its subclasses.

The

toEngineeringString()

method may be used for
presenting numbers with exponents in engineering notation, and the

setScale

method may be used for
rounding a

BigDecimal

so it has a known number of digits after
the decimal point.

The digit-to-character mapping provided by

Character.forDigit

is used.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- string representation of this

BigDecimal

.

**See Also:**
- Character.forDigit(int, int)

,

BigDecimal(java.lang.String)

#### public
String
toEngineeringString()

Returns a string representation of this

BigDecimal

,
using engineering notation if an exponent is needed.

Returns a string that represents the

BigDecimal

as
described in the

toString()

method, except that if
exponential notation is used, the power of ten is adjusted to
be a multiple of three (engineering notation) such that the
integer part of nonzero values will be in the range 1 through
999. If exponential notation is used for zero values, a
decimal point and one or two fractional zero digits are used so
that the scale of the zero value is preserved. Note that
unlike the output of

toString()

, the output of this
method is

not

guaranteed to recover the same [integer,
scale] pair of this

BigDecimal

if the output string is
converting back to a

BigDecimal

using the

string constructor

. The result of this method meets
the weaker constraint of always producing a numerically equal
result from applying the string constructor to the method's output.

**Returns:**
- string representation of this

BigDecimal

, using
engineering notation if an exponent is needed.

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
String
toPlainString()

Returns a string representation of this

BigDecimal

without an exponent field. For values with a positive scale,
the number of digits to the right of the decimal point is used
to indicate scale. For values with a zero or negative scale,
the resulting string is generated as if the value were
converted to a numerically equal value with zero scale and as
if all the trailing zeros of the zero scale value were present
in the result.

The entire string is prefixed by a minus sign character '-'
(

'\u002D'

) if the unscaled value is less than
zero. No sign character is prefixed if the unscaled value is
zero or positive.

Note that if the result of this method is passed to the

string constructor

, only the
numerical value of this

BigDecimal

will necessarily be
recovered; the representation of the new

BigDecimal

may have a different scale. In particular, if this

BigDecimal

has a negative scale, the string resulting
from this method will have a scale of zero when processed by
the string constructor.

(This method behaves analogously to the

toString

method in 1.4 and earlier releases.)

- a string representation of this

BigDecimal

without an exponent field.

Immutable, arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. A

BigDecimal

consists of an arbitrary precision integer

unscaled value

and a 32-bit integer

scale

. If zero
or positive, the scale is the number of digits to the right of the
decimal point. If negative, the unscaled value of the number is
multiplied by ten to the power of the negation of the scale. The
value of the number represented by the

BigDecimal

is
therefore

(unscaledValue × 10

-scale

)

.

The

BigDecimal

class provides operations for
arithmetic, scale manipulation, rounding, comparison, hashing, and
format conversion. The

toString()

method provides a
canonical representation of a

BigDecimal

.

The

BigDecimal

class gives its user complete control
over rounding behavior. If no rounding mode is specified and the
exact result cannot be represented, an exception is thrown;
otherwise, calculations can be carried out to a chosen precision
and rounding mode by supplying an appropriate

MathContext

object to the operation. In either case, eight

rounding
modes

are provided for the control of rounding. Using the
integer fields in this class (such as

ROUND_HALF_UP

) to
represent rounding mode is deprecated; the enumeration values
of the

RoundingMode

enum

, (such as

RoundingMode.HALF_UP

) should be used instead.

When a

MathContext

object is supplied with a precision
setting of 0 (for example,

MathContext.UNLIMITED

),
arithmetic operations are exact, as are the arithmetic methods
which take no

MathContext

object. (This is the only
behavior that was supported in releases prior to 5.) As a
corollary of computing the exact result, the rounding mode setting
of a

MathContext

object with a precision setting of 0 is
not used and thus irrelevant. In the case of divide, the exact
quotient could have an infinitely long decimal expansion; for
example, 1 divided by 3. If the quotient has a nonterminating
decimal expansion and the operation is specified to return an exact
result, an

ArithmeticException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
exact result of the division is returned, as done for other
operations.

When the precision setting is not 0, the rules of

BigDecimal

arithmetic are broadly compatible with selected
modes of operation of the arithmetic defined in ANSI X3.274-1996
and ANSI X3.274-1996/AM 1-2000 (section 7.4). Unlike those
standards,

BigDecimal

includes many rounding modes, which
were mandatory for division in

BigDecimal

releases prior
to 5. Any conflicts between these ANSI standards and the

BigDecimal

specification are resolved in favor of

BigDecimal

.

Since the same numerical value can have different
representations (with different scales), the rules of arithmetic
and rounding must specify both the numerical result and the scale
used in the result's representation.

In general the rounding modes and precision setting determine
how operations return results with a limited number of digits when
the exact result has more digits (perhaps infinitely many in the
case of division and square root) than the number of digits returned.

First, the
total number of digits to return is specified by the

MathContext

's

precision

setting; this determines
the result's

precision

. The digit count starts from the
leftmost nonzero digit of the exact result. The rounding mode
determines how any discarded trailing digits affect the returned
result.

For all arithmetic operators , the operation is carried out as
though an exact intermediate result were first calculated and then
rounded to the number of digits specified by the precision setting
(if necessary), using the selected rounding mode. If the exact
result is not returned, some digit positions of the exact result
are discarded. When rounding increases the magnitude of the
returned result, it is possible for a new digit position to be
created by a carry propagating to a leading "9" digit.
For example, rounding the value 999.9 to three digits rounding up
would be numerically equal to one thousand, represented as
100×10

1

. In such cases, the new "1" is
the leading digit position of the returned result.

Besides a logical exact result, each arithmetic operation has a
preferred scale for representing a result. The preferred
scale for each operation is listed in the table below.

Preferred Scales for Results of Arithmetic Operations

Operation

Preferred Scale of Result

Add

max(addend.scale(), augend.scale())

Subtract

max(minuend.scale(), subtrahend.scale())

Multiply

multiplier.scale() + multiplicand.scale()

Divide

dividend.scale() - divisor.scale()

Square root

radicand.scale()/2

These scales are the ones used by the methods which return exact
arithmetic results; except that an exact divide may have to use a
larger scale since the exact result may have more digits. For
example,

1/32

is

0.03125

.

Before rounding, the scale of the logical exact intermediate
result is the preferred scale for that operation. If the exact
numerical result cannot be represented in

precision

digits, rounding selects the set of digits to return and the scale
of the result is reduced from the scale of the intermediate result
to the least scale which can represent the

precision

digits actually returned. If the exact result can be represented
with at most

precision

digits, the representation
of the result with the scale closest to the preferred scale is
returned. In particular, an exactly representable quotient may be
represented in fewer than

precision

digits by removing
trailing zeros and decreasing the scale. For example, rounding to
three digits using the

floor

rounding mode,

19/100 = 0.19 // integer=19, scale=2

but

21/110 = 0.190 // integer=190, scale=3

Note that for add, subtract, and multiply, the reduction in
scale will equal the number of digit positions of the exact result
which are discarded. If the rounding causes a carry propagation to
create a new high-order digit position, an additional digit of the
result is discarded than when no new digit position is created.

Other methods may have slightly different rounding semantics.
For example, the result of the

pow

method using the

specified algorithm

can
occasionally differ from the rounded mathematical result by more
than one unit in the last place, one

ulp

.

Two types of operations are provided for manipulating the scale
of a

BigDecimal

: scaling/rounding operations and decimal
point motion operations. Scaling/rounding operations (

setScale

and

round

) return a

BigDecimal

whose value is approximately (or exactly) equal
to that of the operand, but whose scale or precision is the
specified value; that is, they increase or decrease the precision
of the stored number with minimal effect on its value. Decimal
point motion operations (

movePointLeft

and

movePointRight

) return a

BigDecimal

created from the operand by moving the decimal
point a specified distance in the specified direction.

For the sake of brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used
throughout the descriptions of

BigDecimal

methods. The
pseudo-code expression

(i + j)

is shorthand for "a

BigDecimal

whose value is that of the

BigDecimal

i

added to that of the

BigDecimal

j

." The pseudo-code expression

(i == j)

is
shorthand for "

true

if and only if the

BigDecimal

i

represents the same value as the

BigDecimal

j

." Other pseudo-code expressions
are interpreted similarly. Square brackets are used to represent
the particular

BigInteger

and scale pair defining a

BigDecimal

value; for example [19, 2] is the

BigDecimal

numerically equal to 0.19 having a scale of 2.

All methods and constructors for this class throw

NullPointerException

when passed a

null

object
reference for any input parameter.

Immutable, arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. A

consists of an arbitrary precision integer

and a 32-bit integer

. If zero
or positive, the scale is the number of digits to the right of the

The

otherwise, calculations can be carried out to a chosen precision

) to
represent rounding mode is deprecated; the enumeration values
of the

, (such as

) should be used instead.

When a

MathContext

object is supplied with a precision
setting of 0 (for example,

),
arithmetic operations are exact, as are the arithmetic methods
which take no

object. (This is the only
behavior that was supported in releases prior to 5.) As a
corollary of computing the exact result, the rounding mode setting

not used and thus irrelevant. In the case of divide, the exact
quotient could have an infinitely long decimal expansion; for
example, 1 divided by 3. If the quotient has a nonterminating
decimal expansion and the operation is specified to return an exact
result, an

ArithmeticException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
exact result of the division is returned, as done for other
operations.

When the precision setting is not 0, the rules of

Since the same numerical value can have different
representations (with different scales), the rules of arithmetic
and rounding must specify both the numerical result and the scale
used in the result's representation.

In general the rounding modes and precision setting determine
how operations return results with a limited number of digits when
the exact result has more digits (perhaps infinitely many in the
case of division and square root) than the number of digits returned.

First, the
total number of digits to return is specified by the

MathContext

's

precision

setting; this determines
the result's

precision

. The digit count starts from the
leftmost nonzero digit of the exact result. The rounding mode
determines how any discarded trailing digits affect the returned
result.

For all arithmetic operators , the operation is carried out as
though an exact intermediate result were first calculated and then
rounded to the number of digits specified by the precision setting
(if necessary), using the selected rounding mode. If the exact
result is not returned, some digit positions of the exact result
are discarded. When rounding increases the magnitude of the
returned result, it is possible for a new digit position to be
created by a carry propagating to a leading "9" digit.
For example, rounding the value 999.9 to three digits rounding up
would be numerically equal to one thousand, represented as
100×10

1

. In such cases, the new "1" is
the leading digit position of the returned result.

Besides a logical exact result, each arithmetic operation has a
preferred scale for representing a result. The preferred
scale for each operation is listed in the table below.

Preferred Scales for Results of Arithmetic Operations

Operation

Preferred Scale of Result

Add

max(addend.scale(), augend.scale())

Subtract

max(minuend.scale(), subtrahend.scale())

Multiply

multiplier.scale() + multiplicand.scale()

Divide

dividend.scale() - divisor.scale()

Square root

radicand.scale()/2

These scales are the ones used by the methods which return exact
arithmetic results; except that an exact divide may have to use a
larger scale since the exact result may have more digits. For
example,

1/32

is

0.03125

.

Before rounding, the scale of the logical exact intermediate
result is the preferred scale for that operation. If the exact
numerical result cannot be represented in

precision

digits, rounding selects the set of digits to return and the scale
of the result is reduced from the scale of the intermediate result
to the least scale which can represent the

precision

digits actually returned. If the exact result can be represented
with at most

precision

digits, the representation
of the result with the scale closest to the preferred scale is
returned. In particular, an exactly representable quotient may be
represented in fewer than

precision

digits by removing
trailing zeros and decreasing the scale. For example, rounding to
three digits using the

floor

rounding mode,

19/100 = 0.19 // integer=19, scale=2

but

21/110 = 0.190 // integer=190, scale=3

Note that for add, subtract, and multiply, the reduction in
scale will equal the number of digit positions of the exact result
which are discarded. If the rounding causes a carry propagation to
create a new high-order digit position, an additional digit of the
result is discarded than when no new digit position is created.

Other methods may have slightly different rounding semantics.
For example, the result of the

pow

method using the

specified algorithm

can
occasionally differ from the rounded mathematical result by more
than one unit in the last place, one

ulp

.

Two types of operations are provided for manipulating the scale

: scaling/rounding operations and decimal
point motion operations. Scaling/rounding operations (

setScale

and

round

) return a

BigDecimal

whose value is approximately (or exactly) equal
to that of the operand, but whose scale or precision is the
specified value; that is, they increase or decrease the precision
of the stored number with minimal effect on its value. Decimal
point motion operations (

movePointLeft

and

movePointRight

) return a

BigDecimal

created from the operand by moving the decimal
point a specified distance in the specified direction.

For the sake of brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used
throughout the descriptions of

BigDecimal

methods. The
pseudo-code expression

(i + j)

is shorthand for "a

BigDecimal

whose value is that of the

BigDecimal

i

added to that of the

BigDecimal

j

." The pseudo-code expression

(i == j)

is
shorthand for "

true

if and only if the

BigDecimal

i

represents the same value as the

BigDecimal

j

." Other pseudo-code expressions
are interpreted similarly. Square brackets are used to represent
the particular

BigInteger

and scale pair defining a

BigDecimal

value; for example [19, 2] is the

BigDecimal

numerically equal to 0.19 having a scale of 2.

All methods and constructors for this class throw

NullPointerException

when passed a

null

object
reference for any input parameter.

The

BigDecimal

class provides operations for
arithmetic, scale manipulation, rounding, comparison, hashing, and
format conversion. The

toString()

method provides a
canonical representation of a

BigDecimal

.

The

BigDecimal

class gives its user complete control
over rounding behavior. If no rounding mode is specified and the
exact result cannot be represented, an exception is thrown;
otherwise, calculations can be carried out to a chosen precision
and rounding mode by supplying an appropriate

MathContext

object to the operation. In either case, eight

rounding
modes

are provided for the control of rounding. Using the
integer fields in this class (such as

ROUND_HALF_UP

) to
represent rounding mode is deprecated; the enumeration values
of the

RoundingMode

enum

, (such as

RoundingMode.HALF_UP

) should be used instead.

When a

MathContext

object is supplied with a precision
setting of 0 (for example,

MathContext.UNLIMITED

),
arithmetic operations are exact, as are the arithmetic methods
which take no

MathContext

object. (This is the only
behavior that was supported in releases prior to 5.) As a
corollary of computing the exact result, the rounding mode setting
of a

MathContext

object with a precision setting of 0 is
not used and thus irrelevant. In the case of divide, the exact
quotient could have an infinitely long decimal expansion; for
example, 1 divided by 3. If the quotient has a nonterminating
decimal expansion and the operation is specified to return an exact
result, an

ArithmeticException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
exact result of the division is returned, as done for other
operations.

When the precision setting is not 0, the rules of

BigDecimal

arithmetic are broadly compatible with selected
modes of operation of the arithmetic defined in ANSI X3.274-1996
and ANSI X3.274-1996/AM 1-2000 (section 7.4). Unlike those
standards,

BigDecimal

includes many rounding modes, which
were mandatory for division in

BigDecimal

releases prior
to 5. Any conflicts between these ANSI standards and the

BigDecimal

specification are resolved in favor of

BigDecimal

.

Since the same numerical value can have different
representations (with different scales), the rules of arithmetic
and rounding must specify both the numerical result and the scale
used in the result's representation.

In general the rounding modes and precision setting determine
how operations return results with a limited number of digits when
the exact result has more digits (perhaps infinitely many in the
case of division and square root) than the number of digits returned.

First, the
total number of digits to return is specified by the

MathContext

's

precision

setting; this determines
the result's

precision

. The digit count starts from the
leftmost nonzero digit of the exact result. The rounding mode
determines how any discarded trailing digits affect the returned
result.

For all arithmetic operators , the operation is carried out as
though an exact intermediate result were first calculated and then
rounded to the number of digits specified by the precision setting
(if necessary), using the selected rounding mode. If the exact
result is not returned, some digit positions of the exact result
are discarded. When rounding increases the magnitude of the
returned result, it is possible for a new digit position to be
created by a carry propagating to a leading "9" digit.
For example, rounding the value 999.9 to three digits rounding up
would be numerically equal to one thousand, represented as
100×10

1

. In such cases, the new "1" is
the leading digit position of the returned result.

Besides a logical exact result, each arithmetic operation has a
preferred scale for representing a result. The preferred
scale for each operation is listed in the table below.

Preferred Scales for Results of Arithmetic Operations

Operation

Preferred Scale of Result

Add

max(addend.scale(), augend.scale())

Subtract

max(minuend.scale(), subtrahend.scale())

Multiply

multiplier.scale() + multiplicand.scale()

Divide

dividend.scale() - divisor.scale()

Square root

radicand.scale()/2

These scales are the ones used by the methods which return exact
arithmetic results; except that an exact divide may have to use a
larger scale since the exact result may have more digits. For
example,

1/32

is

0.03125

.

Before rounding, the scale of the logical exact intermediate
result is the preferred scale for that operation. If the exact
numerical result cannot be represented in

precision

digits, rounding selects the set of digits to return and the scale
of the result is reduced from the scale of the intermediate result
to the least scale which can represent the

precision

digits actually returned. If the exact result can be represented
with at most

precision

digits, the representation
of the result with the scale closest to the preferred scale is
returned. In particular, an exactly representable quotient may be
represented in fewer than

precision

digits by removing
trailing zeros and decreasing the scale. For example, rounding to
three digits using the

floor

rounding mode,

19/100 = 0.19 // integer=19, scale=2

but

21/110 = 0.190 // integer=190, scale=3

Note that for add, subtract, and multiply, the reduction in
scale will equal the number of digit positions of the exact result
which are discarded. If the rounding causes a carry propagation to
create a new high-order digit position, an additional digit of the
result is discarded than when no new digit position is created.

Other methods may have slightly different rounding semantics.
For example, the result of the

pow

method using the

specified algorithm

can
occasionally differ from the rounded mathematical result by more
than one unit in the last place, one

ulp

.

Two types of operations are provided for manipulating the scale
of a

BigDecimal

: scaling/rounding operations and decimal
point motion operations. Scaling/rounding operations (

setScale

and

round

) return a

BigDecimal

whose value is approximately (or exactly) equal
to that of the operand, but whose scale or precision is the
specified value; that is, they increase or decrease the precision
of the stored number with minimal effect on its value. Decimal
point motion operations (

movePointLeft

and

movePointRight

) return a

BigDecimal

created from the operand by moving the decimal
point a specified distance in the specified direction.

setScale

and

round

) return a

BigDecimal

whose value is approximately (or exactly) equal
to that of the operand, but whose scale or precision is the
specified value; that is, they increase or decrease the precision
of the stored number with minimal effect on its value. Decimal
point motion operations (

movePointLeft

and

) return a

BigDecimal

point a specified distance in the specified direction.

For the sake of brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used
throughout the descriptions of

BigDecimal

methods. The
pseudo-code expression

(i + j)

is shorthand for "a

BigDecimal

whose value is that of the

BigDecimal

i

added to that of the

BigDecimal

j

." The pseudo-code expression

(i == j)

is
shorthand for "

true

if and only if the

BigDecimal

i

represents the same value as the

BigDecimal

j

." Other pseudo-code expressions
are interpreted similarly. Square brackets are used to represent
the particular

BigInteger

and scale pair defining a

BigDecimal

value; for example [19, 2] is the

BigDecimal

numerically equal to 0.19 having a scale of 2.

All methods and constructors for this class throw

In general the rounding modes and precision setting determine
how operations return results with a limited number of digits when
the exact result has more digits (perhaps infinitely many in the
case of division and square root) than the number of digits returned.

First, the
total number of digits to return is specified by the

MathContext

's

precision

setting; this determines
the result's

precision

. The digit count starts from the
leftmost nonzero digit of the exact result. The rounding mode
determines how any discarded trailing digits affect the returned
result.

For all arithmetic operators , the operation is carried out as
though an exact intermediate result were first calculated and then
rounded to the number of digits specified by the precision setting
(if necessary), using the selected rounding mode. If the exact
result is not returned, some digit positions of the exact result
are discarded. When rounding increases the magnitude of the
returned result, it is possible for a new digit position to be
created by a carry propagating to a leading "9" digit.
For example, rounding the value 999.9 to three digits rounding up
would be numerically equal to one thousand, represented as
100×10

1

. In such cases, the new "1" is
the leading digit position of the returned result.

Besides a logical exact result, each arithmetic operation has a
preferred scale for representing a result. The preferred
scale for each operation is listed in the table below.

Preferred Scales for Results of Arithmetic Operations

Operation

Preferred Scale of Result

Add

max(addend.scale(), augend.scale())

Subtract

max(minuend.scale(), subtrahend.scale())

Multiply

multiplier.scale() + multiplicand.scale()

Divide

dividend.scale() - divisor.scale()

Square root

radicand.scale()/2

These scales are the ones used by the methods which return exact
arithmetic results; except that an exact divide may have to use a
larger scale since the exact result may have more digits. For
example,

1/32

is

0.03125

.

Before rounding, the scale of the logical exact intermediate
result is the preferred scale for that operation. If the exact
numerical result cannot be represented in

precision

digits, rounding selects the set of digits to return and the scale
of the result is reduced from the scale of the intermediate result
to the least scale which can represent the

precision

digits actually returned. If the exact result can be represented
with at most

precision

digits, the representation
of the result with the scale closest to the preferred scale is
returned. In particular, an exactly representable quotient may be
represented in fewer than

precision

digits by removing
trailing zeros and decreasing the scale. For example, rounding to
three digits using the

floor

rounding mode,

19/100 = 0.19 // integer=19, scale=2

but

21/110 = 0.190 // integer=190, scale=3

Note that for add, subtract, and multiply, the reduction in
scale will equal the number of digit positions of the exact result
which are discarded. If the rounding causes a carry propagation to
create a new high-order digit position, an additional digit of the
result is discarded than when no new digit position is created.

Other methods may have slightly different rounding semantics.
For example, the result of the

pow

method using the

specified algorithm

can
occasionally differ from the rounded mathematical result by more
than one unit in the last place, one

ulp

.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- BigDecimal

```java
public BigDecimal​(char[] in,
int offset,
int len)
```

Translates a character array representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

, accepting the
same sequence of characters as the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, while allowing a sub-array to be specified.

**Implementation Note:** If the sequence of characters is already available
within a character array, using this constructor is faster than
converting the

char

array to string and using the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor.
**Parameters:** in

-

char

array that is the source of characters.
**Parameters:** offset

- first character in the array to inspect.
**Parameters:** len

- number of characters to consider.
**Throws:** NumberFormatException

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, while allowing a sub-array to be specified and
with rounding according to the context settings.

**Implementation Note:** If the sequence of characters is already available

Translates a character array representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

, accepting the
same sequence of characters as the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor.

**Implementation Note:** If the sequence of characters is already available
as a character array, using this constructor is faster than

```java
public BigDecimal​(char[] in,

MathContext

```

Translates a character array representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

, accepting the
same sequence of characters as the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor and with rounding according to the context
settings.

**Implementation Note:** If the sequence of characters is already available
as a character array, using this constructor is faster than
converting the

char

array to string and using the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor.
**Parameters:** in

-

char

array that is the source of characters.
**Parameters:** mc

- the context to use.
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

rounding mode is

UNNECESSARY

.
**Throws:** NumberFormatException

- if

in

is not a valid
representation of a

BigDecimal

.
**Since:** 1.5

- BigDecimal

```java
public BigDecimal​(
String
val)
```

Translates the string representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

. The string representation consists
of an optional sign,

'+'

(

'\u002B'

) or

'-'

(

'\u002D'

), followed by a sequence of
zero or more decimal digits ("the integer"), optionally
followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent.

The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero
or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one
digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed
by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the

significand

.

The exponent consists of the character

'e'

(

'\u0065'

) or

'E'

(

'\u0045'

)
followed by one or more decimal digits. The value of the
exponent must lie between -

Integer.MAX_VALUE

(

Integer.MIN_VALUE

+1) and

Integer.MAX_VALUE

, inclusive.

More formally, the strings this constructor accepts are
described by the following grammar:

The scale of the returned

BigDecimal

will be the
number of digits in the fraction, or zero if the string
contains no decimal point, subject to adjustment for any
exponent; if the string contains an exponent, the exponent is
subtracted from the scale. The value of the resulting scale
must lie between

Integer.MIN_VALUE

and

Integer.MAX_VALUE

, inclusive.

The character-to-digit mapping is provided by

Character.digit(char, int)

set to convert to radix 10. The
String may not contain any extraneous characters (whitespace,
for example).

Examples:

The value of the returned

BigDecimal

is equal to

significand

× 10

exponent

.
For each string on the left, the resulting representation
[

BigInteger

,

scale

] is shown on the right.

```java
"0" [0,0]
"0.00" [0,2]
"123" [123,0]
"-123" [-123,0]
"1.23E3" [123,-1]
"1.23E+3" [123,-1]
"12.3E+7" [123,-6]
"12.0" [120,1]
"12.3" [123,1]
"0.00123" [123,5]
"-1.23E-12" [-123,14]
"1234.5E-4" [12345,5]
"0E+7" [0,-7]
"-0" [0,0]
```

**API Note:** For values other than

float

and

double

NaN and ±Infinity, this constructor is
compatible with the values returned by

Float.toString(float)

and

Double.toString(double)

. This is generally the preferred
way to convert a

float

or

double

into a
BigDecimal, as it doesn't suffer from the unpredictability of
the

BigDecimal(double)

constructor.
**Parameters:** val

- String representation of

BigDecimal

.
**Throws:** NumberFormatException

- if

val

is not a valid
representation of a

BigDecimal

.

- BigDecimal

```java
public BigDecimal​(
String
val,

MathContext
mc)
```

Translates the string representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

, accepting the same strings as the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, with rounding
according to the context settings.

**Parameters:** val

- string representation of a

BigDecimal

.
**Parameters:** mc

- the context to use.
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if the result is inexact but the
rounding mode is

UNNECESSARY

.
**Throws:** NumberFormatException

- if

val

is not a valid
representation of a BigDecimal.
**Since:** 1.5

- BigDecimal

```java
public BigDecimal​(double val)
```

Translates a

double

into a

BigDecimal

which
is the exact decimal representation of the

double

's
binary floating-point value. The scale of the returned

BigDecimal

is the smallest value such that

(10

scale

× val)

is an integer.

Notes:

- The results of this constructor can be somewhat unpredictable.
One might assume that writing

new BigDecimal(0.1)

in
Java creates a

BigDecimal

which is exactly equal to
0.1 (an unscaled value of 1, with a scale of 1), but it is
actually equal to
0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.
This is because 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a

double

(or, for that matter, as a binary fraction of
any finite length). Thus, the value that is being passed

in

to the constructor is not exactly equal to 0.1,
appearances notwithstanding.

The

String

constructor, on the other hand, is
perfectly predictable: writing

new BigDecimal("0.1")

creates a

BigDecimal

which is

exactly

equal to
0.1, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally
recommended that the

String constructor

be used in preference to this one.

When a

double

must be used as a source for a

BigDecimal

, note that this constructor provides an
exact conversion; it does not give the same result as
converting the

double

to a

String

using the

Double.toString(double)

method and then using the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor. To get that result,
use the

static

valueOf(double)

method.

**Parameters:** val

-

double

value to be converted to

BigDecimal

.
**Throws:** NumberFormatException

- if

val

is infinite or NaN.

- BigDecimal

public BigDecimal​(double val,

MathContext
mc)
```

Translates a

double

and its use is generally not recommended; see the notes under
the

BigDecimal(double)

constructor.

BigDecimal

array containing the
result of

divideToIntegralValue

followed by the result of

```

Returns an approximation to the square root of

this

with rounding according to the context settings.

The preferred scale of the returned result is equal to

this.scale()/2

. The value of the returned result is

- pow

```java
public
BigDecimal
pow​(int n)
```

Returns a

BigDecimal

whose value is

(this

)

, The power is computed exactly, to
unlimited precision.

The parameter

n

must be in the range 0 through
999999999, inclusive.

```

Returns a

BigDecimal

whose value is

. The current implementation uses
the core algorithm defined in ANSI standard X3.274-1996 with
rounding according to the context settings. In general, the
returned numerical value is within two ulps of the exact
numerical value for the chosen precision. Note that future
releases may use a different algorithm with a decreased
allowable error bound and increased allowable exponent range.

The X3.274-1996 algorithm is:

- An

ArithmeticException

exception is thrown if

- abs(n) > 999999999

mc.precision == 0

and

n < 0

mc.precision > 0

and

n

has more than

mc.precision

decimal digits

if

n

is zero,

ONE

is returned even if

this

is zero, otherwise

- if

n

is positive, the result is calculated via
the repeated squaring technique into a single accumulator.
The individual multiplications with the accumulator use the
same math context settings as in

mc

except for a
precision increased to

mc.precision + elength + 1

where

elength

is the number of decimal digits in

n

.

if

n

is negative, the result is calculated as if

n

were positive; this value is then divided into one
using the working precision specified above.

The final value from either the positive or negative case
is then rounded to the destination precision.

roundingMode)
```

Returns a

BigDecimal

whose scale is the specified
value, and whose unscaled value is determined by multiplying or
dividing this

BigDecimal

's unscaled value by the
appropriate power of ten to maintain its overall value. If the
scale is reduced by the operation, the unscaled value must be
divided (rather than multiplied), and the value may be changed;
in this case, the specified rounding mode is applied to the
division.

**API Note:** Since BigDecimal objects are immutable, calls of
this method do

not

result in the original object being

```

Returns a

BigDecimal

whose scale is the specified
value, and whose value is numerically equal to this

BigDecimal

's. Throws an

ArithmeticException

if this is not possible.

This call is typically used to increase the scale, in which
case it is guaranteed that there exists a

BigDecimal

of the specified scale and the correct value. The call can
also be used to reduce the scale if the caller knows that the

BigDecimal

has sufficiently many zeros at the end of
its fractional part (i.e., factors of ten in its integer value)
to allow for the rescaling without changing its value.

This method returns the same result as the two-argument
versions of

setScale

, but saves the caller the trouble
of specifying a rounding mode in cases where it is irrelevant.

**API Note:** Since

BigDecimal

objects are immutable,
calls of this method do

not

result in the original
object being modified, contrary to the usual convention of
having methods named

which is equivalent to this one
with the decimal point moved

n

places to the left. If

)

and scale

max(this.scale()+n,
0)

.

**Parameters:** n

BigDecimal

which is equivalent to this one
with the decimal point moved

n

places to the right.
If

n

is non-negative, the call merely subtracts

n

is equivalent to

movePointLeft(-n)

. The

BigDecimal

returned by this call has value

(this

- stripTrailingZeros

```java
public
BigDecimal
stripTrailingZeros()
```

representation. For example, stripping the trailing zeros from
the

BigDecimal

value

600.0

, which has
[

BigInteger

,

scale

] components equals to
[6000, 1], yields

6E2

with [

this BigDecimal is numerically equal to zero, then

BigDecimal.ZERO

is returned.

```

Compares this

BigDecimal

with the specified

BigDecimal

. Two

BigDecimal

objects that are
equal in value but have a different scale (like 2.0 and 2.00)
are considered equal by this method. This method is provided
in preference to individual methods for each of the six boolean
comparison operators (<, ==,
>, >=, !=, <=). The
suggested idiom for performing these comparisons is:

(x.compareTo(y)

<

op

>

0)

, where
<

op

> is one of the six comparison operators.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

BigDecimal

-

BigDecimal

to which this

BigDecimal

is
to be compared.

is numerically
less than, equal to, or greater than

val

.

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
x)
```

Compares this

BigDecimal

with the specified

Object

for equality. Unlike

compareTo

, this method considers two

BigDecimal

objects equal only if they are equal in
value and scale (thus 2.0 is not equal to 2.00 when compared by
this method).

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** x

-

Object

to which this

BigDecimal

is
to be compared.
**Returns:** true

if and only if the specified

Object

is a

BigDecimal

compareTo

method,

this

is returned.

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code for this

BigDecimal

. Note that
two

BigDecimal

objects that are numerically equal but
differ in scale (like 2.0 and 2.00) will generally

not

have the same hash code.

**Overrides:** hashCode

Object
**Returns:** hash code for this

BigDecimal

.
**See Also:** equals(Object)

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the string representation of this

BigDecimal

,
using scientific notation if an exponent is needed.

A standard canonical string form of the

BigDecimal

is created as though by the following steps: first, the
absolute value of the unscaled value of the

BigDecimal

is converted to a string in base ten using the characters

'0'

through

'9'

with no leading zeros (except
if its value is zero, in which case a single

'0'

character is used).

Next, an

adjusted exponent

is calculated; this is the
negated scale, plus the number of characters in the converted
unscaled value, less one. That is,

-scale+(ulength-1)

, where

ulength

is the
length of the absolute value of the unscaled value in decimal
digits (its

precision

).

If the scale is greater than or equal to zero and the
adjusted exponent is greater than or equal to

-6

, the
number will be converted to a character form without using
exponential notation. In this case, if the scale is zero then
no decimal point is added and if the scale is positive a
decimal point will be inserted with the scale specifying the
number of characters to the right of the decimal point.

'0'

characters are added to the left of the converted
unscaled value as necessary. If no character precedes the
decimal point after this insertion then a conventional

'0'

character is prefixed.

Otherwise (that is, if the scale is negative, or the
adjusted exponent is less than

-6

), the number will be
converted to a character form using exponential notation. In
this case, if the converted

BigInteger

has more than
one digit a decimal point is inserted after the first digit.
An exponent in character form is then suffixed to the converted
unscaled value (perhaps with inserted decimal point); this
comprises the letter

'E'

followed immediately by the
adjusted exponent converted to a character form. The latter is
in base ten, using the characters

'0'

through

'9'

with no leading zeros, and is always prefixed by a
sign character

'-'

(

'\u002D'

) if the
adjusted exponent is negative,

'+'

(

'\u002B'

) otherwise).

Finally, the entire string is prefixed by a minus sign
character

'-'

(

'\u002D'

) if the unscaled
value is less than zero. No sign character is prefixed if the
unscaled value is zero or positive.

Examples:

For each representation [

unscaled value

,

scale

]
on the left, the resulting string is shown on the right.

```java
[123,0] "123"
[-123,0] "-123"
[123,-1] "1.23E+3"
[123,-3] "1.23E+5"
[123,1] "12.3"
[123,5] "0.00123"
[123,10] "1.23E-8"
[-123,12] "-1.23E-10"
```

Notes:

- There is a one-to-one mapping between the distinguishable

BigDecimal

values and the result of this conversion.
That is, every distinguishable

BigDecimal

value
(unscaled value and scale) has a unique string representation
as a result of using

toString

. If that string
representation is converted back to a

BigDecimal

using
the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, then the original
value will be recovered.

The string produced for a given number is always the same;
it is not affected by locale. This means that it can be used
as a canonical string representation for exchanging decimal
data, or as a key for a Hashtable, etc. Locale-sensitive
number formatting and parsing is handled by the

NumberFormat

class and its subclasses.

The

toEngineeringString()

method may be used for
presenting numbers with exponents in engineering notation, and the

setScale

method may be used for
rounding a

BigDecimal

so it has a known number of digits after
the decimal point.

The digit-to-character mapping provided by

Character.forDigit

is used.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** string representation of this

BigDecimal

.
**See Also:** Character.forDigit(int, int)

,

BigDecimal(java.lang.String)

- toEngineeringString

```java
public
String
toEngineeringString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

BigDecimal

,
using engineering notation if an exponent is needed.

Returns a string that represents the

BigDecimal

as
described in the

toString()

method, except that if
exponential notation is used, the power of ten is adjusted to
be a multiple of three (engineering notation) such that the
integer part of nonzero values will be in the range 1 through
999. If exponential notation is used for zero values, a
decimal point and one or two fractional zero digits are used so
that the scale of the zero value is preserved. Note that
unlike the output of

toString()

, the output of this
method is

not

guaranteed to recover the same [integer,
scale] pair of this

BigDecimal

if the output string is
converting back to a

BigDecimal

using the

string constructor

. The result of this method meets
the weaker constraint of always producing a numerically equal
result from applying the string constructor to the method's output.

**Returns:** string representation of this

BigDecimal

, using
engineering notation if an exponent is needed.
**Since:** 1.5

- toPlainString

```java
public
String
toPlainString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

BigDecimal

without an exponent field. For values with a positive scale,
the number of digits to the right of the decimal point is used
to indicate scale. For values with a zero or negative scale,
the resulting string is generated as if the value were
converted to a numerically equal value with zero scale and as
if all the trailing zeros of the zero scale value were present
in the result.

The entire string is prefixed by a minus sign character '-'
(

'\u002D'

) if the unscaled value is less than
zero. No sign character is prefixed if the unscaled value is
zero or positive.

Note that if the result of this method is passed to the

string constructor

, only the
numerical value of this

BigDecimal

will necessarily be
recovered; the representation of the new

BigDecimal

may have a different scale. In particular, if this

BigDecimal

has a negative scale, the string resulting
from this method will have a scale of zero when processed by
the string constructor.

(This method behaves analogously to the

toString

method in 1.4 and earlier releases.)

**Returns:** a string representation of this

BigDecimal

without an exponent field.

**Since:** 1.5

- BigDecimal

```java
public BigDecimal​(
String
val)
```

Translates the string representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

. The string representation consists
of an optional sign,

'+'

(

'\u002B'

) or

'-'

(

'\u002D'

), followed by a sequence of
zero or more decimal digits ("the integer"), optionally
followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent.

The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero
or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one
digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed
by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the

significand

.

The exponent consists of the character

'e'

(

'\u0065'

) or

'E'

(

'\u0045'

)
followed by one or more decimal digits. The value of the
exponent must lie between -

Integer.MAX_VALUE

(

Integer.MIN_VALUE

+1) and

Integer.MAX_VALUE

, inclusive.

More formally, the strings this constructor accepts are
described by the following grammar:

The scale of the returned

BigDecimal

will be the
number of digits in the fraction, or zero if the string
contains no decimal point, subject to adjustment for any
exponent; if the string contains an exponent, the exponent is
subtracted from the scale. The value of the resulting scale
must lie between

Integer.MIN_VALUE

and

Integer.MAX_VALUE

, inclusive.

The character-to-digit mapping is provided by

Character.digit(char, int)

set to convert to radix 10. The
String may not contain any extraneous characters (whitespace,
for example).

Examples:

The value of the returned

BigDecimal

is equal to

significand

× 10

exponent

.
For each string on the left, the resulting representation
[

BigInteger

,

scale

] is shown on the right.

**API Note:** For values other than

float

and

double

NaN and ±Infinity, this constructor is
compatible with the values returned by

Float.toString(float)

and

Double.toString(double)

. This is generally the preferred
way to convert a

float

or

double

into a
BigDecimal, as it doesn't suffer from the unpredictability of
the

BigDecimal(double)

constructor.
**Parameters:** val

- String representation of

BigDecimal

.
**Throws:** NumberFormatException

- if

val

is not a valid
representation of a

BigDecimal

.

- BigDecimal

```java
public BigDecimal​(
String
val,

MathContext
mc)
```

Translates the string representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

, accepting the same strings as the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, with rounding
according to the context settings.

**Parameters:** val

- string representation of a

BigDecimal

.
**Parameters:** mc

- the context to use.
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if the result is inexact but the
rounding mode is

UNNECESSARY

.
**Throws:** NumberFormatException

- if

val

is not a valid
representation of a BigDecimal.
**Since:** 1.5

- BigDecimal

```java
public BigDecimal​(double val)
```

Translates a

double

into a

BigDecimal

which
is the exact decimal representation of the

double

's
binary floating-point value. The scale of the returned

BigDecimal

is the smallest value such that

(10

scale

× val)

is an integer.

Notes:

- The results of this constructor can be somewhat unpredictable.
One might assume that writing

new BigDecimal(0.1)

in
Java creates a

BigDecimal

which is exactly equal to
0.1 (an unscaled value of 1, with a scale of 1), but it is
actually equal to
0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.
This is because 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a

double

(or, for that matter, as a binary fraction of
any finite length). Thus, the value that is being passed

in

to the constructor is not exactly equal to 0.1,
appearances notwithstanding.

The

String

constructor, on the other hand, is
perfectly predictable: writing

new BigDecimal("0.1")

creates a

BigDecimal

which is

exactly

equal to
0.1, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally
recommended that the

String constructor

be used in preference to this one.

When a

double

must be used as a source for a

BigDecimal

, note that this constructor provides an
exact conversion; it does not give the same result as
converting the

double

to a

String

using the

Double.toString(double)

method and then using the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor. To get that result,
use the

static

valueOf(double)

method.

**Parameters:** val

-

double

val

is infinite or NaN.

- BigDecimal

```

Translates a

BigDecimal(String)

constructor and with rounding according to the context
settings.

BigDecimal

```java
public BigDecimal​(
String
val)
```

Translates the string representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

. The string representation consists
of an optional sign,

'+'

(

'\u002B'

) or

'-'

(

'\u002D'

), followed by a sequence of
zero or more decimal digits ("the integer"), optionally
followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent.

The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero
or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one
digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed
by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the

significand

.

The exponent consists of the character

'e'

(

'\u0065'

) or

'E'

(

'\u0045'

)
followed by one or more decimal digits. The value of the
exponent must lie between -

Integer.MAX_VALUE

(

Integer.MIN_VALUE

+1) and

Integer.MAX_VALUE

, inclusive.

More formally, the strings this constructor accepts are
described by the following grammar:

The scale of the returned

BigDecimal

will be the
number of digits in the fraction, or zero if the string
contains no decimal point, subject to adjustment for any
exponent; if the string contains an exponent, the exponent is
subtracted from the scale. The value of the resulting scale
must lie between

Integer.MIN_VALUE

and

Integer.MAX_VALUE

, inclusive.

The character-to-digit mapping is provided by

Character.digit(char, int)

set to convert to radix 10. The
String may not contain any extraneous characters (whitespace,
for example).

Examples:

The value of the returned

BigDecimal

is equal to

significand

public BigDecimal​(

String

val,

MathContext

mc)

Translates the string representation of a

BigDecimal

into a

BigDecimal

, accepting the same strings as the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, with rounding
according to the context settings.

BigDecimal

```java
public BigDecimal​(double val)
```

Translates a

double

into a

BigDecimal

which
is the exact decimal representation of the

double

's
binary floating-point value. The scale of the returned

BigDecimal

is the smallest value such that

(10

scale

× val)

is an integer.

Notes:

- The results of this constructor can be somewhat unpredictable.
One might assume that writing

new BigDecimal(0.1)

in
Java creates a

BigDecimal

which is exactly equal to
0.1 (an unscaled value of 1, with a scale of 1), but it is
actually equal to
0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.
This is because 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a

double

(or, for that matter, as a binary fraction of
any finite length). Thus, the value that is being passed

in

to the constructor is not exactly equal to 0.1,
appearances notwithstanding.

The

String

constructor, on the other hand, is
perfectly predictable: writing

new BigDecimal("0.1")

creates a

BigDecimal

which is

exactly

equal to
0.1, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally
recommended that the

String constructor

be used in preference to this one.

When a

double

must be used as a source for a

BigDecimal

, note that this constructor provides an
exact conversion; it does not give the same result as
converting the

double

to a

String

using the

Double.toString(double)

method and then using the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor. To get that result,
use the

static

valueOf(double)

method.

**Parameters:** val

-

double

value to be converted to

BigDecimal

.
**Throws:** NumberFormatException

- if

val

is infinite or NaN.

followed by the result of

remainder

on the two operands.

Note that if both the integer quotient and remainder are
needed, this method is faster than using the

methods
separately because the division need only be carried out once.

**Parameters:** divisor

- value by which this

BigDecimal

is to be divided,
and the remainder computed.
**Returns:** a two element

BigDecimal

array: the quotient
(the result of

divideToIntegralValue

) is the initial element
and the remainder is the final element.
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

```

Returns a two-element

BigDecimal

array containing the
result of

divideToIntegralValue

followed by the result of

remainder

on the two operands calculated with rounding
according to the context settings.

Note that if both the integer quotient and remainder are
needed, this method is faster than using the

divideToIntegralValue

and

methods
separately because the division need only be carried out once.

**Parameters:** divisor

- value by which this

BigDecimal

is to be divided,
and the remainder computed.
**Parameters:** mc

- the context to use.
**Returns:** a two element

BigDecimal

array: the quotient
(the result of

) is the
initial element and the remainder is the final element.
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if

divisor==0
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if the result is inexact but the
rounding mode is

- sqrt

```java
public
BigDecimal
sqrt​(
MathContext
mc)
```

Returns an approximation to the square root of

this

with rounding according to the context settings.

The preferred scale of the returned result is equal to

this.scale()/2

. The value of the returned result is
always within one ulp of the exact decimal value for the
precision in question. If the rounding mode is

HALF_UP

,

HALF_DOWN

, or

HALF_EVEN

, the
result is within one half an ulp of the exact decimal value.

Special case:

- The square root of a number numerically equal to

ZERO

is numerically equal to

ZERO

with a preferred
scale according to the general rule above. In particular, for

ZERO

,

ZERO.sqrt(mc).equals(ZERO)

is true with
any

MathContext

as an argument.

**Parameters:** mc

- the context to use.
**Returns:** the square root of

this

.
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if

this

is less than zero.
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if an exact result is requested
(

mc.getPrecision()==0

) and there is no finite decimal
expansion of the exact result
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

(mc.getRoundingMode()==RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY

) and
the exact result cannot fit in

mc.getPrecision()

digits.

- pow

```java
public
BigDecimal
pow​(int n)
```

Returns a

BigDecimal

whose value is

(this

n

)

, The power is computed exactly, to
unlimited precision.

The parameter

n

must be in the range 0 through
999999999, inclusive.

ZERO.pow(0)

returns

.

Note that future releases may expand the allowable exponent
range of this method.

- pow

```java
public
BigDecimal

```

Returns a

BigDecimal

whose value is

(this

n

)

. The current implementation uses
the core algorithm defined in ANSI standard X3.274-1996 with
rounding according to the context settings. In general, the
returned numerical value is within two ulps of the exact
numerical value for the chosen precision. Note that future
releases may use a different algorithm with a decreased
allowable error bound and increased allowable exponent range.

The X3.274-1996 algorithm is:

- An

ArithmeticException

exception is thrown if

- abs(n) > 999999999

mc.precision == 0

and

n < 0

mc.precision > 0

and

n

has more than

mc.precision

decimal digits

if

n

is zero,

ONE

is returned even if

this

is zero, otherwise

- if

n

is positive, the result is calculated via
the repeated squaring technique into a single accumulator.
The individual multiplications with the accumulator use the
same math context settings as in

mc

except for a
precision increased to

mc.precision + elength + 1

where

elength

is the number of decimal digits in

n

.

if

n

is negative, the result is calculated as if

n

were positive; this value is then divided into one
using the working precision specified above.

The final value from either the positive or negative case
is then rounded to the destination precision.

**Parameters:** n

```

Returns a

BigDecimal

whose scale is the specified
value, and whose unscaled value is determined by multiplying or
dividing this

BigDecimal

's unscaled value by the
appropriate power of ten to maintain its overall value. If the
scale is reduced by the operation, the unscaled value must be
divided (rather than multiplied), and the value may be changed;
in this case, the specified rounding mode is applied to the
division.

**API Note:** Since BigDecimal objects are immutable, calls of
this method do

not

result in the original object being
modified, contrary to the usual convention of having methods
named

```java
public
BigDecimal
setScale​(int newScale)
```

Returns a

BigDecimal

whose scale is the specified
value, and whose value is numerically equal to this

BigDecimal

's. Throws an

ArithmeticException

if this is not possible.

This call is typically used to increase the scale, in which
case it is guaranteed that there exists a

BigDecimal

of the specified scale and the correct value. The call can
also be used to reduce the scale if the caller knows that the

BigDecimal

has sufficiently many zeros at the end of
its fractional part (i.e., factors of ten in its integer value)
to allow for the rescaling without changing its value.

This method returns the same result as the two-argument
versions of

setScale

, but saves the caller the trouble
of specifying a rounding mode in cases where it is irrelevant.

**API Note:** Since

BigDecimal

objects are immutable,
calls of this method do

not

result in the original
object being modified, contrary to the usual convention of
having methods named

set

X

X

. Instead,

setScale

returns an
object with the proper scale; the returned object may or may

**Parameters:** newScale

- scale of the

BigDecimal

value to be returned.
**Returns:** a

BigDecimal

whose scale is the specified value, and
whose unscaled value is determined by multiplying or dividing
this

BigDecimal

's unscaled value by the appropriate

- movePointLeft

```java
public
BigDecimal
movePointLeft​(int n)
```

Returns a

BigDecimal

which is equivalent to this one
with the decimal point moved

n

places to the left. If

n

is non-negative, the call merely adds

n

to
the scale. If

n

is negative, the call is equivalent
to

movePointRight(-n)

. The

BigDecimal

returned by this call has value

(this ×
10

-n

)

and scale

max(this.scale()+n,
0)

.

**Parameters:** n

- number of places to move the decimal point to the left.
**Returns:** a

BigDecimal

which is equivalent to this one with the
decimal point moved

n

places to the left.
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if scale overflows.

- movePointRight

```java
public
BigDecimal
movePointRight​(int n)
```

Returns a

BigDecimal

which is equivalent to this one
with the decimal point moved

n

places to the right.
If

n

is non-negative, the call merely subtracts

n

from the scale. If

n

is negative, the call
is equivalent to

movePointLeft(-n)

. The

BigDecimal

returned by this call has value

(this
× 10

n

)

and scale

max(this.scale()-n,
0)

.

**Parameters:** n

the result is

(this.scale() - n)

.

**Parameters:** n

- the exponent power of ten to scale by
**Returns:** a BigDecimal whose numerical value is equal to
(

this

)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if the scale would be
outside the range of a 32-bit integer.
**Since:** 1.5

- stripTrailingZeros

```java
public
BigDecimal
stripTrailingZeros()
```

Returns a

BigDecimal

which is numerically equal to
this one but with any trailing zeros removed from the
representation. For example, stripping the trailing zeros from
the

BigDecimal

value

600.0

, which has
[

BigInteger

,

scale

] components equals to
[6000, 1], yields

6E2

with [

BigInteger

,

scale

] components equals to [6, -2]. If
this BigDecimal is numerically equal to zero, then

BigDecimal.ZERO

is returned.

**Returns:** a numerically equal

BigDecimal

with any
trailing zeros removed.
**Since:** 1.5

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
BigDecimal
val)
```

Compares this

BigDecimal

with the specified

BigDecimal

. Two

BigDecimal

objects that are
equal in value but have a different scale (like 2.0 and 2.00)
are considered equal by this method. This method is provided
in preference to individual methods for each of the six boolean
comparison operators (<, ==,
>, >=, !=, <=). The
suggested idiom for performing these comparisons is:

(x.compareTo(y)

<

op

>

0)

, where
<

op

> is one of the six comparison operators.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

BigDecimal

>
**Parameters:** val

-

BigDecimal

to which this

BigDecimal

is
to be compared.
**Returns:** -1, 0, or 1 as this

BigDecimal

is numerically
less than, equal to, or greater than

val

.

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
x)
```

Compares this

BigDecimal

with the specified

Object

for equality. Unlike

compareTo

, this method considers two

BigDecimal

objects equal only if they are equal in
value and scale (thus 2.0 is not equal to 2.00 when compared by
this method).

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** x

-

Object

to which this

BigDecimal

is
to be compared.
**Returns:** true

if and only if the specified

Object

is a

BigDecimal

whose value and scale are equal to this

BigDecimal

's.

BigDecimal

and

. If they are equal,
as defined by the

compareTo

method,

this

is returned.

**Returns:** the

BigDecimal

whose value is the greater of this

BigDecimal

and

val

as defined by the

compareTo

method,

this

is returned.
**See Also:** compareTo(java.math.BigDecimal)

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code for this

BigDecimal

. Note that
two

BigDecimal

objects that are numerically equal but
differ in scale (like 2.0 and 2.00) will generally

not

have the same hash code.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** hash code for this

BigDecimal

.
**See Also:** equals(Object)

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the string representation of this

BigDecimal

,
using scientific notation if an exponent is needed.

A standard canonical string form of the

BigDecimal

is created as though by the following steps: first, the
absolute value of the unscaled value of the

BigDecimal

is converted to a string in base ten using the characters

'0'

through

'9'

with no leading zeros (except
if its value is zero, in which case a single

'0'

character is used).

Next, an

adjusted exponent

is calculated; this is the
negated scale, plus the number of characters in the converted
unscaled value, less one. That is,

-scale+(ulength-1)

, where

ulength

is the
length of the absolute value of the unscaled value in decimal
digits (its

precision

).

If the scale is greater than or equal to zero and the
adjusted exponent is greater than or equal to

-6

, the
number will be converted to a character form without using
exponential notation. In this case, if the scale is zero then
no decimal point is added and if the scale is positive a
decimal point will be inserted with the scale specifying the
number of characters to the right of the decimal point.

'0'

characters are added to the left of the converted
unscaled value as necessary. If no character precedes the
decimal point after this insertion then a conventional

'0'

character is prefixed.

Otherwise (that is, if the scale is negative, or the
adjusted exponent is less than

-6

), the number will be
converted to a character form using exponential notation. In
this case, if the converted

BigInteger

has more than
one digit a decimal point is inserted after the first digit.
An exponent in character form is then suffixed to the converted
unscaled value (perhaps with inserted decimal point); this
comprises the letter

'E'

followed immediately by the
adjusted exponent converted to a character form. The latter is
in base ten, using the characters

'0'

through

'9'

with no leading zeros, and is always prefixed by a
sign character

'-'

(

'\u002D'

) if the
adjusted exponent is negative,

'+'

(

'\u002B'

) otherwise).

Finally, the entire string is prefixed by a minus sign
character

'-'

(

'\u002D'

) if the unscaled
value is less than zero. No sign character is prefixed if the
unscaled value is zero or positive.

Examples:

For each representation [

unscaled value

,

scale

]
on the left, the resulting string is shown on the right.

```java
[123,0] "123"
[-123,0] "-123"
[123,-1] "1.23E+3"
[123,-3] "1.23E+5"
[123,1] "12.3"
[123,5] "0.00123"
[123,10] "1.23E-8"
[-123,12] "-1.23E-10"
```

Notes:

- There is a one-to-one mapping between the distinguishable

BigDecimal

values and the result of this conversion.
That is, every distinguishable

BigDecimal

value
(unscaled value and scale) has a unique string representation
as a result of using

toString

. If that string
representation is converted back to a

BigDecimal

using
the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, then the original
value will be recovered.

The string produced for a given number is always the same;
it is not affected by locale. This means that it can be used
as a canonical string representation for exchanging decimal
data, or as a key for a Hashtable, etc. Locale-sensitive
number formatting and parsing is handled by the

NumberFormat

class and its subclasses.

The

toEngineeringString()

method may be used for
presenting numbers with exponents in engineering notation, and the

setScale

method may be used for
rounding a

BigDecimal

so it has a known number of digits after
the decimal point.

The digit-to-character mapping provided by

Character.forDigit

is used.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** string representation of this

BigDecimal

.
**See Also:** Character.forDigit(int, int)

,

BigDecimal(java.lang.String)

- toEngineeringString

```java
public
String
toEngineeringString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

BigDecimal

,
using engineering notation if an exponent is needed.

Returns a string that represents the

BigDecimal

as
described in the

toString()

method, except that if
exponential notation is used, the power of ten is adjusted to
be a multiple of three (engineering notation) such that the
integer part of nonzero values will be in the range 1 through
999. If exponential notation is used for zero values, a
decimal point and one or two fractional zero digits are used so
that the scale of the zero value is preserved. Note that
unlike the output of

toString()

, the output of this
method is

not

guaranteed to recover the same [integer,
scale] pair of this

BigDecimal

if the output string is
converting back to a

BigDecimal

using the

string constructor

. The result of this method meets
the weaker constraint of always producing a numerically equal
result from applying the string constructor to the method's output.

**Returns:** string representation of this

BigDecimal

, using
engineering notation if an exponent is needed.
**Since:** 1.5

- toPlainString

```java
public
String
toPlainString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

BigDecimal

without an exponent field. For values with a positive scale,
the number of digits to the right of the decimal point is used
to indicate scale. For values with a zero or negative scale,
the resulting string is generated as if the value were
converted to a numerically equal value with zero scale and as
if all the trailing zeros of the zero scale value were present
in the result.

The entire string is prefixed by a minus sign character '-'
(

'\u002D'

) if the unscaled value is less than
zero. No sign character is prefixed if the unscaled value is
zero or positive.

Note that if the result of this method is passed to the

string constructor

, only the
numerical value of this

BigDecimal

will necessarily be
recovered; the representation of the new

BigDecimal

may have a different scale. In particular, if this

BigDecimal

has a negative scale, the string resulting
from this method will have a scale of zero when processed by
the string constructor.

(This method behaves analogously to the

toString

method in 1.4 and earlier releases.)

**Returns:** a string representation of this

BigDecimal

without an exponent field.
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** toString()

.
This conversion is analogous to the

narrowing primitive conversion

The Java™ Language Specification

:
any fractional part of this

BigDecimal

will be discarded. Note that this
conversion can lose information about the precision of the

BigDecimal

value.

To have an exception thrown if the conversion is inexact (in
other words if a nonzero fractional part is discarded), use the

toBigIntegerExact()

method.

**Returns:** this

array containing the
result of

divideToIntegralValue

followed by the result of

compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
BigDecimal
val)
```

Compares this

BigDecimal

with the specified

BigDecimal

. Two

BigDecimal

objects that are
equal in value but have a different scale (like 2.0 and 2.00)
are considered equal by this method. This method is provided
in preference to individual methods for each of the six boolean
comparison operators (<, ==,
>, >=, !=, <=). The
suggested idiom for performing these comparisons is:

(x.compareTo(y)

<

differ in scale (like 2.0 and 2.00) will generally

not

have the same hash code.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** hash code for this

BigDecimal

two

BigDecimal

objects that are numerically equal but
differ in scale (like 2.0 and 2.00) will generally

not

have the same hash code.

toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the string representation of this

BigDecimal

,
using scientific notation if an exponent is needed.

A standard canonical string form of the

BigDecimal

is created as though by the following steps: first, the
absolute value of the unscaled value of the

BigDecimal

is converted to a string in base ten using the characters

'0'

through

'9'

with no leading zeros (except
if its value is zero, in which case a single

'0'

character is used).

Next, an

adjusted exponent

is calculated; this is the
negated scale, plus the number of characters in the converted
unscaled value, less one. That is,

-scale+(ulength-1)

, where

ulength

is the
length of the absolute value of the unscaled value in decimal
digits (its

precision

).

If the scale is greater than or equal to zero and the
adjusted exponent is greater than or equal to

-6

, the
number will be converted to a character form without using
exponential notation. In this case, if the scale is zero then
no decimal point is added and if the scale is positive a
decimal point will be inserted with the scale specifying the
number of characters to the right of the decimal point.

'0'

characters are added to the left of the converted
unscaled value as necessary. If no character precedes the
decimal point after this insertion then a conventional

'0'

character is prefixed.

Otherwise (that is, if the scale is negative, or the
adjusted exponent is less than

-6

), the number will be
converted to a character form using exponential notation. In
this case, if the converted

BigInteger

has more than
one digit a decimal point is inserted after the first digit.
An exponent in character form is then suffixed to the converted
unscaled value (perhaps with inserted decimal point); this
comprises the letter

'E'

followed immediately by the
adjusted exponent converted to a character form. The latter is
in base ten, using the characters

'0'

through

'9'

with no leading zeros, and is always prefixed by a
sign character

'-'

(

'\u002D'

) if the
adjusted exponent is negative,

'+'

(

'\u002B'

) otherwise).

Finally, the entire string is prefixed by a minus sign
character

'-'

(

'\u002D'

) if the unscaled
value is less than zero. No sign character is prefixed if the
unscaled value is zero or positive.

Examples:

For each representation [

unscaled value

,

scale

]
on the left, the resulting string is shown on the right.

```java
[123,0] "123"
[-123,0] "-123"
[123,-1] "1.23E+3"
[123,-3] "1.23E+5"
[123,1] "12.3"
[123,5] "0.00123"
[123,10] "1.23E-8"
[-123,12] "-1.23E-10"
```

Notes:

- There is a one-to-one mapping between the distinguishable

BigDecimal

values and the result of this conversion.
That is, every distinguishable

BigDecimal

value
(unscaled value and scale) has a unique string representation
as a result of using

toString

. If that string
representation is converted back to a

BigDecimal

using
the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, then the original
value will be recovered.

The string produced for a given number is always the same;
it is not affected by locale. This means that it can be used
as a canonical string representation for exchanging decimal
data, or as a key for a Hashtable, etc. Locale-sensitive
number formatting and parsing is handled by the

NumberFormat

class and its subclasses.

The

toEngineeringString()

method may be used for
presenting numbers with exponents in engineering notation, and the

setScale

method may be used for
rounding a

BigDecimal

so it has a known number of digits after
the decimal point.

The digit-to-character mapping provided by

Character.forDigit

is used.

(unscaled value and scale) has a unique string representation
as a result of using

toString

. If that string
representation is converted back to a

BigDecimal

using
the

BigDecimal(String)

constructor, then the original
value will be recovered.

The string produced for a given number is always the same;
it is not affected by locale. This means that it can be used
as a canonical string representation for exchanging decimal
data, or as a key for a Hashtable, etc. Locale-sensitive
number formatting and parsing is handled by the

NumberFormat

class and its subclasses.

The

toEngineeringString()

method may be used for
presenting numbers with exponents in engineering notation, and the

setScale

method may be used for
rounding a

BigDecimal

so it has a known number of digits after
the decimal point.

The digit-to-character mapping provided by

Character.forDigit

is used.

Examples:

For each representation [

unscaled value

,

scale

]
on the left, the resulting string is shown on the right.

```java
[123,0] "123"
[-123,0] "-123"
[123,-1] "1.23E+3"
[123,-3] "1.23E+5"
[123,1] "12.3"
[123,5] "0.00123"
[123,10] "1.23E-8"
[-123,12] "-1.23E-10"
```

Notes:

- There is a one-to-one mapping between the distinguishable

BigDecimal

values and the result of this conversion.
That is, every distinguishable

BigDecimal

value

toEngineeringString

```java
public
String
toEngineeringString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

BigDecimal

,
using engineering notation if an exponent is needed.

Returns a string that represents the

BigDecimal

as
described in the

toString()

method, except that if
exponential notation is used, the power of ten is adjusted to
be a multiple of three (engineering notation) such that the
integer part of nonzero values will be in the range 1 through
999. If exponential notation is used for zero values, a
decimal point and one or two fractional zero digits are used so
that the scale of the zero value is preserved. Note that
unlike the output of

toString()

, the output of this
method is

not

guaranteed to recover the same [integer,
scale] pair of this

BigDecimal

if the output string is
converting back to a

BigDecimal

using the

string constructor

. The result of this method meets
the weaker constraint of always producing a numerically equal
result from applying the string constructor to the method's output.

**Returns:** string representation of this

BigDecimal

, using
engineering notation if an exponent is needed.
**Since:** 1.5

toPlainString

```java
public
String
toPlainString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

BigDecimal

without an exponent field. For values with a positive scale,
the number of digits to the right of the decimal point is used
to indicate scale. For values with a zero or negative scale,
the resulting string is generated as if the value were
converted to a numerically equal value with zero scale and as
if all the trailing zeros of the zero scale value were present
in the result.

The entire string is prefixed by a minus sign character '-'
(

'\u002D'

) if the unscaled value is less than
zero. No sign character is prefixed if the unscaled value is
zero or positive.

Note that if the result of this method is passed to the

string constructor

, only the
numerical value of this

BigDecimal

will necessarily be
recovered; the representation of the new

BigDecimal

may have a different scale. In particular, if this

BigDecimal

has a negative scale, the string resulting
from this method will have a scale of zero when processed by
the string constructor.

(This method behaves analogously to the

toString

method in 1.4 and earlier releases.)

**Returns:** a string representation of this
