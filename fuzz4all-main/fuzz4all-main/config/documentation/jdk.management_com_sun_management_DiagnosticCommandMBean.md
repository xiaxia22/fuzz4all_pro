### Class Description

```java
public interface
DiagnosticCommandMBean

extends
DynamicMBean
```

Management interface for the diagnostic commands for the HotSpot Virtual Machine.

The

DiagnosticCommandMBean

is registered to the

platform MBeanServer

as are other platform MBeans.

The

ObjectName

for uniquely identifying
the diagnostic MBean within an MBeanServer is:

com.sun.management:type=DiagnosticCommand

This MBean is a

DynamicMBean

and also a

NotificationEmitter

.
The

DiagnosticCommandMBean

is generated at runtime and is subject to
modifications during the lifetime of the Java virtual machine.

A

diagnostic command

is represented as an operation of
the

DiagnosticCommandMBean

interface. Each diagnostic command has:

- the diagnostic command name which is the name being referenced in
the HotSpot Virtual Machine
- the MBean operation name which is the

name

generated for the diagnostic command operation invocation.
The MBean operation name is implementation dependent

The recommended way to transform a diagnostic command name into a MBean
operation name is as follows:

- All characters from the first one to the first dot are set to be
lower-case characters
- Every dot or underline character is removed and the following
character is set to be an upper-case character
- All other characters are copied without modification

The diagnostic command name is always provided with the meta-data on the
operation in a field named

dcmd.name

(see below).

A diagnostic command may or may not support options or arguments.
All the operations return

String

and either take
no parameter for operations that do not support any option or argument,
or take a

String[]

parameter for operations that support at least
one option or argument.
Each option or argument must be stored in a single String.
Options or arguments split across several String instances are not supported.

The distinction between options and arguments: options are identified by
the option name while arguments are identified by their position in the
command line. Options and arguments are processed in the order of the array
passed to the invocation method.

Like any operation of a dynamic MBean, each of these operations is
described by

MBeanOperationInfo

instance. Here's the values returned by this object:

- getName()

returns the operation name generated from the diagnostic command name
- getDescription()

returns the diagnostic command description
(the same as the one return in the 'help' command)
- getImpact()

returns

ACTION_INFO
- getReturnType()

returns

java.lang.String
- getDescriptor()

returns a Descriptor instance (see below)

The

Descriptor

is a collection of fields containing additional
meta-data for a JMX element. A field is a name and an associated value.
The additional meta-data provided for an operation associated with a
diagnostic command are described in the table below:

description

Name

Type

Description

dcmd.name

String

The original diagnostic command name (not the operation name)

dcmd.description

String

The diagnostic command description

dcmd.help

String

The full help message for this diagnostic command (same output as
the one produced by the 'help' command)

dcmd.vmImpact

String

The impact of the diagnostic command,
this value is the same as the one printed in the 'impact'
section of the help message of the diagnostic command, and it
is different from the getImpact() of the MBeanOperationInfo

dcmd.enabled

boolean

True if the diagnostic command is enabled, false otherwise

dcmd.permissionClass

String

Some diagnostic command might require a specific permission to be
executed, in addition to the MBeanPermission to invoke their
associated MBean operation. This field returns the fully qualified
name of the permission class or null if no permission is required

dcmd.permissionName

String

The fist argument of the permission required to execute this
diagnostic command or null if no permission is required

dcmd.permissionAction

String

The second argument of the permission required to execute this
diagnostic command or null if the permission constructor has only
one argument (like the ManagementPermission) or if no permission
is required

dcmd.arguments

Descriptor

A Descriptor instance containing the descriptions of options and
arguments supported by the diagnostic command (see below)

The description of parameters (options or arguments) of a diagnostic
command is provided within a Descriptor instance. In this Descriptor,
each field name is a parameter name, and each field value is itself
a Descriptor instance. The fields provided in this second Descriptor
instance are described in the table below:

description

Name

Type

Description

dcmd.arg.name

String

The name of the parameter

dcmd.arg.type

String

The type of the parameter. The returned String is the name of a type
recognized by the diagnostic command parser. These types are not
Java types and are implementation dependent.

dcmd.arg.description

String

The parameter description

dcmd.arg.isMandatory

boolean

True if the parameter is mandatory, false otherwise

dcmd.arg.isOption

boolean

True if the parameter is an option, false if it is an argument

dcmd.arg.isMultiple

boolean

True if the parameter can be specified several times, false
otherwise

When the set of diagnostic commands currently supported by the Java
Virtual Machine is modified, the

DiagnosticCommandMBean

emits
a

Notification

with a

type

of

"jmx.mbean.info.changed"

and a

userData

that
is the new

MBeanInfo

.

the MBean operation name which is the

name

generated for the diagnostic command operation invocation.
The MBean operation name is implementation dependent

All characters from the first one to the first dot are set to be
lower-case characters

Every dot or underline character is removed and the following
character is set to be an upper-case character

All other characters are copied without modification

The diagnostic command name is always provided with the meta-data on the
operation in a field named

dcmd.name

(see below).

A diagnostic command may or may not support options or arguments.
All the operations return

String

and either take
no parameter for operations that do not support any option or argument,
or take a

String[]

parameter for operations that support at least
one option or argument.
Each option or argument must be stored in a single String.
Options or arguments split across several String instances are not supported.

The distinction between options and arguments: options are identified by
the option name while arguments are identified by their position in the
command line. Options and arguments are processed in the order of the array
passed to the invocation method.

Like any operation of a dynamic MBean, each of these operations is
described by

MBeanOperationInfo

instance. Here's the values returned by this object:

- getName()

returns the operation name generated from the diagnostic command name
- getDescription()

returns the diagnostic command description
(the same as the one return in the 'help' command)
- getImpact()

returns

ACTION_INFO
- getReturnType()

returns

java.lang.String
- getDescriptor()

returns a Descriptor instance (see below)

The

Descriptor

is a collection of fields containing additional
meta-data for a JMX element. A field is a name and an associated value.
The additional meta-data provided for an operation associated with a
diagnostic command are described in the table below:

description

Name

Type

Description

dcmd.name

String

The original diagnostic command name (not the operation name)

dcmd.description

String

The diagnostic command description

dcmd.help

String

The full help message for this diagnostic command (same output as
the one produced by the 'help' command)

dcmd.vmImpact

String

The impact of the diagnostic command,
this value is the same as the one printed in the 'impact'
section of the help message of the diagnostic command, and it
is different from the getImpact() of the MBeanOperationInfo

dcmd.enabled

boolean

True if the diagnostic command is enabled, false otherwise

dcmd.permissionClass

String

Some diagnostic command might require a specific permission to be
executed, in addition to the MBeanPermission to invoke their
associated MBean operation. This field returns the fully qualified
name of the permission class or null if no permission is required

dcmd.permissionName

String

The fist argument of the permission required to execute this
diagnostic command or null if no permission is required

dcmd.permissionAction

String

The second argument of the permission required to execute this
diagnostic command or null if the permission constructor has only
one argument (like the ManagementPermission) or if no permission
is required

dcmd.arguments

Descriptor

A Descriptor instance containing the descriptions of options and
arguments supported by the diagnostic command (see below)

The description of parameters (options or arguments) of a diagnostic
command is provided within a Descriptor instance. In this Descriptor,
each field name is a parameter name, and each field value is itself
a Descriptor instance. The fields provided in this second Descriptor
instance are described in the table below:

description

Name

Type

Description

otherwise

When the set of diagnostic commands currently supported by the Java
Virtual Machine is modified, the

DiagnosticCommandMBean

emits
a

Notification

with a

type

of

"jmx.mbean.info.changed"

and a

userData

that
is the new

MBeanInfo

.

A diagnostic command may or may not support options or arguments.
All the operations return

String

and either take
no parameter for operations that do not support any option or argument,
or take a

String[]

parameter for operations that support at least
one option or argument.
Each option or argument must be stored in a single String.
Options or arguments split across several String instances are not supported.

The distinction between options and arguments: options are identified by
the option name while arguments are identified by their position in the
command line. Options and arguments are processed in the order of the array
passed to the invocation method.
