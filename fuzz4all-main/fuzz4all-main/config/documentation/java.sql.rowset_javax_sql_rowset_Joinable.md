# Interface Joinable

**Source:** `java.sql.rowset\javax\sql\rowset\Joinable.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Joinable
```

1.0 Background

The

Joinable

interface provides the methods for getting and
setting a match column, which is the basis for forming the SQL

JOIN

formed by adding

RowSet

objects to a

JoinRowSet

object.

Any standard

RowSet

implementation

may

implement
the

Joinable

interface in order to be
added to a

JoinRowSet

object. Implementing this interface gives
a

RowSet

object the ability to use

Joinable

methods,
which set, retrieve, and get information about match columns. An
application may add a

RowSet

object that has not implemented the

Joinable

interface to a

JoinRowSet

object, but to do so it must use one
of the

JoinRowSet.addRowSet

methods that takes both a

RowSet

object and a match column or an array of

RowSet

objects and an array of match columns.

To get access to the methods in the

Joinable

interface, a

RowSet

object implements at least one of the
five standard

RowSet

interfaces and also implements the

Joinable

interface. In addition, most

RowSet

objects extend the

BaseRowSet

class. For example:

```java
class MyRowSetImpl extends BaseRowSet implements CachedRowSet, Joinable {
:
:
}
```

2.0 Usage Guidelines

The methods in the

Joinable

interface allow a

RowSet

object
to set a match column, retrieve a match column, or unset a match column, which is
the column upon which an SQL

JOIN

can be based.
An instance of a class that implements these methods can be added to a

JoinRowSet

object to allow an SQL

JOIN

relationship to
be established.

```java
CachedRowSet crs = new MyRowSetImpl();
crs.populate((ResultSet)rs);
(Joinable)crs.setMatchColumnIndex(1);

JoinRowSet jrs = new JoinRowSetImpl();
jrs.addRowSet(crs);
```

In the previous example,

crs

is a

CachedRowSet

object that
has implemented the

Joinable

interface. In the following example,

crs2

has not, so it must supply the match column as an argument to the

addRowSet

method. This example assumes that column 1 is the match
column.

```java
CachedRowSet crs2 = new MyRowSetImpl();
crs2.populate((ResultSet)rs);

JoinRowSet jrs2 = new JoinRowSetImpl();
jrs2.addRowSet(crs2, 1);
```

The

JoinRowSet

interface makes it possible to get data from one or
more

RowSet

objects consolidated into one table without having to incur
the expense of creating a connection to a database. It is therefore ideally suited
for use by disconnected

RowSet

objects. Nevertheless, any

RowSet

object

may

implement this interface
regardless of whether it is connected or disconnected. Note that a

JdbcRowSet

object, being always connected to its data source, can
become part of an SQL

JOIN

directly without having to become part
of a

JoinRowSet

object.

3.0 Managing Multiple Match Columns

The index array passed into the

setMatchColumn

methods indicates
how many match columns are being set (the length of the array) in addition to
which columns will be used for the match. For example:

```java
int[] i = {1, 2, 4, 7}; // indicates four match columns, with column
// indexes 1, 2, 4, 7 participating in the JOIN.
Joinable.setMatchColumn(i);
```

Subsequent match columns may be added as follows to a different

Joinable

object (a

RowSet

object that has implemented the

Joinable

interface).

```java
int[] w = {3, 2, 5, 3};
Joinable2.setMatchColumn(w);
```

When an application adds two or more

RowSet

objects to a

JoinRowSet

object, the order of the indexes in the array is
particularly important. Each index of
the array maps directly to the corresponding index of the previously added

RowSet

object. If overlap or underlap occurs, the match column
data is maintained in the event an additional

Joinable

RowSet is
added and needs to relate to the match column data. Therefore, applications
can set multiple match columns in any order, but
this order has a direct effect on the outcome of the

SQL

JOIN.

This assertion applies in exactly the same manner when column names are used
rather than column indexes to indicate match columns.

An instance of a class that implements these methods can be added to a

jrs.addRowSet(crs);
```

In the previous example,

crs

is a

CachedRowSet

object that
has implemented the

Joinable

interface. In the following example,

crs2

has not, so it must supply the match column as an argument to the

addRowSet

method. This example assumes that column 1 is the match
column.

```java

jrs2.addRowSet(crs2, 1);
```

The

JoinRowSet

interface makes it possible to get data from one or
more

RowSet

objects consolidated into one table without having to incur
the expense of creating a connection to a database. It is therefore ideally suited
for use by disconnected

RowSet

JdbcRowSet

3.0 Managing Multiple Match Columns

The index array passed into the

setMatchColumn

methods indicates
how many match columns are being set (the length of the array) in addition to
which columns will be used for the match. For example:

```java
int[] i = {1, 2, 4, 7}; // indicates four match columns, with column
// indexes 1, 2, 4, 7 participating in the JOIN.
Joinable.setMatchColumn(i);
```

Subsequent match columns may be added as follows to a different

Joinable

object (a

RowSet

object that has implemented the

Joinable

interface).

```java
int[] w = {3, 2, 5, 3};
Joinable2.setMatchColumn(w);
```

When an application adds two or more

RowSet

objects to a

JoinRowSet

object, the order of the indexes in the array is
particularly important. Each index of
the array maps directly to the corresponding index of the previously added

RowSet

object. If overlap or underlap occurs, the match column

can set multiple match columns in any order, but

may

implement this interface
regardless of whether it is connected or disconnected. Note that a

JdbcRowSet

object, being always connected to its data source, can
become part of an SQL

JOIN

directly without having to become part
of a

JoinRowSet

object.

3.0 Managing Multiple Match Columns

The index array passed into the

setMatchColumn

methods indicates
how many match columns are being set (the length of the array) in addition to
which columns will be used for the match. For example:

```java
int[] i = {1, 2, 4, 7}; // indicates four match columns, with column
// indexes 1, 2, 4, 7 participating in the JOIN.
Joinable.setMatchColumn(i);
```

Subsequent match columns may be added as follows to a different

Joinable

object (a

RowSet

object that has implemented the

Joinable

interface).

```java
int[] w = {3, 2, 5, 3};
Joinable2.setMatchColumn(w);
```

When an application adds two or more

RowSet

objects to a

JoinRowSet

object, the order of the indexes in the array is
particularly important. Each index of
the array maps directly to the corresponding index of the previously added

RowSet

object. If overlap or underlap occurs, the match column
data is maintained in the event an additional

Joinable

RowSet is
added and needs to relate to the match column data. Therefore, applications
can set multiple match columns in any order, but
this order has a direct effect on the outcome of the

SQL

JOIN.

This assertion applies in exactly the same manner when column names are used
rather than column indexes to indicate match columns.

CachedRowSet crs = new MyRowSetImpl();
crs.populate((ResultSet)rs);
(Joinable)crs.setMatchColumnIndex(1);

JoinRowSet jrs = new JoinRowSetImpl();
jrs.addRowSet(crs);

CachedRowSet crs2 = new MyRowSetImpl();
crs2.populate((ResultSet)rs);

JoinRowSet jrs2 = new JoinRowSetImpl();
jrs2.addRowSet(crs2, 1);

The

JoinRowSet

interface makes it possible to get data from one or
more

RowSet

objects consolidated into one table without having to incur
the expense of creating a connection to a database. It is therefore ideally suited
for use by disconnected

RowSet

objects. Nevertheless, any

RowSet

object

may

implement this interface
regardless of whether it is connected or disconnected. Note that a

JdbcRowSet

object, being always connected to its data source, can
become part of an SQL

JOIN

directly without having to become part
of a

JoinRowSet

object.

```
