result of a service becoming available

---

#### public
BeanContextChild
getBeanContextChildPeer()

- the

BeanContextChild

peer of this class

---

#### public boolean isDelegated()

Reports whether or not this class is a delegate of another.

**Returns:**
- true if this class is a delegate of another

---

#### public void firePropertyChange​(
String
name,

Object
oldValue,

Object
newValue)

Report a bound property update to any registered listeners. No event is
fired if old and new are equal and non-null.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The programmatic name of the property that was changed
- oldValue

- The old value of the property
- newValue

- The new value of the property

---

#### public void fireVetoableChange​(
String
name,

Object
oldValue,

Object
newValue)
throws
PropertyVetoException

Report a vetoable property update to any registered listeners.
If anyone vetos the change, then fire a new event
reverting everyone to the old value and then rethrow
the PropertyVetoException.

No event is fired if old and new are equal and non-null.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The programmatic name of the property that is about to
change
- oldValue

- The old value of the property
- newValue

- - The new value of the property

**Throws:**

change to be rolled back.

---

#### public boolean validatePendingSetBeanContext​(
BeanContext
newValue)

Called from setBeanContext to validate (or otherwise) the
pending change in the nesting BeanContext property value.
Returning false will cause setBeanContext to throw
PropertyVetoException.

**Parameters:**
- newValue

- the new value that has been requested for
the BeanContext property

**Returns:**
- true

if the change operation is to be vetoed

---

#### protected void releaseBeanContextResources()

This method may be overridden by subclasses to provide their own
release behaviors. When invoked any resources held by this instance
obtained from its current BeanContext property should be released
since the object is no longer nested within that BeanContext.

---

#### protected void initializeBeanContextResources()

This method may be overridden by subclasses to provide their own
initialization behaviors. When invoked any resources required by the
BeanContextChild should be obtained from the current BeanContext.
