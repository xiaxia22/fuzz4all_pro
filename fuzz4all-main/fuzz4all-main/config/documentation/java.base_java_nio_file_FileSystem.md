# Class FileSystem

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\file\FileSystem.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
FileSystem

extends
Object

implements
Closeable
```

Provides an interface to a file system and is the factory for objects to
access files and other objects in the file system.

The default file system, obtained by invoking the

FileSystems.getDefault

method, provides access to the file system that is
accessible to the Java virtual machine. The

FileSystems

class defines
methods to create file systems that provide access to other types of (custom)
file systems.

A file system is the factory for several types of objects:

- The

getPath

method converts a system dependent

path string

, returning a

Path

object that may be used
to locate and access a file.
- The

getPathMatcher

method is used
to create a

PathMatcher

that performs match operations on
paths.
- The

getFileStores

method returns an iterator
over the underlying

file-stores

.
- The

getUserPrincipalLookupService

method returns the

UserPrincipalLookupService

to lookup users or
groups by name.
- The

newWatchService

method creates a

WatchService

that may be used to watch objects for changes and
events.

File systems vary greatly. In some cases the file system is a single
hierarchy of files with one top-level root directory. In other cases it may
have several distinct file hierarchies, each with its own top-level root
directory. The

getRootDirectories

method may be
used to iterate over the root directories in the file system. A file system
is typically composed of one or more underlying

file-stores

that provide the storage for the files. Theses file stores can also vary in
the features they support, and the file attributes or

meta-data

that
they associate with files.

A file system is open upon creation and can be closed by invoking its

close

method. Once closed, any further attempt to access
objects in the file system cause

ClosedFileSystemException

to be
thrown. File systems created by the default

provider

cannot be closed.

A

FileSystem

can provide read-only or read-write access to the
file system. Whether or not a file system provides read-only access is
established when the

FileSystem

is created and can be tested by invoking
its

isReadOnly

method. Attempts to write to file stores
by means of an object associated with a read-only file system throws

ReadOnlyFileSystemException

.

File systems are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The

close

method may be invoked at any time to close a file system but
whether a file system is

asynchronously closeable

is provider specific
and therefore unspecified. In other words, if a thread is accessing an
object in a file system, and another thread invokes the

close

method
then it may require to block until the first operation is complete. Closing
a file system causes all open channels, watch services, and other

closeable

objects associated with the file system to be closed.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Closeable

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected FileSystem()

Initializes a new instance of this class.

---

### Method Details

#### public abstract
FileSystemProvider
provider()

Returns the provider that created this file system.

**Returns:**
- The provider that created this file system.

---

#### public abstract void close()
throws
IOException

Closes this file system.

After a file system is closed then all subsequent access to the file
system, either by methods defined by this class or on objects associated
with this file system, throw

ClosedFileSystemException

. If the
file system is already closed then invoking this method has no effect.

Closing a file system will close all open

channels

,

directory-streams

,

watch-service

, and other closeable objects associated
with this file system. The

default

file
system cannot be closed.

**Specified by:**
- close

in interface

AutoCloseable
- close

in interface

Closeable

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- UnsupportedOperationException

- Thrown in the case of the default file system

---

#### public abstract boolean isOpen()

Tells whether or not this file system is open.

File systems created by the default provider are always open.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this file system is open

---

#### public abstract boolean isReadOnly()

Tells whether or not this file system allows only read-only access to
its file stores.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this file system provides
read-only access

---

#### public abstract
String
getSeparator()

Returns the name separator, represented as a string.

The name separator is used to separate names in a path string. An
implementation may support multiple name separators in which case this
method returns an implementation specific

default

name separator.
This separator is used when creating path strings by invoking the

toString()

method.

In the case of the default provider, this method returns the same
separator as

File.separator

.

**Returns:**
- The name separator

---

#### public abstract
Iterable
<
Path
> getRootDirectories()

Returns an object to iterate over the paths of the root directories.

A file system provides access to a file store that may be composed
of a number of distinct file hierarchies, each with its own top-level
root directory. Unless denied by the security manager, each element in
the returned iterator corresponds to the root directory of a distinct
file hierarchy. The order of the elements is not defined. The file
hierarchies may change during the lifetime of the Java virtual machine.
For example, in some implementations, the insertion of removable media
may result in the creation of a new file hierarchy with its own
top-level directory.

When a security manager is installed, it is invoked to check access
to the each root directory. If denied, the root directory is not returned
by the iterator. In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to check read access
to each root directory. It is system dependent if the permission checks
are done when the iterator is obtained or during iteration.

**Returns:**
- An object to iterate over the root directories

---

#### public abstract
Iterable
<
FileStore
> getFileStores()

Returns an object to iterate over the underlying file stores.

The elements of the returned iterator are the

FileStores

for this file system. The order of the elements is
not defined and the file stores may change during the lifetime of the
Java virtual machine. When an I/O error occurs, perhaps because a file
store is not accessible, then it is not returned by the iterator.

In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the security manager is invoked to check

RuntimePermission

("getFileStoreAttributes")

. If denied, then
no file stores are returned by the iterator. In addition, the security
manager's

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to
check read access to the file store's

top-most

directory. If
denied, the file store is not returned by the iterator. It is system
dependent if the permission checks are done when the iterator is obtained
or during iteration.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to print the space usage for all file stores:

```java
for (FileStore store: FileSystems.getDefault().getFileStores()) {
long total = store.getTotalSpace() / 1024;
long used = (store.getTotalSpace() - store.getUnallocatedSpace()) / 1024;
long avail = store.getUsableSpace() / 1024;
System.out.format("%-20s %12d %12d %12d%n", store, total, used, avail);
}
```

**Returns:**
- An object to iterate over the backing file stores

---

#### public abstract
Set
<
String
> supportedFileAttributeViews()

Returns the set of the

names

of the file
attribute views supported by this

FileSystem

.

The

BasicFileAttributeView

is required to be supported and
therefore the set contains at least one element, "basic".

The

supportsFileAttributeView(String)

method may be used to test if an
underlying

FileStore

supports the file attributes identified by a
file attribute view.

**Returns:**
- An unmodifiable set of the names of the supported file attribute
views

---

#### public abstract
Path
getPath​(
String
first,

String
... more)

Converts a path string, or a sequence of strings that when joined form
a path string, to a

Path

. If

more

does not specify any
elements then the value of the

first

parameter is the path string
to convert. If

more

specifies one or more elements then each
non-empty string, including

first

, is considered to be a sequence
of name elements (see

Path

) and is joined to form a path string.
The details as to how the Strings are joined is provider specific but
typically they will be joined using the

name-separator

as the separator. For example, if the name separator is
"

/

" and

getPath("/foo","bar","gus")

is invoked, then the
path string

"/foo/bar/gus"

is converted to a

Path

.
A

Path

representing an empty path is returned if

first

is the empty string and

more

does not contain any non-empty
strings.

The parsing and conversion to a path object is inherently
implementation dependent. In the simplest case, the path string is rejected,
and

InvalidPathException

thrown, if the path string contains
characters that cannot be converted to characters that are

legal

to the file store. For example, on UNIX systems, the NUL (\u0000)
character is not allowed to be present in a path. An implementation may
choose to reject path strings that contain names that are longer than those
allowed by any file store, and where an implementation supports a complex
path syntax, it may choose to reject path strings that are

badly
formed

.

In the case of the default provider, path strings are parsed based
on the definition of paths at the platform or virtual file system level.
For example, an operating system may not allow specific characters to be
present in a file name, but a specific underlying file store may impose
different or additional restrictions on the set of legal
characters.

This method throws

InvalidPathException

when the path string
cannot be converted to a path. Where possible, and where applicable,
the exception is created with an

index

value indicating the first position in the

path

parameter
that caused the path string to be rejected.

**Parameters:**
- first

- the path string or initial part of the path string
- more

- additional strings to be joined to form the path string

**Returns:**
- the resulting

Path

**Throws:**
- InvalidPathException

- If the path string cannot be converted

---

#### public abstract
PathMatcher
getPathMatcher​(
String
syntaxAndPattern)

Returns a

PathMatcher

that performs match operations on the

String

representation of

Path

objects by interpreting a
given pattern.

The

syntaxAndPattern

parameter identifies the syntax and the
pattern and takes the form:

```java
syntax
:
pattern
```

where

':'

stands for itself.

A

FileSystem

implementation supports the "

glob

" and
"

regex

" syntaxes, and may support others. The value of the syntax
component is compared without regard to case.

When the syntax is "

glob

" then the

String

representation of the path is matched using a limited pattern language
that resembles regular expressions but with a simpler syntax. For example:

Pattern Language

Example

Description

*.java

Matches a path that represents a file name ending in

.java

*.*

Matches file names containing a dot

*.{java,class}

Matches file names ending with

.java

or

.class

foo.?

Matches file names starting with

foo.

and a single
character extension

/home/*/*

Matches

/home/gus/data

on UNIX platforms

/home/**

Matches

/home/gus

and

/home/gus/data

on UNIX platforms

C:\\*

Matches

C:\foo

and

C:\bar

on the Windows
platform (note that the backslash is escaped; as a string literal in the
Java Language the pattern would be

"C:\\\\*"

)

The following rules are used to interpret glob patterns:

- The

*

character matches zero or more

characters

of a

name

component without
crossing directory boundaries.
- The

**

characters matches zero or more

characters

crossing directory boundaries.
- The

?

character matches exactly one character of a
name component.
- The backslash character (

\

) is used to escape characters
that would otherwise be interpreted as special characters. The expression

\\

matches a single backslash and "\{" matches a left brace
for example.
- The

[ ]

characters are a

bracket expression

that
match a single character of a name component out of a set of characters.
For example,

[abc]

matches

"a"

,

"b"

, or

"c"

.
The hyphen (

-

) may be used to specify a range so

[a-z]

specifies a range that matches from

"a"

to

"z"

(inclusive).
These forms can be mixed so [abce-g] matches

"a"

,

"b"

,

"c"

,

"e"

,

"f"

or

"g"

. If the character
after the

[

is a

!

then it is used for negation so

[!a-c]

matches any character except

"a"

,

"b"

, or

"c"

.

Within a bracket expression the

*

,

?

and

\

characters match themselves. The (

-

) character matches itself if
it is the first character within the brackets, or the first character
after the

!

if negating.
- The

{ }

characters are a group of subpatterns, where
the group matches if any subpattern in the group matches. The

","

character is used to separate the subpatterns. Groups cannot be nested.
- Leading period

/

dot characters in file name are
treated as regular characters in match operations. For example,
the

"*"

glob pattern matches file name

".login"

.
The

Files.isHidden(java.nio.file.Path)

method may be used to test whether a file
is considered hidden.
- All other characters match themselves in an implementation
dependent manner. This includes characters representing any

name-separators

.
- The matching of

root

components is highly
implementation-dependent and is not specified.

When the syntax is "

regex

" then the pattern component is a
regular expression as defined by the

Pattern

class.

For both the glob and regex syntaxes, the matching details, such as
whether the matching is case sensitive, are implementation-dependent
and therefore not specified.

**Parameters:**
- syntaxAndPattern

- The syntax and pattern

**Returns:**
- A path matcher that may be used to match paths against the pattern

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the parameter does not take the form:

syntax:pattern
- PatternSyntaxException

- If the pattern is invalid
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If the pattern syntax is not known to the implementation

**See Also:**
- Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,String)

#### public abstract
UserPrincipalLookupService
getUserPrincipalLookupService()

Returns the

UserPrincipalLookupService

for this file system

(optional operation)

. The resulting lookup service may be used to
lookup user or group names.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to make "joe" the owner of a file:

```java
UserPrincipalLookupService lookupService = FileSystems.getDefault().getUserPrincipalLookupService();
Files.setOwner(path, lookupService.lookupPrincipalByName("joe"));
```

**Returns:**
- The

UserPrincipalLookupService

for this file system

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If this

FileSystem

does not does have a lookup service

---

#### public abstract
WatchService
newWatchService()
throws
IOException

Constructs a new

WatchService

(optional operation)

.

This method constructs a new watch service that may be used to watch
registered objects for changes and events.

**Returns:**
- a new watch service

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If this

FileSystem

does not support watching file system
objects for changes and events. This exception is not thrown
by

FileSystems

created by the default provider.
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

File systems are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The

A

FileSystem

can provide read-only or read-write access to the
file system. Whether or not a file system provides read-only access is
established when the

FileSystem

is created and can be tested by invoking
its

isReadOnly

method. Attempts to write to file stores

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- provider

```java
public abstract
FileSystemProvider
provider()
```

Returns the provider that created this file system.

**Returns:** The provider that created this file system.

- close

```java
public abstract void close()
throws
IOException
```

Closes this file system.

After a file system is closed then all subsequent access to the file
system, either by methods defined by this class or on objects associated
with this file system, throw

ClosedFileSystemException

. If the
file system is already closed then invoking this method has no effect.

Closing a file system will close all open

channels

,

directory-streams

,

watch-service

, and other closeable objects associated
with this file system. The

default

file
system cannot be closed.

**Specified by:** close

in interface

AutoCloseable
**Specified by:** close

in interface

Closeable
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- Thrown in the case of the default file system

- isOpen

```java
public abstract boolean isOpen()
```

Tells whether or not this file system is open.

File systems created by the default provider are always open.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this file system is open

- isReadOnly

```java
public abstract boolean isReadOnly()
```

Tells whether or not this file system allows only read-only access to
its file stores.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this file system provides
read-only access

- getSeparator

```java
public abstract
String
getSeparator()
```

Returns the name separator, represented as a string.

The name separator is used to separate names in a path string. An
implementation may support multiple name separators in which case this
method returns an implementation specific

default

name separator.
This separator is used when creating path strings by invoking the

toString()

method.

In the case of the default provider, this method returns the same
separator as

File.separator

.

**Returns:** The name separator

- getRootDirectories

```java
public abstract
Iterable
<
Path
> getRootDirectories()
```

Returns an object to iterate over the paths of the root directories.

A file system provides access to a file store that may be composed
of a number of distinct file hierarchies, each with its own top-level
root directory. Unless denied by the security manager, each element in
the returned iterator corresponds to the root directory of a distinct
file hierarchy. The order of the elements is not defined. The file
hierarchies may change during the lifetime of the Java virtual machine.
For example, in some implementations, the insertion of removable media
may result in the creation of a new file hierarchy with its own
top-level directory.

When a security manager is installed, it is invoked to check access
to the each root directory. If denied, the root directory is not returned
by the iterator. In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to check read access
to each root directory. It is system dependent if the permission checks
are done when the iterator is obtained or during iteration.

**Returns:** An object to iterate over the root directories

- getFileStores

```java
public abstract
Iterable
<
FileStore
> getFileStores()
```

Returns an object to iterate over the underlying file stores.

The elements of the returned iterator are the

FileStores

for this file system. The order of the elements is
not defined and the file stores may change during the lifetime of the
Java virtual machine. When an I/O error occurs, perhaps because a file
store is not accessible, then it is not returned by the iterator.

In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the security manager is invoked to check

RuntimePermission

("getFileStoreAttributes")

. If denied, then
no file stores are returned by the iterator. In addition, the security
manager's

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to
check read access to the file store's

top-most

directory. If
denied, the file store is not returned by the iterator. It is system
dependent if the permission checks are done when the iterator is obtained
or during iteration.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to print the space usage for all file stores:

```java
for (FileStore store: FileSystems.getDefault().getFileStores()) {
long total = store.getTotalSpace() / 1024;
long used = (store.getTotalSpace() - store.getUnallocatedSpace()) / 1024;
long avail = store.getUsableSpace() / 1024;
System.out.format("%-20s %12d %12d %12d%n", store, total, used, avail);
}
```

**Returns:** An object to iterate over the backing file stores

- supportedFileAttributeViews

```java
public abstract
Set
<
String
> supportedFileAttributeViews()
```

Returns the set of the

names

of the file
attribute views supported by this

FileSystem

.

The

BasicFileAttributeView

is required to be supported and
therefore the set contains at least one element, "basic".

The

supportsFileAttributeView(String)

method may be used to test if an
underlying

FileStore

supports the file attributes identified by a
file attribute view.

**Returns:** An unmodifiable set of the names of the supported file attribute
views

- getPath

```java
public abstract
Path
getPath​(
String
first,

String
... more)
```

Converts a path string, or a sequence of strings that when joined form
a path string, to a

Path

. If

more

does not specify any
elements then the value of the

first

parameter is the path string
to convert. If

more

specifies one or more elements then each
non-empty string, including

first

, is considered to be a sequence
of name elements (see

Path

) and is joined to form a path string.
The details as to how the Strings are joined is provider specific but
typically they will be joined using the

name-separator

as the separator. For example, if the name separator is
"

/

" and

getPath("/foo","bar","gus")

is invoked, then the
path string

"/foo/bar/gus"

is converted to a

Path

.
A

Path

representing an empty path is returned if

first

is the empty string and

more

does not contain any non-empty
strings.

The parsing and conversion to a path object is inherently
implementation dependent. In the simplest case, the path string is rejected,
and

InvalidPathException

thrown, if the path string contains
characters that cannot be converted to characters that are

legal

to the file store. For example, on UNIX systems, the NUL (\u0000)
character is not allowed to be present in a path. An implementation may
choose to reject path strings that contain names that are longer than those
allowed by any file store, and where an implementation supports a complex
path syntax, it may choose to reject path strings that are

badly
formed

.

In the case of the default provider, path strings are parsed based
on the definition of paths at the platform or virtual file system level.
For example, an operating system may not allow specific characters to be
present in a file name, but a specific underlying file store may impose
different or additional restrictions on the set of legal
characters.

This method throws

InvalidPathException

when the path string
cannot be converted to a path. Where possible, and where applicable,
the exception is created with an

index

value indicating the first position in the

path

parameter
that caused the path string to be rejected.

**Parameters:** first

- the path string or initial part of the path string
**Parameters:** more

- additional strings to be joined to form the path string
**Returns:** the resulting

Path
**Throws:** InvalidPathException

- If the path string cannot be converted

- getPathMatcher

```java
public abstract
PathMatcher
getPathMatcher​(
String
syntaxAndPattern)
```

Returns a

PathMatcher

that performs match operations on the

String

representation of

Path

objects by interpreting a
given pattern.

The

syntaxAndPattern

parameter identifies the syntax and the
pattern and takes the form:

```java
syntax
:
pattern
```

where

':'

stands for itself.

A

FileSystem

implementation supports the "

glob

" and
"

regex

" syntaxes, and may support others. The value of the syntax
component is compared without regard to case.

When the syntax is "

glob

" then the

String

representation of the path is matched using a limited pattern language
that resembles regular expressions but with a simpler syntax. For example:

Pattern Language

Example

Description

*.java

Matches a path that represents a file name ending in

.java

*.*

Matches file names containing a dot

*.{java,class}

Matches file names ending with

.java

or

.class

foo.?

Matches file names starting with

foo.

and a single
character extension

/home/*/*

Matches

/home/gus/data

on UNIX platforms

/home/**

Matches

/home/gus

and

/home/gus/data

on UNIX platforms

C:\\*

Matches

C:\foo

and

C:\bar

on the Windows
platform (note that the backslash is escaped; as a string literal in the
Java Language the pattern would be

"C:\\\\*"

)

The following rules are used to interpret glob patterns:

- The

*

character matches zero or more

characters

of a

name

component without
crossing directory boundaries.
- The

**

characters matches zero or more

characters

crossing directory boundaries.
- The

?

character matches exactly one character of a
name component.
- The backslash character (

\

) is used to escape characters
that would otherwise be interpreted as special characters. The expression

\\

matches a single backslash and "\{" matches a left brace
for example.
- The

[ ]

characters are a

bracket expression

that
match a single character of a name component out of a set of characters.
For example,

[abc]

matches

"a"

,

"b"

, or

"c"

.
The hyphen (

-

) may be used to specify a range so

[a-z]

specifies a range that matches from

"a"

to

"z"

(inclusive).
These forms can be mixed so [abce-g] matches

"a"

,

"b"

,

"c"

,

"e"

,

"f"

or

"g"

. If the character
after the

[

is a

!

then it is used for negation so

[!a-c]

matches any character except

"a"

,

"b"

, or

"c"

.

Within a bracket expression the

*

,

?

and

\

characters match themselves. The (

-

) character matches itself if
it is the first character within the brackets, or the first character
after the

!

if negating.
- The

{ }

characters are a group of subpatterns, where
the group matches if any subpattern in the group matches. The

","

character is used to separate the subpatterns. Groups cannot be nested.
- Leading period

/

dot characters in file name are
treated as regular characters in match operations. For example,
the

"*"

glob pattern matches file name

".login"

.
The

Files.isHidden(java.nio.file.Path)

method may be used to test whether a file
is considered hidden.
- All other characters match themselves in an implementation
dependent manner. This includes characters representing any

name-separators

.
- The matching of

root

components is highly
implementation-dependent and is not specified.

When the syntax is "

regex

" then the pattern component is a
regular expression as defined by the

Pattern

class.

For both the glob and regex syntaxes, the matching details, such as
whether the matching is case sensitive, are implementation-dependent
and therefore not specified.

**Parameters:** syntaxAndPattern

- The syntax and pattern
**Returns:** A path matcher that may be used to match paths against the pattern
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the parameter does not take the form:

syntax:pattern
**Throws:** PatternSyntaxException

- If the pattern is invalid
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the pattern syntax is not known to the implementation
**See Also:** Files.newDirectoryStream(Path,String)

- getUserPrincipalLookupService

```java
public abstract
UserPrincipalLookupService
getUserPrincipalLookupService()
```

Returns the

UserPrincipalLookupService

for this file system

(optional operation)

. The resulting lookup service may be used to
lookup user or group names.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to make "joe" the owner of a file:

```java
UserPrincipalLookupService lookupService = FileSystems.getDefault().getUserPrincipalLookupService();
Files.setOwner(path, lookupService.lookupPrincipalByName("joe"));
```

**Returns:** The

UserPrincipalLookupService

for this file system
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If this

FileSystem

does not does have a lookup service

- newWatchService

```java
public abstract
WatchService
newWatchService()
throws
IOException
```

Constructs a new

WatchService

(optional operation)

.

This method constructs a new watch service that may be used to watch
registered objects for changes and events.

**Returns:** a new watch service
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If this

FileSystem

does not support watching file system
objects for changes and events. This exception is not thrown
by

FileSystems

created by the default provider.
**Throws:** IOException

getSeparator()
```

Returns the name separator, represented as a string.

The name separator is used to separate names in a path string. An
implementation may support multiple name separators in which case this
method returns an implementation specific

default

name separator.
This separator is used when creating path strings by invoking the

toString()

method.

In the case of the default provider, this method returns the same

File.separator

.

**Returns:** The name separator

- getRootDirectories

```java
public abstract
Iterable
<
Path
> getRootDirectories()
```

Returns an object to iterate over the paths of the root directories.

A file system provides access to a file store that may be composed
of a number of distinct file hierarchies, each with its own top-level
root directory. Unless denied by the security manager, each element in
the returned iterator corresponds to the root directory of a distinct
file hierarchy. The order of the elements is not defined. The file
hierarchies may change during the lifetime of the Java virtual machine.
For example, in some implementations, the insertion of removable media
may result in the creation of a new file hierarchy with its own
top-level directory.

When a security manager is installed, it is invoked to check access
to the each root directory. If denied, the root directory is not returned
by the iterator. In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to check read access
to each root directory. It is system dependent if the permission checks
are done when the iterator is obtained or during iteration.

**Returns:** An object to iterate over the root directories

- getFileStores

```java
public abstract
Iterable
<
FileStore
> getFileStores()
```

Returns an object to iterate over the underlying file stores.

The elements of the returned iterator are the

FileStores

for this file system. The order of the elements is
not defined and the file stores may change during the lifetime of the
Java virtual machine. When an I/O error occurs, perhaps because a file
store is not accessible, then it is not returned by the iterator.

In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the security manager is invoked to check

RuntimePermission

("getFileStoreAttributes")

. If denied, then
no file stores are returned by the iterator. In addition, the security
manager's

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to
check read access to the file store's

top-most

directory. If
denied, the file store is not returned by the iterator. It is system
dependent if the permission checks are done when the iterator is obtained
or during iteration.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to print the space usage for all file stores:

```java
for (FileStore store: FileSystems.getDefault().getFileStores()) {
long total = store.getTotalSpace() / 1024;
long used = (store.getTotalSpace() - store.getUnallocatedSpace()) / 1024;
long avail = store.getUsableSpace() / 1024;
System.out.format("%-20s %12d %12d %12d%n", store, total, used, avail);
}
```

**Returns:** An object to iterate over the backing file stores

- supportedFileAttributeViews

```java
public abstract
Set
<
String

```

Returns the set of the

names

of the file
attribute views supported by this

FileSystem

.

The

BasicFileAttributeView

is required to be supported and
therefore the set contains at least one element, "basic".

The

supportsFileAttributeView(String)

method may be used to test if an
underlying

FileStore

supports the file attributes identified by a
file attribute view.

**Returns:** An unmodifiable set of the names of the supported file attribute
views

- getPath

```java
public abstract

```

Converts a path string, or a sequence of strings that when joined form
a path string, to a

Path

. If

character extension

/home/*/*

Matches

/home/gus/data

on UNIX platforms

/home/**

Matches

/home/gus

and

/home/gus/data

on UNIX platforms

C:\\*

Matches

C:\foo

and

C:\bar

on the Windows
platform (note that the backslash is escaped; as a string literal in the
Java Language the pattern would be

"C:\\\\*"

)

The following rules are used to interpret glob patterns:

- The

*

character matches zero or more

characters

of a

name

component without
crossing directory boundaries.
- The

**

characters matches zero or more

characters

crossing directory boundaries.
- The

?

character matches exactly one character of a
name component.
- The backslash character (

\

) is used to escape characters
that would otherwise be interpreted as special characters. The expression

\\

matches a single backslash and "\{" matches a left brace
for example.
- The

[ ]

characters are a

bracket expression

that
match a single character of a name component out of a set of characters.
For example,

[abc]

matches

"a"

,

"b"

, or

"c"

.
The hyphen (

-

) may be used to specify a range so

[a-z]

specifies a range that matches from

"a"

to

"z"

(inclusive).
These forms can be mixed so [abce-g] matches

"a"

,

"b"

,

"c"

,

"e"

,

"f"

or

"g"

. If the character
after the

[

is a

!

then it is used for negation so

[!a-c]

matches any character except

"a"

,

"b"

, or

"c"

.

Within a bracket expression the

*

,

?

and

\

characters match themselves. The (

-

) character matches itself if
it is the first character within the brackets, or the first character
after the

!

if negating.
- The

{ }

characters are a group of subpatterns, where
the group matches if any subpattern in the group matches. The

","

character is used to separate the subpatterns. Groups cannot be nested.
- Leading period

/

dot characters in file name are
treated as regular characters in match operations. For example,
the

"*"

glob pattern matches file name

".login"

.
The

Files.isHidden(java.nio.file.Path)

method may be used to test whether a file
is considered hidden.
- All other characters match themselves in an implementation
dependent manner. This includes characters representing any

name-separators

.
- The matching of

root

components is highly
implementation-dependent and is not specified.

When the syntax is "

regex

" then the pattern component is a
regular expression as defined by the

Pattern

class.

For both the glob and regex syntaxes, the matching details, such as
whether the matching is case sensitive, are implementation-dependent
and therefore not specified.

**Parameters:** syntaxAndPattern

- The syntax and pattern
**Returns:** A path matcher that may be used to match paths against the pattern
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the parameter does not take the form:

syntax:pattern
**Throws:** PatternSyntaxException

- If the pattern is invalid
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the pattern syntax is not known to the implementation

getRootDirectories

```java
public abstract
Iterable
<
Path
> getRootDirectories()
```

Returns an object to iterate over the paths of the root directories.

A file system provides access to a file store that may be composed
of a number of distinct file hierarchies, each with its own top-level
root directory. Unless denied by the security manager, each element in
the returned iterator corresponds to the root directory of a distinct
file hierarchy. The order of the elements is not defined. The file
hierarchies may change during the lifetime of the Java virtual machine.
For example, in some implementations, the insertion of removable media
may result in the creation of a new file hierarchy with its own
top-level directory.

When a security manager is installed, it is invoked to check access
to the each root directory. If denied, the root directory is not returned
by the iterator. In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to check read access
to each root directory. It is system dependent if the permission checks
are done when the iterator is obtained or during iteration.

**Returns:** An object to iterate over the root directories

getFileStores

```java
public abstract
Iterable
<
FileStore
> getFileStores()
```

Returns an object to iterate over the underlying file stores.

The elements of the returned iterator are the

FileStores

for this file system. The order of the elements is
not defined and the file stores may change during the lifetime of the
Java virtual machine. When an I/O error occurs, perhaps because a file
store is not accessible, then it is not returned by the iterator.

In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
installed, the security manager is invoked to check

RuntimePermission

("getFileStoreAttributes")

. If denied, then
no file stores are returned by the iterator. In addition, the security
manager's

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to
check read access to the file store's

top-most

directory. If
denied, the file store is not returned by the iterator. It is system
dependent if the permission checks are done when the iterator is obtained
or during iteration.

Usage Example:

Suppose we want to print the space usage for all file stores:

```java
for (FileStore store: FileSystems.getDefault().getFileStores()) {
long total = store.getTotalSpace() / 1024;
long used = (store.getTotalSpace() - store.getUnallocatedSpace()) / 1024;
long avail = store.getUsableSpace() / 1024;
System.out.format("%-20s %12d %12d %12d%n", store, total, used, avail);

getPath

```java
public abstract
Path
getPath​(
String
first,

String
... more)
```

Converts a path string, or a sequence of strings that when joined form
a path string, to a

Path

. If

more

does not specify any
elements then the value of the

first

parameter is the path string
to convert. If

more

specifies one or more elements then each
non-empty string, including

first

, is considered to be a sequence
of name elements (see

Path

) and is joined to form a path string.
The details as to how the Strings are joined is provider specific but
typically they will be joined using the

name-separator

as the separator. For example, if the name separator is
"

/

" and

getPath("/foo","bar","gus")

is invoked, then the
path string

"/foo/bar/gus"

is converted to a

Path

.
A

Path

representing an empty path is returned if

first

is the empty string and

more

does not contain any non-empty
strings.

The parsing and conversion to a path object is inherently
implementation dependent. In the simplest case, the path string is rejected,
and

InvalidPathException

thrown, if the path string contains
characters that cannot be converted to characters that are

legal

to the file store. For example, on UNIX systems, the NUL (\u0000)
character is not allowed to be present in a path. An implementation may
choose to reject path strings that contain names that are longer than those
allowed by any file store, and where an implementation supports a complex
path syntax, it may choose to reject path strings that are

badly
formed

.

In the case of the default provider, path strings are parsed based
on the definition of paths at the platform or virtual file system level.
For example, an operating system may not allow specific characters to be
present in a file name, but a specific underlying file store may impose
different or additional restrictions on the set of legal
characters.

This method throws

InvalidPathException

when the path string
cannot be converted to a path. Where possible, and where applicable,
the exception is created with an

index

value indicating the first position in the

path

parameter
that caused the path string to be rejected.

**Parameters:** first

- the path string or initial part of the path string
**Parameters:** more

- additional strings to be joined to form the path string
**Returns:** the resulting

getPathMatcher

```java
public abstract
PathMatcher
getPathMatcher​(
String
syntaxAndPattern)
```

Returns a

PathMatcher

that performs match operations on the

String

representation of

Path

objects by interpreting a
given pattern.

The

syntaxAndPattern

parameter identifies the syntax and the
pattern and takes the form:

```java
syntax
:
pattern
```

where

':'

stands for itself.

A

FileSystem

implementation supports the "

glob

" and
"

regex

" syntaxes, and may support others. The value of the syntax
component is compared without regard to case.

When the syntax is "

glob

" then the

String

representation of the path is matched using a limited pattern language
that resembles regular expressions but with a simpler syntax. For example:

Pattern Language

Example

Description

*.java

Matches a path that represents a file name ending in

.java

*.*

Matches file names containing a dot

*.{java,class}

Matches file names ending with

.java

or

.class

foo.?

Matches file names starting with

foo.

and a single
character extension

/home/*/*

Matches

/home/gus/data

on UNIX platforms

/home/**

Matches

/home/gus

and

/home/gus/data

on UNIX platforms

C:\\*

Matches

C:\foo

and

C:\bar

on the Windows
platform (note that the backslash is escaped; as a string literal in the
Java Language the pattern would be

"C:\\\\*"

)

The following rules are used to interpret glob patterns:

- The

*

character matches zero or more

characters

of a

name

component without
crossing directory boundaries.
- The

**

characters matches zero or more

characters

crossing directory boundaries.
- The

?

character matches exactly one character of a
name component.
- The backslash character (

\

) is used to escape characters
that would otherwise be interpreted as special characters. The expression

\\

matches a single backslash and "\{" matches a left brace
for example.
- The

[ ]

characters are a

bracket expression

that
match a single character of a name component out of a set of characters.
For example,

[abc]

matches

"a"

,

"b"

, or

"c"

.
The hyphen (

-

) may be used to specify a range so

[a-z]

specifies a range that matches from

"a"

to

"z"

(inclusive).
These forms can be mixed so [abce-g] matches

"a"

,

"b"

,

"c"

,

"e"

,

"f"

or

"g"

. If the character
after the

[

is a

!

then it is used for negation so

[!a-c]

matches any character except

"a"

,

"b"

, or

"c"

.

Within a bracket expression the

*

,

?

and

\

characters match themselves. The (

-

) character matches itself if
it is the first character within the brackets, or the first character
after the

!

if negating.
- The

PathMatcher

getPathMatcher​(

String

syntaxAndPattern)

Returns a

PathMatcher

that performs match operations on the

String

representation of

Path

objects by interpreting a
given pattern.

The

syntaxAndPattern

parameter identifies the syntax and the
pattern and takes the form:

```java
syntax
:
pattern
```

where

':'

stands for itself.

A

FileSystem

implementation supports the "

glob

" and
"

regex

" syntaxes, and may support others. The value of the syntax
component is compared without regard to case.

When the syntax is "

glob

" then the

String

representation of the path is matched using a limited pattern language
that resembles regular expressions but with a simpler syntax. For example:

Pattern Language

Example

Description

*.java

Matches a path that represents a file name ending in

.java

*.*

Matches file names containing a dot

*.{java,class}

Matches file names ending with

.java

or

.class

foo.?

Matches file names starting with

foo.

and a single
character extension

/home/*/*

Matches

/home/gus/data

on UNIX platforms

/home/**

Matches

/home/gus

and

/home/gus/data

on UNIX platforms

C:\\*

Matches

C:\foo

and

C:\bar

on the Windows
platform (note that the backslash is escaped; as a string literal in the
Java Language the pattern would be

"C:\\\\*"

)

The following rules are used to interpret glob patterns:

- The

*

character matches zero or more

characters

of a

name

component without
crossing directory boundaries.
- The

**

characters matches zero or more

characters

crossing directory boundaries.
- The

?

character matches exactly one character of a
name component.
- The backslash character (

\

) is used to escape characters
that would otherwise be interpreted as special characters. The expression

\\

matches a single backslash and "\{" matches a left brace
for example.
- The

[ ]

characters are a

bracket expression

that
match a single character of a name component out of a set of characters.
For example,

[abc]

matches

"a"

,

"b"

, or

"c"

.
The hyphen (

-

) may be used to specify a range so

[a-z]

specifies a range that matches from

"a"

to

"z"

(inclusive).
These forms can be mixed so [abce-g] matches

"a"

,

"b"

,

"c"

,

"e"

,

"f"

or

"g"

. If the character
after the

[

is a

!

then it is used for negation so

[!a-c]

matches any character except

"a"

,

"b"

, or

"c"

.

Within a bracket expression the

*

,

?

and

\

characters match themselves. The (

-

) character matches itself if
it is the first character within the brackets, or the first character
after the

!

if negating.

the group matches if any subpattern in the group matches. The
