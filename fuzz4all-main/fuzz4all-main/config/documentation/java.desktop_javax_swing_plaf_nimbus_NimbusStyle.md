# Class NimbusStyle

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\plaf\nimbus\NimbusStyle.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
NimbusStyle

extends
SynthStyle
```

A SynthStyle implementation used by Nimbus. Each Region that has been
registered with the NimbusLookAndFeel will have an associated NimbusStyle.
Third party components that are registered with the NimbusLookAndFeel will
therefore be handed a NimbusStyle from the look and feel from the
#getStyle(JComponent, Region) method.

This class properly reads and retrieves values placed in the UIDefaults
according to the standard Nimbus naming conventions. It will create and
retrieve painters, fonts, colors, and other data stored there.

NimbusStyle also supports the ability to override settings on a per
component basis. NimbusStyle checks the component's client property map for
"Nimbus.Overrides". If the value associated with this key is an instance of
UIDefaults, then the values in that defaults table will override the standard
Nimbus defaults in UIManager, but for that component instance only.

Optionally, you may specify the client property
"Nimbus.Overrides.InheritDefaults". If true, this client property indicates
that the defaults located in UIManager should first be read, and then
replaced with defaults located in the component client properties. If false,
then only the defaults located in the component client property map will
be used. If not specified, it is assumed to be true.

You must specify "Nimbus.Overrides" for "Nimbus.Overrides.InheritDefaults"
to have any effect. "Nimbus.Overrides" indicates whether there are any
overrides, while "Nimbus.Overrides.InheritDefaults" indicates whether those
overrides should first be initialized with the defaults from UIManager.

The NimbusStyle is reloaded whenever a property change event is fired
for a component for "Nimbus.Overrides" or "Nimbus.Overrides.InheritDefaults".
So for example, setting a new UIDefaults on a component would cause the
style to be reloaded.

The values are only read out of UIManager once, and then cached. If
you need to read the values again (for example, if the UI is being reloaded),
then discard this NimbusStyle and read a new one from NimbusLookAndFeel
using NimbusLookAndFeel.getStyle.

The primary API of interest in this class for 3rd party component authors
are the three methods which retrieve painters: #getBackgroundPainter,
#getForegroundPainter, and #getBorderPainter.

NimbusStyle allows you to specify custom states, or modify the order of
states. Synth (and thus Nimbus) has the concept of a "state". For example,
a JButton might be in the "MOUSE_OVER" state, or the "ENABLED" state, or the
"DISABLED" state. These are all "standard" states which are defined in synth,
and which apply to all synth Regions.

Sometimes, however, you need to have a custom state. For example, you
want JButton to render differently if it's parent is a JToolbar. In Nimbus,
you specify these custom states by including a special key in UIDefaults.
The following UIDefaults entries define three states for this button:

```java
JButton.States = Enabled, Disabled, Toolbar
JButton[Enabled].backgroundPainter = somePainter
JButton[Disabled].background = BLUE
JButton[Toolbar].backgroundPainter = someOtherPaint
```

As you can see, the

JButton.States

entry lists the states
that the JButton style will support. You then specify the settings for
each state. If you do not specify the

JButton.States

entry,
then the standard Synth states will be assumed. If you specify the entry
but the list of states is empty or null, then the standard synth states
will be assumed.

### Method Details

#### public void installDefaults​(
SynthContext
ctx)

Installs the necessary state from this Style on the

JComponent

from

context

.

Overridden to cause this style to populate itself with data from
UIDefaults, if necessary.

**Overrides:**
- installDefaults

in class

SynthStyle

**Parameters:**
- ctx

- SynthContext identifying component to install properties
to.

---

#### public
Insets
getInsets​(
SynthContext
ctx,

Insets
in)

Returns the Insets that are used to calculate sizing information.

Overridden to cause this style to populate itself with data from
UIDefaults, if necessary.

**Overrides:**
- getInsets

in class

SynthStyle

**Parameters:**
- ctx

- SynthContext identifying requester
- in

- Insets to place return value in.

**Returns:**
- Sizing Insets.

---

#### protected
Color
getColorForState​(
SynthContext
ctx,

ColorType
type)

Returns the color for the specified state. This should NOT call any
methods on the

JComponent

.

Overridden to cause this style to populate itself with data from
UIDefaults, if necessary.

In addition, NimbusStyle handles ColorTypes slightly differently from
Synth.

- ColorType.BACKGROUND will equate to the color stored in UIDefaults
named "background".
- ColorType.TEXT_BACKGROUND will equate to the color stored in
UIDefaults named "textBackground".
- ColorType.FOREGROUND will equate to the color stored in UIDefaults
named "textForeground".
- ColorType.TEXT_FOREGROUND will equate to the color stored in
UIDefaults named "textForeground".

**Specified by:**
- getColorForState

in class

SynthStyle

**Parameters:**
- ctx

- SynthContext identifying requester
- type

- Type of color being requested.

**Returns:**
- Color to render with

---

#### protected
Font
getFontForState​(
SynthContext
ctx)

Returns the font for the specified state. This should NOT call any
method on the

JComponent

.

Overridden to cause this style to populate itself with data from
UIDefaults, if necessary. If a value named "font" is not found in
UIDefaults, then the "defaultFont" font in UIDefaults will be returned
instead.

**Specified by:**
- getFontForState

in class

SynthStyle

**Parameters:**
- ctx

- SynthContext identifying requester

**Returns:**
- Font to render with

---

#### public
SynthPainter
getPainter​(
SynthContext
ctx)

Returns the

SynthPainter

that will be used for painting.
This may return null.

Returns the SynthPainter for this style, which ends up delegating to
the Painters installed in this style.

**Overrides:**
- getPainter

in class

SynthStyle

**Parameters:**
- ctx

- SynthContext identifying requester

**Returns:**
- SynthPainter to use

---

#### public boolean isOpaque​(
SynthContext
ctx)

Returns true if the region is opaque.

Overridden to cause this style to populate itself with data from
UIDefaults, if necessary. If opacity is not specified in UI defaults,
then it defaults to being non-opaque.

**Overrides:**
- isOpaque

in class

SynthStyle

**Parameters:**
- ctx

- SynthContext identifying requester

**Returns:**
- true if region is opaque.

---

#### public
Object
get​(
SynthContext
ctx,

Object
key)

Getter for a region specific style property.

Overridden to cause this style to populate itself with data from
UIDefaults, if necessary.

Properties in UIDefaults may be specified in a chained manner. For
example:

```java
background
Button.opacity
Button.Enabled.foreground
Button.Enabled+Selected.background
```

In this example, suppose you were in the Enabled+Selected state and
searched for "foreground". In this case, we first check for
Button.Enabled+Selected.foreground, but no such color exists. We then
fall back to the next valid state, in this case,
Button.Enabled.foreground, and have a match. So we return it.

Again, if we were in the state Enabled and looked for "background", we
wouldn't find it in Button.Enabled, or in Button, but would at the top
level in UIManager. So we return that value.

One special note: the "key" passed to this method could be of the form
"background" or "Button.background" where "Button" equals the prefix
passed to the NimbusStyle constructor. In either case, it looks for
"background".

**Overrides:**
- get

in class

SynthStyle

**Parameters:**
- ctx

- SynthContext identifying requester
- key

- must not be null

**Returns:**
- Value of the named property

---

#### public

```

Returns true if the region is opaque.

Overridden to cause this style to populate itself with data from
UIDefaults, if necessary. If opacity is not specified in UI defaults,
then it defaults to being non-opaque.

**Overrides:** isOpaque

in class

SynthStyle
**Parameters:** ctx

- SynthContext identifying requester
**Returns:** true if region is opaque.

- get

```java
public
Object
get​(
SynthContext
ctx,

Object
key)
```

Getter for a region specific style property.

Overridden to cause this style to populate itself with data from
UIDefaults, if necessary.

Properties in UIDefaults may be specified in a chained manner. For
example:

```java
background
Button.opacity
Button.Enabled.foreground
Button.Enabled+Selected.background
```

In this example, suppose you were in the Enabled+Selected state and
searched for "foreground". In this case, we first check for
Button.Enabled+Selected.foreground, but no such color exists. We then
fall back to the next valid state, in this case,
Button.Enabled.foreground, and have a match. So we return it.

Again, if we were in the state Enabled and looked for "background", we
wouldn't find it in Button.Enabled, or in Button, but would at the top
level in UIManager. So we return that value.

One special note: the "key" passed to this method could be of the form
"background" or "Button.background" where "Button" equals the prefix
passed to the NimbusStyle constructor. In either case, it looks for
"background".
