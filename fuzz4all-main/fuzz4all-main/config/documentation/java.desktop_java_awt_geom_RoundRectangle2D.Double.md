#### public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Specified by:**
- getBounds2D

in interface

Shape

**Returns:**
- an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

Shape

.

**See Also:**
- Shape.getBounds()

**Since:**
- 1.2

RoundRectangle2D

to the specified

double

values.

- getBounds2D

```java
public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()
```

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Specified by:** getBounds2D

in interface

Shape
**Returns:** an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

Shape

.
**Since:** 1.2
