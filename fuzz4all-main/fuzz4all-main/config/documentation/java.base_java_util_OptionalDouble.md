# Class OptionalDouble

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\OptionalDouble.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
OptionalDouble

extends
Object
```

A container object which may or may not contain a

double

value.
If a value is present,

isPresent()

returns

true

. If no
value is present, the object is considered

empty

and

isPresent()

returns

false

.

Additional methods that depend on the presence or absence of a contained
value are provided, such as

orElse()

(returns a default value if no value is present) and

ifPresent()

(performs
an action if a value is present).

This is a

value-based

class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
(

==

), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of

OptionalDouble

may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.

**API Note:** OptionalDouble

is primarily intended for use as a method return type where
there is a clear need to represent "no result." A variable whose type is

OptionalDouble

should never itself be

null

; it should always point
to an

OptionalDouble

instance.
**Since:** 1.8

### Method Details

#### public static
OptionalDouble
empty()

Returns an empty

OptionalDouble

instance. No value is present
for this

OptionalDouble

.

**Returns:**
- an empty

OptionalDouble

.

**API Note:**
- Though it may be tempting to do so, avoid testing if an object is empty
by comparing with

==

against instances returned by

OptionalDouble.empty()

. There is no guarantee that it is a singleton.
Instead, use

isPresent()

.

---

#### public static
OptionalDouble

OptionalDouble

describing the given value.

**Parameters:**
- value

- the value to describe

#### public double getAsDouble()

If a value is present, returns the value, otherwise throws

NoSuchElementException

.

**Returns:**
- the value described by this

OptionalDouble

**Throws:**
- NoSuchElementException

- if no value is present

**API Note:**
- The preferred alternative to this method is

orElseThrow()

.

---

#### public boolean equals​(

both instances have no value present or;

the present values are "equal to" each other via

Double.compare() == 0

.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- an object to be tested for equality

suitable for debugging. The exact presentation format is unspecified and
may vary between implementations and versions.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- the string representation of this instance

**Implementation Requirements:**
- If a value is present the result must include its string representation
in the result. Empty and present

OptionalDouble

s must be
unambiguously differentiable.

obj)
```

Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this

OptionalDouble

. The other object is considered equal if:

- it is also an

and;

both instances have no value present or;

the present values are "equal to" each other via

Double.compare() == 0

.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- an object to be tested for equality
**Returns:** true

if the other object is "equal to" this object
otherwise

false
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

#### equals

public boolean equals​(

Object

obj)

Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this

OptionalDouble

. The other object is considered equal if:

- it is also an

OptionalDouble

and;

both instances have no value present or;

the present values are "equal to" each other via

Double.compare() == 0

.

it is also an

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a non-empty string representation of this

OptionalDouble

suitable for debugging. The exact presentation format is unspecified and
may vary between implementations and versions.

**Implementation Requirements:** If a value is present the result must include its string representation
in the result. Empty and present

OptionalDouble

s must be
unambiguously differentiable.
**Returns:** the string representation of this instance
