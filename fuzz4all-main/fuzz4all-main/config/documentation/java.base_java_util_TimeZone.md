# Class TimeZone

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\TimeZone.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
TimeZone

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
,
Cloneable
```

TimeZone

represents a time zone offset, and also figures out daylight
savings.

Typically, you get a

TimeZone

using

getDefault

which creates a

TimeZone

based on the time zone where the program
is running. For example, for a program running in Japan,

getDefault

creates a

TimeZone

object based on Japanese Standard Time.

You can also get a

TimeZone

using

getTimeZone

along with a time zone ID. For instance, the time zone ID for the
U.S. Pacific Time zone is "America/Los_Angeles". So, you can get a
U.S. Pacific Time

TimeZone

object with:

```java
TimeZone tz = TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Los_Angeles");
```

You can use the

getAvailableIDs

method to iterate through
all the supported time zone IDs. You can then choose a
supported ID to get a

TimeZone

.
If the time zone you want is not represented by one of the
supported IDs, then a custom time zone ID can be specified to
produce a TimeZone. The syntax of a custom time zone ID is:

```java
CustomID:

GMT

Sign

Hours

:

Minutes

GMT

Sign

Hours

Minutes

GMT

Hours

Sign:
one of

+ -

Hours:

Digit

Digit

Digit

Minutes:

Digit

Digit

Digit:
one of

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

Hours

must be between 0 to 23 and

Minutes

must be
between 00 to 59. For example, "GMT+10" and "GMT+0010" mean ten
hours and ten minutes ahead of GMT, respectively.

The format is locale independent and digits must be taken from the
Basic Latin block of the Unicode standard. No daylight saving time
transition schedule can be specified with a custom time zone ID. If
the specified string doesn't match the syntax,

"GMT"

is used.

When creating a

TimeZone

, the specified custom time
zone ID is normalized in the following syntax:

```java
NormalizedCustomID:

GMT

Sign

TwoDigitHours

:

Minutes

Sign:
one of

+ -

TwoDigitHours:

Digit

Digit

Minutes:

Digit

Digit

Digit:
one of

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

For example, TimeZone.getTimeZone("GMT-8").getID() returns "GMT-08:00".

Three-letter time zone IDs

For compatibility with JDK 1.1.x, some other three-letter time zone IDs
(such as "PST", "CTT", "AST") are also supported. However,

their
use is deprecated

because the same abbreviation is often used
for multiple time zones (for example, "CST" could be U.S. "Central Standard
Time" and "China Standard Time"), and the Java platform can then only
recognize one of them.

### Constructor Details

#### public TimeZone()

Sole constructor. (For invocation by subclass constructors, typically
implicit.)

---

### Method Details

#### public abstract int getOffset​(int era,
int year,
int month,
int day,
int dayOfWeek,
int milliseconds)

Gets the time zone offset, for current date, modified in case of
daylight savings. This is the offset to add to UTC to get local time.

This method returns a historically correct offset if an
underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical Daylight Saving Time schedule and GMT
offset changes.

**Parameters:**
- era

- the era of the given date.
- year

- the year in the given date.
- month

- the month in the given date.
Month is 0-based. e.g., 0 for January.
- day

- the day-in-month of the given date.
- dayOfWeek

- the day-of-week of the given date.
- milliseconds

- the milliseconds in day in

standard

local time.

**Returns:**
- the offset in milliseconds to add to GMT to get local time.

**See Also:**
- Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET

,

Calendar.DST_OFFSET

---

#### public int getOffset​(long date)

Returns the offset of this time zone from UTC at the specified
date. If Daylight Saving Time is in effect at the specified
date, the offset value is adjusted with the amount of daylight
saving.

This method returns a historically correct offset value if an
underlying TimeZone implementation subclass supports historical
Daylight Saving Time schedule and GMT offset changes.

**Parameters:**
- date

- the date represented in milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT

**Returns:**
- the amount of time in milliseconds to add to UTC to get local time.

**See Also:**
- Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET

,

Calendar.DST_OFFSET

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public abstract void setRawOffset​(int offsetMillis)

Sets the base time zone offset to GMT.
This is the offset to add to UTC to get local time.

If an underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical GMT offset changes, the specified GMT
offset is set as the latest GMT offset and the difference from
the known latest GMT offset value is used to adjust all
historical GMT offset values.

**Parameters:**
- offsetMillis

- the given base time zone offset to GMT.

---

#### public abstract int getRawOffset()

Returns the amount of time in milliseconds to add to UTC to get
standard time in this time zone. Because this value is not
affected by daylight saving time, it is called

raw
offset

.

If an underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical GMT offset changes, the method returns the
raw offset value of the current date. In Honolulu, for example,
its raw offset changed from GMT-10:30 to GMT-10:00 in 1947, and
this method always returns -36000000 milliseconds (i.e., -10
hours).

**Returns:**
- the amount of raw offset time in milliseconds to add to UTC.

**See Also:**
- Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET

---

#### public
String
getID()

Gets the ID of this time zone.

**Returns:**
- the ID of this time zone.

#### public
String
getDisplayName​(boolean daylight,
int style,

Locale
locale)

Returns a name in the specified

style

of this

TimeZone

suitable for presentation to the user in the specified

locale

doesn't
observe Daylight Saving Time). Otherwise, a Standard Time name is
returned.

When looking up a time zone name, the

default

Locale

search path of

ResourceBundle

derived
from the specified

locale

is used. (No

fallback

Locale

search is performed.) If a time zone name in any

Locale

of the search path, including

Locale.ROOT

, is
found, the name is returned. Otherwise, a string in the

normalized custom ID format

is returned.

#### public int getDSTSavings()

Returns the amount of time to be added to local standard time
to get local wall clock time.

The default implementation returns 3600000 milliseconds
(i.e., one hour) if a call to

useDaylightTime()

returns

true

. Otherwise, 0 (zero) is returned.

If an underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical and future Daylight Saving Time schedule
changes, this method returns the amount of saving time of the
last known Daylight Saving Time rule that can be a future
prediction.

If the amount of saving time at any given time stamp is
required, construct a

Calendar

with this

TimeZone

and the time stamp, and call

Calendar.get

(

Calendar.DST_OFFSET

)

.

**Returns:**
- the amount of saving time in milliseconds

#### public abstract boolean useDaylightTime()

Queries if this

TimeZone

uses Daylight Saving Time.

If an underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical and future Daylight Saving Time schedule
changes, this method refers to the last known Daylight Saving Time
rule that can be a future prediction and may not be the same as
the current rule. Consider calling

observesDaylightTime()

if the current rule should also be taken into account.

```

TimeZone

represents a time zone offset, and also figures out daylight
savings.

Typically, you get a

TimeZone

using

getDefault

which creates a

TimeZone

based on the time zone where the program
is running. For example, for a program running in Japan,

getDefault

creates a

TimeZone

object based on Japanese Standard Time.

You can also get a

TimeZone

using

getTimeZone

along with a time zone ID. For instance, the time zone ID for the
U.S. Pacific Time zone is "America/Los_Angeles". So, you can get a
U.S. Pacific Time

TimeZone

object with:

```java
TimeZone tz = TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Los_Angeles");
```

You can use the

getAvailableIDs

method to iterate through
all the supported time zone IDs. You can then choose a
supported ID to get a

TimeZone

.
If the time zone you want is not represented by one of the
supported IDs, then a custom time zone ID can be specified to
produce a TimeZone. The syntax of a custom time zone ID is:

```java
CustomID:

GMT

Minutes:

Digit:
one of

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

Hours

must be between 0 to 23 and

Minutes

must be
between 00 to 59. For example, "GMT+10" and "GMT+0010" mean ten
hours and ten minutes ahead of GMT, respectively.

The format is locale independent and digits must be taken from the
Basic Latin block of the Unicode standard. No daylight saving time
transition schedule can be specified with a custom time zone ID. If
the specified string doesn't match the syntax,

"GMT"

is used.

When creating a

TimeZone

, the specified custom time
zone ID is normalized in the following syntax:

```java
NormalizedCustomID:

TwoDigitHours:

Digit

Minutes:

Digit

Digit

Digit:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

For example, TimeZone.getTimeZone("GMT-8").getID() returns "GMT-08:00".

Three-letter time zone IDs

For compatibility with JDK 1.1.x, some other three-letter time zone IDs
(such as "PST", "CTT", "AST") are also supported. However,

their
use is deprecated

because the same abbreviation is often used
for multiple time zones (for example, "CST" could be U.S. "Central Standard
Time" and "China Standard Time"), and the Java platform can then only
recognize one of them.

The format is locale independent and digits must be taken from the
Basic Latin block of the Unicode standard. No daylight saving time
transition schedule can be specified with a custom time zone ID. If
the specified string doesn't match the syntax,

"GMT"

is used.

When creating a

TimeZone

, the specified custom time
zone ID is normalized in the following syntax:

For example, TimeZone.getTimeZone("GMT-8").getID() returns "GMT-08:00".

Three-letter time zone IDs

For compatibility with JDK 1.1.x, some other three-letter time zone IDs
(such as "PST", "CTT", "AST") are also supported. However,

their
use is deprecated

because the same abbreviation is often used
for multiple time zones (for example, "CST" could be U.S. "Central Standard
Time" and "China Standard Time"), and the Java platform can then only
recognize one of them.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getOffset

```java
public abstract int getOffset​(int era,
int year,
int month,
int day,
int dayOfWeek,
int milliseconds)
```

Gets the time zone offset, for current date, modified in case of
daylight savings. This is the offset to add to UTC to get local time.

This method returns a historically correct offset if an
underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical Daylight Saving Time schedule and GMT
offset changes.

**Parameters:** era

- the era of the given date.
**Parameters:** year

- the year in the given date.
**Parameters:** month

- the month in the given date.
Month is 0-based. e.g., 0 for January.
**Parameters:** day

- the day-in-month of the given date.
**Parameters:** dayOfWeek

- the day-of-week of the given date.
**Parameters:** milliseconds

- the milliseconds in day in

standard

local time.
**Returns:** the offset in milliseconds to add to GMT to get local time.
**See Also:** Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET

,

Calendar.DST_OFFSET

- getOffset

```java
public int getOffset​(long date)
```

Returns the offset of this time zone from UTC at the specified
date. If Daylight Saving Time is in effect at the specified
date, the offset value is adjusted with the amount of daylight
saving.

This method returns a historically correct offset value if an
underlying TimeZone implementation subclass supports historical
Daylight Saving Time schedule and GMT offset changes.

**Parameters:** date

- the date represented in milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT
**Returns:** the amount of time in milliseconds to add to UTC to get local time.
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET

,

Calendar.DST_OFFSET

- setRawOffset

```java
public abstract void setRawOffset​(int offsetMillis)
```

Sets the base time zone offset to GMT.
This is the offset to add to UTC to get local time.

If an underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical GMT offset changes, the specified GMT
offset is set as the latest GMT offset and the difference from
the known latest GMT offset value is used to adjust all
historical GMT offset values.

**Parameters:** offsetMillis

- the given base time zone offset to GMT.

- getRawOffset

```java
public abstract int getRawOffset()
```

Returns the amount of time in milliseconds to add to UTC to get
standard time in this time zone. Because this value is not
affected by daylight saving time, it is called

raw
offset

.

If an underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical GMT offset changes, the method returns the
raw offset value of the current date. In Honolulu, for example,
its raw offset changed from GMT-10:30 to GMT-10:00 in 1947, and
this method always returns -36000000 milliseconds (i.e., -10
hours).

**Returns:** the amount of raw offset time in milliseconds to add to UTC.
**See Also:** Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET

- getID

```java
public
String
getID()
```

Gets the ID of this time zone.

**Returns:** the ID of this time zone.

- setID

```java
public void setID​(
String
ID)
```

Sets the time zone ID. This does not change any other data in
the time zone object.

**Parameters:** ID

- the new time zone ID.

- getDisplayName

```java
public final
String
getDisplayName()
```

Returns a long standard time name of this

TimeZone

suitable for
presentation to the user in the default locale.

This method is equivalent to:

```java
getDisplayName(false,
LONG
,
Locale.getDefault(
Locale.Category.DISPLAY
))
```

**Returns:** the human-readable name of this time zone in the default locale.
**Since:** 1.2

Returns a long standard time name of this

TimeZone

suitable for
presentation to the user in the specified

locale

.

This method is equivalent to:

```java
getDisplayName(false,
LONG
, locale)
```

**Parameters:** locale

- the locale in which to supply the display name.
**Returns:** the human-readable name of this time zone in the given locale.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

```

Returns a name in the specified

style

of this

TimeZone

suitable for presentation to the user in the default locale. If the
specified

daylight

is

true

, a Daylight Saving Time name
is returned (even if this

TimeZone

doesn't observe Daylight Saving
Time). Otherwise, a Standard Time name is returned.

This method is equivalent to:

```java
getDisplayName(daylight, style,
Locale.getDefault(
Locale.Category.DISPLAY
))
```

**Parameters:** daylight

-

true

specifying a Daylight Saving Time name, or

false

specifying a Standard Time name
**Parameters:** style

- either

LONG

or

SHORT
**Returns:** the human-readable name of this time zone in the default locale.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

style

is invalid.

- getDisplayName

```java
public
String
getDisplayName​(boolean daylight,
int style,

Locale
locale)
```

Returns a name in the specified

style

of this

TimeZone

suitable for presentation to the user in the specified

locale

. If the specified

daylight

is

true

, a Daylight
Saving Time name is returned (even if this

TimeZone

doesn't
observe Daylight Saving Time). Otherwise, a Standard Time name is
returned.

When looking up a time zone name, the

default

Locale

search path of

ResourceBundle

derived
from the specified

locale

is used. (No

fallback

Locale

search is performed.) If a time zone name in any

Locale

of the search path, including

Locale.ROOT

, is
found, the name is returned. Otherwise, a string in the

normalized custom ID format

is returned.

**Parameters:** daylight

-

true

specifying a Daylight Saving Time name, or

false

specifying a Standard Time name
**Parameters:** style

- either

LONG

or

SHORT
**Parameters:** locale

- the locale in which to supply the display name.
**Returns:** the human-readable name of this time zone in the given locale.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

style

is invalid.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

locale

is

null

.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** DateFormatSymbols.getZoneStrings()

- getDSTSavings

```java
public int getDSTSavings()
```

Returns the amount of time to be added to local standard time
to get local wall clock time.

The default implementation returns 3600000 milliseconds
(i.e., one hour) if a call to

useDaylightTime()

returns

true

. Otherwise, 0 (zero) is returned.

If an underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical and future Daylight Saving Time schedule
changes, this method returns the amount of saving time of the
last known Daylight Saving Time rule that can be a future
prediction.

If the amount of saving time at any given time stamp is
required, construct a

Calendar

with this

TimeZone

and the time stamp, and call

Calendar.get

(

Calendar.DST_OFFSET

)

.

**Returns:** the amount of saving time in milliseconds

- getOffset

```java
public int getOffset​(long date)
```

Returns the offset of this time zone from UTC at the specified
date. If Daylight Saving Time is in effect at the specified
date, the offset value is adjusted with the amount of daylight
saving.

This method returns a historically correct offset value if an
underlying TimeZone implementation subclass supports historical
Daylight Saving Time schedule and GMT offset changes.

**Parameters:** date

implementation subclass
supports historical GMT offset changes, the specified GMT
offset is set as the latest GMT offset and the difference from
the known latest GMT offset value is used to adjust all
historical GMT offset values.

**Parameters:** offsetMillis

- the given base time zone offset to GMT.

- getRawOffset

```java
public abstract int getRawOffset()

Returns the amount of time in milliseconds to add to UTC to get
standard time in this time zone. Because this value is not
affected by daylight saving time, it is called

raw
offset

.

If an underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical GMT offset changes, the method returns the
raw offset value of the current date. In Honolulu, for example,
its raw offset changed from GMT-10:30 to GMT-10:00 in 1947, and
this method always returns -36000000 milliseconds (i.e., -10
hours).

useDaylightTime

```java
public abstract boolean useDaylightTime()
```

Queries if this

TimeZone

uses Daylight Saving Time.

If an underlying

TimeZone

implementation subclass
supports historical and future Daylight Saving Time schedule
changes, this method refers to the last known Daylight Saving Time
rule that can be a future prediction and may not be the same as
the current rule. Consider calling

observesDaylightTime()

if the current rule should also be taken into account.

**Returns:** true

if this

TimeZone

uses Daylight Saving Time,

false

, otherwise.
