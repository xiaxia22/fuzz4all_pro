# Class AudioInputStream

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\sound\sampled\AudioInputStream.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
AudioInputStream

extends
InputStream
```

An audio input stream is an input stream with a specified audio format and
length. The length is expressed in sample frames, not bytes. Several methods
are provided for reading a certain number of bytes from the stream, or an
unspecified number of bytes. The audio input stream keeps track of the last
byte that was read. You can skip over an arbitrary number of bytes to get to
a later position for reading. An audio input stream may support marks. When
you set a mark, the current position is remembered so that you can return to
it later.

The

AudioSystem

class includes many methods that manipulate

AudioInputStream

objects. For example, the methods let you:

- obtain an audio input stream from an external audio file, stream, or

URL

write an external file from an audio input stream

convert an audio input stream to a different audio format
