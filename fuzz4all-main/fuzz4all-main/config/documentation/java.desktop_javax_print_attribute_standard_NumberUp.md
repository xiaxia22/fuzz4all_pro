# Class NumberUp

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\print\attribute\standard\NumberUp.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
NumberUp

extends
IntegerSyntax

implements
DocAttribute
,
PrintRequestAttribute
,
PrintJobAttribute
```

Class

NumberUp

is an integer valued printing attribute class that
specifies the number of print-stream pages to impose upon a single side of an
instance of a selected medium. That is, if the NumberUp value is

n,

the printer must place

n

print-stream pages on a single side of an
instance of the selected medium. To accomplish this, the printer may add some
sort of translation, scaling, or rotation. This attribute primarily controls
the translation, scaling and rotation of print-stream pages.

The effect of a

NumberUp

attribute on a multidoc print job (a job
with multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same number
up values specified or whether different docs have different number up values
specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the

MultipleDocumentHandling

attribute.

- If all the docs have the same number up value

n

specified, then
any value of

MultipleDocumentHandling

makes sense, and the printer's processing depends on the

MultipleDocumentHandling

value:

- SINGLE_DOCUMENT

-- All the input docs will be combined
together into one output document. Each media impression will consist of

n

m print-stream pages from the output document.

SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET

-- All the input docs will be
combined together into one output document. Each media impression will
consist of

n

print-stream pages from the output document. However,
the first impression of each input doc will always start on a new media
sheet; this means the last impression of an input doc may have fewer than

n

print-stream pages on it.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES

-- The input docs will
remain separate. Each media impression will consist of

n

print-stream pages from the input doc. Since the input docs are separate,
the first impression of each input doc will always start on a new media
sheet; this means the last impression of an input doc may have fewer than

n

print-stream pages on it.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES

-- The input docs will
remain separate. Each media impression will consist of

n

print-stream pages from the input doc. Since the input docs are separate,
the first impression of each input doc will always start on a new media
sheet; this means the last impression of an input doc may have fewer than

n

print-stream pages on it.

- SINGLE_DOCUMENT

-- All the input docs will be combined
together into one output document. Each media impression will consist of

n

i

print-stream pages from the output document, where

i

is the number of the input doc corresponding to that point in
the output document. When the next input doc has a different number up
value from the previous input doc, the first print-stream page of the
next input doc goes at the start of the next media impression, possibly
leaving fewer than the full number of print-stream pages on the previous
media impression.

SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET

-- All the input docs will be
combined together into one output document. Each media impression will
consist of

n

print-stream pages from the output document. However,
the first impression of each input doc will always start on a new media
sheet; this means the last impression of an input doc may have fewer than

n

print-stream pages on it.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES

-- The input docs will
remain separate. For input doc

i,

each media impression will
consist of

n

i

print-stream pages from the input doc.
Since the input docs are separate, the first impression of each input doc
will always start on a new media sheet; this means the last impression of
an input doc may have fewer than

n

i

print-stream pages
on it.

SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES

-- The input docs will
remain separate. For input doc

i,

each media impression will
consist of

n

i

print-stream pages from the input doc.
Since the input docs are separate, the first impression of each input doc
will always start on a new media sheet; this means the last impression of
an input doc may have fewer than

n

i

print-stream pages
on it.

The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
category name returned by

getName()

gives the IPP attribute name.
