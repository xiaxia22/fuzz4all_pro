# Interface ChronoLocalDateTime<D extends ChronoLocalDate >

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\chrono\ChronoLocalDateTime.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
ChronoLocalDateTime<D extends
ChronoLocalDate
>

extends
Temporal
,
TemporalAdjuster
,
Comparable
<
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?>>
```

A date-time without a time-zone in an arbitrary chronology, intended
for advanced globalization use cases.

Most applications should declare method signatures, fields and variables
as

LocalDateTime

, not this interface.

A

ChronoLocalDateTime

is the abstract representation of a local date-time
where the

Chronology chronology

, or calendar system, is pluggable.
The date-time is defined in terms of fields expressed by

TemporalField

,
where most common implementations are defined in

ChronoField

.
The chronology defines how the calendar system operates and the meaning of
the standard fields.

When to use this interface

The design of the API encourages the use of

LocalDateTime

rather than this
interface, even in the case where the application needs to deal with multiple
calendar systems. The rationale for this is explored in detail in

ChronoLocalDate

.

Ensure that the discussion in

ChronoLocalDate

has been read and understood
before using this interface.

**Type Parameters:** D

- the concrete type for the date of this date-time

### Method Details

#### static
Comparator
<
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?>> timeLineOrder()

Gets a comparator that compares

ChronoLocalDateTime

in
time-line order ignoring the chronology.

This comparator differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying date-time and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the position of the date-time on the local time-line.
The underlying comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-day and nano-of-day.

**Returns:**
- a comparator that compares in time-line order ignoring the chronology

**See Also:**
- isAfter(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

,

isBefore(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

,

isEqual(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

---

#### static
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)

Obtains an instance of

ChronoLocalDateTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains a local date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ChronoLocalDateTime

.

The conversion extracts and combines the chronology and the date-time
from the temporal object. The behavior is equivalent to using

Chronology.localDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

with the extracted chronology.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ChronoLocalDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null

**Returns:**
- the date-time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

ChronoLocalDateTime

**See Also:**
- Chronology.localDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

---

#### default
Chronology
getChronology()

Gets the chronology of this date-time.

The

Chronology

represents the calendar system in use.
The era and other fields in

ChronoField

are defined by the chronology.

**Returns:**
- the chronology, not null

---

#### D
toLocalDate()

Gets the local date part of this date-time.

This returns a local date with the same year, month and day
as this date-time.

**Returns:**
- the date part of this date-time, not null

---

#### LocalTime
toLocalTime()

Gets the local time part of this date-time.

This returns a local time with the same hour, minute, second and
nanosecond as this date-time.

**Returns:**
- the time part of this date-time, not null

---

#### boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if the specified field can be queried on this date-time.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported fields is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoField

date and time fields.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:**
- isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if the field can be queried, false if not

---

#### default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to or subtracted from this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported units is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoUnit

units except

FOREVER

.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:**
- isSupported

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- unit

- the unit to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to set in the result, not null
- newValue

- the new value of the field in the result

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> plus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:**
- plus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amount

- the amount to add, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the addition cannot be made
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:**
- plus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amountToAdd

- the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
- unit

- the unit of the amount to add, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> minus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:**
- minus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amount

- the amount to subtract, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**

- if the subtraction cannot be made
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> minus​(long amountToSubtract,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period subtracted.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:**
- minus

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- amountToSubtract

- the amount of the specified unit to subtract, may be negative
- unit

- the unit of the amount to subtract, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified period subtracted, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be subtracted
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)

Queries this date-time using the specified query.

This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:**
- query

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- query

- the query to invoke, not null

**Returns:**
- the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

**Type Parameters:**
- R

- the type of the result

---

#### default
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same date and time as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the date and time changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

and

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalDateTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalDateTime);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null

**Returns:**
- the adjusted object, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### default
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)

Formats this date-time using the specified formatter.

This date-time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

The default implementation must behave as follows:

```java
return formatter.format(this);
```

**Parameters:**
- formatter

- the formatter to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the formatted date-time string, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

---

#### ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> atZone​(
ZoneId
zone)

Combines this time with a time-zone to create a

ChronoZonedDateTime

.

This returns a

ChronoZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time at the
specified time-zone. The result will match this date-time as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

To obtain the later offset during an overlap, call

ChronoZonedDateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

on the result of this method.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the time-zone to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the zoned date-time formed from this date-time, not null

---

#### default
Instant
toInstant​(
ZoneOffset
offset)

Converts this date-time to an

Instant

.

This combines this local date-time and the specified offset to form
an

Instant

.

This default implementation calculates from the epoch-day of the date and the
second-of-day of the time.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- the offset to use for the conversion, not null

**Returns:**
- an

Instant

representing the same instant, not null

---

#### default long toEpochSecond​(
ZoneOffset
offset)

Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch
of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This combines this local date-time and the specified offset to calculate the
epoch-second value, which is the number of elapsed seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier are negative.

This default implementation calculates from the epoch-day of the date and the
second-of-day of the time.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- the offset to use for the conversion, not null

**Returns:**
- the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

---

#### default int compareTo​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)

Compares this date-time to another date-time, including the chronology.

The comparison is based first on the underlying time-line date-time, then
on the chronology.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2012-12-03T12:00 (ISO)
- 2012-12-04T12:00 (ISO)
- 2555-12-04T12:00 (ThaiBuddhist)
- 2012-12-05T12:00 (ISO)

Values #2 and #3 represent the same date-time on the time-line.
When two values represent the same date-time, the chronology ID is compared to distinguish them.
This step is needed to make the ordering "consistent with equals".

If all the date-time objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
additional chronology stage is not required and only the local date-time is used.

This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

D

extends

ChronoLocalDate

>

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

---

#### default boolean isAfter​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)

Checks if this date-time is after the specified date-time ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying date-time and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day
and nano-of-day.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this is after the specified date-time

---

#### default boolean isBefore​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)

Checks if this date-time is before the specified date-time ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying date-time and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day
and nano-of-day.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this is before the specified date-time

---

#### default boolean isEqual​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)

Checks if this date-time is equal to the specified date-time ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and time and not the chronology.
This allows date-times in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day
and nano-of-day.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if the underlying date-time is equal to the specified date-time on the timeline

---

#### boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Checks if this date-time is equal to another date-time, including the chronology.

Compares this date-time with another ensuring that the date-time and chronology are the same.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if this is equal to the other date

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### int hashCode()

A hash code for this date-time.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a suitable hash code

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### String
toString()

Outputs this date-time as a

String

.

The output will include the full local date-time.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- timeLineOrder

```java
static
Comparator
<
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?>> timeLineOrder()
```

Gets a comparator that compares

ChronoLocalDateTime

in
time-line order ignoring the chronology.

This comparator differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying date-time and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the position of the date-time on the local time-line.
The underlying comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-day and nano-of-day.

**Returns:** a comparator that compares in time-line order ignoring the chronology
**See Also:** isAfter(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

,

isBefore(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

,

isEqual(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

- from

```java
static
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

ChronoLocalDateTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains a local date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ChronoLocalDateTime

.

The conversion extracts and combines the chronology and the date-time
from the temporal object. The behavior is equivalent to using

Chronology.localDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

with the extracted chronology.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ChronoLocalDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the date-time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to a

ChronoLocalDateTime
**See Also:** Chronology.localDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

- getChronology

```java
default
Chronology
getChronology()
```

Gets the chronology of this date-time.

The

Chronology

represents the calendar system in use.
The era and other fields in

ChronoField

are defined by the chronology.

**Returns:** the chronology, not null

- toLocalDate

```java
D
toLocalDate()
```

Gets the local date part of this date-time.

This returns a local date with the same year, month and day
as this date-time.

**Returns:** the date part of this date-time, not null

- toLocalTime

```java
LocalTime
toLocalTime()
```

Gets the local time part of this date-time.

This returns a local time with the same hour, minute, second and
nanosecond as this date-time.

**Returns:** the time part of this date-time, not null

- isSupported

```java
boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if the specified field can be queried on this date-time.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported fields is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoField

date and time fields.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the field can be queried, false if not

- isSupported

```java
default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to or subtracted from this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported units is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoUnit

units except

FOREVER

.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

- with

```java
default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** field

- the field to set in the result, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field in the result
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> plus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the addition cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToAdd

- the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be added
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> minus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the subtraction cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> minus​(long amountToSubtract,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period subtracted.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToSubtract

- the amount of the specified unit to subtract, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period subtracted, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be subtracted
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- query

```java
default <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this date-time using the specified query.

This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

- adjustInto

```java
default
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)
```

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same date and time as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the date and time changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

and

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalDateTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalDateTime);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- format

```java
default
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Formats this date-time using the specified formatter.

This date-time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

The default implementation must behave as follows:

```java
return formatter.format(this);
```

**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the formatted date-time string, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

- atZone

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> atZone​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Combines this time with a time-zone to create a

ChronoZonedDateTime

.

This returns a

ChronoZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time at the
specified time-zone. The result will match this date-time as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

To obtain the later offset during an overlap, call

ChronoZonedDateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

on the result of this method.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to use, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time formed from this date-time, not null

- toInstant

```java
default
Instant
toInstant​(
ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Converts this date-time to an

Instant

.

This combines this local date-time and the specified offset to form
an

Instant

.

This default implementation calculates from the epoch-day of the date and the
second-of-day of the time.

**Parameters:** offset

- the offset to use for the conversion, not null
**Returns:** an

Instant

representing the same instant, not null

- toEpochSecond

```java
default long toEpochSecond​(
ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch
of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This combines this local date-time and the specified offset to calculate the
epoch-second value, which is the number of elapsed seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier are negative.

This default implementation calculates from the epoch-day of the date and the
second-of-day of the time.

**Parameters:** offset

- the offset to use for the conversion, not null
**Returns:** the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

- compareTo

```java
default int compareTo​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)
```

Compares this date-time to another date-time, including the chronology.

The comparison is based first on the underlying time-line date-time, then
on the chronology.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2012-12-03T12:00 (ISO)
- 2012-12-04T12:00 (ISO)
- 2555-12-04T12:00 (ThaiBuddhist)
- 2012-12-05T12:00 (ISO)

Values #2 and #3 represent the same date-time on the time-line.
When two values represent the same date-time, the chronology ID is compared to distinguish them.
This step is needed to make the ordering "consistent with equals".

If all the date-time objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
additional chronology stage is not required and only the local date-time is used.

This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

D

extends

ChronoLocalDate

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

- isAfter

```java
default boolean isAfter​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)
```

Checks if this date-time is after the specified date-time ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying date-time and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day
and nano-of-day.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is after the specified date-time

- isBefore

```java
default boolean isBefore​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)
```

Checks if this date-time is before the specified date-time ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying date-time and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day
and nano-of-day.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is before the specified date-time

- isEqual

```java
default boolean isEqual​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)
```

Checks if this date-time is equal to the specified date-time ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying date and time and not the chronology.
This allows date-times in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day
and nano-of-day.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if the underlying date-time is equal to the specified date-time on the timeline

- equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Method Detail

- timeLineOrder

```java
static
Comparator
<
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?>> timeLineOrder()
```

Gets a comparator that compares

ChronoLocalDateTime

in
time-line order ignoring the chronology.

This comparator differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying date-time and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the position of the date-time on the local time-line.
The underlying comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-day and nano-of-day.

**Returns:** a comparator that compares in time-line order ignoring the chronology
**See Also:** isAfter(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

,

isBefore(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

,

isEqual(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

- from

```java
static
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

ChronoLocalDateTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains a local date-time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

ChronoLocalDateTime

.

The conversion extracts and combines the chronology and the date-time
from the temporal object. The behavior is equivalent to using

Chronology.localDateTime(TemporalAccessor)

with the extracted chronology.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

ChronoLocalDateTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported fields is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoField

date and time fields.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the field can be queried, false if not

- isSupported

```java
default boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to or subtracted from this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

The set of supported units is defined by the chronology and normally includes
all

ChronoUnit

units except

FOREVER

.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

- with

```java
default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** field

- the field to set in the result, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field in the result
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> plus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the addition cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToAdd

- the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be added
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> minus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the subtraction cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
ChronoLocalDateTime
<
D
> minus​(long amountToSubtract,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period subtracted.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Specified by:** minus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToSubtract

- the amount of the specified unit to subtract, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period subtracted, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be subtracted
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- query

```java
default <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this date-time using the specified query.

This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

- adjustInto

```java
default
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)
```

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same date and time as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the date and time changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY

and

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisLocalDateTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalDateTime);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- format

```java
default
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Formats this date-time using the specified formatter.

This date-time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

The default implementation must behave as follows:

```java
return formatter.format(this);
```

**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the formatted date-time string, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

- atZone

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime
<
D
> atZone​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Combines this time with a time-zone to create a

ChronoZonedDateTime

.

This returns a

ChronoZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time at the
specified time-zone. The result will match this date-time as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

To obtain the later offset during an overlap, call

ChronoZonedDateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

on the result of this method.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to use, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time formed from this date-time, not null

- toInstant

```java
default
Instant
toInstant​(
ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Converts this date-time to an

Instant

.

This combines this local date-time and the specified offset to form
an

Instant

.

This default implementation calculates from the epoch-day of the date and the
second-of-day of the time.

**Parameters:** offset

- the offset to use for the conversion, not null
**Returns:** an

Instant

representing the same instant, not null

- toEpochSecond

```java
default long toEpochSecond​(
ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch
of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This combines this local date-time and the specified offset to calculate the
epoch-second value, which is the number of elapsed seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier are negative.

This default implementation calculates from the epoch-day of the date and the
second-of-day of the time.

**Parameters:** offset

- the offset to use for the conversion, not null
**Returns:** the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

- compareTo

```java
default int compareTo​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)
```

Compares this date-time to another date-time, including the chronology.

The comparison is based first on the underlying time-line date-time, then
on the chronology.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2012-12-03T12:00 (ISO)
- 2012-12-04T12:00 (ISO)
- 2555-12-04T12:00 (ThaiBuddhist)
- 2012-12-05T12:00 (ISO)

Values #2 and #3 represent the same date-time on the time-line.
When two values represent the same date-time, the chronology ID is compared to distinguish them.
This step is needed to make the ordering "consistent with equals".

If all the date-time objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
additional chronology stage is not required and only the local date-time is used.

This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

D

extends

ChronoLocalDate

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

- isAfter

```java
default boolean isAfter​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)
```

Checks if this date-time is after the specified date-time ignoring the chronology.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDateTime<?>)

in that it
only compares the underlying date-time and not the chronology.
This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
on the time-line position.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day
and nano-of-day.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is after the specified date-time

on the time-line position.

This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day
and nano-of-day.

**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if the underlying date-time is equal to the specified date-time on the timeline

- equals

```

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

atZone

```java
ChronoZonedDateTime

```

Combines this time with a time-zone to create a

ChronoZonedDateTime

.

This returns a

ChronoZonedDateTime

formed from this date-time at the
specified time-zone. The result will match this date-time as closely as possible.
Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
date-time as defined by the

rules

of the zone ID.

In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".

In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

To obtain the later offset during an overlap, call

ChronoZonedDateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

on the result of this method.

**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone to use, not null
**Returns:** the zoned date-time formed from this date-time, not null

compareTo

```java
default int compareTo​(
ChronoLocalDateTime
<?> other)
```

Compares this date-time to another date-time, including the chronology.

The comparison is based first on the underlying time-line date-time, then
on the chronology.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 2012-12-03T12:00 (ISO)
- 2012-12-04T12:00 (ISO)
- 2555-12-04T12:00 (ThaiBuddhist)
- 2012-12-05T12:00 (ISO)

Values #2 and #3 represent the same date-time on the time-line.
When two values represent the same date-time, the chronology ID is compared to distinguish them.
This step is needed to make the ordering "consistent with equals".

If all the date-time objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
additional chronology stage is not required and only the local date-time is used.

This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

D

extends

ChronoLocalDate

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other date-time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater
