# Class RelationSupport

**Source:** `java.management\javax\management\relation\RelationSupport.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
RelationSupport

extends
Object

implements
RelationSupportMBean
,
MBeanRegistration
```

A RelationSupport object is used internally by the Relation Service to
represent simple relations (only roles, no properties or methods), with an
unlimited number of roles, of any relation type. As internal representation,
it is not exposed to the user.

RelationSupport class conforms to the design patterns of standard MBean. So
the user can decide to instantiate a RelationSupport object himself as
a MBean (as it follows the MBean design patterns), to register it in the
MBean Server, and then to add it in the Relation Service.

The user can also, when creating his own MBean relation class, have it
extending RelationSupport, to retrieve the implementations of required
interfaces (see below).

It is also possible to have in a user relation MBean class a member
being a RelationSupport object, and to implement the required interfaces by
delegating all to this member.

RelationSupport implements the Relation interface (to be handled by the
Relation Service).

It implements also the MBeanRegistration interface to be able to retrieve
the MBean Server where it is registered (if registered as a MBean) to access
to its Relation Service.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** MBeanRegistration

### Constructor Details

#### public RelationSupport​(
String
relationId,

ObjectName
relationServiceName,

String
relationTypeName,

RoleList
list)
throws
InvalidRoleValueException
,

IllegalArgumentException

Creates a

RelationSupport

object.

This constructor has to be used when the RelationSupport object will
be registered as a MBean by the user, or when creating a user relation
MBean whose class extends RelationSupport.

Nothing is done at the Relation Service level, i.e.
the

RelationSupport

object is not added to the

RelationService

and no checks are performed to
see if the provided values are correct.
The object is always created, EXCEPT if:

- any of the required parameters is

null

.

- the same name is used for two roles.

To be handled as a relation, the

RelationSupport

object has
to be added to the Relation Service using the Relation Service method
addRelation().

**Parameters:**
- relationId

- relation identifier, to identify the relation in the
Relation Service.

Expected to be unique in the given Relation Service.
- relationServiceName

- ObjectName of the Relation Service where
the relation will be registered.

This parameter is required as it is the Relation Service that is
aware of the definition of the relation type of the given relation,
so that will be able to check update operations (set).
- relationTypeName

- Name of relation type.

Expected to have been created in the given Relation Service.
- list

- list of roles (Role objects) to initialize the
relation. Can be

null

.

Expected to conform to relation info in associated relation type.

**Throws:**
- InvalidRoleValueException

- if the same name is used for two
roles.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if any of the required parameters
(relation id, relation service ObjectName, or relation type name) is

null

.

String
relationId,

relationServiceName,

MBeanServer
relationServiceMBeanServer,

String
relationTypeName,

list)
throws
InvalidRoleValueException
,

IllegalArgumentException

Creates a

RelationSupport

object.

This constructor has to be used when the user relation MBean
implements the interfaces expected to be supported by a relation by
delegating to a RelationSupport object.

This object needs to know the Relation Service expected to handle the
relation. So it has to know the MBean Server where the Relation Service
is registered.

According to a limitation, a relation MBean must be registered in the
same MBean Server as the Relation Service expected to handle it. So the
user relation MBean has to be created and registered, and then the
wrapped RelationSupport object can be created within the identified MBean
Server.

Nothing is done at the Relation Service level, i.e.
the

RelationSupport

object is not added to the

RelationService

and no checks are performed to
see if the provided values are correct.
The object is always created, EXCEPT if:

- any of the required parameters is

null

.

- the same name is used for two roles.

To be handled as a relation, the

RelationSupport

object has
to be added to the Relation Service using the Relation Service method
addRelation().

**Parameters:**
- relationId

- relation identifier, to identify the relation in the
Relation Service.

Expected to be unique in the given Relation Service.
- relationServiceName

- ObjectName of the Relation Service where
the relation will be registered.

This parameter is required as it is the Relation Service that is
aware of the definition of the relation type of the given relation,
so that will be able to check update operations (set).
- relationServiceMBeanServer

- MBean Server where the wrapping MBean
is or will be registered.

Expected to be the MBean Server where the Relation Service is or will
be registered.
- relationTypeName

- Name of relation type.

Expected to have been created in the given Relation Service.
- list

- list of roles (Role objects) to initialize the
relation. Can be

null

.

Expected to conform to relation info in associated relation type.

**Throws:**
- InvalidRoleValueException

- if the same name is used for two
roles.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if any of the required parameters
(relation id, relation service ObjectName, relation service MBeanServer,
or relation type name) is

null

.

Creates a

This constructor has to be used when the RelationSupport object will
be registered as a MBean by the user, or when creating a user relation
MBean whose class extends RelationSupport.

Nothing is done at the Relation Service level, i.e.
the

RelationService

and no checks are performed to
see if the provided values are correct.
The object is always created, EXCEPT if:

- any of the required parameters is

null

.

- the same name is used for two roles.

To be handled as a relation, the

RelationSupport

object has
to be added to the Relation Service using the Relation Service method
addRelation().

**Parameters:** relationId

- relation identifier, to identify the relation in the
Relation Service.

Expected to be unique in the given Relation Service.
**Parameters:** relationServiceName

- ObjectName of the Relation Service where
the relation will be registered.

This parameter is required as it is the Relation Service that is
aware of the definition of the relation type of the given relation,
so that will be able to check update operations (set).
**Parameters:** relationTypeName

- Name of relation type.

Expected to have been created in the given Relation Service.
**Parameters:** list

- list of roles (Role objects) to initialize the
relation. Can be

null

The object is always created, EXCEPT if:

- any of the required parameters is

null

.

- the same name is used for two roles.

To be handled as a relation, the

RelationSupport

object has
to be added to the Relation Service using the Relation Service method
addRelation().

**Parameters:** relationId

- relation identifier, to identify the relation in the
Relation Service.

Expected to be unique in the given Relation Service.
**Parameters:** relationServiceName

- ObjectName of the Relation Service where
the relation will be registered.

This parameter is required as it is the Relation Service that is
aware of the definition of the relation type of the given relation,
so that will be able to check update operations (set).
**Parameters:** relationTypeName

- Name of relation type.

Expected to have been created in the given Relation Service.
**Parameters:** list

- list of roles (Role objects) to initialize the
relation. Can be

Creates a

RelationSupport

object.

This constructor has to be used when the user relation MBean
implements the interfaces expected to be supported by a relation by
delegating to a RelationSupport object.

This object needs to know the Relation Service expected to handle the
relation. So it has to know the MBean Server where the Relation Service
is registered.

According to a limitation, a relation MBean must be registered in the
same MBean Server as the Relation Service expected to handle it. So the
user relation MBean has to be created and registered, and then the
wrapped RelationSupport object can be created within the identified MBean
Server.

Nothing is done at the Relation Service level, i.e.
the

RelationSupport

object is not added to the

RelationService

and no checks are performed to
see if the provided values are correct.
