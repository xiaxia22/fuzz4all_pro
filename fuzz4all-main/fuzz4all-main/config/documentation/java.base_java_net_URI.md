# Class URI

**Source:** `java.base\java\net\URI.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
URI

extends
Object

implements
Comparable
<
URI
>,
Serializable
```

Represents a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) reference.

Aside from some minor deviations noted below, an instance of this
class represents a URI reference as defined by

RFC 2396: Uniform
Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax

, amended by

RFC 2732: Format for
Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs

. The Literal IPv6 address format
also supports scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described

here

.
This class provides constructors for creating URI instances from
their components or by parsing their string forms, methods for accessing the
various components of an instance, and methods for normalizing, resolving,
and relativizing URI instances. Instances of this class are immutable.

URI syntax and components

At the highest level a URI reference (hereinafter simply "URI") in string
form has the syntax

[

scheme

:

]

scheme-specific-part

[

#

fragment

]

where square brackets [...] delineate optional components and the characters

:

and

#

stand for themselves.

An

absolute

URI specifies a scheme; a URI that is not absolute is
said to be

relative

. URIs are also classified according to whether
they are

opaque

or

hierarchical

.

An

opaque

URI is an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part does
not begin with a slash character (

'/'

). Opaque URIs are not
subject to further parsing. Some examples of opaque URIs are:

- mailto:java-net@java.sun.com
- news:comp.lang.java
- urn:isbn:096139210x

A

hierarchical

URI is either an absolute URI whose
scheme-specific part begins with a slash character, or a relative URI, that
is, a URI that does not specify a scheme. Some examples of hierarchical
URIs are:

http://example.com/languages/java/

sample/a/index.html#28

../../demo/b/index.html

file:///~/calendar

A hierarchical URI is subject to further parsing according to the syntax

[

scheme

:

][

//

authority

][

path

][

?

query

][

#

fragment

]

where the characters

:

,

/

,

?

, and

#

stand for themselves. The
scheme-specific part of a hierarchical URI consists of the characters
between the scheme and fragment components.

The authority component of a hierarchical URI is, if specified, either

server-based

or

registry-based

. A server-based authority
parses according to the familiar syntax

[

user-info

@

]

host

[

:

port

]

where the characters

@

and

:

stand for
themselves. Nearly all URI schemes currently in use are server-based. An
authority component that does not parse in this way is considered to be
registry-based.

The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute
if it begins with a slash character (

'/'

); otherwise it is
relative. The path of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or
specifies an authority is always absolute.

All told, then, a URI instance has the following nine components:

Describes the components of a URI:scheme,scheme-specific-part,authority,user-info,host,port,path,query,fragment

Component

Type

scheme

String

scheme-specific-part

String

authority

String

user-info

String

host

String

port

int

path

String

query

String

fragment

String

In a given instance any particular component is either

undefined

or

defined

with a distinct value. Undefined string components are
represented by

null

, while undefined integer components are
represented by

-1

. A string component may be defined to have the
empty string as its value; this is not equivalent to that component being
undefined.

Whether a particular component is or is not defined in an instance
depends upon the type of the URI being represented. An absolute URI has a
scheme component. An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and
possibly a fragment, but has no other components. A hierarchical URI always
has a path (though it may be empty) and a scheme-specific-part (which at
least contains the path), and may have any of the other components. If the
authority component is present and is server-based then the host component
will be defined and the user-information and port components may be defined.

Operations on URI instances

The key operations supported by this class are those of

normalization

,

resolution

, and

relativization

.

Normalization

is the process of removing unnecessary

"."

and

".."

segments from the path component of a hierarchical URI.
Each

"."

segment is simply removed. A

".."

segment is
removed only if it is preceded by a non-

".."

segment.
Normalization has no effect upon opaque URIs.

Resolution

is the process of resolving one URI against another,

base

URI. The resulting URI is constructed from components of both
URIs in the manner specified by RFC 2396, taking components from the
base URI for those not specified in the original. For hierarchical URIs,
the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
normalized. The result, for example, of resolving

sample/a/index.html#28

(1)

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

is the result
URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

Resolving the relative URI

../../demo/b/index.html

(2)

against this result yields, in turn,

http://example.com/languages/java/demo/b/index.html

Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving
the URI

file:///~calendar

against any other URI simply yields the
original URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above
against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
URI

demo/b/index.html

Relativization

, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
two normalized URIs

u

and

v

,

u

.relativize(

u

.resolve(

v

)).equals(

v

)

and

u

.resolve(

u

.relativize(

v

)).equals(

v

)

.

This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
possible. For example, relativizing the URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

yields the relative URI

sample/a/index.html#28

.

Character categories

RFC 2396 specifies precisely which characters are permitted in the
various components of a URI reference. The following categories, most of
which are taken from that specification, are used below to describe these
constraints:

Describes categories alpha,digit,alphanum,unreserved,punct,reserved,escaped,and other

Category

Description

alpha

The US-ASCII alphabetic characters,

'A'

through

'Z'

and

'a'

through

'z'

digit

The US-ASCII decimal digit characters,

'0'

through

'9'

alphanum

All

alpha

and

digit

characters

unreserved

All

alphanum

characters together with those in the string

"_-!.~'()*"

punct

The characters in the string

",;:$&+="

reserved

All

punct

characters together with those in the string

"?/[]@"

escaped

Escaped octets, that is, triplets consisting of the percent
character (

'%'

) followed by two hexadecimal digits
(

'0'

-

'9'

,

'A'

-

'F'

, and

'a'

-

'f'

)

other

The Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character set,
are not control characters (according to the

Character.isISOControl

method), and are not space characters (according to the

Character.isSpaceChar

method)

(

Deviation from RFC 2396

, which is
limited to US-ASCII)

The set of all legal URI characters consists of
the

unreserved

,

reserved

,

escaped

, and

other

characters.

Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding

RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and
fragment components. Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:

- To

encode

non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to
conform strictly to RFC 2396 by not containing any

other

characters.
- To

quote

characters that are otherwise illegal in a
component. The user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ
slightly in terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.

These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:

- A character is

encoded

by replacing it
with the sequence of escaped octets that represent that character in the
UTF-8 character set. The Euro currency symbol (

'\u20AC'

),
for example, is encoded as

"%E2%82%AC"

.

(

Deviation from
RFC 2396

, which does not specify any particular character
set.)
- An illegal character is

quoted

simply by
encoding it. The space character, for example, is quoted by replacing it
with

"%20"

. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII
characters this transformation has exactly the effect required by
RFC 2396.
- A sequence of escaped octets is

decoded

by
replacing it with the sequence of characters that it represents in the
UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the
effect of de-quoting any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of
decoding any encoded non-US-ASCII characters. If a

decoding error

occurs
when decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by

'\uFFFD'

, the Unicode replacement character.

These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class
as follows:

- The

single-argument
constructor

requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
quoted and preserves any escaped octets and

other

characters that
are present.
- The

multi-argument constructors

quote illegal characters as
required by the components in which they appear. The percent character
(

'%'

) is always quoted by these constructors. Any

other

characters are preserved.
- The

getRawUserInfo

,

getRawPath

,

getRawQuery

,

getRawFragment

,

getRawAuthority

, and

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

methods return the
values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
any escaped octets. The strings returned by these methods may contain
both escaped octets and

other

characters, and will not contain any
illegal characters.
- The

getUserInfo

,

getPath

,

getQuery

,

getFragment

,

getAuthority

, and

getSchemeSpecificPart

methods decode any escaped
octets in their corresponding components. The strings returned by these
methods may contain both

other

characters and illegal characters,
and will not contain any escaped octets.
- The

toString

method returns a URI string with
all necessary quotation but which may contain

other

characters.
- The

toASCIIString

method returns a fully
quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any

other

characters.

Identities

For any URI

u

, it is always the case that

new URI(

u

.toString()).equals(

u

)

.

For any URI

u

that does not contain redundant syntax such as two
slashes before an empty authority (as in

file:///tmp/

) or a
colon following a host name but no port (as in

http://java.sun.com:

), and that does not encode characters
except those that must be quoted, the following identities also hold:

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getSchemeSpecificPart(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

in all cases,

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getAuthority(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical, and

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getUserInfo(),
u
.getHost(),
u
.getPort(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical and has either no authority or a server-based
authority.

URIs, URLs, and URNs

A URI is a uniform resource

identifier

while a URL is a uniform
resource

locator

. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but
not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of
URIs, uniform resource

names

(URNs), which name resources but do not
specify how to locate them. The

mailto

,

news

, and

isbn

URIs shown above are examples of URNs.

The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the
differences between this class and the

URL

class.

An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic
sense defined by RFC 2396. A URI may be either absolute or relative.
A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the
scheme, if any, that it specifies. No lookup of the host, if any, is
performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed. Equality,
hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character
content of the instance. In other words, a URI instance is little more than
a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent
operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.

An instance of the

URL

class, by contrast, represents the
syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required
to access the resource that it describes. A URL must be absolute, that is,
it must always specify a scheme. A URL string is parsed according to its
scheme. A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is
impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is
available. Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the
Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined. In other
words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of
resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and
opening a connection to the specified resource.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public URI​(
String
str)
throws
URISyntaxException

Constructs a URI by parsing the given string.

This constructor parses the given string exactly as specified by the
grammar in

RFC 2396

,
Appendix A,

except for the following deviations:

- An empty authority component is permitted as long as it is
followed by a non-empty path, a query component, or a fragment
component. This allows the parsing of URIs such as

"file:///foo/bar"

, which seems to be the intent of
RFC 2396 although the grammar does not permit it. If the
authority component is empty then the user-information, host, and port
components are undefined.
- Empty relative paths are permitted; this seems to be the
intent of RFC 2396 although the grammar does not permit it. The
primary consequence of this deviation is that a standalone fragment
such as

"#foo"

parses as a relative URI with an empty path
and the given fragment, and can be usefully

resolved

against a base URI.

IPv4 addresses in host components are parsed rigorously, as
specified by

RFC 2732

: Each
element of a dotted-quad address must contain no more than three
decimal digits. Each element is further constrained to have a value
no greater than 255.

Hostnames in host components that comprise only a single
domain label are permitted to start with an

alphanum

character. This seems to be the intent of

RFC 2396

section 3.2.2 although the grammar does not permit it. The
consequence of this deviation is that the authority component of a
hierarchical URI such as

s://123

, will parse as a server-based
authority.

IPv6 addresses are permitted for the host component. An IPv6
address must be enclosed in square brackets (

'['

and

']'

) as specified by

RFC 2732

. The
IPv6 address itself must parse according to

RFC 2373

. IPv6
addresses are further constrained to describe no more than sixteen
bytes of address information, a constraint implicit in RFC 2373
but not expressible in the grammar.

Characters in the

other

category are permitted wherever
RFC 2396 permits

escaped

octets, that is, in the
user-information, path, query, and fragment components, as well as in
the authority component if the authority is registry-based. This
allows URIs to contain Unicode characters beyond those in the US-ASCII
character set.

**Parameters:**
- str

- The string to be parsed into a URI

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

str

is

null
- URISyntaxException

- If the given string violates RFC 2396, as augmented
by the above deviations

---

#### public URI​(
String
scheme,

String
userInfo,

String
host,
int port,

String
path,

String
query,

String
fragment)
throws
URISyntaxException

Constructs a hierarchical URI from the given components.

If a scheme is given then the path, if also given, must either be
empty or begin with a slash character (

'/'

). Otherwise a
component of the new URI may be left undefined by passing

null

for the corresponding parameter or, in the case of the

port

parameter, by passing

-1

.

This constructor first builds a URI string from the given components
according to the rules specified in

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 7:

- Initially, the result string is empty.
- If a scheme is given then it is appended to the result,
followed by a colon character (

':'

).
- If user information, a host, or a port are given then the
string

"//"

is appended.
- If user information is given then it is appended, followed by
a commercial-at character (

'@'

). Any character not in the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

, or

other

categories is

quoted

.
- If a host is given then it is appended. If the host is a
literal IPv6 address but is not enclosed in square brackets
(

'['

and

']'

) then the square brackets are added.
- If a port number is given then a colon character
(

':'

) is appended, followed by the port number in decimal.
- If a path is given then it is appended. Any character not in
the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

, or

other

categories, and not equal to the slash character (

'/'

) or the
commercial-at character (

'@'

), is quoted.
- If a query is given then a question-mark character
(

'?'

) is appended, followed by the query. Any character that
is not a

legal URI character

is quoted.
- Finally, if a fragment is given then a hash character
(

'#'

) is appended, followed by the fragment. Any character
that is not a legal URI character is quoted.

The resulting URI string is then parsed as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor and then invoking the

parseServerAuthority()

method upon the result; this may cause a

URISyntaxException

to be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- scheme

- Scheme name
- userInfo

- User name and authorization information
- host

- Host name
- port

- Port number
- path

- Path
- query

- Query
- fragment

- Fragment

**Throws:**
- URISyntaxException

- If both a scheme and a path are given but the path is relative,
if the URI string constructed from the given components violates
RFC 2396, or if the authority component of the string is
present but cannot be parsed as a server-based authority

---

#### public URI​(
String
scheme,

String
authority,

String
path,

String
query,

String
fragment)
throws
URISyntaxException

Constructs a hierarchical URI from the given components.

If a scheme is given then the path, if also given, must either be
empty or begin with a slash character (

'/'

). Otherwise a
component of the new URI may be left undefined by passing

null

for the corresponding parameter.

This constructor first builds a URI string from the given components
according to the rules specified in

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 7:

- Initially, the result string is empty.
- If a scheme is given then it is appended to the result,
followed by a colon character (

':'

).
- If an authority is given then the string

"//"

is
appended, followed by the authority. If the authority contains a
literal IPv6 address then the address must be enclosed in square
brackets (

'['

and

']'

). Any character not in the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

, or

other

categories, and not equal to the commercial-at character
(

'@'

), is

quoted

.
- If a path is given then it is appended. Any character not in
the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

, or

other

categories, and not equal to the slash character (

'/'

) or the
commercial-at character (

'@'

), is quoted.
- If a query is given then a question-mark character
(

'?'

) is appended, followed by the query. Any character that
is not a

legal URI character

is quoted.
- Finally, if a fragment is given then a hash character
(

'#'

) is appended, followed by the fragment. Any character
that is not a legal URI character is quoted.

The resulting URI string is then parsed as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor and then invoking the

parseServerAuthority()

method upon the result; this may cause a

URISyntaxException

to be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- scheme

- Scheme name
- authority

- Authority
- path

- Path
- query

- Query
- fragment

- Fragment

**Throws:**
- URISyntaxException

- If both a scheme and a path are given but the path is relative,
if the URI string constructed from the given components violates
RFC 2396, or if the authority component of the string is
present but cannot be parsed as a server-based authority

---

#### public URI​(
String
scheme,

String
host,

String
path,

String
fragment)
throws
URISyntaxException

Constructs a hierarchical URI from the given components.

A component may be left undefined by passing

null

.

This convenience constructor works as if by invoking the
seven-argument constructor as follows:

new

URI

(scheme, null, host, -1, path, null, fragment);

**Parameters:**
- scheme

- Scheme name
- host

- Host name
- path

- Path
- fragment

- Fragment

**Throws:**
- URISyntaxException

- If the URI string constructed from the given components
violates RFC 2396

---

#### public URI​(
String
scheme,

String
ssp,

String
fragment)
throws
URISyntaxException

Constructs a URI from the given components.

A component may be left undefined by passing

null

.

This constructor first builds a URI in string form using the given
components as follows:

- Initially, the result string is empty.
- If a scheme is given then it is appended to the result,
followed by a colon character (

':'

).
- If a scheme-specific part is given then it is appended. Any
character that is not a

legal URI character

is

quoted

.
- Finally, if a fragment is given then a hash character
(

'#'

) is appended to the string, followed by the fragment.
Any character that is not a legal URI character is quoted.

The resulting URI string is then parsed in order to create the new
URI instance as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor;
this may cause a

URISyntaxException

to be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- scheme

- Scheme name
- ssp

- Scheme-specific part
- fragment

- Fragment

**Throws:**
- URISyntaxException

- If the URI string constructed from the given components
violates RFC 2396

---

### Method Details

#### public static
URI
create​(
String
str)

Creates a URI by parsing the given string.

This convenience factory method works as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor; any

URISyntaxException

thrown by the
constructor is caught and wrapped in a new

IllegalArgumentException

object, which is then thrown.

This method is provided for use in situations where it is known that
the given string is a legal URI, for example for URI constants declared
within in a program, and so it would be considered a programming error
for the string not to parse as such. The constructors, which throw

URISyntaxException

directly, should be used situations where a
URI is being constructed from user input or from some other source that
may be prone to errors.

**Parameters:**
- str

- The string to be parsed into a URI

**Returns:**
- The new URI

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

str

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the given string violates RFC 2396

---

#### public
URI
parseServerAuthority()
throws
URISyntaxException

Attempts to parse this URI's authority component, if defined, into
user-information, host, and port components.

If this URI's authority component has already been recognized as
being server-based then it will already have been parsed into
user-information, host, and port components. In this case, or if this
URI has no authority component, this method simply returns this URI.

Otherwise this method attempts once more to parse the authority
component into user-information, host, and port components, and throws
an exception describing why the authority component could not be parsed
in that way.

This method is provided because the generic URI syntax specified in

RFC 2396

cannot always distinguish a malformed server-based authority from a
legitimate registry-based authority. It must therefore treat some
instances of the former as instances of the latter. The authority
component in the URI string

"//foo:bar"

, for example, is not a
legal server-based authority but it is legal as a registry-based
authority.

In many common situations, for example when working URIs that are
known to be either URNs or URLs, the hierarchical URIs being used will
always be server-based. They therefore must either be parsed as such or
treated as an error. In these cases a statement such as

URI

u

= new URI(str).parseServerAuthority();

can be used to ensure that

u

always refers to a URI that, if
it has an authority component, has a server-based authority with proper
user-information, host, and port components. Invoking this method also
ensures that if the authority could not be parsed in that way then an
appropriate diagnostic message can be issued based upon the exception
that is thrown.

**Returns:**
- A URI whose authority field has been parsed
as a server-based authority

**Throws:**
- URISyntaxException

- If the authority component of this URI is defined
but cannot be parsed as a server-based authority
according to RFC 2396

---

#### public
URI
normalize()

Normalizes this URI's path.

If this URI is opaque, or if its path is already in normal form,
then this URI is returned. Otherwise a new URI is constructed that is
identical to this URI except that its path is computed by normalizing
this URI's path in a manner consistent with

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 6, sub-steps c through f; that is:

- All

"."

segments are removed.
- If a

".."

segment is preceded by a non-

".."

segment then both of these segments are removed. This step is
repeated until it is no longer applicable.
- If the path is relative, and if its first segment contains a
colon character (

':'

), then a

"."

segment is
prepended. This prevents a relative URI with a path such as

"a:b/c/d"

from later being re-parsed as an opaque URI with a
scheme of

"a"

and a scheme-specific part of

"b/c/d"

.

(Deviation from RFC 2396)

A normalized path will begin with one or more

".."

segments
if there were insufficient non-

".."

segments preceding them to
allow their removal. A normalized path will begin with a

"."

segment if one was inserted by step 3 above. Otherwise, a normalized
path will not contain any

"."

or

".."

segments.

**Returns:**
- A URI equivalent to this URI,
but whose path is in normal form

---

#### public
URI
resolve​(
URI
uri)

Resolves the given URI against this URI.

If the given URI is already absolute, or if this URI is opaque, then
the given URI is returned.

If the given URI's fragment component is
defined, its path component is empty, and its scheme, authority, and
query components are undefined, then a URI with the given fragment but
with all other components equal to those of this URI is returned. This
allows a URI representing a standalone fragment reference, such as

"#foo"

, to be usefully resolved against a base URI.

Otherwise this method constructs a new hierarchical URI in a manner
consistent with

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2; that is:

- A new URI is constructed with this URI's scheme and the given
URI's query and fragment components.
- If the given URI has an authority component then the new URI's
authority and path are taken from the given URI.
- Otherwise the new URI's authority component is copied from
this URI, and its path is computed as follows:

- If the given URI's path is absolute then the new URI's path
is taken from the given URI.
- Otherwise the given URI's path is relative, and so the new
URI's path is computed by resolving the path of the given URI
against the path of this URI. This is done by concatenating all but
the last segment of this URI's path, if any, with the given URI's
path and then normalizing the result as if by invoking the

normalize

method.

The result of this method is absolute if, and only if, either this
URI is absolute or the given URI is absolute.

**Parameters:**
- uri

- The URI to be resolved against this URI

**Returns:**
- The resulting URI

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

uri

is

null

---

#### public
URI
resolve​(
String
str)

evaluating the expression

resolve

(URI.

create

(str))

.

**Parameters:**

---

#### public
URI
relativize​(
URI
uri)

Relativizes the given URI against this URI.

The relativization of the given URI against this URI is computed as
follows:

- If either this URI or the given URI are opaque, or if the
scheme and authority components of the two URIs are not identical, or
if the path of this URI is not a prefix of the path of the given URI,
then the given URI is returned.
- Otherwise a new relative hierarchical URI is constructed with
query and fragment components taken from the given URI and with a path
component computed by removing this URI's path from the beginning of
the given URI's path.

**Parameters:**
- uri

- The URI to be relativized against this URI

**Returns:**
- The resulting URI

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

uri

is

null

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
ob)

Tests this URI for equality with another object.

If the given object is not a URI then this method immediately
returns

false

.

For two URIs to be considered equal requires that either both are
opaque or both are hierarchical. Their schemes must either both be
undefined or else be equal without regard to case. Their fragments
must either both be undefined or else be equal.

For two opaque URIs to be considered equal, their scheme-specific
parts must be equal.

For two hierarchical URIs to be considered equal, their paths must
be equal and their queries must either both be undefined or else be
equal. Their authorities must either both be undefined, or both be
registry-based, or both be server-based. If their authorities are
defined and are registry-based, then they must be equal. If their
authorities are defined and are server-based, then their hosts must be
equal without regard to case, their port numbers must be equal, and
their user-information components must be equal.

When testing the user-information, path, query, fragment, authority,
or scheme-specific parts of two URIs for equality, the raw forms rather
than the encoded forms of these components are compared and the
hexadecimal digits of escaped octets are compared without regard to
case.

This method satisfies the general contract of the

Object.equals

method.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- ob

- The object to which this object is to be compared

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, the given object is a URI that
is identical to this URI

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### public int hashCode()

Returns a hash-code value for this URI. The hash code is based upon all
of the URI's components, and satisfies the general contract of the

Object.hashCode

method.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- A hash-code value for this URI

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public int compareTo​(
URI
that)

Compares this URI to another object, which must be a URI.

When comparing corresponding components of two URIs, if one
component is undefined but the other is defined then the first is
considered to be less than the second. Unless otherwise noted, string
components are ordered according to their natural, case-sensitive
ordering as defined by the

String.compareTo

method. String components that are subject to
encoding are compared by comparing their raw forms rather than their
encoded forms.

The ordering of URIs is defined as follows:

- Two URIs with different schemes are ordered according the
ordering of their schemes, without regard to case.
- A hierarchical URI is considered to be less than an opaque URI
with an identical scheme.
- Two opaque URIs with identical schemes are ordered according
to the ordering of their scheme-specific parts.
- Two opaque URIs with identical schemes and scheme-specific
parts are ordered according to the ordering of their
fragments.
- Two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes are ordered
according to the ordering of their authority components:

- If both authority components are server-based then the URIs
are ordered according to their user-information components; if these
components are identical then the URIs are ordered according to the
ordering of their hosts, without regard to case; if the hosts are
identical then the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of
their ports.
- If one or both authority components are registry-based then
the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of their authority
components.
- Finally, two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes and
authority components are ordered according to the ordering of their
paths; if their paths are identical then they are ordered according to
the ordering of their queries; if the queries are identical then they
are ordered according to the order of their fragments.

This method satisfies the general contract of the

Comparable.compareTo

method.

**Specified by:**

**Parameters:**
- that

- The object to which this URI is to be compared

**Returns:**
- A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this URI is
less than, equal to, or greater than the given URI

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- If the given object is not a URI

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns the content of this URI as a string.

If this URI was created by invoking one of the constructors in this
class then a string equivalent to the original input string, or to the
string computed from the originally-given components, as appropriate, is
returned. Otherwise this URI was created by normalization, resolution,
or relativization, and so a string is constructed from this URI's
components according to the rules specified in

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 7.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- The string form of this URI

---

#### public
String
toASCIIString()

Returns the content of this URI as a US-ASCII string.

If this URI does not contain any characters in the

other

category then an invocation of this method will return the same value as
an invocation of the

toString

method. Otherwise
this method works as if by invoking that method and then

encoding

the result.

**Returns:**
- The string form of this URI, encoded as needed
so that it only contains characters in the US-ASCII
charset

Represents a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) reference.

Aside from some minor deviations noted below, an instance of this
class represents a URI reference as defined by

RFC 2396: Uniform
Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax

, amended by

RFC 2732: Format for
Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs

. The Literal IPv6 address format
also supports scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described

here

.
This class provides constructors for creating URI instances from
their components or by parsing their string forms, methods for accessing the
various components of an instance, and methods for normalizing, resolving,
and relativizing URI instances. Instances of this class are immutable.

URI syntax and components

At the highest level a URI reference (hereinafter simply "URI") in string
form has the syntax

[

scheme

:

]

scheme-specific-part

[

#

fragment

]

where square brackets [...] delineate optional components and the characters

:

and

#

stand for themselves.

An

absolute

URI specifies a scheme; a URI that is not absolute is
said to be

relative

. URIs are also classified according to whether
they are

opaque

or

hierarchical

.

An

opaque

URI is an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part does
not begin with a slash character (

'/'

). Opaque URIs are not
subject to further parsing. Some examples of opaque URIs are:

- mailto:java-net@java.sun.com
- news:comp.lang.java
- urn:isbn:096139210x

A

hierarchical

URI is either an absolute URI whose
scheme-specific part begins with a slash character, or a relative URI, that
is, a URI that does not specify a scheme. Some examples of hierarchical
URIs are:

http://example.com/languages/java/

sample/a/index.html#28

../../demo/b/index.html

file:///~/calendar

A hierarchical URI is subject to further parsing according to the syntax

[

scheme

:

][

//

authority

][

path

][

?

query

][

#

fragment

]

where the characters

:

,

/

,

?

, and

#

stand for themselves. The
scheme-specific part of a hierarchical URI consists of the characters
between the scheme and fragment components.

The authority component of a hierarchical URI is, if specified, either

server-based

or

registry-based

. A server-based authority
parses according to the familiar syntax

[

user-info

@

]

host

[

:

port

]

where the characters

@

and

:

stand for
themselves. Nearly all URI schemes currently in use are server-based. An
authority component that does not parse in this way is considered to be
registry-based.

The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute
if it begins with a slash character (

'/'

); otherwise it is
relative. The path of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or
specifies an authority is always absolute.

All told, then, a URI instance has the following nine components:

Describes the components of a URI:scheme,scheme-specific-part,authority,user-info,host,port,path,query,fragment

Component

Type

scheme

String

scheme-specific-part

String

authority

String

user-info

String

host

String

port

int

path

String

query

String

fragment

String

In a given instance any particular component is either

undefined

or

defined

with a distinct value. Undefined string components are
represented by

null

, while undefined integer components are
represented by

-1

. A string component may be defined to have the
empty string as its value; this is not equivalent to that component being
undefined.

Whether a particular component is or is not defined in an instance
depends upon the type of the URI being represented. An absolute URI has a
scheme component. An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and
possibly a fragment, but has no other components. A hierarchical URI always
has a path (though it may be empty) and a scheme-specific-part (which at
least contains the path), and may have any of the other components. If the
authority component is present and is server-based then the host component
will be defined and the user-information and port components may be defined.

Operations on URI instances

The key operations supported by this class are those of

normalization

,

resolution

, and

relativization

.

Normalization

is the process of removing unnecessary

"."

and

".."

segments from the path component of a hierarchical URI.
Each

"."

segment is simply removed. A

".."

segment is
removed only if it is preceded by a non-

".."

segment.
Normalization has no effect upon opaque URIs.

Resolution

is the process of resolving one URI against another,

base

URI. The resulting URI is constructed from components of both
URIs in the manner specified by RFC 2396, taking components from the
base URI for those not specified in the original. For hierarchical URIs,
the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
normalized. The result, for example, of resolving

sample/a/index.html#28

(1)

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

is the result
URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

Resolving the relative URI

../../demo/b/index.html

(2)

against this result yields, in turn,

http://example.com/languages/java/demo/b/index.html

Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving
the URI

file:///~calendar

against any other URI simply yields the
original URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above
against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
URI

demo/b/index.html

Relativization

, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
two normalized URIs

u

and

v

,

u

.relativize(

u

.resolve(

v

)).equals(

v

)

and

u

.resolve(

u

.relativize(

v

)).equals(

v

)

.

This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
possible. For example, relativizing the URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

yields the relative URI

sample/a/index.html#28

.

Character categories

RFC 2396 specifies precisely which characters are permitted in the
various components of a URI reference. The following categories, most of
which are taken from that specification, are used below to describe these
constraints:

Describes categories alpha,digit,alphanum,unreserved,punct,reserved,escaped,and other

Category

Description

alpha

The US-ASCII alphabetic characters,

'A'

through

'Z'

and

'a'

through

'z'

digit

The US-ASCII decimal digit characters,

'0'

through

'9'

alphanum

All

alpha

and

digit

characters

unreserved

All

alphanum

characters together with those in the string

"_-!.~'()*"

punct

The characters in the string

",;:$&+="

reserved

All

punct

characters together with those in the string

"?/[]@"

escaped

Escaped octets, that is, triplets consisting of the percent
character (

'%'

) followed by two hexadecimal digits
(

'0'

-

'9'

,

'A'

-

'F'

, and

'a'

-

'f'

)

other

The Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character set,
are not control characters (according to the

Character.isISOControl

method), and are not space characters (according to the

Character.isSpaceChar

method)

(

Deviation from RFC 2396

, which is
limited to US-ASCII)

The set of all legal URI characters consists of
the

unreserved

,

reserved

,

escaped

, and

other

characters.

Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding

RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and
fragment components. Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:

- To

encode

non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to
conform strictly to RFC 2396 by not containing any

other

characters.
- To

quote

characters that are otherwise illegal in a
component. The user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ
slightly in terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.

These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:

- A character is

encoded

by replacing it
with the sequence of escaped octets that represent that character in the
UTF-8 character set. The Euro currency symbol (

'\u20AC'

),
for example, is encoded as

"%E2%82%AC"

.

(

Deviation from
RFC 2396

, which does not specify any particular character
set.)
- An illegal character is

quoted

simply by
encoding it. The space character, for example, is quoted by replacing it
with

"%20"

. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII
characters this transformation has exactly the effect required by
RFC 2396.
- A sequence of escaped octets is

decoded

by
replacing it with the sequence of characters that it represents in the
UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the
effect of de-quoting any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of
decoding any encoded non-US-ASCII characters. If a

decoding error

occurs
when decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by

'\uFFFD'

, the Unicode replacement character.

These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class
as follows:

- The

single-argument
constructor

requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
quoted and preserves any escaped octets and

other

characters that
are present.
- The

multi-argument constructors

quote illegal characters as
required by the components in which they appear. The percent character
(

'%'

) is always quoted by these constructors. Any

other

characters are preserved.
- The

getRawUserInfo

,

getRawPath

,

getRawQuery

,

getRawFragment

,

getRawAuthority

, and

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

methods return the
values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
any escaped octets. The strings returned by these methods may contain
both escaped octets and

other

characters, and will not contain any
illegal characters.
- The

getUserInfo

,

getPath

,

getQuery

,

getFragment

,

getAuthority

, and

getSchemeSpecificPart

methods decode any escaped
octets in their corresponding components. The strings returned by these
methods may contain both

other

characters and illegal characters,
and will not contain any escaped octets.
- The

toString

method returns a URI string with
all necessary quotation but which may contain

other

characters.
- The

toASCIIString

method returns a fully
quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any

other

characters.

Identities

For any URI

u

, it is always the case that

new URI(

u

.toString()).equals(

u

)

.

For any URI

u

that does not contain redundant syntax such as two
slashes before an empty authority (as in

file:///tmp/

) or a
colon following a host name but no port (as in

http://java.sun.com:

), and that does not encode characters
except those that must be quoted, the following identities also hold:

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getSchemeSpecificPart(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

in all cases,

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getAuthority(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical, and

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getUserInfo(),
u
.getHost(),
u
.getPort(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical and has either no authority or a server-based
authority.

URIs, URLs, and URNs

A URI is a uniform resource

identifier

while a URL is a uniform
resource

locator

. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but
not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of
URIs, uniform resource

names

(URNs), which name resources but do not
specify how to locate them. The

mailto

,

news

, and

isbn

URIs shown above are examples of URNs.

The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the
differences between this class and the

URL

class.

An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic
sense defined by RFC 2396. A URI may be either absolute or relative.
A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the
scheme, if any, that it specifies. No lookup of the host, if any, is
performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed. Equality,
hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character
content of the instance. In other words, a URI instance is little more than
a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent
operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.

An instance of the

URL

class, by contrast, represents the
syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required
to access the resource that it describes. A URL must be absolute, that is,
it must always specify a scheme. A URL string is parsed according to its
scheme. A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is
impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is
available. Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the
Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined. In other
words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of
resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and
opening a connection to the specified resource.

Represents a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) reference.

Aside from some minor deviations noted below, an instance of this
class represents a URI reference as defined by

RFC 2396: Uniform
Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax

, amended by

RFC 2732: Format for
Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs

. The Literal IPv6 address format
also supports scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described

here

.
This class provides constructors for creating URI instances from
their components or by parsing their string forms, methods for accessing the
various components of an instance, and methods for normalizing, resolving,
and relativizing URI instances. Instances of this class are immutable.

URI syntax and components

At the highest level a URI reference (hereinafter simply "URI") in string
form has the syntax

[

scheme

:

]

scheme-specific-part

[

#

fragment

]

where square brackets [...] delineate optional components and the characters

:

and

#

stand for themselves.

An

absolute

URI specifies a scheme; a URI that is not absolute is
said to be

relative

. URIs are also classified according to whether
they are

opaque

or

hierarchical

.

An

opaque

URI is an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part does
not begin with a slash character (

'/'

). Opaque URIs are not
subject to further parsing. Some examples of opaque URIs are:

- mailto:java-net@java.sun.com
- news:comp.lang.java
- urn:isbn:096139210x

A

hierarchical

URI is either an absolute URI whose
scheme-specific part begins with a slash character, or a relative URI, that
is, a URI that does not specify a scheme. Some examples of hierarchical
URIs are:

http://example.com/languages/java/

sample/a/index.html#28

../../demo/b/index.html

file:///~/calendar

A hierarchical URI is subject to further parsing according to the syntax

[

scheme

:

][

//

authority

][

path

][

?

query

][

#

fragment

]

where the characters

:

,

/

,

?

, and

#

stand for themselves. The
scheme-specific part of a hierarchical URI consists of the characters
between the scheme and fragment components.

The authority component of a hierarchical URI is, if specified, either

server-based

or

registry-based

. A server-based authority
parses according to the familiar syntax

[

user-info

@

]

host

[

:

port

]

where the characters

@

and

:

stand for
themselves. Nearly all URI schemes currently in use are server-based. An
authority component that does not parse in this way is considered to be
registry-based.

The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute
if it begins with a slash character (

'/'

); otherwise it is
relative. The path of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or
specifies an authority is always absolute.

All told, then, a URI instance has the following nine components:

Describes the components of a URI:scheme,scheme-specific-part,authority,user-info,host,port,path,query,fragment

Component

Type

scheme

String

scheme-specific-part

String

authority

String

user-info

String

host

String

port

int

path

String

query

String

fragment

String

In a given instance any particular component is either

undefined

or

defined

with a distinct value. Undefined string components are
represented by

null

, while undefined integer components are
represented by

-1

. A string component may be defined to have the
empty string as its value; this is not equivalent to that component being
undefined.

Whether a particular component is or is not defined in an instance
depends upon the type of the URI being represented. An absolute URI has a
scheme component. An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and
possibly a fragment, but has no other components. A hierarchical URI always
has a path (though it may be empty) and a scheme-specific-part (which at
least contains the path), and may have any of the other components. If the
authority component is present and is server-based then the host component
will be defined and the user-information and port components may be defined.

Operations on URI instances

The key operations supported by this class are those of

normalization

,

resolution

, and

relativization

.

Normalization

is the process of removing unnecessary

"."

and

".."

segments from the path component of a hierarchical URI.
Each

"."

segment is simply removed. A

".."

segment is
removed only if it is preceded by a non-

".."

segment.
Normalization has no effect upon opaque URIs.

Resolution

is the process of resolving one URI against another,

base

URI. The resulting URI is constructed from components of both
URIs in the manner specified by RFC 2396, taking components from the
base URI for those not specified in the original. For hierarchical URIs,
the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
normalized. The result, for example, of resolving

sample/a/index.html#28

(1)

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

is the result
URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

Resolving the relative URI

../../demo/b/index.html

(2)

against this result yields, in turn,

http://example.com/languages/java/demo/b/index.html

Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving
the URI

file:///~calendar

against any other URI simply yields the
original URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above
against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
URI

demo/b/index.html

Relativization

, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
two normalized URIs

u

and

v

,

u

.relativize(

u

.resolve(

v

)).equals(

v

)

and

u

.resolve(

u

.relativize(

v

)).equals(

v

)

.

This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
possible. For example, relativizing the URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

yields the relative URI

sample/a/index.html#28

.

Character categories

RFC 2396 specifies precisely which characters are permitted in the
various components of a URI reference. The following categories, most of
which are taken from that specification, are used below to describe these
constraints:

Describes categories alpha,digit,alphanum,unreserved,punct,reserved,escaped,and other

Category

Description

alpha

The US-ASCII alphabetic characters,

'A'

through

'Z'

and

'a'

through

'z'

digit

The US-ASCII decimal digit characters,

'0'

through

'9'

alphanum

All

alpha

and

digit

characters

unreserved

All

alphanum

characters together with those in the string

"_-!.~'()*"

punct

The characters in the string

",;:$&+="

reserved

All

punct

characters together with those in the string

"?/[]@"

escaped

Escaped octets, that is, triplets consisting of the percent
character (

'%'

) followed by two hexadecimal digits
(

'0'

-

'9'

,

'A'

-

'F'

, and

'a'

-

'f'

)

other

The Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character set,
are not control characters (according to the

Character.isISOControl

method), and are not space characters (according to the

Character.isSpaceChar

method)

(

Deviation from RFC 2396

, which is
limited to US-ASCII)

The set of all legal URI characters consists of
the

unreserved

,

reserved

,

escaped

, and

other

characters.

Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding

RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and
fragment components. Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:

- To

encode

non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to
conform strictly to RFC 2396 by not containing any

other

characters.
- To

quote

characters that are otherwise illegal in a
component. The user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ
slightly in terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.

These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:

- A character is

encoded

by replacing it
with the sequence of escaped octets that represent that character in the
UTF-8 character set. The Euro currency symbol (

'\u20AC'

),
for example, is encoded as

"%E2%82%AC"

.

(

Deviation from
RFC 2396

, which does not specify any particular character
set.)
- An illegal character is

quoted

simply by
encoding it. The space character, for example, is quoted by replacing it
with

"%20"

. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII
characters this transformation has exactly the effect required by
RFC 2396.
- A sequence of escaped octets is

decoded

by
replacing it with the sequence of characters that it represents in the
UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the
effect of de-quoting any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of
decoding any encoded non-US-ASCII characters. If a

decoding error

occurs
when decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by

'\uFFFD'

, the Unicode replacement character.

These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class
as follows:

- The

single-argument
constructor

requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
quoted and preserves any escaped octets and

other

characters that
are present.
- The

multi-argument constructors

quote illegal characters as
required by the components in which they appear. The percent character
(

'%'

) is always quoted by these constructors. Any

other

characters are preserved.
- The

getRawUserInfo

,

getRawPath

,

getRawQuery

,

getRawFragment

,

getRawAuthority

, and

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

methods return the
values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
any escaped octets. The strings returned by these methods may contain
both escaped octets and

other

characters, and will not contain any
illegal characters.
- The

getUserInfo

,

getPath

,

getQuery

,

getFragment

,

getAuthority

, and

getSchemeSpecificPart

methods decode any escaped
octets in their corresponding components. The strings returned by these
methods may contain both

other

characters and illegal characters,
and will not contain any escaped octets.
- The

toString

method returns a URI string with
all necessary quotation but which may contain

other

characters.
- The

toASCIIString

method returns a fully
quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any

other

characters.

Identities

For any URI

u

, it is always the case that

new URI(

u

.toString()).equals(

u

)

.

For any URI

u

that does not contain redundant syntax such as two
slashes before an empty authority (as in

file:///tmp/

) or a
colon following a host name but no port (as in

http://java.sun.com:

), and that does not encode characters
except those that must be quoted, the following identities also hold:

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getSchemeSpecificPart(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

in all cases,

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getAuthority(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical, and

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getUserInfo(),
u
.getHost(),
u
.getPort(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical and has either no authority or a server-based
authority.

URIs, URLs, and URNs

A URI is a uniform resource

identifier

while a URL is a uniform
resource

locator

. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but
not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of
URIs, uniform resource

names

(URNs), which name resources but do not
specify how to locate them. The

mailto

,

news

, and

isbn

URIs shown above are examples of URNs.

The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the
differences between this class and the

URL

class.

An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic
sense defined by RFC 2396. A URI may be either absolute or relative.
A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the
scheme, if any, that it specifies. No lookup of the host, if any, is
performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed. Equality,
hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character
content of the instance. In other words, a URI instance is little more than
a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent
operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.

An instance of the

URL

class, by contrast, represents the
syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required
to access the resource that it describes. A URL must be absolute, that is,
it must always specify a scheme. A URL string is parsed according to its
scheme. A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is
impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is
available. Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the
Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined. In other
words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of
resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and
opening a connection to the specified resource.

Aside from some minor deviations noted below, an instance of this
class represents a URI reference as defined by

RFC 2396: Uniform
Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax

, amended by

RFC 2732: Format for
Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs

. The Literal IPv6 address format
also supports scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described

here

.
This class provides constructors for creating URI instances from
their components or by parsing their string forms, methods for accessing the
various components of an instance, and methods for normalizing, resolving,
and relativizing URI instances. Instances of this class are immutable.

is the process of removing unnecessary

the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
normalized. The result, for example, of resolving

sample/a/index.html#28

http://example.com/languages/java/

is the result
URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

Resolving the relative URI

../../demo/b/index.html

(2)

against this result yields, in turn,

http://example.com/languages/java/demo/b/index.html

Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving
the URI

file:///~calendar

against any other URI simply yields the
original URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above
against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
URI

Relativization

, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
two normalized URIs

u

u

.resolve(

v

)).equals(

and

u

.resolve(

u

.relativize(

v

)).equals(

v

)

.

This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
possible. For example, relativizing the URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

yields the relative URI

sample/a/index.html#28

A

hierarchical

URI is either an absolute URI whose
scheme-specific part begins with a slash character, or a relative URI, that
is, a URI that does not specify a scheme. Some examples of hierarchical
URIs are:

http://example.com/languages/java/

sample/a/index.html#28

../../demo/b/index.html

file:///~/calendar

A hierarchical URI is subject to further parsing according to the syntax

[

scheme

:

][

//

authority

][

path

][

?

query

][

#

fragment

]

where the characters

:

,

/

,

?

, and

#

stand for themselves. The
scheme-specific part of a hierarchical URI consists of the characters
between the scheme and fragment components.

The authority component of a hierarchical URI is, if specified, either

server-based

or

registry-based

. A server-based authority
parses according to the familiar syntax

[

user-info

@

]

host

[

:

port

]

where the characters

@

and

:

stand for
themselves. Nearly all URI schemes currently in use are server-based. An
authority component that does not parse in this way is considered to be
registry-based.

The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute
if it begins with a slash character (

'/'

); otherwise it is
relative. The path of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or
specifies an authority is always absolute.

All told, then, a URI instance has the following nine components:

Describes the components of a URI:scheme,scheme-specific-part,authority,user-info,host,port,path,query,fragment

scheme

String

scheme-specific-part

String

authority

String

user-info

String

host

String

port

int

path

String

query

String

fragment

String

In a given instance any particular component is either

undefined

or

defined

with a distinct value. Undefined string components are
represented by

null

, while undefined integer components are
represented by

-1

. A string component may be defined to have the
empty string as its value; this is not equivalent to that component being
undefined.

Whether a particular component is or is not defined in an instance
depends upon the type of the URI being represented. An absolute URI has a
scheme component. An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and
possibly a fragment, but has no other components. A hierarchical URI always
has a path (though it may be empty) and a scheme-specific-part (which at
least contains the path), and may have any of the other components. If the
authority component is present and is server-based then the host component
will be defined and the user-information and port components may be defined.

Operations on URI instances

The key operations supported by this class are those of

normalization

,

resolution

, and

relativization

.

Normalization

is the process of removing unnecessary

"."

and

".."

segments from the path component of a hierarchical URI.
Each

"."

segment is simply removed. A

".."

segment is
removed only if it is preceded by a non-

".."

segment.
Normalization has no effect upon opaque URIs.

Resolution

is the process of resolving one URI against another,

base

URI. The resulting URI is constructed from components of both
URIs in the manner specified by RFC 2396, taking components from the
base URI for those not specified in the original. For hierarchical URIs,
the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
normalized. The result, for example, of resolving

sample/a/index.html#28

(1)

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

is the result
URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

Resolving the relative URI

../../demo/b/index.html

(2)

against this result yields, in turn,

http://example.com/languages/java/demo/b/index.html

Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving
the URI

file:///~calendar

against any other URI simply yields the
original URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above
against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
URI

demo/b/index.html

Relativization

, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
two normalized URIs

u

and

v

,

u

.relativize(

u

.resolve(

v

)).equals(

v

)

and

u

.resolve(

u

.relativize(

v

)).equals(

v

)

.

This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
possible. For example, relativizing the URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

yields the relative URI

sample/a/index.html#28

.

Character categories

RFC 2396 specifies precisely which characters are permitted in the
various components of a URI reference. The following categories, most of
which are taken from that specification, are used below to describe these
constraints:

Describes categories alpha,digit,alphanum,unreserved,punct,reserved,escaped,and other

Category

Description

alpha

The US-ASCII alphabetic characters,

'A'

through

'Z'

and

'a'

through

'z'

digit

The US-ASCII decimal digit characters,

'0'

through

'9'

alphanum

All

alpha

and

digit

characters

unreserved

All

alphanum

characters together with those in the string

"_-!.~'()*"

punct

The characters in the string

",;:$&+="

reserved

All

punct

characters together with those in the string

"?/[]@"

escaped

Escaped octets, that is, triplets consisting of the percent
character (

'%'

) followed by two hexadecimal digits
(

'0'

-

'9'

,

'A'

-

'F'

, and

'a'

-

'f'

)

other

The Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character set,
are not control characters (according to the

Character.isISOControl

method), and are not space characters (according to the

Character.isSpaceChar

method)

(

Deviation from RFC 2396

, which is
limited to US-ASCII)

The set of all legal URI characters consists of
the

unreserved

,

reserved

,

escaped

, and

other

characters.

Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding

RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and
fragment components. Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:

- To

encode

non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to
conform strictly to RFC 2396 by not containing any

other

characters.
- To

quote

characters that are otherwise illegal in a
component. The user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ
slightly in terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.

These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:

- A character is

encoded

by replacing it
with the sequence of escaped octets that represent that character in the
UTF-8 character set. The Euro currency symbol (

'\u20AC'

),
for example, is encoded as

"%E2%82%AC"

.

(

Deviation from
RFC 2396

, which does not specify any particular character
set.)
- An illegal character is

quoted

simply by
encoding it. The space character, for example, is quoted by replacing it
with

"%20"

. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII
characters this transformation has exactly the effect required by
RFC 2396.
- A sequence of escaped octets is

decoded

by
replacing it with the sequence of characters that it represents in the
UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the
effect of de-quoting any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of
decoding any encoded non-US-ASCII characters. If a

decoding error

occurs
when decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by

'\uFFFD'

, the Unicode replacement character.

These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class
as follows:

- The

single-argument
constructor

requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
quoted and preserves any escaped octets and

other

characters that
are present.
- The

multi-argument constructors

quote illegal characters as
required by the components in which they appear. The percent character
(

'%'

) is always quoted by these constructors. Any

other

characters are preserved.
- The

getRawUserInfo

,

getRawPath

,

getRawQuery

,

getRawFragment

,

getRawAuthority

, and

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

methods return the
values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
any escaped octets. The strings returned by these methods may contain
both escaped octets and

other

characters, and will not contain any
illegal characters.
- The

getUserInfo

,

getPath

,

getQuery

,

getFragment

,

getAuthority

, and

getSchemeSpecificPart

methods decode any escaped
octets in their corresponding components. The strings returned by these
methods may contain both

other

characters and illegal characters,
and will not contain any escaped octets.
- The

toString

method returns a URI string with
all necessary quotation but which may contain

other

characters.
- The

toASCIIString

method returns a fully
quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any

other

characters.

Identities

For any URI

u

, it is always the case that

new URI(

u

.toString()).equals(

u

)

.

For any URI

u

that does not contain redundant syntax such as two
slashes before an empty authority (as in

file:///tmp/

) or a
colon following a host name but no port (as in

http://java.sun.com:

), and that does not encode characters
except those that must be quoted, the following identities also hold:

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getSchemeSpecificPart(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

in all cases,

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getAuthority(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical, and

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getUserInfo(),
u
.getHost(),
u
.getPort(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical and has either no authority or a server-based
authority.

URIs, URLs, and URNs

A URI is a uniform resource

identifier

while a URL is a uniform
resource

locator

. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but
not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of
URIs, uniform resource

names

(URNs), which name resources but do not
specify how to locate them. The

mailto

,

news

, and

isbn

URIs shown above are examples of URNs.

The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the
differences between this class and the

URL

class.

An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic
sense defined by RFC 2396. A URI may be either absolute or relative.
A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the
scheme, if any, that it specifies. No lookup of the host, if any, is
performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed. Equality,
hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character
content of the instance. In other words, a URI instance is little more than
a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent
operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.

An instance of the

URL

class, by contrast, represents the
syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required
to access the resource that it describes. A URL must be absolute, that is,
it must always specify a scheme. A URL string is parsed according to its
scheme. A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is
impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is
available. Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the
Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined. In other
words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of
resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and
opening a connection to the specified resource.

An

opaque

URI is an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part does
not begin with a slash character (

'/'

). Opaque URIs are not
subject to further parsing. Some examples of opaque URIs are:

- mailto:java-net@java.sun.com
- news:comp.lang.java
- urn:isbn:096139210x

A

hierarchical

the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
normalized. The result, for example, of resolving

sample/a/index.html#28

(1)

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

is the result
URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

Resolving the relative URI

../../demo/b/index.html

(2)

against this result yields, in turn,

http://example.com/languages/java/demo/b/index.html

Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving
the URI

file:///~calendar

against any other URI simply yields the
original URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above
against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
URI

demo/b/index.html

Relativization

, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
two normalized URIs

u

and

v

,

u

.relativize(

u

.resolve(

v

)).equals(

v

)

and

u

.resolve(

u

.relativize(

v

)).equals(

v

)

.

This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
possible. For example, relativizing the URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

yields the relative URI

sample/a/index.html#28

.

Character categories

RFC 2396 specifies precisely which characters are permitted in the
various components of a URI reference. The following categories, most of
which are taken from that specification, are used below to describe these
constraints:

Describes categories alpha,digit,alphanum,unreserved,punct,reserved,escaped,and other

Category

Description

alpha

The US-ASCII alphabetic characters,

'A'

through

'Z'

and

'a'

through

'z'

digit

The US-ASCII decimal digit characters,

'0'

through

'9'

alphanum

All

alpha

and

digit

characters

unreserved

All

alphanum

characters together with those in the string

"_-!.~'()*"

punct

The characters in the string

",;:$&+="

reserved

All

punct

characters together with those in the string

"?/[]@"

escaped

Escaped octets, that is, triplets consisting of the percent
character (

'%'

) followed by two hexadecimal digits
(

'0'

-

'9'

,

'A'

-

'F'

, and

'a'

-

'f'

)

other

The Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character set,
are not control characters (according to the

Character.isISOControl

method), and are not space characters (according to the

Character.isSpaceChar

method)

(

Deviation from RFC 2396

, which is
limited to US-ASCII)

The set of all legal URI characters consists of
the

unreserved

,

reserved

,

escaped

, and

other

characters.

Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding

RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and
fragment components. Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:

- To

encode

non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to
conform strictly to RFC 2396 by not containing any

other

characters.
- To

quote

characters that are otherwise illegal in a
component. The user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ
slightly in terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.

These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:

- A character is

encoded

by replacing it
with the sequence of escaped octets that represent that character in the
UTF-8 character set. The Euro currency symbol (

'\u20AC'

),
for example, is encoded as

"%E2%82%AC"

.

(

Deviation from
RFC 2396

, which does not specify any particular character
set.)
- An illegal character is

quoted

simply by
encoding it. The space character, for example, is quoted by replacing it
with

"%20"

. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII
characters this transformation has exactly the effect required by
RFC 2396.
- A sequence of escaped octets is

decoded

by
replacing it with the sequence of characters that it represents in the
UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the
effect of de-quoting any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of
decoding any encoded non-US-ASCII characters. If a

decoding error

occurs
when decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by

'\uFFFD'

, the Unicode replacement character.

These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class
as follows:

- The

single-argument
constructor

requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
quoted and preserves any escaped octets and

other

characters that
are present.
- The

multi-argument constructors

quote illegal characters as
required by the components in which they appear. The percent character
(

'%'

) is always quoted by these constructors. Any

other

characters are preserved.
- The

getRawUserInfo

,

getRawPath

,

getRawQuery

,

getRawFragment

,

getRawAuthority

, and

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

methods return the
values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
any escaped octets. The strings returned by these methods may contain
both escaped octets and

other

characters, and will not contain any
illegal characters.
- The

getUserInfo

,

getPath

,

getQuery

,

getFragment

,

getAuthority

, and

getSchemeSpecificPart

methods decode any escaped
octets in their corresponding components. The strings returned by these
methods may contain both

other

characters and illegal characters,
and will not contain any escaped octets.
- The

toString

method returns a URI string with
all necessary quotation but which may contain

other

characters.
- The

toASCIIString

method returns a fully
quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any

other

characters.

Identities

For any URI

u

, it is always the case that

new URI(

u

.toString()).equals(

u

)

.

For any URI

u

that does not contain redundant syntax such as two
slashes before an empty authority (as in

file:///tmp/

) or a
colon following a host name but no port (as in

http://java.sun.com:

), and that does not encode characters
except those that must be quoted, the following identities also hold:

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getSchemeSpecificPart(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

in all cases,

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getAuthority(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical, and

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getUserInfo(),
u
.getHost(),
u
.getPort(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical and has either no authority or a server-based
authority.

URIs, URLs, and URNs

A URI is a uniform resource

identifier

while a URL is a uniform
resource

locator

. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but
not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of
URIs, uniform resource

names

(URNs), which name resources but do not
specify how to locate them. The

mailto

,

news

, and

isbn

URIs shown above are examples of URNs.

The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the
differences between this class and the

URL

class.

An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic
sense defined by RFC 2396. A URI may be either absolute or relative.
A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the
scheme, if any, that it specifies. No lookup of the host, if any, is
performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed. Equality,
hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character
content of the instance. In other words, a URI instance is little more than
a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent
operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.

An instance of the

URL

class, by contrast, represents the
syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required
to access the resource that it describes. A URL must be absolute, that is,
it must always specify a scheme. A URL string is parsed according to its
scheme. A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is
impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is
available. Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the
Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined. In other
words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of
resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and
opening a connection to the specified resource.

A hierarchical URI is subject to further parsing according to the syntax

[

scheme

:

][

//

authority

][

path

][

?

query

][

#

fragment

]

where the characters

:

,

/

,

?

, and

#

stand for themselves. The
scheme-specific part of a hierarchical URI consists of the characters
between the scheme and fragment components.

The authority component of a hierarchical URI is, if specified, either

server-based

or

registry-based

. A server-based authority
parses according to the familiar syntax

[

user-info

@

]

host

[

:

port

]

where the characters

@

and

:

stand for
themselves. Nearly all URI schemes currently in use are server-based. An
authority component that does not parse in this way is considered to be
registry-based.

The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute
if it begins with a slash character (

'/'

); otherwise it is
relative. The path of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or
specifies an authority is always absolute.

All told, then, a URI instance has the following nine components:

Describes the components of a URI:scheme,scheme-specific-part,authority,user-info,host,port,path,query,fragment

Component

Type

scheme

String

scheme-specific-part

String

authority

String

user-info

String

host

String

port

int

path

String

query

String

fragment

String

In a given instance any particular component is either

undefined

or

defined

with a distinct value. Undefined string components are
represented by

null

, while undefined integer components are
represented by

-1

. A string component may be defined to have the
empty string as its value; this is not equivalent to that component being
undefined.

Whether a particular component is or is not defined in an instance
depends upon the type of the URI being represented. An absolute URI has a
scheme component. An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and
possibly a fragment, but has no other components. A hierarchical URI always
has a path (though it may be empty) and a scheme-specific-part (which at
least contains the path), and may have any of the other components. If the
authority component is present and is server-based then the host component
will be defined and the user-information and port components may be defined.

Operations on URI instances

The key operations supported by this class are those of

normalization

,

resolution

, and

relativization

.

Normalization

is the process of removing unnecessary

"."

and

".."

segments from the path component of a hierarchical URI.
Each

"."

segment is simply removed. A

".."

segment is
removed only if it is preceded by a non-

".."

segment.
Normalization has no effect upon opaque URIs.

Resolution

is the process of resolving one URI against another,

base

URI. The resulting URI is constructed from components of both
URIs in the manner specified by RFC 2396, taking components from the
base URI for those not specified in the original. For hierarchical URIs,
the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
normalized. The result, for example, of resolving

sample/a/index.html#28

(1)

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

is the result
URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

Resolving the relative URI

../../demo/b/index.html

(2)

against this result yields, in turn,

http://example.com/languages/java/demo/b/index.html

Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving
the URI

file:///~calendar

against any other URI simply yields the
original URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above
against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
URI

demo/b/index.html

Relativization

, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
two normalized URIs

u

and

v

,

u

.relativize(

u

.resolve(

v

)).equals(

v

)

and

u

.resolve(

u

.relativize(

v

)).equals(

v

)

.

This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
possible. For example, relativizing the URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

yields the relative URI

sample/a/index.html#28

.

Character categories

RFC 2396 specifies precisely which characters are permitted in the
various components of a URI reference. The following categories, most of
which are taken from that specification, are used below to describe these
constraints:

Describes categories alpha,digit,alphanum,unreserved,punct,reserved,escaped,and other

'a'

-

)

The Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character set,
are not control characters (according to the

Character.isISOControl

method), and are not space characters (according to the

Character.isSpaceChar

method)

(

Deviation from RFC 2396

, which is
limited to US-ASCII)

The set of all legal URI characters consists of
the

unreserved

,

reserved

,

escaped

, and

other

characters.

Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding

RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and
fragment components. Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:

- To

encode

non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to
conform strictly to RFC 2396 by not containing any

other

characters.
- To

quote

characters that are otherwise illegal in a
component. The user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ
slightly in terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.

These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:

- A character is

encoded

by replacing it
with the sequence of escaped octets that represent that character in the
UTF-8 character set. The Euro currency symbol (

'\u20AC'

),
for example, is encoded as

"%E2%82%AC"

.

(

Deviation from
RFC 2396

, which does not specify any particular character
set.)
- An illegal character is

quoted

simply by
encoding it. The space character, for example, is quoted by replacing it
with

"%20"

. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII
characters this transformation has exactly the effect required by
RFC 2396.
- A sequence of escaped octets is

decoded

by
replacing it with the sequence of characters that it represents in the
UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the
effect of de-quoting any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of
decoding any encoded non-US-ASCII characters. If a

decoding error

occurs
when decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by

'\uFFFD'

, the Unicode replacement character.

These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class
as follows:

- The

single-argument
constructor

requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
quoted and preserves any escaped octets and

other

characters that
are present.
- The

multi-argument constructors

quote illegal characters as
required by the components in which they appear. The percent character
(

'%'

) is always quoted by these constructors. Any

other

characters are preserved.
- The

getRawUserInfo

,

getRawPath

,

getRawQuery

,

getRawFragment

,

getRawAuthority

, and

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

methods return the
values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
any escaped octets. The strings returned by these methods may contain
both escaped octets and

other

characters, and will not contain any
illegal characters.
- The

getUserInfo

,

getPath

,

getQuery

,

getFragment

,

getAuthority

, and

getSchemeSpecificPart

methods decode any escaped
octets in their corresponding components. The strings returned by these
methods may contain both

other

characters and illegal characters,
and will not contain any escaped octets.
- The

toString

method returns a URI string with
all necessary quotation but which may contain

other

characters.
- The

toASCIIString

method returns a fully
quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any

other

characters.

Identities

For any URI

u

, it is always the case that

new URI(

u

.toString()).equals(

u

)

.

For any URI

u

that does not contain redundant syntax such as two
slashes before an empty authority (as in

file:///tmp/

) or a
colon following a host name but no port (as in

http://java.sun.com:

), and that does not encode characters
except those that must be quoted, the following identities also hold:

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getSchemeSpecificPart(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

in all cases,

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getAuthority(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical, and

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getUserInfo(),
u
.getHost(),
u
.getPort(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical and has either no authority or a server-based
authority.

URIs, URLs, and URNs

A URI is a uniform resource

identifier

while a URL is a uniform
resource

locator

. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but
not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of
URIs, uniform resource

names

(URNs), which name resources but do not
specify how to locate them. The

mailto

,

news

, and

isbn

URIs shown above are examples of URNs.

The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the
differences between this class and the

URL

class.

An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic
sense defined by RFC 2396. A URI may be either absolute or relative.
A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the
scheme, if any, that it specifies. No lookup of the host, if any, is
performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed. Equality,
hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character
content of the instance. In other words, a URI instance is little more than
a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent
operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.

An instance of the

URL

class, by contrast, represents the
syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required
to access the resource that it describes. A URL must be absolute, that is,
it must always specify a scheme. A URL string is parsed according to its
scheme. A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is
impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is
available. Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the
Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined. In other
words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of
resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and
opening a connection to the specified resource.

The authority component of a hierarchical URI is, if specified, either

server-based

or

registry-based

. A server-based authority
parses according to the familiar syntax

[

user-info

@

]

host

[

:

port

]

where the characters

@

and

:

stand for
themselves. Nearly all URI schemes currently in use are server-based. An
authority component that does not parse in this way is considered to be
registry-based.

The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute
if it begins with a slash character (

'/'

); otherwise it is
relative. The path of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or
specifies an authority is always absolute.

All told, then, a URI instance has the following nine components:

represented by

, while undefined integer components are
represented by

-1

. A string component may be defined to have the
empty string as its value; this is not equivalent to that component being
undefined.

Whether a particular component is or is not defined in an instance
depends upon the type of the URI being represented. An absolute URI has a
scheme component. An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and
possibly a fragment, but has no other components. A hierarchical URI always
has a path (though it may be empty) and a scheme-specific-part (which at
least contains the path), and may have any of the other components. If the
authority component is present and is server-based then the host component
will be defined and the user-information and port components may be defined.

Operations on URI instances

The key operations supported by this class are those of

normalization

,

resolution

, and

.

Normalization

is the process of removing unnecessary

is the process of resolving one URI against another,

base

URI. The resulting URI is constructed from components of both
URIs in the manner specified by RFC 2396, taking components from the
base URI for those not specified in the original. For hierarchical URIs,
the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
normalized. The result, for example, of resolving

sample/a/index.html#28

(1)

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

is the result
URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

Resolving the relative URI

../../demo/b/index.html

(2)

against this result yields, in turn,

http://example.com/languages/java/demo/b/index.html

Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving
the URI

file:///~calendar

against any other URI simply yields the
original URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above
against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
URI

demo/b/index.html

Relativization

, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
two normalized URIs

u

and

v

,

u

.relativize(

u

.resolve(

v

)).equals(

v

)

and

u

.resolve(

u

.relativize(

v

)).equals(

v

)

.

This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
possible. For example, relativizing the URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

yields the relative URI

sample/a/index.html#28

.

as follows:

- The

single-argument
constructor

requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
quoted and preserves any escaped octets and

other

are present.
- The

multi-argument constructors

quote illegal characters as
required by the components in which they appear. The percent character
(

'%'

) is always quoted by these constructors. Any

other

characters are preserved.
- The

getRawUserInfo

getRawPath

,

getRawQuery

,

getRawFragment

,

getRawAuthority

, and

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

methods return the
values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
any escaped octets. The strings returned by these methods may contain
both escaped octets and

other

characters, and will not contain any
illegal characters.
- The

getUserInfo

,

getPath

,

getQuery

,

getFragment

,

getAuthority

getSchemeSpecificPart

methods decode any escaped
octets in their corresponding components. The strings returned by these
methods may contain both

other

and will not contain any escaped octets.
- The

toString

method returns a URI string with
all necessary quotation but which may contain

other

quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any

other

URIs, URLs, and URNs

A URI is a uniform resource

identifier

while a URL is a uniform
resource

locator

. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but
not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of
URIs, uniform resource

names

(URNs), which name resources but do not
specify how to locate them. The

mailto

,

news

, and

isbn

URIs shown above are examples of URNs.

The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the
differences between this class and the

URL

class.

An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic
sense defined by RFC 2396. A URI may be either absolute or relative.
A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the
scheme, if any, that it specifies. No lookup of the host, if any, is
performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed. Equality,
hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character
content of the instance. In other words, a URI instance is little more than
a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent
operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.

An instance of the

URL

class, by contrast, represents the
syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required
to access the resource that it describes. A URL must be absolute, that is,
it must always specify a scheme. A URL string is parsed according to its
scheme. A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is
impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is
available. Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the
Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined. In other
words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of
resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and
opening a connection to the specified resource.

The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute
if it begins with a slash character (

'/'

); otherwise it is
relative. The path of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or
specifies an authority is always absolute.

All told, then, a URI instance has the following nine components:

Describes the components of a URI:scheme,scheme-specific-part,authority,user-info,host,port,path,query,fragment

Component

Type

scheme

String

scheme-specific-part

String

authority

String

user-info

String

host

String

port

int

path

String

query

String

fragment

String

In a given instance any particular component is either

undefined

or

defined

with a distinct value. Undefined string components are
represented by

null

, while undefined integer components are
represented by

-1

. A string component may be defined to have the
empty string as its value; this is not equivalent to that component being
undefined.

Whether a particular component is or is not defined in an instance
depends upon the type of the URI being represented. An absolute URI has a
scheme component. An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and
possibly a fragment, but has no other components. A hierarchical URI always
has a path (though it may be empty) and a scheme-specific-part (which at
least contains the path), and may have any of the other components. If the
authority component is present and is server-based then the host component
will be defined and the user-information and port components may be defined.

Operations on URI instances

The key operations supported by this class are those of

normalization

,

resolution

, and

relativization

.

Normalization

is the process of removing unnecessary

"."

and

".."

segments from the path component of a hierarchical URI.
Each

"."

segment is simply removed. A

".."

segment is
removed only if it is preceded by a non-

".."

segment.
Normalization has no effect upon opaque URIs.

Resolution

is the process of resolving one URI against another,

base

URI. The resulting URI is constructed from components of both
URIs in the manner specified by RFC 2396, taking components from the
base URI for those not specified in the original. For hierarchical URIs,
the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
normalized. The result, for example, of resolving

sample/a/index.html#28

(1)

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

is the result
URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

Resolving the relative URI

../../demo/b/index.html

(2)

against this result yields, in turn,

http://example.com/languages/java/demo/b/index.html

Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving
the URI

file:///~calendar

against any other URI simply yields the
original URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above
against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
URI

demo/b/index.html

Relativization

, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
two normalized URIs

u

and

v

,

u

.relativize(

u

.resolve(

v

)).equals(

v

)

and

u

.resolve(

u

.relativize(

v

)).equals(

v

)

.

This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
possible. For example, relativizing the URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

yields the relative URI

sample/a/index.html#28

.

Character categories

RFC 2396 specifies precisely which characters are permitted in the
various components of a URI reference. The following categories, most of
which are taken from that specification, are used below to describe these
constraints:

Describes categories alpha,digit,alphanum,unreserved,punct,reserved,escaped,and other

Category

Description

alpha

The US-ASCII alphabetic characters,

'A'

through

'Z'

and

'a'

through

'z'

digit

The US-ASCII decimal digit characters,

'0'

through

'9'

alphanum

All

alpha

and

digit

characters

unreserved

All

alphanum

characters together with those in the string

"_-!.~'()*"

punct

The characters in the string

",;:$&+="

reserved

All

punct

characters together with those in the string

"?/[]@"

escaped

Escaped octets, that is, triplets consisting of the percent
character (

'%'

) followed by two hexadecimal digits
(

'0'

-

'9'

,

'A'

-

'F'

, and

'a'

-

'f'

)

other

The Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character set,
are not control characters (according to the

Character.isISOControl

method), and are not space characters (according to the

Character.isSpaceChar

method)

(

Deviation from RFC 2396

, which is
limited to US-ASCII)

The set of all legal URI characters consists of
the

unreserved

,

reserved

,

escaped

, and

other

characters.

Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding

RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and
fragment components. Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:

- To

encode

non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to
conform strictly to RFC 2396 by not containing any

other

characters.
- To

quote

characters that are otherwise illegal in a
component. The user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ
slightly in terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.

These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:

- A character is

encoded

by replacing it
with the sequence of escaped octets that represent that character in the
UTF-8 character set. The Euro currency symbol (

'\u20AC'

),
for example, is encoded as

"%E2%82%AC"

.

(

Deviation from
RFC 2396

, which does not specify any particular character
set.)
- An illegal character is

quoted

simply by
encoding it. The space character, for example, is quoted by replacing it
with

"%20"

. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII
characters this transformation has exactly the effect required by
RFC 2396.
- A sequence of escaped octets is

decoded

by
replacing it with the sequence of characters that it represents in the
UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the
effect of de-quoting any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of
decoding any encoded non-US-ASCII characters. If a

decoding error

occurs
when decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by

'\uFFFD'

, the Unicode replacement character.

These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class
as follows:

- The

single-argument
constructor

requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
quoted and preserves any escaped octets and

other

characters that
are present.
- The

multi-argument constructors

quote illegal characters as
required by the components in which they appear. The percent character
(

'%'

) is always quoted by these constructors. Any

other

characters are preserved.
- The

getRawUserInfo

,

getRawPath

,

getRawQuery

,

getRawFragment

,

getRawAuthority

, and

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

methods return the
values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
any escaped octets. The strings returned by these methods may contain
both escaped octets and

other

characters, and will not contain any
illegal characters.
- The

getUserInfo

,

getPath

,

getQuery

,

getFragment

,

getAuthority

, and

getSchemeSpecificPart

methods decode any escaped
octets in their corresponding components. The strings returned by these
methods may contain both

other

characters and illegal characters,
and will not contain any escaped octets.
- The

toString

method returns a URI string with
all necessary quotation but which may contain

other

characters.
- The

toASCIIString

method returns a fully
quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any

other

characters.

file:///tmp/

) or a
colon following a host name but no port (as in

Character categories

RFC 2396 specifies precisely which characters are permitted in the
various components of a URI reference. The following categories, most of
which are taken from that specification, are used below to describe these
constraints:

Describes categories alpha,digit,alphanum,unreserved,punct,reserved,escaped,and other

Category

Description

alpha

The US-ASCII alphabetic characters,

'A'

through

'Z'

and

'a'

through

'z'

digit

The US-ASCII decimal digit characters,

'0'

through

'9'

alphanum

All

alpha

and

characters

unreserved

All

characters together with those in the string

"_-!.~'()*"

punct

The characters in the string

reserved

All

characters together with those in the string

"?/[]@"

escaped

Escaped octets, that is, triplets consisting of the percent
character (

'%'

) followed by two hexadecimal digits
(

'0'

-

'9'

,

'A'

-

'F'

, and

'a'

-

'f'

)

other

The Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character set,
are not control characters (according to the

Character.isISOControl

method), and are not space characters (according to the

Character.isSpaceChar

method)

(

Deviation from RFC 2396

, which is
limited to US-ASCII)

The set of all legal URI characters consists of
the

unreserved

,

reserved

,

escaped

, and

other

characters.

Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding

RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and
fragment components. Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:

- To

encode

non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to
conform strictly to RFC 2396 by not containing any

other

characters.
- To

quote

characters that are otherwise illegal in a
component. The user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ
slightly in terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.

These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:

- A character is

encoded

by replacing it
with the sequence of escaped octets that represent that character in the
UTF-8 character set. The Euro currency symbol (

'\u20AC'

),
for example, is encoded as

"%E2%82%AC"

.

(

Deviation from
RFC 2396

, which does not specify any particular character
set.)
- An illegal character is

quoted

simply by
encoding it. The space character, for example, is quoted by replacing it
with

"%20"

. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII
characters this transformation has exactly the effect required by
RFC 2396.
- A sequence of escaped octets is

decoded

by
replacing it with the sequence of characters that it represents in the
UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the
effect of de-quoting any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of
decoding any encoded non-US-ASCII characters. If a

decoding error

occurs
when decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by

'\uFFFD'

, the Unicode replacement character.

These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class
as follows:

- The

single-argument
constructor

requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
quoted and preserves any escaped octets and

other

characters that
are present.
- The

multi-argument constructors

quote illegal characters as
required by the components in which they appear. The percent character
(

'%'

) is always quoted by these constructors. Any

other

characters are preserved.
- The

getRawUserInfo

,

getRawPath

,

getRawQuery

,

getRawFragment

,

getRawAuthority

, and

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

methods return the
values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
any escaped octets. The strings returned by these methods may contain
both escaped octets and

other

characters, and will not contain any
illegal characters.
- The

getUserInfo

,

getPath

,

getQuery

,

getFragment

,

getAuthority

, and

getSchemeSpecificPart

methods decode any escaped
octets in their corresponding components. The strings returned by these
methods may contain both

other

characters and illegal characters,
and will not contain any escaped octets.
- The

toString

method returns a URI string with
all necessary quotation but which may contain

other

characters.
- The

toASCIIString

method returns a fully
quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any

other

characters.

Identities

For any URI

u

, it is always the case that

new URI(

u

.toString()).equals(

u

)

.

For any URI

u

that does not contain redundant syntax such as two
slashes before an empty authority (as in

file:///tmp/

) or a
colon following a host name but no port (as in

http://java.sun.com:

), and that does not encode characters
except those that must be quoted, the following identities also hold:

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getSchemeSpecificPart(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

in all cases,

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getAuthority(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical, and

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getUserInfo(),
u
.getHost(),
u
.getPort(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical and has either no authority or a server-based
authority.

URIs, URLs, and URNs

A URI is a uniform resource

identifier

while a URL is a uniform
resource

locator

. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but
not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of
URIs, uniform resource

names

(URNs), which name resources but do not
specify how to locate them. The

mailto

,

news

, and

isbn

URIs shown above are examples of URNs.

The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the
differences between this class and the

URL

class.

An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic
sense defined by RFC 2396. A URI may be either absolute or relative.
A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the
scheme, if any, that it specifies. No lookup of the host, if any, is
performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed. Equality,
hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character
content of the instance. In other words, a URI instance is little more than
a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent
operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.

An instance of the

URL

class, by contrast, represents the
syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required
to access the resource that it describes. A URL must be absolute, that is,
it must always specify a scheme. A URL string is parsed according to its
scheme. A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is
impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is
available. Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the
Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined. In other
words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of
resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and
opening a connection to the specified resource.

---

#### Operations on URI instances

Normalization

is the process of removing unnecessary

"."

and

".."

segments from the path component of a hierarchical URI.
Each

"."

segment is simply removed. A

".."

segment is
removed only if it is preceded by a non-

".."

segment.
Normalization has no effect upon opaque URIs.

Resolution

is the process of resolving one URI against another,

base

URI. The resulting URI is constructed from components of both
URIs in the manner specified by RFC 2396, taking components from the
base URI for those not specified in the original. For hierarchical URIs,
the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
normalized. The result, for example, of resolving

sample/a/index.html#28

(1)

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

is the result
URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

Resolving the relative URI

../../demo/b/index.html

(2)

against this result yields, in turn,

http://example.com/languages/java/demo/b/index.html

Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported. Resolving
the URI

file:///~calendar

against any other URI simply yields the
original URI, since it is absolute. Resolving the relative URI (2) above
against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
URI

demo/b/index.html

Relativization

, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
two normalized URIs

u

and

v

,

u

.relativize(

u

.resolve(

v

)).equals(

v

)

and

u

.resolve(

u

.relativize(

v

)).equals(

v

)

.

This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
possible. For example, relativizing the URI

http://example.com/languages/java/sample/a/index.html#28

against the base URI

http://example.com/languages/java/

yields the relative URI

sample/a/index.html#28

.

Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding

RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and
fragment components. Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:

- To

encode

non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to
conform strictly to RFC 2396 by not containing any

other

characters.
- To

quote

characters that are otherwise illegal in a
component. The user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ
slightly in terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.

These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:

- A character is

encoded

by replacing it
with the sequence of escaped octets that represent that character in the
UTF-8 character set. The Euro currency symbol (

'\u20AC'

),
for example, is encoded as

"%E2%82%AC"

.

(

Deviation from
RFC 2396

, which does not specify any particular character
set.)
- An illegal character is

quoted

simply by
encoding it. The space character, for example, is quoted by replacing it
with

"%20"

. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII
characters this transformation has exactly the effect required by
RFC 2396.
- A sequence of escaped octets is

decoded

by
replacing it with the sequence of characters that it represents in the
UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the
effect of de-quoting any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of
decoding any encoded non-US-ASCII characters. If a

decoding error

occurs
when decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by

'\uFFFD'

, the Unicode replacement character.

These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class
as follows:

- The

single-argument
constructor

requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
quoted and preserves any escaped octets and

other

characters that
are present.
- The

multi-argument constructors

quote illegal characters as
required by the components in which they appear. The percent character
(

'%'

) is always quoted by these constructors. Any

other

characters are preserved.
- The

getRawUserInfo

,

getRawPath

,

getRawQuery

,

getRawFragment

,

getRawAuthority

, and

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

methods return the
values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
any escaped octets. The strings returned by these methods may contain
both escaped octets and

other

characters, and will not contain any
illegal characters.
- The

getUserInfo

,

getPath

,

getQuery

,

getFragment

,

getAuthority

, and

getSchemeSpecificPart

methods decode any escaped
octets in their corresponding components. The strings returned by these
methods may contain both

other

characters and illegal characters,
and will not contain any escaped octets.
- The

toString

method returns a URI string with
all necessary quotation but which may contain

other

characters.
- The

toASCIIString

method returns a fully
quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any

other

characters.

Identities

For any URI

u

, it is always the case that

new URI(

u

.toString()).equals(

u

)

.

For any URI

u

that does not contain redundant syntax such as two
slashes before an empty authority (as in

file:///tmp/

) or a
colon following a host name but no port (as in

http://java.sun.com:

), and that does not encode characters
except those that must be quoted, the following identities also hold:

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getSchemeSpecificPart(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

in all cases,

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getAuthority(),

u
.getPath(),
u
.getQuery(),

u
.getFragment())
.equals(
u
)
```

if

u

is hierarchical, and

```java
new URI(
u
.getScheme(),

u
.getUserInfo(),
u
.getHost(),
u
.getPort(),

u

u
.getQuery(),

u

.equals(
u

```

if

u

is hierarchical and has either no authority or a server-based
authority.

URIs, URLs, and URNs

A URI is a uniform resource

identifier

while a URL is a uniform
resource

locator

. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but
not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of
URIs, uniform resource

names

(URNs), which name resources but do not
specify how to locate them. The

mailto

,

news

, and

isbn

URIs shown above are examples of URNs.

The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the
differences between this class and the

URL

class.

An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic
sense defined by RFC 2396. A URI may be either absolute or relative.
A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the
scheme, if any, that it specifies. No lookup of the host, if any, is
performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed. Equality,
hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character
content of the instance. In other words, a URI instance is little more than
a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent
operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.

An instance of the

URL

class, by contrast, represents the
syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required
to access the resource that it describes. A URL must be absolute, that is,
it must always specify a scheme. A URL string is parsed according to its
scheme. A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is
impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is
available. Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the
Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined. In other
words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of
resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and
opening a connection to the specified resource.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- URI

```java
public URI​(
String
str)
throws
URISyntaxException
```

Constructs a URI by parsing the given string.

This constructor parses the given string exactly as specified by the
grammar in

RFC 2396

,
Appendix A,

except for the following deviations:

- An empty authority component is permitted as long as it is
followed by a non-empty path, a query component, or a fragment
component. This allows the parsing of URIs such as

"file:///foo/bar"

, which seems to be the intent of
RFC 2396 although the grammar does not permit it. If the
authority component is empty then the user-information, host, and port
components are undefined.
- Empty relative paths are permitted; this seems to be the
intent of RFC 2396 although the grammar does not permit it. The
primary consequence of this deviation is that a standalone fragment
such as

"#foo"

parses as a relative URI with an empty path
and the given fragment, and can be usefully

resolved

against a base URI.

IPv4 addresses in host components are parsed rigorously, as
specified by

RFC 2732

: Each
element of a dotted-quad address must contain no more than three
decimal digits. Each element is further constrained to have a value
no greater than 255.

Hostnames in host components that comprise only a single
domain label are permitted to start with an

alphanum

character. This seems to be the intent of

RFC 2396

section 3.2.2 although the grammar does not permit it. The
consequence of this deviation is that the authority component of a
hierarchical URI such as

s://123

, will parse as a server-based
authority.

IPv6 addresses are permitted for the host component. An IPv6
address must be enclosed in square brackets (

'['

and

']'

) as specified by

RFC 2732

. The
IPv6 address itself must parse according to

RFC 2373

. IPv6
addresses are further constrained to describe no more than sixteen
bytes of address information, a constraint implicit in RFC 2373
but not expressible in the grammar.

Characters in the

other

category are permitted wherever
RFC 2396 permits

escaped

octets, that is, in the
user-information, path, query, and fragment components, as well as in
the authority component if the authority is registry-based. This
allows URIs to contain Unicode characters beyond those in the US-ASCII
character set.

**Parameters:** str

- The string to be parsed into a URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

str

is

null
**Throws:** URISyntaxException

- If the given string violates RFC 2396, as augmented
by the above deviations

- URI

```java
public URI​(
String
scheme,

String
userInfo,

String
host,
int port,

String
path,

String
query,

String
fragment)
throws
URISyntaxException
```

Constructs a hierarchical URI from the given components.

If a scheme is given then the path, if also given, must either be
empty or begin with a slash character (

'/'

). Otherwise a
component of the new URI may be left undefined by passing

null

for the corresponding parameter or, in the case of the

port

parameter, by passing

-1

.

This constructor first builds a URI string from the given components
according to the rules specified in

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 7:

- Initially, the result string is empty.
- If a scheme is given then it is appended to the result,
followed by a colon character (

':'

).
- If user information, a host, or a port are given then the
string

"//"

is appended.
- If user information is given then it is appended, followed by
a commercial-at character (

'@'

). Any character not in the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

, or

other

categories is

quoted

.
- If a host is given then it is appended. If the host is a
literal IPv6 address but is not enclosed in square brackets
(

'['

and

']'

) then the square brackets are added.
- If a port number is given then a colon character
(

':'

) is appended, followed by the port number in decimal.
- If a path is given then it is appended. Any character not in
the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

, or

other

categories, and not equal to the slash character (

'/'

) or the
commercial-at character (

'@'

), is quoted.
- If a query is given then a question-mark character
(

'?'

) is appended, followed by the query. Any character that
is not a

legal URI character

is quoted.
- Finally, if a fragment is given then a hash character
(

'#'

) is appended, followed by the fragment. Any character
that is not a legal URI character is quoted.

The resulting URI string is then parsed as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor and then invoking the

parseServerAuthority()

method upon the result; this may cause a

URISyntaxException

to be thrown.

**Parameters:** scheme

- Scheme name
**Parameters:** userInfo

- User name and authorization information
**Parameters:** host

- Host name
**Parameters:** port

- Port number
**Parameters:** path

- Path
**Parameters:** query

- Query
**Parameters:** fragment

- Fragment
**Throws:** URISyntaxException

- If both a scheme and a path are given but the path is relative,
if the URI string constructed from the given components violates
RFC 2396, or if the authority component of the string is
present but cannot be parsed as a server-based authority

- URI

```java
public URI​(
String
scheme,

String
authority,

String
path,

String
query,

String
fragment)
throws
URISyntaxException
```

Constructs a hierarchical URI from the given components.

If a scheme is given then the path, if also given, must either be
empty or begin with a slash character (

'/'

). Otherwise a
component of the new URI may be left undefined by passing

null

for the corresponding parameter.

This constructor first builds a URI string from the given components
according to the rules specified in

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 7:

- Initially, the result string is empty.
- If a scheme is given then it is appended to the result,
followed by a colon character (

':'

).
- If an authority is given then the string

"//"

is
appended, followed by the authority. If the authority contains a
literal IPv6 address then the address must be enclosed in square
brackets (

'['

and

']'

). Any character not in the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

, or

other

categories, and not equal to the commercial-at character
(

'@'

), is

quoted

.
- If a path is given then it is appended. Any character not in
the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

, or

other

categories, and not equal to the slash character (

'/'

) or the
commercial-at character (

'@'

), is quoted.
- If a query is given then a question-mark character
(

'?'

) is appended, followed by the query. Any character that
is not a

legal URI character

is quoted.
- Finally, if a fragment is given then a hash character
(

'#'

) is appended, followed by the fragment. Any character
that is not a legal URI character is quoted.

The resulting URI string is then parsed as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor and then invoking the

parseServerAuthority()

method upon the result; this may cause a

URISyntaxException

to be thrown.

**Parameters:** scheme

- Scheme name
**Parameters:** authority

- Authority
**Parameters:** path

- Path
**Parameters:** query

- Query
**Parameters:** fragment

- Fragment
**Throws:** URISyntaxException

- If both a scheme and a path are given but the path is relative,
if the URI string constructed from the given components violates
RFC 2396, or if the authority component of the string is
present but cannot be parsed as a server-based authority

- URI

```java
public URI​(
String
scheme,

String
host,

String
path,

String
fragment)
throws
URISyntaxException
```

Constructs a hierarchical URI from the given components.

A component may be left undefined by passing

null

.

This convenience constructor works as if by invoking the
seven-argument constructor as follows:

new

URI

(scheme, null, host, -1, path, null, fragment);

**Parameters:** scheme

- Scheme name
**Parameters:** host

- Host name
**Parameters:** path

- Path
**Parameters:** fragment

- Fragment
**Throws:** URISyntaxException

- If the URI string constructed from the given components
violates RFC 2396

String
scheme,

String
ssp,

String
fragment)
throws
URISyntaxException
```

Constructs a URI from the given components.

A component may be left undefined by passing

null

.

This constructor first builds a URI in string form using the given
components as follows:

- Initially, the result string is empty.
- If a scheme is given then it is appended to the result,
followed by a colon character (

':'

).
- If a scheme-specific part is given then it is appended. Any
character that is not a

legal URI character

is

quoted

.
- Finally, if a fragment is given then a hash character
(

'#'

) is appended to the string, followed by the fragment.
Any character that is not a legal URI character is quoted.

The resulting URI string is then parsed in order to create the new
URI instance as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor;
this may cause a

URISyntaxException

to be thrown.

**Parameters:** scheme

- Scheme name
**Parameters:** ssp

- Scheme-specific part
**Parameters:** fragment

- Fragment
**Throws:** URISyntaxException

- If the URI string constructed from the given components
violates RFC 2396

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- create

```java
public static
URI
create​(
String
str)
```

Creates a URI by parsing the given string.

This convenience factory method works as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor; any

URISyntaxException

thrown by the
constructor is caught and wrapped in a new

IllegalArgumentException

object, which is then thrown.

This method is provided for use in situations where it is known that
the given string is a legal URI, for example for URI constants declared
within in a program, and so it would be considered a programming error
for the string not to parse as such. The constructors, which throw

URISyntaxException

directly, should be used situations where a
URI is being constructed from user input or from some other source that
may be prone to errors.

**Parameters:** str

- The string to be parsed into a URI
**Returns:** The new URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

str

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the given string violates RFC 2396

- parseServerAuthority

```java
public
URI
parseServerAuthority()
throws
URISyntaxException
```

Attempts to parse this URI's authority component, if defined, into
user-information, host, and port components.

If this URI's authority component has already been recognized as
being server-based then it will already have been parsed into
user-information, host, and port components. In this case, or if this
URI has no authority component, this method simply returns this URI.

Otherwise this method attempts once more to parse the authority
component into user-information, host, and port components, and throws
an exception describing why the authority component could not be parsed
in that way.

This method is provided because the generic URI syntax specified in

RFC 2396

cannot always distinguish a malformed server-based authority from a
legitimate registry-based authority. It must therefore treat some
instances of the former as instances of the latter. The authority
component in the URI string

"//foo:bar"

, for example, is not a
legal server-based authority but it is legal as a registry-based
authority.

In many common situations, for example when working URIs that are
known to be either URNs or URLs, the hierarchical URIs being used will
always be server-based. They therefore must either be parsed as such or
treated as an error. In these cases a statement such as

URI

u

= new URI(str).parseServerAuthority();

can be used to ensure that

u

always refers to a URI that, if
it has an authority component, has a server-based authority with proper
user-information, host, and port components. Invoking this method also
ensures that if the authority could not be parsed in that way then an
appropriate diagnostic message can be issued based upon the exception
that is thrown.

**Returns:** A URI whose authority field has been parsed
as a server-based authority
**Throws:** URISyntaxException

- If the authority component of this URI is defined
but cannot be parsed as a server-based authority
according to RFC 2396

- normalize

```java
public
URI
normalize()
```

Normalizes this URI's path.

If this URI is opaque, or if its path is already in normal form,
then this URI is returned. Otherwise a new URI is constructed that is
identical to this URI except that its path is computed by normalizing
this URI's path in a manner consistent with

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 6, sub-steps c through f; that is:

- All

"."

segments are removed.
- If a

".."

segment is preceded by a non-

".."

segment then both of these segments are removed. This step is
repeated until it is no longer applicable.
- If the path is relative, and if its first segment contains a
colon character (

':'

), then a

"."

segment is
prepended. This prevents a relative URI with a path such as

"a:b/c/d"

from later being re-parsed as an opaque URI with a
scheme of

"a"

and a scheme-specific part of

"b/c/d"

.

(Deviation from RFC 2396)

A normalized path will begin with one or more

".."

segments
if there were insufficient non-

".."

segments preceding them to
allow their removal. A normalized path will begin with a

"."

segment if one was inserted by step 3 above. Otherwise, a normalized
path will not contain any

"."

or

".."

segments.

**Returns:** A URI equivalent to this URI,
but whose path is in normal form

- resolve

```java
public
URI
resolve​(
URI
uri)
```

Resolves the given URI against this URI.

If the given URI is already absolute, or if this URI is opaque, then
the given URI is returned.

If the given URI's fragment component is
defined, its path component is empty, and its scheme, authority, and
query components are undefined, then a URI with the given fragment but
with all other components equal to those of this URI is returned. This
allows a URI representing a standalone fragment reference, such as

"#foo"

, to be usefully resolved against a base URI.

Otherwise this method constructs a new hierarchical URI in a manner
consistent with

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2; that is:

- A new URI is constructed with this URI's scheme and the given
URI's query and fragment components.
- If the given URI has an authority component then the new URI's
authority and path are taken from the given URI.
- Otherwise the new URI's authority component is copied from
this URI, and its path is computed as follows:

- If the given URI's path is absolute then the new URI's path
is taken from the given URI.
- Otherwise the given URI's path is relative, and so the new
URI's path is computed by resolving the path of the given URI
against the path of this URI. This is done by concatenating all but
the last segment of this URI's path, if any, with the given URI's
path and then normalizing the result as if by invoking the

normalize

method.

The result of this method is absolute if, and only if, either this
URI is absolute or the given URI is absolute.

**Parameters:** uri

- The URI to be resolved against this URI
**Returns:** The resulting URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

uri

is

null

- resolve

```java
public
URI
resolve​(
String
str)
```

Constructs a new URI by parsing the given string and then resolving it
against this URI.

This convenience method works as if invoking it were equivalent to
evaluating the expression

resolve

(URI.

create

(str))

.

**Parameters:** str

- The string to be parsed into a URI
**Returns:** The resulting URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

str

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the given string violates RFC 2396

- relativize

```java
public
URI
relativize​(
URI
uri)
```

Relativizes the given URI against this URI.

The relativization of the given URI against this URI is computed as
follows:

- If either this URI or the given URI are opaque, or if the
scheme and authority components of the two URIs are not identical, or
if the path of this URI is not a prefix of the path of the given URI,
then the given URI is returned.
- Otherwise a new relative hierarchical URI is constructed with
query and fragment components taken from the given URI and with a path
component computed by removing this URI's path from the beginning of
the given URI's path.

**Parameters:** uri

- The URI to be relativized against this URI
**Returns:** The resulting URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

uri

is

null

- toURL

```java
public
URL
toURL()
throws
MalformedURLException
```

Constructs a URL from this URI.

This convenience method works as if invoking it were equivalent to
evaluating the expression

new URL(this.toString())

after
first checking that this URI is absolute.

**Returns:** A URL constructed from this URI
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If this URL is not absolute
**Throws:** MalformedURLException

), though hyphens never
occur as the first or last characters in a label. The rightmost
label of a domain name consisting of two or more labels, begins
with an

alpha

character.

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
ob)
```

Tests this URI for equality with another object.

If the given object is not a URI then this method immediately
returns

false

.

For two URIs to be considered equal requires that either both are
opaque or both are hierarchical. Their schemes must either both be
undefined or else be equal without regard to case. Their fragments
must either both be undefined or else be equal.

For two opaque URIs to be considered equal, their scheme-specific
parts must be equal.

For two hierarchical URIs to be considered equal, their paths must
be equal and their queries must either both be undefined or else be
equal. Their authorities must either both be undefined, or both be
registry-based, or both be server-based. If their authorities are
defined and are registry-based, then they must be equal. If their
authorities are defined and are server-based, then their hosts must be
equal without regard to case, their port numbers must be equal, and
their user-information components must be equal.

When testing the user-information, path, query, fragment, authority,
or scheme-specific parts of two URIs for equality, the raw forms rather
than the encoded forms of these components are compared and the
hexadecimal digits of escaped octets are compared without regard to
case.

of the URI's components, and satisfies the general contract of the

Object.hashCode

method.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** A hash-code value for this URI
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
URI
that)
```

Compares this URI to another object, which must be a URI.

When comparing corresponding components of two URIs, if one
component is undefined but the other is defined then the first is
considered to be less than the second. Unless otherwise noted, string
components are ordered according to their natural, case-sensitive
ordering as defined by the

String.compareTo

method. String components that are subject to
encoding are compared by comparing their raw forms rather than their
encoded forms.

The ordering of URIs is defined as follows:

- Two URIs with different schemes are ordered according the
ordering of their schemes, without regard to case.
- A hierarchical URI is considered to be less than an opaque URI
with an identical scheme.
- Two opaque URIs with identical schemes are ordered according
to the ordering of their scheme-specific parts.
- Two opaque URIs with identical schemes and scheme-specific
parts are ordered according to the ordering of their
fragments.
- Two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes are ordered
according to the ordering of their authority components:

- If both authority components are server-based then the URIs
are ordered according to their user-information components; if these
components are identical then the URIs are ordered according to the
ordering of their hosts, without regard to case; if the hosts are
identical then the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of
their ports.
- If one or both authority components are registry-based then
the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of their authority
components.
- Finally, two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes and
authority components are ordered according to the ordering of their
paths; if their paths are identical then they are ordered according to
the ordering of their queries; if the queries are identical then they
are ordered according to the order of their fragments.

This method satisfies the general contract of the

Comparable.compareTo

method.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

URI

>
**Parameters:** that

- The object to which this URI is to be compared
**Returns:** A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this URI is
less than, equal to, or greater than the given URI
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- If the given object is not a URI

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the content of this URI as a string.

If this URI was created by invoking one of the constructors in this
class then a string equivalent to the original input string, or to the
string computed from the originally-given components, as appropriate, is
returned. Otherwise this URI was created by normalization, resolution,
or relativization, and so a string is constructed from this URI's
components according to the rules specified in

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 7.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** The string form of this URI

- toASCIIString

```java
public
String
toASCIIString()
```

Returns the content of this URI as a US-ASCII string.

If this URI does not contain any characters in the

other

category then an invocation of this method will return the same value as
an invocation of the

toString

method. Otherwise
this method works as if by invoking that method and then

encoding

the result.

**Returns:** The string form of this URI, encoded as needed
so that it only contains characters in the US-ASCII
charset

Constructor Detail

- URI

```java
public URI​(
String
str)
throws
URISyntaxException
```

Constructs a URI by parsing the given string.

This constructor parses the given string exactly as specified by the
grammar in

RFC 2396

,
Appendix A,

except for the following deviations:

- An empty authority component is permitted as long as it is
followed by a non-empty path, a query component, or a fragment
component. This allows the parsing of URIs such as

"file:///foo/bar"

, which seems to be the intent of
RFC 2396 although the grammar does not permit it. If the
authority component is empty then the user-information, host, and port
components are undefined.
- Empty relative paths are permitted; this seems to be the
intent of RFC 2396 although the grammar does not permit it. The
primary consequence of this deviation is that a standalone fragment
such as

"#foo"

parses as a relative URI with an empty path
and the given fragment, and can be usefully

resolved

against a base URI.

IPv4 addresses in host components are parsed rigorously, as
specified by

RFC 2732

: Each
element of a dotted-quad address must contain no more than three
decimal digits. Each element is further constrained to have a value
no greater than 255.

Hostnames in host components that comprise only a single
domain label are permitted to start with an

alphanum

character. This seems to be the intent of

RFC 2396

section 3.2.2 although the grammar does not permit it. The
consequence of this deviation is that the authority component of a
hierarchical URI such as

s://123

, will parse as a server-based
authority.

IPv6 addresses are permitted for the host component. An IPv6
address must be enclosed in square brackets (

'['

and

']'

) as specified by

RFC 2732

. The
IPv6 address itself must parse according to

RFC 2373

. IPv6
addresses are further constrained to describe no more than sixteen
bytes of address information, a constraint implicit in RFC 2373
but not expressible in the grammar.

Characters in the

other

category are permitted wherever
RFC 2396 permits

escaped

octets, that is, in the
user-information, path, query, and fragment components, as well as in
the authority component if the authority is registry-based. This
allows URIs to contain Unicode characters beyond those in the US-ASCII
character set.

**Parameters:** str

- The string to be parsed into a URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

str

is

null
**Throws:** URISyntaxException

- If the given string violates RFC 2396, as augmented
by the above deviations

- URI

```java
public URI​(
String
scheme,

String
userInfo,

String
host,
int port,

String
path,

String
query,

String
fragment)
throws
URISyntaxException
```

Constructs a hierarchical URI from the given components.

If a scheme is given then the path, if also given, must either be
empty or begin with a slash character (

'/'

). Otherwise a
component of the new URI may be left undefined by passing

null

for the corresponding parameter or, in the case of the

port

parameter, by passing

-1

.

This constructor first builds a URI string from the given components
according to the rules specified in

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 7:

- Initially, the result string is empty.
- If a scheme is given then it is appended to the result,
followed by a colon character (

':'

).
- If user information, a host, or a port are given then the
string

"//"

is appended.
- If user information is given then it is appended, followed by
a commercial-at character (

'@'

). Any character not in the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

, or

other

categories is

quoted

.
- If a host is given then it is appended. If the host is a
literal IPv6 address but is not enclosed in square brackets
(

'['

and

']'

) then the square brackets are added.
- If a port number is given then a colon character
(

':'

) is appended, followed by the port number in decimal.
- If a path is given then it is appended. Any character not in
the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

, or

other

categories, and not equal to the slash character (

'/'

) or the
commercial-at character (

'@'

), is quoted.
- If a query is given then a question-mark character
(

'?'

) is appended, followed by the query. Any character that
is not a

legal URI character

is quoted.
- Finally, if a fragment is given then a hash character
(

'#'

) is appended, followed by the fragment. Any character
that is not a legal URI character is quoted.

The resulting URI string is then parsed as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor and then invoking the

parseServerAuthority()

method upon the result; this may cause a

URISyntaxException

to be thrown.

**Parameters:** scheme

- Scheme name

present but cannot be parsed as a server-based authority

- URI

```java
public URI​(

Constructs a hierarchical URI from the given components.

If a scheme is given then the path, if also given, must either be
empty or begin with a slash character (

.

This convenience constructor works as if by invoking the
seven-argument constructor as follows:

new

(scheme, null, host, -1, path, null, fragment);

**Parameters:** scheme

- Scheme name
**Parameters:** host

- Host name
**Parameters:** path

```

Constructs a URI from the given components.

A component may be left undefined by passing

null

.

This constructor first builds a URI in string form using the given
components as follows:

- Initially, the result string is empty.
- If a scheme is given then it is appended to the result,
followed by a colon character (

':'

).
- If a scheme-specific part is given then it is appended. Any
character that is not a

legal URI character

is

quoted

.
- Finally, if a fragment is given then a hash character
(

'#'

) is appended to the string, followed by the fragment.
Any character that is not a legal URI character is quoted.

The resulting URI string is then parsed in order to create the new
URI instance as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor;
this may cause a

URISyntaxException

to be thrown.

Method Detail

- create

```java
public static
URI
create​(
String
str)
```

Creates a URI by parsing the given string.

This convenience factory method works as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor; any

URISyntaxException

thrown by the
constructor is caught and wrapped in a new

IllegalArgumentException

object, which is then thrown.

This method is provided for use in situations where it is known that
the given string is a legal URI, for example for URI constants declared
within in a program, and so it would be considered a programming error
for the string not to parse as such. The constructors, which throw

URISyntaxException

directly, should be used situations where a
URI is being constructed from user input or from some other source that
may be prone to errors.

**Parameters:** str

- The string to be parsed into a URI
**Returns:** The new URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

str

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the given string violates RFC 2396

- parseServerAuthority

```java
public
URI
parseServerAuthority()
throws
URISyntaxException
```

Attempts to parse this URI's authority component, if defined, into
user-information, host, and port components.

If this URI's authority component has already been recognized as
being server-based then it will already have been parsed into
user-information, host, and port components. In this case, or if this
URI has no authority component, this method simply returns this URI.

Otherwise this method attempts once more to parse the authority
component into user-information, host, and port components, and throws
an exception describing why the authority component could not be parsed
in that way.

This method is provided because the generic URI syntax specified in

RFC 2396

cannot always distinguish a malformed server-based authority from a
legitimate registry-based authority. It must therefore treat some
instances of the former as instances of the latter. The authority
component in the URI string

"//foo:bar"

, for example, is not a
legal server-based authority but it is legal as a registry-based
authority.

In many common situations, for example when working URIs that are
known to be either URNs or URLs, the hierarchical URIs being used will
always be server-based. They therefore must either be parsed as such or
treated as an error. In these cases a statement such as

URI

u

= new URI(str).parseServerAuthority();

can be used to ensure that

u

always refers to a URI that, if
it has an authority component, has a server-based authority with proper
user-information, host, and port components. Invoking this method also
ensures that if the authority could not be parsed in that way then an
appropriate diagnostic message can be issued based upon the exception
that is thrown.

**Returns:** A URI whose authority field has been parsed
as a server-based authority
**Throws:** URISyntaxException

- If the authority component of this URI is defined
but cannot be parsed as a server-based authority
according to RFC 2396

- normalize

```java
public
URI
normalize()
```

Normalizes this URI's path.

If this URI is opaque, or if its path is already in normal form,
then this URI is returned. Otherwise a new URI is constructed that is
identical to this URI except that its path is computed by normalizing
this URI's path in a manner consistent with

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 6, sub-steps c through f; that is:

- All

"."

segments are removed.
- If a

".."

segment is preceded by a non-

".."

segment then both of these segments are removed. This step is
repeated until it is no longer applicable.
- If the path is relative, and if its first segment contains a
colon character (

':'

), then a

"."

segment is
prepended. This prevents a relative URI with a path such as

"a:b/c/d"

from later being re-parsed as an opaque URI with a
scheme of

"a"

and a scheme-specific part of

"b/c/d"

.

(Deviation from RFC 2396)

A normalized path will begin with one or more

".."

segments
if there were insufficient non-

".."

segments preceding them to
allow their removal. A normalized path will begin with a

"."

segment if one was inserted by step 3 above. Otherwise, a normalized
path will not contain any

"."

or

".."

segments.

**Returns:** A URI equivalent to this URI,
but whose path is in normal form

- resolve

```java
public
URI
resolve​(
URI
uri)
```

Resolves the given URI against this URI.

If the given URI is already absolute, or if this URI is opaque, then
the given URI is returned.

If the given URI's fragment component is
defined, its path component is empty, and its scheme, authority, and
query components are undefined, then a URI with the given fragment but
with all other components equal to those of this URI is returned. This
allows a URI representing a standalone fragment reference, such as

"#foo"

, to be usefully resolved against a base URI.

Otherwise this method constructs a new hierarchical URI in a manner
consistent with

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2; that is:

- A new URI is constructed with this URI's scheme and the given
URI's query and fragment components.
- If the given URI has an authority component then the new URI's
authority and path are taken from the given URI.
- Otherwise the new URI's authority component is copied from
this URI, and its path is computed as follows:

- If the given URI's path is absolute then the new URI's path
is taken from the given URI.
- Otherwise the given URI's path is relative, and so the new
URI's path is computed by resolving the path of the given URI
against the path of this URI. This is done by concatenating all but
the last segment of this URI's path, if any, with the given URI's
path and then normalizing the result as if by invoking the

normalize

method.

The result of this method is absolute if, and only if, either this
URI is absolute or the given URI is absolute.

**Parameters:** uri

- The URI to be resolved against this URI
**Returns:** The resulting URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

uri

is

null

- resolve

```java
public
URI
resolve​(
String
str)
```

Constructs a new URI by parsing the given string and then resolving it
against this URI.

This convenience method works as if invoking it were equivalent to
evaluating the expression

resolve

(URI.

create

(str))

.

**Parameters:** str

- The string to be parsed into a URI
**Returns:** The resulting URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

str

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the given string violates RFC 2396

- relativize

```java
public
URI
relativize​(
URI
uri)
```

Relativizes the given URI against this URI.

The relativization of the given URI against this URI is computed as
follows:

- If either this URI or the given URI are opaque, or if the
scheme and authority components of the two URIs are not identical, or
if the path of this URI is not a prefix of the path of the given URI,
then the given URI is returned.
- Otherwise a new relative hierarchical URI is constructed with
query and fragment components taken from the given URI and with a path
component computed by removing this URI's path from the beginning of
the given URI's path.

**Parameters:** uri

- The URI to be relativized against this URI
**Returns:** The resulting URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

uri

is

null

- toURL

```java
public
URL
toURL()
throws
MalformedURLException
```

Constructs a URL from this URI.

This convenience method works as if invoking it were equivalent to
evaluating the expression

new URL(this.toString())

after
first checking that this URI is absolute.

**Returns:** A URL constructed from this URI
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If this URL is not absolute
**Throws:** MalformedURLException

- If a protocol handler for the URL could not be found,
or if some other error occurred while constructing the URL

- getScheme

```java
public
String
getScheme()
```

Returns the scheme component of this URI.

The scheme component of a URI, if defined, only contains characters
in the

alphanum

category and in the string

"-.+"

. A
scheme always starts with an

alpha

character.

The scheme component of a URI cannot contain escaped octets, hence this
method does not perform any decoding.

**Returns:** The scheme component of this URI,
or

null

if the scheme is undefined

- isAbsolute

```java
public boolean isAbsolute()
```

Tells whether or not this URI is absolute.

A URI is absolute if, and only if, it has a scheme component.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this URI is absolute

- isOpaque

```java
public boolean isOpaque()
```

Tells whether or not this URI is opaque.

A URI is opaque if, and only if, it is absolute and its
scheme-specific part does not begin with a slash character ('/').
An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and possibly
a fragment; all other components are undefined.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this URI is opaque

- getRawSchemeSpecificPart

```java
public
String
getRawSchemeSpecificPart()
```

Returns the raw scheme-specific part of this URI. The scheme-specific
part is never undefined, though it may be empty.

The scheme-specific part of a URI only contains legal URI
characters.

**Returns:** The raw scheme-specific part of this URI
(never

null

)

- getSchemeSpecificPart

```java
public
String
getSchemeSpecificPart()
```

Returns the decoded scheme-specific part of this URI.

The string returned by this method is equal to that returned by the

getRawSchemeSpecificPart

method
except that all sequences of escaped octets are

decoded

.

**Returns:** The decoded scheme-specific part of this URI
(never

null

)

- getRawAuthority

```java
public
String
getRawAuthority()
```

Returns the raw authority component of this URI.

The authority component of a URI, if defined, only contains the
commercial-at character (

'@'

) and characters in the

unreserved

,

punct

,

escaped

and

']'

) and consisting of hexadecimal digits, colon characters
(

':'

), and possibly an embedded IPv4 address. The full
syntax of IPv6 addresses is specified in

.

The host component of a URI cannot contain escaped octets, hence this
method does not perform any decoding.

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
ob)
```

Tests this URI for equality with another object.

If the given object is not a URI then this method immediately
returns

false

.

For two URIs to be considered equal requires that either both are
opaque or both are hierarchical. Their schemes must either both be
undefined or else be equal without regard to case. Their fragments
must either both be undefined or else be equal.

For two opaque URIs to be considered equal, their scheme-specific
parts must be equal.

For two hierarchical URIs to be considered equal, their paths must
be equal and their queries must either both be undefined or else be
equal. Their authorities must either both be undefined, or both be
registry-based, or both be server-based. If their authorities are
defined and are registry-based, then they must be equal. If their
authorities are defined and are server-based, then their hosts must be
equal without regard to case, their port numbers must be equal, and
their user-information components must be equal.

When testing the user-information, path, query, fragment, authority,
or scheme-specific parts of two URIs for equality, the raw forms rather
than the encoded forms of these components are compared and the
hexadecimal digits of escaped octets are compared without regard to
case.

This method satisfies the general contract of the

Object.equals

method.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** ob

- The object to which this object is to be compared
**Returns:** true

if, and only if, the given object is a URI that
is identical to this URI
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns a hash-code value for this URI. The hash code is based upon all
of the URI's components, and satisfies the general contract of the

Object.hashCode

method.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** A hash-code value for this URI
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
URI
that)
```

Compares this URI to another object, which must be a URI.

When comparing corresponding components of two URIs, if one
component is undefined but the other is defined then the first is
considered to be less than the second. Unless otherwise noted, string
components are ordered according to their natural, case-sensitive
ordering as defined by the

String.compareTo

method. String components that are subject to
encoding are compared by comparing their raw forms rather than their
encoded forms.

The ordering of URIs is defined as follows:

- Two URIs with different schemes are ordered according the
ordering of their schemes, without regard to case.
- A hierarchical URI is considered to be less than an opaque URI
with an identical scheme.
- Two opaque URIs with identical schemes are ordered according
to the ordering of their scheme-specific parts.
- Two opaque URIs with identical schemes and scheme-specific
parts are ordered according to the ordering of their
fragments.
- Two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes are ordered
according to the ordering of their authority components:

- If both authority components are server-based then the URIs
are ordered according to their user-information components; if these
components are identical then the URIs are ordered according to the
ordering of their hosts, without regard to case; if the hosts are
identical then the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of
their ports.
- If one or both authority components are registry-based then
the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of their authority
components.
- Finally, two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes and
authority components are ordered according to the ordering of their
paths; if their paths are identical then they are ordered according to
the ordering of their queries; if the queries are identical then they
are ordered according to the order of their fragments.

This method satisfies the general contract of the

Comparable.compareTo

method.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

URI

>
**Parameters:** that

- The object to which this URI is to be compared
**Returns:** A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this URI is
less than, equal to, or greater than the given URI
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- If the given object is not a URI

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the content of this URI as a string.

If this URI was created by invoking one of the constructors in this
class then a string equivalent to the original input string, or to the
string computed from the originally-given components, as appropriate, is
returned. Otherwise this URI was created by normalization, resolution,
or relativization, and so a string is constructed from this URI's
components according to the rules specified in

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2, step 7.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** The string form of this URI

- toASCIIString

```java
public
String
toASCIIString()
```

Returns the content of this URI as a US-ASCII string.

If this URI does not contain any characters in the

other

category then an invocation of this method will return the same value as
an invocation of the

toString

method. Otherwise
this method works as if by invoking that method and then

encoding

the result.

**Returns:** The string form of this URI, encoded as needed
so that it only contains characters in the US-ASCII
charset

#### Method Detail

create

```java
public static
URI
create​(
String
str)
```

Creates a URI by parsing the given string.

This convenience factory method works as if by invoking the

URI(String)

constructor; any

URISyntaxException

thrown by the
constructor is caught and wrapped in a new

IllegalArgumentException

object, which is then thrown.

This method is provided for use in situations where it is known that
the given string is a legal URI, for example for URI constants declared
within in a program, and so it would be considered a programming error
for the string not to parse as such. The constructors, which throw

URISyntaxException

directly, should be used situations where a
URI is being constructed from user input or from some other source that
may be prone to errors.

**Parameters:** str

- The string to be parsed into a URI
**Returns:** The new URI
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

str

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the given string violates RFC 2396

parseServerAuthority

```java
public
URI
parseServerAuthority()
throws
URISyntaxException
```

Attempts to parse this URI's authority component, if defined, into
user-information, host, and port components.

If this URI's authority component has already been recognized as
being server-based then it will already have been parsed into
user-information, host, and port components. In this case, or if this
URI has no authority component, this method simply returns this URI.

Otherwise this method attempts once more to parse the authority
component into user-information, host, and port components, and throws
an exception describing why the authority component could not be parsed
in that way.

This method is provided because the generic URI syntax specified in

RFC 2396

cannot always distinguish a malformed server-based authority from a
legitimate registry-based authority. It must therefore treat some
instances of the former as instances of the latter. The authority
component in the URI string

"//foo:bar"

, for example, is not a
legal server-based authority but it is legal as a registry-based
authority.

In many common situations, for example when working URIs that are
known to be either URNs or URLs, the hierarchical URIs being used will
always be server-based. They therefore must either be parsed as such or
treated as an error. In these cases a statement such as

URI

u

= new URI(str).parseServerAuthority();

can be used to ensure that

u

always refers to a URI that, if
it has an authority component, has a server-based authority with proper
user-information, host, and port components. Invoking this method also
ensures that if the authority could not be parsed in that way then an
appropriate diagnostic message can be issued based upon the exception
that is thrown.

**Returns:** A URI whose authority field has been parsed
as a server-based authority
**Throws:** URISyntaxException

- If the authority component of this URI is defined
but cannot be parsed as a server-based authority

normalize

```java

normalize()
```

Normalizes this URI's path.

If this URI is opaque, or if its path is already in normal form,
then this URI is returned. Otherwise a new URI is constructed that is
identical to this URI except that its path is computed by normalizing
this URI's path in a manner consistent with

RFC 2396

section 5.2, step 6, sub-steps c through f; that is:

- All

"."

segments are removed.
- If a

".."

segment is preceded by a non-

".."

segment then both of these segments are removed. This step is
repeated until it is no longer applicable.
- If the path is relative, and if its first segment contains a
colon character (

resolve

```java

```

Resolves the given URI against this URI.

If the given URI is already absolute, or if this URI is opaque, then
the given URI is returned.

If the given URI's fragment component is
defined, its path component is empty, and its scheme, authority, and
query components are undefined, then a URI with the given fragment but
with all other components equal to those of this URI is returned. This
allows a URI representing a standalone fragment reference, such as

"#foo"

, to be usefully resolved against a base URI.

Otherwise this method constructs a new hierarchical URI in a manner
consistent with

RFC 2396

,
section 5.2; that is:

- A new URI is constructed with this URI's scheme and the given
URI's query and fragment components.
- If the given URI has an authority component then the new URI's
authority and path are taken from the given URI.
- Otherwise the new URI's authority component is copied from
this URI, and its path is computed as follows:

- If the given URI's path is absolute then the new URI's path
is taken from the given URI.
- Otherwise the given URI's path is relative, and so the new
URI's path is computed by resolving the path of the given URI
against the path of this URI. This is done by concatenating all but
the last segment of this URI's path, if any, with the given URI's
path and then normalizing the result as if by invoking the

normalize

method.

The result of this method is absolute if, and only if, either this

must either both be undefined or else be equal.

For two opaque URIs to be considered equal, their scheme-specific
parts must be equal.

For two hierarchical URIs to be considered equal, their paths must
be equal and their queries must either both be undefined or else be
equal. Their authorities must either both be undefined, or both be
registry-based, or both be server-based. If their authorities are
defined and are registry-based, then they must be equal. If their
authorities are defined and are server-based, then their hosts must be
equal without regard to case, their port numbers must be equal, and
their user-information components must be equal.

When testing the user-information, path, query, fragment, authority,
or scheme-specific parts of two URIs for equality, the raw forms rather
than the encoded forms of these components are compared and the
hexadecimal digits of escaped octets are compared without regard to
case.

compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
URI
that)
```

Compares this URI to another object, which must be a URI.

When comparing corresponding components of two URIs, if one
component is undefined but the other is defined then the first is
considered to be less than the second. Unless otherwise noted, string
components are ordered according to their natural, case-sensitive
ordering as defined by the

String.compareTo

method. String components that are subject to
encoding are compared by comparing their raw forms rather than their
encoded forms.

The ordering of URIs is defined as follows:

- Two URIs with different schemes are ordered according the
ordering of their schemes, without regard to case.
- A hierarchical URI is considered to be less than an opaque URI
with an identical scheme.
- Two opaque URIs with identical schemes are ordered according
to the ordering of their scheme-specific parts.
- Two opaque URIs with identical schemes and scheme-specific
parts are ordered according to the ordering of their
fragments.
- Two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes are ordered
according to the ordering of their authority components:

- If both authority components are server-based then the URIs
are ordered according to their user-information components; if these
components are identical then the URIs are ordered according to the
ordering of their hosts, without regard to case; if the hosts are
identical then the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of
their ports.
- If one or both authority components are registry-based then
the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of their authority
components.

authority components are ordered according to the ordering of their
paths; if their paths are identical then they are ordered according to
the ordering of their queries; if the queries are identical then they
are ordered according to the order of their fragments.
