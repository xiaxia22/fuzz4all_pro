# Class X500Principal

**Source:** `java.base\javax\security\auth\x500\X500Principal.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
X500Principal

extends
Object

implements
Principal
,
Serializable
```

This class represents an X.500

Principal

.

X500Principal

s are represented by distinguished names such as
"CN=Duke, OU=JavaSoft, O=Sun Microsystems, C=US".

This class can be instantiated by using a string representation
of the distinguished name, or by using the ASN.1 DER encoded byte
representation of the distinguished name. The current specification
for the string representation of a distinguished name is defined in

RFC 2253: Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (v3): UTF-8 String Representation of
Distinguished Names

. This class, however, accepts string formats from
both RFC 2253 and

RFC 1779:
A String Representation of Distinguished Names

, and also recognizes
attribute type keywords whose OIDs (Object Identifiers) are defined in

RFC 5280: Internet X.509
Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile

.

The string representation for this

X500Principal

can be obtained by calling the

getName

methods.

Note that the

getSubjectX500Principal

and

getIssuerX500Principal

methods of

X509Certificate

return X500Principals representing the
issuer and subject fields of the certificate.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

### Constructor Details

#### public X500Principal​(
String
name)

Creates an

X500Principal

from a string representation of
an X.500 distinguished name (ex:
"CN=Duke, OU=JavaSoft, O=Sun Microsystems, C=US").
The distinguished name must be specified using the grammar defined in
RFC 1779 or RFC 2253 (either format is acceptable).

This constructor recognizes the attribute type keywords
defined in RFC 1779 and RFC 2253
(and listed in

getName(String format)

),
as well as the T, DNQ or DNQUALIFIER, SURNAME, GIVENNAME, INITIALS,
GENERATION, EMAILADDRESS, and SERIALNUMBER keywords whose Object
Identifiers (OIDs) are defined in RFC 5280.
Any other attribute type must be specified as an OID.

This implementation enforces a more restrictive OID syntax than
defined in RFC 1779 and 2253. It uses the more correct syntax defined in

RFC 4512

, which
specifies that OIDs contain at least 2 digits:

numericoid = number 1*( DOT number )

**Parameters:**
- name

- an X.500 distinguished name in RFC 1779 or RFC 2253 format

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the

name

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the

name

is improperly specified

---

#### public X500Principal​(
String
name,

Map
<
String
,​
String
> keywordMap)

Creates an

X500Principal

from a string representation of
an X.500 distinguished name (ex:
"CN=Duke, OU=JavaSoft, O=Sun Microsystems, C=US").
The distinguished name must be specified using the grammar defined in
RFC 1779 or RFC 2253 (either format is acceptable).

This constructor recognizes the attribute type keywords specified
in

X500Principal(String)

and also recognizes additional
keywords that have entries in the

keywordMap

parameter.
Keyword entries in the keywordMap take precedence over the default
keywords recognized by

X500Principal(String)

. Keywords
MUST be specified in all upper-case, otherwise they will be ignored.
Improperly specified keywords are ignored; however if a keyword in the
name maps to an improperly specified Object Identifier (OID), an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown. It is permissible to
have 2 different keywords that map to the same OID.

This implementation enforces a more restrictive OID syntax than
defined in RFC 1779 and 2253. It uses the more correct syntax defined in

RFC 4512

, which
specifies that OIDs contain at least 2 digits:

numericoid = number 1*( DOT number )

**Parameters:**
- name

- an X.500 distinguished name in RFC 1779 or RFC 2253 format
- keywordMap

- an attribute type keyword map, where each key is a
keyword String that maps to a corresponding object identifier in String
form (a sequence of nonnegative integers separated by periods). The map
may be empty but never

null

.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

name

or

keywordMap

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the

name

is
improperly specified or a keyword in the

name

maps to an
OID that is not in the correct form

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public X500Principal​(byte[] name)

Creates an

X500Principal

from a distinguished name in
ASN.1 DER encoded form. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is as
follows.

```java
Name ::= CHOICE {
RDNSequence }

RDNSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedName

RelativeDistinguishedName ::=
SET SIZE (1 .. MAX) OF AttributeTypeAndValue

AttributeTypeAndValue ::= SEQUENCE {
type AttributeType,
value AttributeValue }

AttributeType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

AttributeValue ::= ANY DEFINED BY AttributeType
....
DirectoryString ::= CHOICE {
teletexString TeletexString (SIZE (1..MAX)),
printableString PrintableString (SIZE (1..MAX)),
universalString UniversalString (SIZE (1..MAX)),
utf8String UTF8String (SIZE (1.. MAX)),
bmpString BMPString (SIZE (1..MAX)) }
```

**Parameters:**
- name

- a byte array containing the distinguished name in ASN.1
DER encoded form

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if an encoding error occurs
(incorrect form for DN)

---

#### public X500Principal​(
InputStream
is)

Creates an

X500Principal

from an

InputStream

containing the distinguished name in ASN.1 DER encoded form.
The ASN.1 notation for this structure is supplied in the
documentation for

X500Principal(byte[] name)

.

The read position of the input stream is positioned
to the next available byte after the encoded distinguished name.

**Parameters:**
- is

- an

InputStream

containing the distinguished
name in ASN.1 DER encoded form

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the

InputStream

is

null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if an encoding error occurs
(incorrect form for DN)

---

### Method Details

#### public
String
getName()

Returns a string representation of the X.500 distinguished name using
the format defined in RFC 2253.

This method is equivalent to calling

getName(X500Principal.RFC2253)

.

**Specified by:**
- getName

in interface

Principal

**Returns:**
- the distinguished name of this

X500Principal

---

#### public
String
getName​(
String
format)

Returns a string representation of the X.500 distinguished name
using the specified format. Valid values for the format are
"RFC1779", "RFC2253", and "CANONICAL" (case insensitive).

If "RFC1779" is specified as the format,
this method emits the attribute type keywords defined in
RFC 1779 (CN, L, ST, O, OU, C, STREET).
Any other attribute type is emitted as an OID.

If "RFC2253" is specified as the format,
this method emits the attribute type keywords defined in
RFC 2253 (CN, L, ST, O, OU, C, STREET, DC, UID).
Any other attribute type is emitted as an OID.
Under a strict reading, RFC 2253 only specifies a UTF-8 string
representation. The String returned by this method is the
Unicode string achieved by decoding this UTF-8 representation.

If "CANONICAL" is specified as the format,
this method returns an RFC 2253 conformant string representation
with the following additional canonicalizations:

- Leading zeros are removed from attribute types
that are encoded as dotted decimal OIDs

DirectoryString attribute values of type
PrintableString and UTF8String are not
output in hexadecimal format

DirectoryString attribute values of types
other than PrintableString and UTF8String
are output in hexadecimal format

Leading and trailing white space characters
are removed from non-hexadecimal attribute values
(unless the value consists entirely of white space characters)

Internal substrings of one or more white space characters are
converted to a single space in non-hexadecimal
attribute values

Relative Distinguished Names containing more than one
Attribute Value Assertion (AVA) are output in the
following order: an alphabetical ordering of AVAs
containing standard keywords, followed by a numeric
ordering of AVAs containing OID keywords.

The only characters in attribute values that are escaped are
those which section 2.4 of RFC 2253 states must be escaped
(they are escaped using a preceding backslash character)

The entire name is converted to upper case
using

String.toUpperCase(Locale.US)

The entire name is converted to lower case
using

String.toLowerCase(Locale.US)

The name is finally normalized using normalization form KD,
as described in the Unicode Standard and UAX #15

Additional standard formats may be introduced in the future.

**Parameters:**
- format

- the format to use

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this

X500Principal

using the specified format

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified format is invalid
or null

---

#### public
String
getName​(
String
format,

Map
<
String
,​
String
> oidMap)

Returns a string representation of the X.500 distinguished name
using the specified format. Valid values for the format are
"RFC1779" and "RFC2253" (case insensitive). "CANONICAL" is not
permitted and an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

This method returns Strings in the format as specified in

getName(String)

and also emits additional attribute type
keywords for OIDs that have entries in the

oidMap

parameter. OID entries in the oidMap take precedence over the default
OIDs recognized by

getName(String)

.
Improperly specified OIDs are ignored; however if an OID
in the name maps to an improperly specified keyword, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

Additional standard formats may be introduced in the future.

Warning: additional attribute type keywords may not be recognized
by other implementations; therefore do not use this method if
you are unsure if these keywords will be recognized by other
implementations.

**Parameters:**
- format

- the format to use
- oidMap

- an OID map, where each key is an object identifier in
String form (a sequence of nonnegative integers separated by periods)
that maps to a corresponding attribute type keyword String.
The map may be empty but never

null

.

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this

X500Principal

using the specified format

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified format is invalid,
null, or an OID in the name maps to an improperly specified keyword
- NullPointerException

- if

oidMap

is

null

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public byte[] getEncoded()

Returns the distinguished name in ASN.1 DER encoded form. The ASN.1
notation for this structure is supplied in the documentation for

X500Principal(byte[] name)

.

Note that the byte array returned is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Returns:**
- a byte array containing the distinguished name in ASN.1 DER
encoded form

---

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getName

```java
public
String
getName()
```

Returns a string representation of the X.500 distinguished name using
the format defined in RFC 2253.

This method is equivalent to calling

getName(X500Principal.RFC2253)

.

**Specified by:** getName

in interface

Principal
**Returns:** the distinguished name of this

X500Principal

- getName

```java
public
String
getName​(
String
format)
```

Returns a string representation of the X.500 distinguished name
using the specified format. Valid values for the format are
"RFC1779", "RFC2253", and "CANONICAL" (case insensitive).

If "RFC1779" is specified as the format,
this method emits the attribute type keywords defined in
RFC 1779 (CN, L, ST, O, OU, C, STREET).
Any other attribute type is emitted as an OID.

If "RFC2253" is specified as the format,
this method emits the attribute type keywords defined in
RFC 2253 (CN, L, ST, O, OU, C, STREET, DC, UID).
Any other attribute type is emitted as an OID.
Under a strict reading, RFC 2253 only specifies a UTF-8 string
representation. The String returned by this method is the
Unicode string achieved by decoding this UTF-8 representation.

If "CANONICAL" is specified as the format,
this method returns an RFC 2253 conformant string representation
with the following additional canonicalizations:

- Leading zeros are removed from attribute types
that are encoded as dotted decimal OIDs

DirectoryString attribute values of type
PrintableString and UTF8String are not
output in hexadecimal format

DirectoryString attribute values of types
other than PrintableString and UTF8String
are output in hexadecimal format

Leading and trailing white space characters
are removed from non-hexadecimal attribute values
(unless the value consists entirely of white space characters)

Internal substrings of one or more white space characters are
converted to a single space in non-hexadecimal
attribute values

Relative Distinguished Names containing more than one
Attribute Value Assertion (AVA) are output in the
following order: an alphabetical ordering of AVAs
containing standard keywords, followed by a numeric
ordering of AVAs containing OID keywords.

The only characters in attribute values that are escaped are
those which section 2.4 of RFC 2253 states must be escaped
(they are escaped using a preceding backslash character)

The entire name is converted to upper case
using

String.toUpperCase(Locale.US)

The entire name is converted to lower case
using

String.toLowerCase(Locale.US)

The name is finally normalized using normalization form KD,
as described in the Unicode Standard and UAX #15

Additional standard formats may be introduced in the future.

**Parameters:** format

- the format to use
**Returns:** a string representation of this

X500Principal

using the specified format
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified format is invalid
or null

- getName

```java
public
String
getName​(
String
format,

Map
<
String
,​
String
> oidMap)
```

Returns a string representation of the X.500 distinguished name
using the specified format. Valid values for the format are
"RFC1779" and "RFC2253" (case insensitive). "CANONICAL" is not
permitted and an

IllegalArgumentException

will be thrown.

This method returns Strings in the format as specified in

getName(String)

and also emits additional attribute type
keywords for OIDs that have entries in the

oidMap

parameter. OID entries in the oidMap take precedence over the default
OIDs recognized by

getName(String)

.
Improperly specified OIDs are ignored; however if an OID
in the name maps to an improperly specified keyword, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

Additional standard formats may be introduced in the future.

Warning: additional attribute type keywords may not be recognized
by other implementations; therefore do not use this method if
you are unsure if these keywords will be recognized by other
implementations.

**Parameters:** format

- the format to use
**Parameters:** oidMap

- an OID map, where each key is an object identifier in
String form (a sequence of nonnegative integers separated by periods)
that maps to a corresponding attribute type keyword String.
The map may be empty but never

null

.
**Returns:** a string representation of this

X500Principal

using the specified format
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified format is invalid,
null, or an OID in the name maps to an improperly specified keyword
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

oidMap

is

null
**Since:** 1.6

- getEncoded

```java
public byte[] getEncoded()
```

Returns the distinguished name in ASN.1 DER encoded form. The ASN.1
notation for this structure is supplied in the documentation for

X500Principal(byte[] name)

subsequent modifications.

**Returns:** a byte array containing the distinguished name in ASN.1 DER
encoded form

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Return a user-friendly string representation of this

X500Principal

Specifically, this method returns

true

if
the

Object

o

is an

X500Principal

and if the respective canonical string representations
(obtained via the

getName(X500Principal.CANONICAL)

method)
of this object and

o

are equal.

This implementation is compliant with the requirements of RFC 5280.

**Specified by:** equals

Method Detail

- getName

```java
public
String
getName()
```

Returns a string representation of the X.500 distinguished name using
the format defined in RFC 2253.

This method is equivalent to calling

getName(X500Principal.RFC2253)

.

**Specified by:** getName

in interface

Principal
**Returns:** the distinguished name of this

X500Principal

- getName

```java
public
String
getName​(
String
format)
```

Returns a string representation of the X.500 distinguished name
using the specified format. Valid values for the format are
"RFC1779", "RFC2253", and "CANONICAL" (case insensitive).

If "RFC1779" is specified as the format,
this method emits the attribute type keywords defined in
RFC 1779 (CN, L, ST, O, OU, C, STREET).
Any other attribute type is emitted as an OID.

If "RFC2253" is specified as the format,
this method emits the attribute type keywords defined in
RFC 2253 (CN, L, ST, O, OU, C, STREET, DC, UID).
Any other attribute type is emitted as an OID.
Under a strict reading, RFC 2253 only specifies a UTF-8 string
representation. The String returned by this method is the
Unicode string achieved by decoding this UTF-8 representation.

If "CANONICAL" is specified as the format,
this method returns an RFC 2253 conformant string representation
with the following additional canonicalizations:

- Leading zeros are removed from attribute types
that are encoded as dotted decimal OIDs

DirectoryString attribute values of type
PrintableString and UTF8String are not
output in hexadecimal format

DirectoryString attribute values of types
other than PrintableString and UTF8String
are output in hexadecimal format

Leading and trailing white space characters
are removed from non-hexadecimal attribute values
(unless the value consists entirely of white space characters)

Internal substrings of one or more white space characters are
converted to a single space in non-hexadecimal
attribute values

Relative Distinguished Names containing more than one
Attribute Value Assertion (AVA) are output in the
following order: an alphabetical ordering of AVAs
containing standard keywords, followed by a numeric
ordering of AVAs containing OID keywords.

The only characters in attribute values that are escaped are
those which section 2.4 of RFC 2253 states must be escaped
(they are escaped using a preceding backslash character)

The entire name is converted to upper case
using

String.toUpperCase(Locale.US)

The entire name is converted to lower case
using

String.toLowerCase(Locale.US)

The name is finally normalized using normalization form KD,
as described in the Unicode Standard and UAX #15

Additional standard formats may be introduced in the future.

**Parameters:** format

.

getName

```java
public
String
getName​(
String
format)
```

Returns a string representation of the X.500 distinguished name
using the specified format. Valid values for the format are
"RFC1779", "RFC2253", and "CANONICAL" (case insensitive).

If "RFC1779" is specified as the format,
this method emits the attribute type keywords defined in
RFC 1779 (CN, L, ST, O, OU, C, STREET).
Any other attribute type is emitted as an OID.

If "RFC2253" is specified as the format,
this method emits the attribute type keywords defined in
RFC 2253 (CN, L, ST, O, OU, C, STREET, DC, UID).
Any other attribute type is emitted as an OID.
Under a strict reading, RFC 2253 only specifies a UTF-8 string
representation. The String returned by this method is the
Unicode string achieved by decoding this UTF-8 representation.

If "CANONICAL" is specified as the format,
this method returns an RFC 2253 conformant string representation
with the following additional canonicalizations:

- Leading zeros are removed from attribute types
that are encoded as dotted decimal OIDs

DirectoryString attribute values of type
PrintableString and UTF8String are not
output in hexadecimal format

DirectoryString attribute values of types
other than PrintableString and UTF8String
are output in hexadecimal format

Leading and trailing white space characters
are removed from non-hexadecimal attribute values
(unless the value consists entirely of white space characters)

Internal substrings of one or more white space characters are
converted to a single space in non-hexadecimal
attribute values

Relative Distinguished Names containing more than one
Attribute Value Assertion (AVA) are output in the
following order: an alphabetical ordering of AVAs
containing standard keywords, followed by a numeric
ordering of AVAs containing OID keywords.

The only characters in attribute values that are escaped are
those which section 2.4 of RFC 2253 states must be escaped
(they are escaped using a preceding backslash character)

The entire name is converted to upper case
using

String.toUpperCase(Locale.US)

The entire name is converted to lower case
using

String.toLowerCase(Locale.US)

The name is finally normalized using normalization form KD,
as described in the Unicode Standard and UAX #15

Additional standard formats may be introduced in the future.

**Parameters:** format

- the format to use
**Returns:** a string representation of this

X500Principal

using the specified format
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified format is invalid
or null
