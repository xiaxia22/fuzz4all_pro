# Class ConcurrentLinkedDeque<E>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\concurrent\ConcurrentLinkedDeque.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ConcurrentLinkedDeque<E>

extends
AbstractCollection
<E>
implements
Deque
<E>,
Serializable
```

An unbounded concurrent

deque

based on linked nodes.
Concurrent insertion, removal, and access operations execute safely
across multiple threads.
A

ConcurrentLinkedDeque

is an appropriate choice when
many threads will share access to a common collection.
Like most other concurrent collection implementations, this class
does not permit the use of

null

elements.

Iterators and spliterators are

weakly consistent

.

Beware that, unlike in most collections, the

size

method
is

NOT

a constant-time operation. Because of the
asynchronous nature of these deques, determining the current number
of elements requires a traversal of the elements, and so may report
inaccurate results if this collection is modified during traversal.

Bulk operations that add, remove, or examine multiple elements,
such as

addAll(java.util.Collection<? extends E>)

,

removeIf(java.util.function.Predicate<? super E>)

or

forEach(java.util.function.Consumer<? super E>)

,
are

not

guaranteed to be performed atomically.
For example, a

forEach

traversal concurrent with an

addAll

operation might observe only some of the added elements.

This class and its iterator implement all of the

optional

methods of the

Deque

and

Iterator

interfaces.

Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections,
actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a

ConcurrentLinkedDeque

happen-before

actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
the

ConcurrentLinkedDeque

in another thread.

This class is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

**Type Parameters:** E

- the type of elements held in this deque

#### public int size()

Returns the number of elements in this deque. If this deque
contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, it
returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is

NOT

a constant-time operation. Because of the
asynchronous nature of these deques, determining the current
number of elements requires traversing them all to count them.
Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during
execution of this method, in which case the returned result
will be inaccurate. Thus, this method is typically not very
useful in concurrent applications.

e

such that

o.equals(e)

(if such an element exists).
Returns

true

if this deque contained the specified element
(or equivalently, if this deque changed as a result of the call).

Collection
<? extends
E
> c)

this deque, in the order that they are returned by the specified
collection's iterator. Attempts to

addAll

of a deque to
itself result in

IllegalArgumentException

.

---

#### public
Object
[] toArray()

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque, in
proper sequence (from first to last element).

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this deque. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this deque

---

#### public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque,
in proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime
type of the returned array is that of the specified array. If
the deque fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of
the specified array and the size of this deque.

If this deque fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this deque), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as
bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs. Further,
this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the
output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to
save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a deque known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the deque into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- a

- the array into which the elements of the deque are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this deque

**Throws:**
- ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this deque
- NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection

---

#### public
Iterator
<
E

Returns the number of elements in this deque. If this deque
contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, it
returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is

NOT

a constant-time operation. Because of the
asynchronous nature of these deques, determining the current
number of elements requires traversing them all to count them.
Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during
execution of this method, in which case the returned result
will be inaccurate. Thus, this method is typically not very
useful in concurrent applications.

If the deque does not contain the element, it is unchanged.
More formally, removes the first element

e

such that

o.equals(e)

(if such an element exists).
Returns

true

if this deque contained the specified element

Appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of
this deque, in the order that they are returned by the specified
collection's iterator. Attempts to

addAll

of a deque to
itself result in

IllegalArgumentException

.

- toArray

```java
public
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque, in
proper sequence (from first to last element).

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this deque. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Overrides:** toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this deque

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque,
in proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime
type of the returned array is that of the specified array. If
the deque fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of
the specified array and the size of this deque.

If this deque fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this deque), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as
bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs. Further,
this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the
output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to
save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a deque known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the deque into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

Collection

<

**Overrides:** toArray

AbstractCollection

<

**Type Parameters:** T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection
**Parameters:** a

- the array into which the elements of the deque are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this deque
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this deque
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

- iterator

```java
public
Iterator
<
E
> iterator()
```

Returns an iterator over the elements in this deque in proper sequence.
The elements will be returned in order from first (head) to last (tail).

The returned iterator is

weakly consistent

.

reports

Spliterator.CONCURRENT

,

Spliterator.ORDERED

, and

Spliterator.NONNULL

.

Returns the number of elements in this deque. If this deque
contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, it
returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is

NOT

a constant-time operation. Because of the
asynchronous nature of these deques, determining the current
number of elements requires traversing them all to count them.
Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during
execution of this method, in which case the returned result
will be inaccurate. Thus, this method is typically not very
useful in concurrent applications.

- toArray

```java
public
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque, in
proper sequence (from first to last element).

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this deque. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:** toArray

Collection

**Overrides:** toArray

<

**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this deque

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque,
in proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime
type of the returned array is that of the specified array. If
the deque fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of
the specified array and the size of this deque.

If this deque fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this deque), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to

null

.

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as
bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs. Further,
this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the
output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to
save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a deque known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the deque into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Type Parameters:** T

be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this deque
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this deque
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

- iterator

```java
public
Iterator
<
E

```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque,
in proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime
type of the returned array is that of the specified array. If
the deque fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of
the specified array and the size of this deque.

If this deque fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than this deque), the element in
the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to
