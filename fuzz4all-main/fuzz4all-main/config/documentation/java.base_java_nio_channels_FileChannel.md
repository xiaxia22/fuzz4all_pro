# Class FileChannel

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\channels\FileChannel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
FileChannel

extends
AbstractInterruptibleChannel

implements
SeekableByteChannel
,
GatheringByteChannel
,
ScatteringByteChannel
```

A channel for reading, writing, mapping, and manipulating a file.

A file channel is a

SeekableByteChannel

that is connected to
a file. It has a current

position

within its file which can
be both

queried

and

modified

. The file itself contains a variable-length sequence
of bytes that can be read and written and whose current

size

can be queried. The size of the file increases
when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size of the file
decreases when it is

truncated

. The
file may also have some associated

metadata

such as access
permissions, content type, and last-modification time; this class does not
define methods for metadata access.

In addition to the familiar read, write, and close operations of byte
channels, this class defines the following file-specific operations:

- Bytes may be

read

or

written

at an absolute
position in a file in a way that does not affect the channel's current
position.
- A region of a file may be

mapped

directly into memory; for large files this is often much more efficient
than invoking the usual

read

or

write

methods.
- Updates made to a file may be

forced
out

to the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not
lost in the event of a system crash.
- Bytes can be transferred from a file

to
some other channel

, and

vice
versa

, in a way that can be optimized by many operating systems
into a very fast transfer directly to or from the filesystem cache.
- A region of a file may be

locked

against access by other programs.

File channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The

close

method may be invoked at any time, as specified
by the

Channel

interface. Only one operation that involves the
channel's position or can change its file's size may be in progress at any
given time; attempts to initiate a second such operation while the first is
still in progress will block until the first operation completes. Other
operations, in particular those that take an explicit position, may proceed
concurrently; whether they in fact do so is dependent upon the underlying
implementation and is therefore unspecified.

The view of a file provided by an instance of this class is guaranteed
to be consistent with other views of the same file provided by other
instances in the same program. The view provided by an instance of this
class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views seen by other
concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by the underlying
operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem protocols. This
is true regardless of the language in which these other programs are
written, and whether they are running on the same machine or on some other
machine. The exact nature of any such inconsistencies are system-dependent
and are therefore unspecified.

A file channel is created by invoking one of the

open

methods defined by this class. A file channel can also be obtained from an
existing

FileInputStream

,

FileOutputStream

, or

RandomAccessFile

object by invoking
that object's

getChannel

method, which returns a file channel that
is connected to the same underlying file. Where the file channel is obtained
from an existing stream or random access file then the state of the file
channel is intimately connected to that of the object whose

getChannel

method returned the channel. Changing the channel's position, whether
explicitly or by reading or writing bytes, will change the file position of
the originating object, and vice versa. Changing the file's length via the
file channel will change the length seen via the originating object, and vice
versa. Changing the file's content by writing bytes will change the content
seen by the originating object, and vice versa.

At various points this class specifies that an
instance that is "open for reading," "open for writing," or "open for
reading and writing" is required. A channel obtained via the

getChannel

method of a

FileInputStream

instance will be open for reading. A channel
obtained via the

getChannel

method of a

FileOutputStream

instance will be open for
writing. Finally, a channel obtained via the

getChannel

method of a

RandomAccessFile

instance will be open for reading if the instance
was created with mode

"r"

and will be open for reading and writing
if the instance was created with mode

"rw"

.

A file channel that is open for writing may be in

append mode

, for example if it was obtained from a file-output stream
that was created by invoking the

FileOutputStream(File,boolean)

constructor and passing

true

for
the second parameter. In this mode each invocation of a relative write
operation first advances the position to the end of the file and then writes
the requested data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing
of the data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified.

### Method Details

#### public static
FileChannel
open​(
Path
path,

Set
<? extends
OpenOption
> options,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException

Opens or creates a file, returning a file channel to access the file.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
The

READ

and

WRITE

options determine if the file should be opened for reading and/or
writing. If neither option (or the

APPEND

option) is contained in the array then the file is opened for reading.
By default reading or writing commences at the beginning of the file.

In the addition to

READ

and

WRITE

, the following
options may be present:

additional options

Option

Description

APPEND

If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
each invocation of the channel's

write

method first advances
the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
with the

READ

or

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

options.

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
for reading.

CREATE_NEW

If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
the file already exists. When creating a file the check for the
existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This option is
ignored when the file is opened only for reading.

CREATE

If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it
exists, otherwise a new file is created. When creating a file the check
for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does
not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This
option is ignored if the

CREATE_NEW

option is also present or
the file is opened only for reading.

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

When this option is present then the implementation makes a

best effort

attempt to delete the file when closed by
the

close

method. If the

close

method is not
invoked then a

best effort

attempt is made to delete the file
when the Java virtual machine terminates.

SPARSE

When creating a new file this option is a

hint

that the
new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
a new file.

SYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

DSYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

An implementation may also support additional options.

The

attrs

parameter is an optional array of file

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the file.

The new channel is created by invoking the

newFileChannel

method on the
provider that created the

Path

.

**Parameters:**
- path

- The path of the file to open or create
- options

- Options specifying how the file is opened
- attrs

- An optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file

**Returns:**
- A new file channel

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the set contains an invalid combination of options
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If the

path

is associated with a provider that does not
support creating file channels, or an unsupported open option is
specified, or the array contains an attribute that cannot be set
atomically when creating the file
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- If a security manager is installed and it denies an
unspecified permission required by the implementation.
In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to check
read access if the file is opened for reading. The

SecurityManager.checkWrite(String)

method is invoked to check
write access if the file is opened for writing

**Since:**
- 1.7

#### public static
FileChannel
open​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException

fc.
open
(file, opts, new FileAttribute<?>[0]);
```

where

opts

is a set of the options specified in the

options

array.

**Parameters:**
- path

path

is associated with a provider that does not
support creating file channels, or an unsupported open option is
specified
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- SecurityException

- If a security manager is installed and it denies an
unspecified permission required by the implementation.
In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to check
read access if the file is opened for reading. The

SecurityManager.checkWrite(String)

method is invoked to check
write access if the file is opened for writing

**Since:**
- 1.7

#### public abstract long position()
throws
IOException

Returns this channel's file position.

**Specified by:**
- position

in interface

SeekableByteChannel

**Returns:**
- This channel's file position,
a non-negative integer counting the number of bytes
from the beginning of the file to the current position

---

#### public abstract
FileChannel
position​(long newPosition)
throws
IOException

Sets this channel's file position.

Setting the position to a value that is greater than the file's
current size is legal but does not change the size of the file. A later
attempt to read bytes at such a position will immediately return an
end-of-file indication. A later attempt to write bytes at such a
position will cause the file to be grown to accommodate the new bytes;
the values of any bytes between the previous end-of-file and the
newly-written bytes are unspecified.

**Specified by:**
- position

in interface

SeekableByteChannel

**Parameters:**
- newPosition

- The new position, a non-negative integer counting
the number of bytes from the beginning of the file

**Returns:**
- This file channel

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the new position is negative
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract long size()
throws
IOException

Returns the current size of this channel's file.

**Specified by:**
- size

in interface

SeekableByteChannel

**Returns:**
- The current size of this channel's file,
measured in bytes

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract
FileChannel
truncate​(long size)
throws
IOException

Truncates this channel's file to the given size.

If the given size is less than the file's current size then the file
is truncated, discarding any bytes beyond the new end of the file. If
the given size is greater than or equal to the file's current size then
the file is not modified. In either case, if this channel's file
position is greater than the given size then it is set to that size.

**Specified by:**
- truncate

in interface

SeekableByteChannel

**Parameters:**
- size

- The new size, a non-negative byte count

**Returns:**
- This file channel

**Throws:**
- NonWritableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for writing
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the new size is negative
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract void force​(boolean metaData)
throws
IOException

Forces any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage
device that contains it.

If this channel's file resides on a local storage device then when
this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file
since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked,
will have been written to that device. This is useful for ensuring that
critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash.

If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
is made.

The

metaData

parameter can be used to limit the number of
I/O operations that this method is required to perform. Passing

false

for this parameter indicates that only updates to the
file's content need be written to storage; passing

true

indicates that updates to both the file's content and metadata must be
written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation.
Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the
underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified.

Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the
channel was only opened for reading. Some operating systems, for
example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and
this time is updated whenever the file is read. Whether or not this is
actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified.

This method is only guaranteed to force changes that were made to
this channel's file via the methods defined in this class. It may or
may not force changes that were made by modifying the content of a

mapped byte buffer

obtained by
invoking the

map

method. Invoking the

force

method of the mapped byte buffer will
force changes made to the buffer's content to be written.

**Parameters:**
- metaData

- If

true

then this method is required to force changes
to both the file's content and metadata to be written to
storage; otherwise, it need only force content changes to be
written

**Throws:**
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract long transferTo​(long position,
long count,

WritableByteChannel
target)
throws
IOException

Transfers bytes from this channel's file to the given writable byte
channel.

An attempt is made to read up to

count

bytes starting at
the given

position

in this channel's file and write them to the
target channel. An invocation of this method may or may not transfer
all of the requested bytes; whether or not it does so depends upon the
natures and states of the channels. Fewer than the requested number of
bytes are transferred if this channel's file contains fewer than

count

bytes starting at the given

position

, or if the
target channel is non-blocking and it has fewer than

count

bytes free in its output buffer.

This method does not modify this channel's position. If the given
position is greater than the file's current size then no bytes are
transferred. If the target channel has a position then bytes are
written starting at that position and then the position is incremented
by the number of bytes written.

This method is potentially much more efficient than a simple loop
that reads from this channel and writes to the target channel. Many
operating systems can transfer bytes directly from the filesystem cache
to the target channel without actually copying them.

**Parameters:**
- position

- The position within the file at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
- count

- The maximum number of bytes to be transferred; must be
non-negative
- target

- The target channel

**Returns:**
- The number of bytes, possibly zero,
that were actually transferred

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
- NonReadableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for reading
- NonWritableChannelException

- If the target channel was not opened for writing
- ClosedChannelException

- If either this channel or the target channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes either channel
while the transfer is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread while the
transfer is in progress, thereby closing both channels and
setting the current thread's interrupt status
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract long transferFrom​(
ReadableByteChannel
src,
long position,
long count)
throws
IOException

Transfers bytes into this channel's file from the given readable byte
channel.

An attempt is made to read up to

count

bytes from the
source channel and write them to this channel's file starting at the
given

position

. An invocation of this method may or may not
transfer all of the requested bytes; whether or not it does so depends
upon the natures and states of the channels. Fewer than the requested
number of bytes will be transferred if the source channel has fewer than

count

bytes remaining, or if the source channel is non-blocking
and has fewer than

count

bytes immediately available in its
input buffer.

This method does not modify this channel's position. If the given
position is greater than the file's current size then no bytes are
transferred. If the source channel has a position then bytes are read
starting at that position and then the position is incremented by the
number of bytes read.

This method is potentially much more efficient than a simple loop
that reads from the source channel and writes to this channel. Many
operating systems can transfer bytes directly from the source channel
into the filesystem cache without actually copying them.

**Parameters:**
- src

- The source channel
- position

- The position within the file at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
- count

- The maximum number of bytes to be transferred; must be
non-negative

**Returns:**
- The number of bytes, possibly zero,
that were actually transferred

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
- NonReadableChannelException

- If the source channel was not opened for reading
- NonWritableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for writing
- ClosedChannelException

- If either this channel or the source channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes either channel
while the transfer is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread while the
transfer is in progress, thereby closing both channels and
setting the current thread's interrupt status
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract int read​(
ByteBuffer
dst,
long position)
throws
IOException

Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer,
starting at the given file position.

This method works in the same manner as the

read(ByteBuffer)

method, except that bytes are read starting at the
given file position rather than at the channel's current position. This
method does not modify this channel's position. If the given position
is greater than the file's current size then no bytes are read.

**Parameters:**
- dst

- The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
- position

- The file position at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative

**Returns:**
- The number of bytes read, possibly zero, or

-1

if the
given position is greater than or equal to the file's current
size

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the position is negative
- NonReadableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for reading
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### public abstract int write​(
ByteBuffer
src,
long position)
throws
IOException

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer,
starting at the given file position.

This method works in the same manner as the

write(ByteBuffer)

method, except that bytes are written starting at
the given file position rather than at the channel's current position.
This method does not modify this channel's position. If the given
position is greater than the file's current size then the file will be
grown to accommodate the new bytes; the values of any bytes between the
previous end-of-file and the newly-written bytes are unspecified.

**Parameters:**
- src

- The buffer from which bytes are to be transferred
- position

- The file position at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative

**Returns:**
- The number of bytes written, possibly zero

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the position is negative
- NonWritableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for writing
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the write operation is in progress
- ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the write operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

#### public abstract
MappedByteBuffer
map​(
FileChannel.MapMode
mode,
long position,
long size)
throws
IOException

Maps a region of this channel's file directly into memory.

A region of a file may be mapped into memory in one of three modes:

- Read-only:

Any attempt to modify the resulting buffer
will cause a

ReadOnlyBufferException

to be thrown.
(

MapMode.READ_ONLY

)
- Read/write:

Changes made to the resulting buffer will
eventually be propagated to the file; they may or may not be made
visible to other programs that have mapped the same file. (

MapMode.READ_WRITE

)
- Private:

Changes made to the resulting buffer will not
be propagated to the file and will not be visible to other programs
that have mapped the same file; instead, they will cause private
copies of the modified portions of the buffer to be created. (

MapMode.PRIVATE

)

For a read-only mapping, this channel must have been opened for
reading; for a read/write or private mapping, this channel must have
been opened for both reading and writing.

The

mapped byte buffer

returned by this method will have a position of zero and a limit and
capacity of

size

; its mark will be undefined. The buffer and
the mapping that it represents will remain valid until the buffer itself
is garbage-collected.

A mapping, once established, is not dependent upon the file channel
that was used to create it. Closing the channel, in particular, has no
effect upon the validity of the mapping.

Many of the details of memory-mapped files are inherently dependent
upon the underlying operating system and are therefore unspecified. The
behavior of this method when the requested region is not completely
contained within this channel's file is unspecified. Whether changes
made to the content or size of the underlying file, by this program or
another, are propagated to the buffer is unspecified. The rate at which
changes to the buffer are propagated to the file is unspecified.

For most operating systems, mapping a file into memory is more
expensive than reading or writing a few tens of kilobytes of data via
the usual

read

and

write

methods. From the
standpoint of performance it is generally only worth mapping relatively
large files into memory.

**Parameters:**
- mode

- One of the constants

READ_ONLY

,

READ_WRITE

, or

PRIVATE

defined in the

FileChannel.MapMode

class, according to
whether the file is to be mapped read-only, read/write, or
privately (copy-on-write), respectively
- position

- The position within the file at which the mapped region
is to start; must be non-negative
- size

- The size of the region to be mapped; must be non-negative and
no greater than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

**Returns:**
- The mapped byte buffer

**Throws:**
- NonReadableChannelException

- If the

mode

is

READ_ONLY

but
this channel was not opened for reading
- NonWritableChannelException

- If the

mode

is

or

PRIVATE

but this channel was not opened
for both reading and writing
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
- IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

FileLock
lock​(long position,
long size,
boolean shared)
throws
IOException

Acquires a lock on the given region of this channel's file.

An invocation of this method will block until the region can be
locked, this channel is closed, or the invoking thread is interrupted,
whichever comes first.

If this channel is closed by another thread during an invocation of
this method then an

AsynchronousCloseException

will be thrown.

If the invoking thread is interrupted while waiting to acquire the
lock then its interrupt status will be set and a

FileLockInterruptionException

will be thrown. If the invoker's
interrupt status is set when this method is invoked then that exception
will be thrown immediately; the thread's interrupt status will not be
changed.

The region specified by the

position

and

size

parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
underlying file. Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
expected maximum size of the file, should be locked. The zero-argument

lock()

method simply locks a region of size

Long.MAX_VALUE

.

Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
an exclusive lock. Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's

isShared

method.

File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
threads within the same virtual machine.

**Parameters:**
- position

- The position at which the locked region is to start; must be
non-negative
- size

- The size of the locked region; must be non-negative, and the sum

position

+

size

must be non-negative
- shared

-

true

to request a shared lock, in which case this
channel must be open for reading (and possibly writing);

false

to request an exclusive lock, in which case this
channel must be open for writing (and possibly reading)

**Returns:**
- A lock object representing the newly-acquired lock

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
- ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
- AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel while the invoking
thread is blocked in this method
- FileLockInterruptionException

- If the invoking thread is interrupted while blocked in this
method
- OverlappingFileLockException

- If a lock that overlaps the requested region is already held by
this Java virtual machine, or if another thread is already
blocked in this method and is attempting to lock an overlapping
region

A channel for reading, writing, mapping, and manipulating a file.

A file channel is a

SeekableByteChannel

that is connected to
a file. It has a current

position

within its file which can
be both

queried

and

modified

. The file itself contains a variable-length sequence
of bytes that can be read and written and whose current

size

can be queried. The size of the file increases
when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size of the file
decreases when it is

truncated

. The
file may also have some associated

metadata

such as access
permissions, content type, and last-modification time; this class does not
define methods for metadata access.

In addition to the familiar read, write, and close operations of byte
channels, this class defines the following file-specific operations:

- Bytes may be

read

or

written

at an absolute
position in a file in a way that does not affect the channel's current
position.
- A region of a file may be

mapped

directly into memory; for large files this is often much more efficient
than invoking the usual

read

or

write

methods.
- Updates made to a file may be

forced
out

to the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not
lost in the event of a system crash.
- Bytes can be transferred from a file

to
some other channel

, and

vice
versa

, in a way that can be optimized by many operating systems
into a very fast transfer directly to or from the filesystem cache.
- A region of a file may be

locked

against access by other programs.

File channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The

close

method may be invoked at any time, as specified
by the

Channel

interface. Only one operation that involves the
channel's position or can change its file's size may be in progress at any
given time; attempts to initiate a second such operation while the first is
still in progress will block until the first operation completes. Other
operations, in particular those that take an explicit position, may proceed
concurrently; whether they in fact do so is dependent upon the underlying
implementation and is therefore unspecified.

The view of a file provided by an instance of this class is guaranteed
to be consistent with other views of the same file provided by other
instances in the same program. The view provided by an instance of this
class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views seen by other
concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by the underlying
operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem protocols. This
is true regardless of the language in which these other programs are
written, and whether they are running on the same machine or on some other
machine. The exact nature of any such inconsistencies are system-dependent
and are therefore unspecified.

A file channel is created by invoking one of the

open

methods defined by this class. A file channel can also be obtained from an
existing

FileInputStream

,

FileOutputStream

, or

RandomAccessFile

object by invoking
that object's

getChannel

method, which returns a file channel that
is connected to the same underlying file. Where the file channel is obtained
from an existing stream or random access file then the state of the file
channel is intimately connected to that of the object whose

getChannel

method returned the channel. Changing the channel's position, whether
explicitly or by reading or writing bytes, will change the file position of
the originating object, and vice versa. Changing the file's length via the
file channel will change the length seen via the originating object, and vice
versa. Changing the file's content by writing bytes will change the content
seen by the originating object, and vice versa.

At various points this class specifies that an
instance that is "open for reading," "open for writing," or "open for
reading and writing" is required. A channel obtained via the

getChannel

method of a

FileInputStream

instance will be open for reading. A channel
obtained via the

getChannel

method of a

FileOutputStream

instance will be open for
writing. Finally, a channel obtained via the

getChannel

method of a

RandomAccessFile

instance will be open for reading if the instance
was created with mode

"r"

and will be open for reading and writing
if the instance was created with mode

"rw"

.

A file channel that is open for writing may be in

append mode

, for example if it was obtained from a file-output stream
that was created by invoking the

FileOutputStream(File,boolean)

constructor and passing

true

for
the second parameter. In this mode each invocation of a relative write
operation first advances the position to the end of the file and then writes
the requested data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing
of the data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified.

versa. Changing the file's content by writing bytes will change the content
seen by the originating object, and vice versa.

At various points this class specifies that an
instance that is "open for reading," "open for writing," or "open for
reading and writing" is required. A channel obtained via the

getChannel

method of a

FileInputStream

instance will be open for reading. A channel
obtained via the

getChannel

method of a

FileOutputStream

instance will be open for
writing. Finally, a channel obtained via the

getChannel

method of a

RandomAccessFile

instance will be open for reading if the instance
was created with mode

"r"

and will be open for reading and writing
if the instance was created with mode

"rw"

.

A file channel that is open for writing may be in

append mode

, for example if it was obtained from a file-output stream
that was created by invoking the

FileOutputStream(File,boolean)

constructor and passing

true

for
the second parameter. In this mode each invocation of a relative write
operation first advances the position to the end of the file and then writes
the requested data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing
of the data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified.

A file channel is created by invoking one of the

open

methods defined by this class. A file channel can also be obtained from an
existing

FileInputStream

,

FileOutputStream

, or

RandomAccessFile

object by invoking
that object's

getChannel

method, which returns a file channel that
is connected to the same underlying file. Where the file channel is obtained
from an existing stream or random access file then the state of the file
channel is intimately connected to that of the object whose

getChannel

method returned the channel. Changing the channel's position, whether
explicitly or by reading or writing bytes, will change the file position of
the originating object, and vice versa. Changing the file's length via the
file channel will change the length seen via the originating object, and vice
versa. Changing the file's content by writing bytes will change the content
seen by the originating object, and vice versa.

```java
protected FileChannel()
```

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- open

```java
public static
FileChannel
open​(
Path
path,

Set
<? extends
OpenOption
> options,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning a file channel to access the file.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
The

READ

and

WRITE

options determine if the file should be opened for reading and/or
writing. If neither option (or the

APPEND

option) is contained in the array then the file is opened for reading.
By default reading or writing commences at the beginning of the file.

In the addition to

READ

and

WRITE

, the following
options may be present:

additional options

Option

Description

APPEND

If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
each invocation of the channel's

write

method first advances
the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
with the

READ

or

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

options.

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
for reading.

CREATE_NEW

If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
the file already exists. When creating a file the check for the
existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This option is
ignored when the file is opened only for reading.

CREATE

If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it
exists, otherwise a new file is created. When creating a file the check
for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does
not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This
option is ignored if the

CREATE_NEW

option is also present or
the file is opened only for reading.

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

When this option is present then the implementation makes a

best effort

attempt to delete the file when closed by
the

close

method. If the

close

method is not
invoked then a

best effort

attempt is made to delete the file
when the Java virtual machine terminates.

SPARSE

When creating a new file this option is a

hint

that the
new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
a new file.

SYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

DSYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

An implementation may also support additional options.

The

attrs

parameter is an optional array of file

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the file.

The new channel is created by invoking the

newFileChannel

method on the
provider that created the

Path

.

**Parameters:** path

- The path of the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- Options specifying how the file is opened
**Parameters:** attrs

- An optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file
**Returns:** A new file channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the set contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the

path

is associated with a provider that does not
support creating file channels, or an unsupported open option is
specified, or the array contains an attribute that cannot be set
atomically when creating the file
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is installed and it denies an
unspecified permission required by the implementation.
In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to check
read access if the file is opened for reading. The

SecurityManager.checkWrite(String)

method is invoked to check
write access if the file is opened for writing
**Since:** 1.7

- open

```java
public static
FileChannel
open​(
Path
path,

OpenOption
... options)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning a file channel to access the file.

An invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same way as the
invocation

```java
fc.
open
(file, opts, new FileAttribute<?>[0]);
```

where

opts

is a set of the options specified in the

options

array.

**Parameters:** path

- The path of the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- Options specifying how the file is opened
**Returns:** A new file channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the set contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the

path

is associated with a provider that does not
support creating file channels, or an unsupported open option is
specified
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is installed and it denies an
unspecified permission required by the implementation.
In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to check
read access if the file is opened for reading. The

SecurityManager.checkWrite(String)

method is invoked to check
write access if the file is opened for writing
**Since:** 1.7

Truncates this channel's file to the given size.

If the given size is less than the file's current size then the file
is truncated, discarding any bytes beyond the new end of the file. If
the given size is greater than or equal to the file's current size then
the file is not modified. In either case, if this channel's file
position is greater than the given size then it is set to that size.

**Specified by:** truncate

in interface

SeekableByteChannel
**Parameters:** size

- The new size, a non-negative byte count
**Returns:** This file channel
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for writing
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the new size is negative
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- force

```java
public abstract void force​(boolean metaData)
throws
IOException
```

Forces any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage
device that contains it.

If this channel's file resides on a local storage device then when
this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file
since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked,
will have been written to that device. This is useful for ensuring that
critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash.

If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
is made.

The

metaData

parameter can be used to limit the number of
I/O operations that this method is required to perform. Passing

false

for this parameter indicates that only updates to the
file's content need be written to storage; passing

true

indicates that updates to both the file's content and metadata must be
written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation.
Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the
underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified.

Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the
channel was only opened for reading. Some operating systems, for
example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and
this time is updated whenever the file is read. Whether or not this is
actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified.

This method is only guaranteed to force changes that were made to
this channel's file via the methods defined in this class. It may or
may not force changes that were made by modifying the content of a

mapped byte buffer

obtained by
invoking the

map

method. Invoking the

force

method of the mapped byte buffer will
force changes made to the buffer's content to be written.

**Parameters:** metaData

- If

true

then this method is required to force changes
to both the file's content and metadata to be written to
storage; otherwise, it need only force content changes to be
written
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- transferTo

```java
public abstract long transferTo​(long position,
long count,

WritableByteChannel
target)
throws
IOException
```

Transfers bytes from this channel's file to the given writable byte
channel.

An attempt is made to read up to

count

bytes starting at
the given

position

in this channel's file and write them to the
target channel. An invocation of this method may or may not transfer
all of the requested bytes; whether or not it does so depends upon the
natures and states of the channels. Fewer than the requested number of
bytes are transferred if this channel's file contains fewer than

count

bytes starting at the given

position

, or if the
target channel is non-blocking and it has fewer than

count

bytes free in its output buffer.

This method does not modify this channel's position. If the given
position is greater than the file's current size then no bytes are
transferred. If the target channel has a position then bytes are
written starting at that position and then the position is incremented
by the number of bytes written.

This method is potentially much more efficient than a simple loop
that reads from this channel and writes to the target channel. Many
operating systems can transfer bytes directly from the filesystem cache
to the target channel without actually copying them.

**Parameters:** position

- The position within the file at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
**Parameters:** count

- The maximum number of bytes to be transferred; must be
non-negative
**Parameters:** target

- The target channel
**Returns:** The number of bytes, possibly zero,
that were actually transferred
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If the target channel was not opened for writing
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If either this channel or the target channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes either channel
while the transfer is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread while the
transfer is in progress, thereby closing both channels and
setting the current thread's interrupt status
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- transferFrom

```java
public abstract long transferFrom​(
ReadableByteChannel
src,
long position,
long count)
throws
IOException
```

Transfers bytes into this channel's file from the given readable byte
channel.

An attempt is made to read up to

count

bytes from the
source channel and write them to this channel's file starting at the
given

position

. An invocation of this method may or may not
transfer all of the requested bytes; whether or not it does so depends
upon the natures and states of the channels. Fewer than the requested
number of bytes will be transferred if the source channel has fewer than

count

bytes remaining, or if the source channel is non-blocking
and has fewer than

count

bytes immediately available in its
input buffer.

This method does not modify this channel's position. If the given
position is greater than the file's current size then no bytes are
transferred. If the source channel has a position then bytes are read
starting at that position and then the position is incremented by the
number of bytes read.

This method is potentially much more efficient than a simple loop
that reads from the source channel and writes to this channel. Many
operating systems can transfer bytes directly from the source channel
into the filesystem cache without actually copying them.

**Parameters:** src

- The source channel
**Parameters:** position

- The position within the file at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
**Parameters:** count

- The maximum number of bytes to be transferred; must be
non-negative
**Returns:** The number of bytes, possibly zero,
that were actually transferred
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If the source channel was not opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for writing
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If either this channel or the source channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes either channel
while the transfer is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread while the
transfer is in progress, thereby closing both channels and
setting the current thread's interrupt status
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- read

```java
public abstract int read​(
ByteBuffer
dst,
long position)
throws
IOException
```

Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer,
starting at the given file position.

This method works in the same manner as the

read(ByteBuffer)

method, except that bytes are read starting at the
given file position rather than at the channel's current position. This
method does not modify this channel's position. If the given position
is greater than the file's current size then no bytes are read.

**Parameters:** dst

- The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** position

- The file position at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
**Returns:** The number of bytes read, possibly zero, or

-1

if the
given position is greater than or equal to the file's current
size
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the position is negative
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for reading
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- write

```java
public abstract int write​(
ByteBuffer
src,
long position)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer,
starting at the given file position.

This method works in the same manner as the

write(ByteBuffer)

method, except that bytes are written starting at
the given file position rather than at the channel's current position.
This method does not modify this channel's position. If the given
position is greater than the file's current size then the file will be
grown to accommodate the new bytes; the values of any bytes between the
previous end-of-file and the newly-written bytes are unspecified.

**Parameters:** src

- The buffer from which bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** position

- The file position at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
**Returns:** The number of bytes written, possibly zero
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the position is negative
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for writing
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the write operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the write operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- map

```java
public abstract
MappedByteBuffer
map​(
FileChannel.MapMode
mode,
long position,
long size)
throws
IOException
```

Maps a region of this channel's file directly into memory.

A region of a file may be mapped into memory in one of three modes:

- Read-only:

Any attempt to modify the resulting buffer
will cause a

ReadOnlyBufferException

to be thrown.
(

MapMode.READ_ONLY

)
- Read/write:

Changes made to the resulting buffer will
eventually be propagated to the file; they may or may not be made
visible to other programs that have mapped the same file. (

MapMode.READ_WRITE

)
- Private:

Changes made to the resulting buffer will not
be propagated to the file and will not be visible to other programs
that have mapped the same file; instead, they will cause private
copies of the modified portions of the buffer to be created. (

MapMode.PRIVATE

)

For a read-only mapping, this channel must have been opened for
reading; for a read/write or private mapping, this channel must have
been opened for both reading and writing.

The

mapped byte buffer

returned by this method will have a position of zero and a limit and
capacity of

size

; its mark will be undefined. The buffer and
the mapping that it represents will remain valid until the buffer itself
is garbage-collected.

A mapping, once established, is not dependent upon the file channel
that was used to create it. Closing the channel, in particular, has no
effect upon the validity of the mapping.

Many of the details of memory-mapped files are inherently dependent
upon the underlying operating system and are therefore unspecified. The
behavior of this method when the requested region is not completely
contained within this channel's file is unspecified. Whether changes
made to the content or size of the underlying file, by this program or
another, are propagated to the buffer is unspecified. The rate at which
changes to the buffer are propagated to the file is unspecified.

For most operating systems, mapping a file into memory is more
expensive than reading or writing a few tens of kilobytes of data via
the usual

read

and

write

methods. From the
standpoint of performance it is generally only worth mapping relatively
large files into memory.

**Parameters:** mode

- One of the constants

READ_ONLY

,

READ_WRITE

, or

PRIVATE

defined in the

FileChannel.MapMode

class, according to
whether the file is to be mapped read-only, read/write, or
privately (copy-on-write), respectively
**Parameters:** position

- The position within the file at which the mapped region
is to start; must be non-negative
**Parameters:** size

- The size of the region to be mapped; must be non-negative and
no greater than

Integer.MAX_VALUE
**Returns:** The mapped byte buffer
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If the

mode

is

READ_ONLY

but
this channel was not opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If the

mode

is

READ_WRITE

or

PRIVATE

but this channel was not opened
for both reading and writing
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

MappedByteBuffer

- lock

```java
public abstract
FileLock
lock​(long position,
long size,
boolean shared)
throws
IOException
```

Acquires a lock on the given region of this channel's file.

An invocation of this method will block until the region can be
locked, this channel is closed, or the invoking thread is interrupted,
whichever comes first.

If this channel is closed by another thread during an invocation of
this method then an

AsynchronousCloseException

will be thrown.

If the invoking thread is interrupted while waiting to acquire the
lock then its interrupt status will be set and a

FileLockInterruptionException

will be thrown. If the invoker's
interrupt status is set when this method is invoked then that exception
will be thrown immediately; the thread's interrupt status will not be
changed.

The region specified by the

position

and

size

parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
underlying file. Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
expected maximum size of the file, should be locked. The zero-argument

lock()

method simply locks a region of size

Long.MAX_VALUE

.

Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
an exclusive lock. Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's

isShared

method.

File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
threads within the same virtual machine.

**Parameters:** position

- The position at which the locked region is to start; must be
non-negative
**Parameters:** size

- The size of the locked region; must be non-negative, and the sum

position

+

size

must be non-negative
**Parameters:** shared

-

true

to request a shared lock, in which case this
channel must be open for reading (and possibly writing);

false

to request an exclusive lock, in which case this
channel must be open for writing (and possibly reading)
**Returns:** A lock object representing the newly-acquired lock
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel while the invoking
thread is blocked in this method
**Throws:** FileLockInterruptionException

- If the invoking thread is interrupted while blocked in this
method
**Throws:** OverlappingFileLockException

- If a lock that overlaps the requested region is already held by
this Java virtual machine, or if another thread is already
blocked in this method and is attempting to lock an overlapping
region
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If

shared

is

true

this channel was not
opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If

shared

is

false

but this channel was not
opened for writing

An invocation of this method of the form

fc.lock()

behaves
in exactly the same way as the invocation

thread is blocked in this method
**Throws:** FileLockInterruptionException

- If the invoking thread is interrupted while blocked in this
method
**Throws:** OverlappingFileLockException

this Java virtual machine, or if another thread is already
blocked in this method and is attempting to lock an overlapping
region of the same file

```java
public abstract
FileLock
tryLock​(long position,

throws
IOException
```

Attempts to acquire a lock on the given region of this channel's file.

This method does not block. An invocation always returns
immediately, either having acquired a lock on the requested region or
having failed to do so. If it fails to acquire a lock because an
overlapping lock is held by another program then it returns

null

. If it fails to acquire a lock for any other reason then
an appropriate exception is thrown.

The region specified by the

position

and

size

parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
underlying file. Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
expected maximum size of the file, should be locked. The zero-argument

tryLock()

method simply locks a region of size

Long.MAX_VALUE

.

Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
an exclusive lock. Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's

isShared

method.

File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
threads within the same virtual machine.

Method Detail

- open

```java
public static
FileChannel
open​(
Path
path,

Set
<? extends
OpenOption
> options,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning a file channel to access the file.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
The

READ

and

WRITE

options determine if the file should be opened for reading and/or
writing. If neither option (or the

APPEND

option) is contained in the array then the file is opened for reading.
By default reading or writing commences at the beginning of the file.

In the addition to

READ

and

WRITE

, the following
options may be present:

additional options

Option

Description

APPEND

If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
each invocation of the channel's

write

method first advances
the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
with the

READ

or

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

options.

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
for reading.

CREATE_NEW

If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
the file already exists. When creating a file the check for the
existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This option is
ignored when the file is opened only for reading.

CREATE

If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it
exists, otherwise a new file is created. When creating a file the check
for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does
not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This
option is ignored if the

CREATE_NEW

option is also present or
the file is opened only for reading.

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

When this option is present then the implementation makes a

best effort

attempt to delete the file when closed by
the

close

method. If the

close

method is not
invoked then a

best effort

attempt is made to delete the file
when the Java virtual machine terminates.

SPARSE

When creating a new file this option is a

hint

that the
new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
a new file.

SYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

DSYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

An implementation may also support additional options.

The

attrs

parameter is an optional array of file

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the file.

The new channel is created by invoking the

newFileChannel

method on the
provider that created the

Path

.

**Parameters:** path

- The path of the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- Options specifying how the file is opened
**Parameters:** attrs

- An optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file
**Returns:** A new file channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the set contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the

path

is associated with a provider that does not
support creating file channels, or an unsupported open option is
specified, or the array contains an attribute that cannot be set
atomically when creating the file
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is installed and it denies an
unspecified permission required by the implementation.
In the case of the default provider, the

SecurityManager.checkRead(String)

method is invoked to check
read access if the file is opened for reading. The

SecurityManager.checkWrite(String)

method is invoked to check
write access if the file is opened for writing
**Since:** 1.7

- open

```java
public static
FileChannel
open​(

```

where

opts

is a set of the options specified in the

options

array.

**Parameters:** path

- The path of the file to open or create

Bytes are written starting at this channel's current file position
unless the channel is in append mode, in which case the position is
first advanced to the end of the file. The file is grown, if necessary,
to accommodate the written bytes, and then the file position is updated
with the number of bytes actually written. Otherwise this method
behaves exactly as specified by the

WritableByteChannel

interface.

which bytes are to be retrieved; must be non-negative and no
larger than

srcs.length
**Parameters:** length

- The maximum number of buffers to be accessed; must be
non-negative and no larger than

```

Returns this channel's file position.

**Specified by:** position

in interface

SeekableByteChannel
**Returns:** This channel's file position,
a non-negative integer counting the number of bytes

- position

```java
public abstract
FileChannel
position​(long newPosition)
throws
IOException
```

Sets this channel's file position.

Setting the position to a value that is greater than the file's
current size is legal but does not change the size of the file. A later
attempt to read bytes at such a position will immediately return an
end-of-file indication. A later attempt to write bytes at such a
position will cause the file to be grown to accommodate the new bytes;
the values of any bytes between the previous end-of-file and the
newly-written bytes are unspecified.

**Specified by:** position

**Parameters:** newPosition

- The new position, a non-negative integer counting
the number of bytes from the beginning of the file
**Returns:** This file channel
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the new position is negative
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- size

```java
public abstract long size()
throws

```

Returns the current size of this channel's file.

**Specified by:** size

in interface

SeekableByteChannel
**Returns:** The current size of this channel's file,

- truncate

```java
public abstract
FileChannel
truncate​(long size)
throws
IOException
```

Truncates this channel's file to the given size.

If the given size is less than the file's current size then the file
is truncated, discarding any bytes beyond the new end of the file. If
the given size is greater than or equal to the file's current size then
the file is not modified. In either case, if this channel's file
position is greater than the given size then it is set to that size.

**Specified by:** truncate

in interface

SeekableByteChannel
**Parameters:** size

- The new size, a non-negative byte count
**Returns:** This file channel
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for writing
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the new size is negative
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- force

```java
public abstract void force​(boolean metaData)
throws
IOException
```

Forces any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage
device that contains it.

If this channel's file resides on a local storage device then when
this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file
since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked,
will have been written to that device. This is useful for ensuring that
critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash.

If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
is made.

The

metaData

parameter can be used to limit the number of
I/O operations that this method is required to perform. Passing

false

for this parameter indicates that only updates to the
file's content need be written to storage; passing

true

indicates that updates to both the file's content and metadata must be
written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation.
Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the
underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified.

Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the
channel was only opened for reading. Some operating systems, for
example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and
this time is updated whenever the file is read. Whether or not this is
actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified.

This method is only guaranteed to force changes that were made to
this channel's file via the methods defined in this class. It may or
may not force changes that were made by modifying the content of a

mapped byte buffer

obtained by
invoking the

map

method. Invoking the

force

method of the mapped byte buffer will
force changes made to the buffer's content to be written.

**Parameters:** metaData

- If

true

then this method is required to force changes
to both the file's content and metadata to be written to
storage; otherwise, it need only force content changes to be
written
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- transferTo

```java
public abstract long transferTo​(long position,
long count,

WritableByteChannel
target)
throws
IOException
```

Transfers bytes from this channel's file to the given writable byte
channel.

An attempt is made to read up to

count

bytes starting at
the given

position

in this channel's file and write them to the
target channel. An invocation of this method may or may not transfer
all of the requested bytes; whether or not it does so depends upon the
natures and states of the channels. Fewer than the requested number of
bytes are transferred if this channel's file contains fewer than

count

bytes starting at the given

position

, or if the
target channel is non-blocking and it has fewer than

count

bytes free in its output buffer.

This method does not modify this channel's position. If the given
position is greater than the file's current size then no bytes are
transferred. If the target channel has a position then bytes are
written starting at that position and then the position is incremented
by the number of bytes written.

This method is potentially much more efficient than a simple loop
that reads from this channel and writes to the target channel. Many
operating systems can transfer bytes directly from the filesystem cache
to the target channel without actually copying them.

**Parameters:** position

- The position within the file at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
**Parameters:** count

- The maximum number of bytes to be transferred; must be
non-negative
**Parameters:** target

- The target channel
**Returns:** The number of bytes, possibly zero,
that were actually transferred
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If the target channel was not opened for writing
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If either this channel or the target channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes either channel
while the transfer is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread while the
transfer is in progress, thereby closing both channels and
setting the current thread's interrupt status
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- transferFrom

```java
public abstract long transferFrom​(
ReadableByteChannel
src,
long position,
long count)
throws
IOException
```

Transfers bytes into this channel's file from the given readable byte
channel.

An attempt is made to read up to

count

bytes from the
source channel and write them to this channel's file starting at the
given

position

. An invocation of this method may or may not
transfer all of the requested bytes; whether or not it does so depends
upon the natures and states of the channels. Fewer than the requested
number of bytes will be transferred if the source channel has fewer than

count

bytes remaining, or if the source channel is non-blocking
and has fewer than

count

bytes immediately available in its
input buffer.

This method does not modify this channel's position. If the given
position is greater than the file's current size then no bytes are
transferred. If the source channel has a position then bytes are read
starting at that position and then the position is incremented by the
number of bytes read.

This method is potentially much more efficient than a simple loop
that reads from the source channel and writes to this channel. Many
operating systems can transfer bytes directly from the source channel
into the filesystem cache without actually copying them.

**Parameters:** src

- The source channel
**Parameters:** position

- The position within the file at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
**Parameters:** count

- The maximum number of bytes to be transferred; must be
non-negative
**Returns:** The number of bytes, possibly zero,
that were actually transferred
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If the source channel was not opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for writing
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If either this channel or the source channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes either channel
while the transfer is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread while the
transfer is in progress, thereby closing both channels and
setting the current thread's interrupt status
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- read

```java
public abstract int read​(
ByteBuffer
dst,
long position)
throws
IOException
```

Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer,
starting at the given file position.

This method works in the same manner as the

read(ByteBuffer)

method, except that bytes are read starting at the
given file position rather than at the channel's current position. This
method does not modify this channel's position. If the given position
is greater than the file's current size then no bytes are read.

**Parameters:** dst

- The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** position

- The file position at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
**Returns:** The number of bytes read, possibly zero, or

-1

if the
given position is greater than or equal to the file's current
size
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the position is negative
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for reading
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the read operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the read operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- write

```java
public abstract int write​(
ByteBuffer
src,
long position)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer,
starting at the given file position.

This method works in the same manner as the

write(ByteBuffer)

method, except that bytes are written starting at
the given file position rather than at the channel's current position.
This method does not modify this channel's position. If the given
position is greater than the file's current size then the file will be
grown to accommodate the new bytes; the values of any bytes between the
previous end-of-file and the newly-written bytes are unspecified.

**Parameters:** src

- The buffer from which bytes are to be transferred
**Parameters:** position

- The file position at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
**Returns:** The number of bytes written, possibly zero
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the position is negative
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for writing
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel
while the write operation is in progress
**Throws:** ClosedByInterruptException

- If another thread interrupts the current thread
while the write operation is in progress, thereby
closing the channel and setting the current thread's
interrupt status
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

- map

```java
public abstract
MappedByteBuffer
map​(
FileChannel.MapMode
mode,
long position,
long size)
throws
IOException
```

Maps a region of this channel's file directly into memory.

A region of a file may be mapped into memory in one of three modes:

- Read-only:

Any attempt to modify the resulting buffer
will cause a

ReadOnlyBufferException

to be thrown.
(

MapMode.READ_ONLY

)
- Read/write:

Changes made to the resulting buffer will
eventually be propagated to the file; they may or may not be made
visible to other programs that have mapped the same file. (

MapMode.READ_WRITE

)
- Private:

Changes made to the resulting buffer will not
be propagated to the file and will not be visible to other programs
that have mapped the same file; instead, they will cause private
copies of the modified portions of the buffer to be created. (

MapMode.PRIVATE

)

For a read-only mapping, this channel must have been opened for
reading; for a read/write or private mapping, this channel must have
been opened for both reading and writing.

The

mapped byte buffer

returned by this method will have a position of zero and a limit and
capacity of

size

; its mark will be undefined. The buffer and
the mapping that it represents will remain valid until the buffer itself
is garbage-collected.

A mapping, once established, is not dependent upon the file channel
that was used to create it. Closing the channel, in particular, has no
effect upon the validity of the mapping.

Many of the details of memory-mapped files are inherently dependent
upon the underlying operating system and are therefore unspecified. The
behavior of this method when the requested region is not completely
contained within this channel's file is unspecified. Whether changes
made to the content or size of the underlying file, by this program or
another, are propagated to the buffer is unspecified. The rate at which
changes to the buffer are propagated to the file is unspecified.

For most operating systems, mapping a file into memory is more
expensive than reading or writing a few tens of kilobytes of data via
the usual

read

and

write

methods. From the
standpoint of performance it is generally only worth mapping relatively
large files into memory.

**Parameters:** mode

- One of the constants

READ_ONLY

,

READ_WRITE

, or

PRIVATE

defined in the

FileChannel.MapMode

class, according to
whether the file is to be mapped read-only, read/write, or
privately (copy-on-write), respectively
**Parameters:** position

- The position within the file at which the mapped region
is to start; must be non-negative
**Parameters:** size

- The size of the region to be mapped; must be non-negative and
no greater than

Integer.MAX_VALUE
**Returns:** The mapped byte buffer
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If the

mode

is

READ_ONLY

but
this channel was not opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If the

mode

is

READ_WRITE

or

PRIVATE

but this channel was not opened
for both reading and writing
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
**See Also:** FileChannel.MapMode

,

MappedByteBuffer

- lock

```java
public abstract
FileLock
lock​(long position,
long size,
boolean shared)
throws
IOException
```

Acquires a lock on the given region of this channel's file.

An invocation of this method will block until the region can be
locked, this channel is closed, or the invoking thread is interrupted,
whichever comes first.

If this channel is closed by another thread during an invocation of
this method then an

AsynchronousCloseException

will be thrown.

If the invoking thread is interrupted while waiting to acquire the
lock then its interrupt status will be set and a

FileLockInterruptionException

will be thrown. If the invoker's
interrupt status is set when this method is invoked then that exception
will be thrown immediately; the thread's interrupt status will not be
changed.

The region specified by the

position

and

size

parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
underlying file. Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
expected maximum size of the file, should be locked. The zero-argument

lock()

method simply locks a region of size

Long.MAX_VALUE

.

Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
an exclusive lock. Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's

isShared

method.

File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
threads within the same virtual machine.

**Parameters:** position

- The position at which the locked region is to start; must be
non-negative
**Parameters:** size

- The size of the locked region; must be non-negative, and the sum

position

+

size

must be non-negative
**Parameters:** shared

-

true

to request a shared lock, in which case this
channel must be open for reading (and possibly writing);

false

to request an exclusive lock, in which case this
channel must be open for writing (and possibly reading)
**Returns:** A lock object representing the newly-acquired lock
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel while the invoking
thread is blocked in this method
**Throws:** FileLockInterruptionException

- If the invoking thread is interrupted while blocked in this
method
**Throws:** OverlappingFileLockException

- If a lock that overlaps the requested region is already held by
this Java virtual machine, or if another thread is already
blocked in this method and is attempting to lock an overlapping
region
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If

shared

is

true

this channel was not
opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If

shared

is

false

but this channel was not
opened for writing

```java
public abstract
FileLock
tryLock​(long position,

throws
IOException
```

Attempts to acquire a lock on the given region of this channel's file.

This method does not block. An invocation always returns
immediately, either having acquired a lock on the requested region or
having failed to do so. If it fails to acquire a lock because an
overlapping lock is held by another program then it returns

null

. If it fails to acquire a lock for any other reason then
an appropriate exception is thrown.

The region specified by the

position

and

size

parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
underlying file. Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
expected maximum size of the file, should be locked. The zero-argument

tryLock()

method simply locks a region of size

Long.MAX_VALUE

.

Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
an exclusive lock. Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's

isShared

method.

File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
threads within the same virtual machine.

#### Method Detail

open

```java
public static
FileChannel
open​(
Path
path,

Set
<? extends
OpenOption
> options,

FileAttribute
<?>... attrs)
throws
IOException
```

Opens or creates a file, returning a file channel to access the file.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
The

READ

and

WRITE

options determine if the file should be opened for reading and/or
writing. If neither option (or the

APPEND

option) is contained in the array then the file is opened for reading.
By default reading or writing commences at the beginning of the file.

In the addition to

READ

and

WRITE

, the following
options may be present:

additional options

Option

Description

APPEND

If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
each invocation of the channel's

write

method first advances
the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
with the

READ

or

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

options.

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
for reading.

CREATE_NEW

If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
the file already exists. When creating a file the check for the
existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This option is
ignored when the file is opened only for reading.

CREATE

If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it
exists, otherwise a new file is created. When creating a file the check
for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does
not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This
option is ignored if the

CREATE_NEW

option is also present or
the file is opened only for reading.

DELETE_ON_CLOSE

When this option is present then the implementation makes a

best effort

attempt to delete the file when closed by
the

close

method. If the

close

method is not
invoked then a

best effort

attempt is made to delete the file
when the Java virtual machine terminates.

SPARSE

When creating a new file this option is a

hint

that the
new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
a new file.

SYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

DSYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content be written
synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

Synchronized I/O file
integrity

).

An implementation may also support additional options.

The

attrs

parameter is an optional array of file

file-attributes

to set atomically when creating the file.

The new channel is created by invoking the

newFileChannel

method on the
provider that created the

Path

.

**Parameters:** path

- The path of the file to open or create
**Parameters:** options

- Options specifying how the file is opened
**Parameters:** attrs

- An optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
creating the file
**Returns:** A new file channel
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the set contains an invalid combination of options
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the

path

is associated with a provider that does not
support creating file channels, or an unsupported open option is
specified, or the array contains an attribute that cannot be set
atomically when creating the file
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** SecurityException

- If a security manager is installed and it denies an

throws

IOException

Opens or creates a file, returning a file channel to access the file.

The

options

parameter determines how the file is opened.
The

READ

and

WRITE

options determine if the file should be opened for reading and/or
writing. If neither option (or the

APPEND

option) is contained in the array then the file is opened for reading.
By default reading or writing commences at the beginning of the file.

In the addition to

READ

and

WRITE

, the following
options may be present:

Option

Description

APPEND

If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
each invocation of the channel's

write

method first advances
the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
with the

options.

TRUNCATE_EXISTING

If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
for reading.

CREATE_NEW

If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
the file already exists. When creating a file the check for the
existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This option is
ignored when the file is opened only for reading.

when the Java virtual machine terminates.

SPARSE

When creating a new file this option is a

that the
new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
a new file.

SYNC

Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see

force

```java
public abstract void force​(boolean metaData)
throws
IOException
```

Forces any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage
device that contains it.

If this channel's file resides on a local storage device then when
this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file
since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked,
will have been written to that device. This is useful for ensuring that
critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash.

If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
is made.

The

metaData

parameter can be used to limit the number of
I/O operations that this method is required to perform. Passing

false

for this parameter indicates that only updates to the
file's content need be written to storage; passing

true

indicates that updates to both the file's content and metadata must be
written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation.
Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the
underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified.

Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the
channel was only opened for reading. Some operating systems, for
example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and
this time is updated whenever the file is read. Whether or not this is
actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified.

This method is only guaranteed to force changes that were made to
this channel's file via the methods defined in this class. It may or
may not force changes that were made by modifying the content of a

mapped byte buffer

obtained by
invoking the

map

method. Invoking the

force

method of the mapped byte buffer will
force changes made to the buffer's content to be written.

**Parameters:** metaData

- If

true

then this method is required to force changes
to both the file's content and metadata to be written to
storage; otherwise, it need only force content changes to be
written
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs

---

#### force

public abstract void force​(boolean metaData)
throws

IOException

Forces any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage
device that contains it.

If this channel's file resides on a local storage device then when
this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file
since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked,
will have been written to that device. This is useful for ensuring that
critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash.

If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
is made.

The

metaData

parameter can be used to limit the number of
I/O operations that this method is required to perform. Passing

file's content need be written to storage; passing

true

indicates that updates to both the file's content and metadata must be

Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the
underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified.

Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the
channel was only opened for reading. Some operating systems, for
example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and
this time is updated whenever the file is read. Whether or not this is
actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified.

This method is only guaranteed to force changes that were made to
this channel's file via the methods defined in this class. It may or

method. Invoking the

force

method of the mapped byte buffer will
force changes made to the buffer's content to be written.

If this channel's file resides on a local storage device then when
this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file
since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked,
will have been written to that device. This is useful for ensuring that
critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash.

If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
is made.

```

Transfers bytes from this channel's file to the given writable byte
channel.

An attempt is made to read up to

count

bytes starting at
the given

position

in this channel's file and write them to the
target channel. An invocation of this method may or may not transfer
all of the requested bytes; whether or not it does so depends upon the
natures and states of the channels. Fewer than the requested number of
bytes are transferred if this channel's file contains fewer than

count

bytes starting at the given

position

, or if the
target channel is non-blocking and it has fewer than

count

bytes free in its output buffer.

This method does not modify this channel's position. If the given
position is greater than the file's current size then no bytes are
transferred. If the target channel has a position then bytes are
written starting at that position and then the position is incremented
by the number of bytes written.

This method is potentially much more efficient than a simple loop
that reads from this channel and writes to the target channel. Many
operating systems can transfer bytes directly from the filesystem cache
to the target channel without actually copying them.

**Parameters:** position

- The position within the file at which the transfer is to begin;
must be non-negative
**Parameters:** count

- The maximum number of bytes to be transferred; must be
non-negative
**Parameters:** target

- The target channel
**Returns:** The number of bytes, possibly zero,
that were actually transferred
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If this channel was not opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If the target channel was not opened for writing
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If either this channel or the target channel is closed

map

```java

Maps a region of this channel's file directly into memory.

A region of a file may be mapped into memory in one of three modes:

- Read-only:

Any attempt to modify the resulting buffer
will cause a

ReadOnlyBufferException

to be thrown.
(

MapMode.READ_ONLY

)
- Read/write:

Changes made to the resulting buffer will
eventually be propagated to the file; they may or may not be made
visible to other programs that have mapped the same file. (

MapMode.READ_WRITE

)
- Private:

Changes made to the resulting buffer will not
be propagated to the file and will not be visible to other programs
that have mapped the same file; instead, they will cause private
copies of the modified portions of the buffer to be created. (

MapMode.PRIVATE

)

For a read-only mapping, this channel must have been opened for
reading; for a read/write or private mapping, this channel must have
been opened for both reading and writing.

The

mapped byte buffer

returned by this method will have a position of zero and a limit and
capacity of

size

; its mark will be undefined. The buffer and
the mapping that it represents will remain valid until the buffer itself
is garbage-collected.

A mapping, once established, is not dependent upon the file channel
that was used to create it. Closing the channel, in particular, has no
effect upon the validity of the mapping.

Many of the details of memory-mapped files are inherently dependent
upon the underlying operating system and are therefore unspecified. The
behavior of this method when the requested region is not completely
contained within this channel's file is unspecified. Whether changes
made to the content or size of the underlying file, by this program or
another, are propagated to the buffer is unspecified. The rate at which
changes to the buffer are propagated to the file is unspecified.

For most operating systems, mapping a file into memory is more
expensive than reading or writing a few tens of kilobytes of data via
the usual

read

and

write

methods. From the
standpoint of performance it is generally only worth mapping relatively
large files into memory.

**Parameters:** mode

- One of the constants

READ_ONLY

,

READ_WRITE

, or

PRIVATE

defined in the

FileChannel.MapMode

class, according to
whether the file is to be mapped read-only, read/write, or
privately (copy-on-write), respectively
**Parameters:** position

- The position within the file at which the mapped region
is to start; must be non-negative
**Parameters:** size

- The size of the region to be mapped; must be non-negative and
no greater than

Integer.MAX_VALUE
**Returns:** The mapped byte buffer
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If the

mode

is

READ_ONLY

but
this channel was not opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If the

mode

is

For most operating systems, mapping a file into memory is more
expensive than reading or writing a few tens of kilobytes of data via
the usual

lock

```java
public abstract
FileLock
lock​(long position,
long size,
boolean shared)
throws
IOException
```

Acquires a lock on the given region of this channel's file.

An invocation of this method will block until the region can be
locked, this channel is closed, or the invoking thread is interrupted,
whichever comes first.

If this channel is closed by another thread during an invocation of
this method then an

AsynchronousCloseException

will be thrown.

If the invoking thread is interrupted while waiting to acquire the
lock then its interrupt status will be set and a

FileLockInterruptionException

will be thrown. If the invoker's
interrupt status is set when this method is invoked then that exception
will be thrown immediately; the thread's interrupt status will not be
changed.

The region specified by the

position

and

size

parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
underlying file. Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
expected maximum size of the file, should be locked. The zero-argument

lock()

method simply locks a region of size

Long.MAX_VALUE

.

Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
an exclusive lock. Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's

isShared

method.

File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
threads within the same virtual machine.

**Parameters:** position

- The position at which the locked region is to start; must be
non-negative
**Parameters:** size

- The size of the locked region; must be non-negative, and the sum

position

+

size

must be non-negative
**Parameters:** shared

-

true

to request a shared lock, in which case this
channel must be open for reading (and possibly writing);

false

to request an exclusive lock, in which case this
channel must be open for writing (and possibly reading)
**Returns:** A lock object representing the newly-acquired lock
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
**Throws:** ClosedChannelException

- If this channel is closed
**Throws:** AsynchronousCloseException

- If another thread closes this channel while the invoking
thread is blocked in this method
**Throws:** FileLockInterruptionException

- If the invoking thread is interrupted while blocked in this
method
**Throws:** OverlappingFileLockException

- If a lock that overlaps the requested region is already held by
this Java virtual machine, or if another thread is already
blocked in this method and is attempting to lock an overlapping
region
**Throws:** NonReadableChannelException

- If

shared

is

true

this channel was not
opened for reading
**Throws:** NonWritableChannelException

- If

shared

is

false

but this channel was not
opened for writing
**Throws:** IOException

- If some other I/O error occurs
