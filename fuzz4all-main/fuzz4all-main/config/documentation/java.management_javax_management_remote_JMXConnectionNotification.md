# Class JMXConnectionNotification

**Source:** `java.management\javax\management\remote\JMXConnectionNotification.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
JMXConnectionNotification

extends
Notification
```

Notification emitted when a client connection is opened or
closed or when notifications are lost. These notifications are
sent by connector servers (instances of

JMXConnectorServer

)
and by connector clients (instances of

JMXConnector

). For
certain connectors, a session can consist of a sequence of
connections. Connection-opened and connection-closed notifications
will be sent for each one.

The notification type is one of the following:

JMXConnectionNotification Types

Type

Meaning

jmx.remote.connection.opened

A new client connection has been opened.

jmx.remote.connection.closed

A client connection has been closed.

jmx.remote.connection.failed

A client connection has failed unexpectedly.

jmx.remote.connection.notifs.lost

A client connection has potentially lost notifications. This
notification only appears on the client side.

The

timeStamp

of the notification is a time value
(consistent with

System.currentTimeMillis()

) indicating
when the notification was constructed.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

### Constructor Details

#### public JMXConnectionNotification​(
String
type,

Object
source,

String
connectionId,
long sequenceNumber,

String
message,

Object
userData)

Constructs a new connection notification. The

source

of the notification depends on whether it
is being sent by a connector server or a connector client:

- For a connector server, if it is registered in an MBean
server, the source is the

ObjectName

under which it is
registered. Otherwise, it is a reference to the connector
server object itself, an instance of a subclass of

JMXConnectorServer

.

For a connector client, the source is a reference to the
connector client object, an instance of a class implementing

JMXConnector

.

**Parameters:**
- type

- the type of the notification. This is usually one
of the constants

OPENED

,

CLOSED

,

FAILED

,

NOTIFS_LOST

. It is not an error for it to
be a different string.
- source

- the connector server or client emitting the
notification.
- connectionId

- the ID of the connection within its
connector server.
- sequenceNumber

- a non-negative integer. It is expected
but not required that this number will be greater than any
previous

sequenceNumber

in a notification from
this source.
- message

- an unspecified text message, typically containing
a human-readable description of the event. Can be null.
- userData

- an object whose type and meaning is defined by
the connector server. Can be null.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

type

,

source

, or

connectionId

is null.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

sequenceNumber

is negative.

### Method Details

#### public
String
getConnectionId()

The connection ID to which this notification pertains.

**Returns:**
- the connection ID.
