# Class DataInputStream

**Source:** `java.base\java\io\DataInputStream.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
DataInputStream

extends
FilterInputStream

implements
DataInput
```

A data input stream lets an application read primitive Java data
types from an underlying input stream in a machine-independent
way. An application uses a data output stream to write data that
can later be read by a data input stream.

DataInputStream is not necessarily safe for multithreaded access.
Thread safety is optional and is the responsibility of users of
methods in this class.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Closeable

,

DataInput

,

AutoCloseable

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public DataInputStream​(
InputStream
in)

Creates a DataInputStream that uses the specified
underlying InputStream.

**Parameters:**
- in

- the specified input stream

---

### Method Details

#### public final int read​(byte[] b)
throws
IOException

Reads some number of bytes from the contained input stream and
stores them into the buffer array

b

. The number of
bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks
until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an
exception is thrown.

If

b

is null, a

NullPointerException

is
thrown. If the length of

b

is zero, then no bytes are
read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt
to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the
stream is at end of file, the value

-1

is returned;
otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[0]

, the
next one into

b[1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read
is, at most, equal to the length of

b

. Let

k

be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in
elements

b[0]

through

b[k-1]

, leaving
elements

b[k]

through

b[b.length-1]

unaffected.

The

read(b)

method has the same effect as:

```java
read(b, 0, b.length)
```

**Overrides:**
- read

in class

FilterInputStream

**Parameters:**
- b

- the buffer into which the data is read.

**Returns:**
- the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end
of the stream has been reached.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than end of file, the stream has been closed and the underlying
input stream does not support reading after close, or another I/O
error occurs.

**See Also:**
- FilterInputStream.in

,

InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)

---

#### public final int read​(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException

Reads up to

len

bytes of data from the contained
input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read
as many as

len

bytes, but a smaller number may be read,
possibly zero. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an
integer.

This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is
detected, or an exception is thrown.

If

len

is zero, then no bytes are read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of
file, the value

-1

is returned; otherwise, at least one
byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[off]

, the
next one into

b[off+1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read
is, at most, equal to

len

. Let

k

be the number of
bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements

b[off]

through

b[off+

k

-1]

,
leaving elements

b[off+

k

]

through

b[off+len-1]

unaffected.

In every case, elements

b[0]

through

b[off]

and elements

b[off+len]

through

b[b.length-1]

are unaffected.

**Overrides:**
- read

in class

FilterInputStream

**Parameters:**
- b

- the buffer into which the data is read.
- off

- the start offset in the destination array

b
- len

- the maximum number of bytes read.

**Returns:**
- the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end
of the stream has been reached.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

b

is

null

.
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If

off

is negative,

len

is negative, or

len

is greater than

b.length - off
- IOException

- if the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than end of file, the stream has been closed and the underlying
input stream does not support reading after close, or another I/O
error occurs.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- DataInputStream

```java
public DataInputStream​(
InputStream
in)
```

Creates a DataInputStream that uses the specified
underlying InputStream.

**Parameters:** in

- the specified input stream

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- read

```java
public final int read​(byte[] b)
throws
IOException
```

Reads some number of bytes from the contained input stream and
stores them into the buffer array

b

. The number of
bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks
until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an
exception is thrown.

If

b

is null, a

NullPointerException

is
thrown. If the length of

b

is zero, then no bytes are
read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt
to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the
stream is at end of file, the value

-1

is returned;
otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[0]

, the
next one into

b[1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read
is, at most, equal to the length of

b

. Let

k

be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in
elements

b[0]

through

b[k-1]

, leaving
elements

b[k]

through

b[b.length-1]

unaffected.

The

read(b)

method has the same effect as:

```java
read(b, 0, b.length)
```

**Overrides:** read

in class

FilterInputStream
**Parameters:** b

- the buffer into which the data is read.
**Returns:** the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end
of the stream has been reached.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than end of file, the stream has been closed and the underlying
input stream does not support reading after close, or another I/O
error occurs.

InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)

- read

```java
public final int read​(byte[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException
```

Reads up to

len

bytes of data from the contained
input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read
as many as

len

bytes, but a smaller number may be read,
possibly zero. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an
integer.

This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is
detected, or an exception is thrown.

If

len

is zero, then no bytes are read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of
file, the value

-1

is returned; otherwise, at least one
byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[off]

, the
next one into

b[off+1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read
is, at most, equal to

len

. Let

k

be the number of
bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements

b[off]

through

b[off+

k

-1]

,
leaving elements

b[off+

k

]

through

b[off+len-1]

unaffected.

In every case, elements

b[0]

through

b[off]

and elements

b[off+len]

through

b[b.length-1]

are unaffected.

Method Detail

- read

```java
public final int read​(byte[] b)
throws
IOException
```

Reads some number of bytes from the contained input stream and
stores them into the buffer array

b

. The number of
bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks
until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an
exception is thrown.

If

b

is null, a

NullPointerException

is
thrown. If the length of

b

is zero, then no bytes are
read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt
to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the
stream is at end of file, the value

-1

is returned;
otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[0]

, the
next one into

b[1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read
is, at most, equal to the length of

b

. Let

k

be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in
elements

b[0]

through

b[k-1]

, leaving
elements

b[k]

through

b[b.length-1]

unaffected.

The

read(b)

method has the same effect as:

```java
read(b, 0, b.length)
```

**Overrides:** read

in class

FilterInputStream
**Parameters:** b

- the buffer into which the data is read.
**Returns:** the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end
of the stream has been reached.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than end of file, the stream has been closed and the underlying
input stream does not support reading after close, or another I/O
error occurs.
**See Also:** FilterInputStream.in

bytes of data from the contained
input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read
as many as

len

bytes, but a smaller number may be read,
possibly zero. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an
integer.

This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is
detected, or an exception is thrown.

If

len

is zero, then no bytes are read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of
file, the value

-1

is returned; otherwise, at least one
byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[off]

, the
next one into

b[off+1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read
is, at most, equal to

len

. Let

k

be the number of

#### Method Detail

read

```java
public final int read​(byte[] b)
throws
IOException
```

Reads some number of bytes from the contained input stream and
stores them into the buffer array

b

. The number of
bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks
until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an
exception is thrown.

If

b

is null, a

NullPointerException

is
thrown. If the length of

b

is zero, then no bytes are
read and

0

is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt
to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the
stream is at end of file, the value

-1

is returned;
otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into

b

.

The first byte read is stored into element

b[0]

, the
next one into

b[1]

, and so on. The number of bytes read
is, at most, equal to the length of

b

. Let

k

be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in
elements

b[0]

through

b[k-1]

, leaving
elements

b[k]

through

b[b.length-1]

unaffected.

The

read(b)

method has the same effect as:

```java
read(b, 0, b.length)
```

**Overrides:** read

in class

FilterInputStream
**Parameters:** b

- the buffer into which the data is read.
**Returns:** the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or

-1

if there is no more data because the end
of the stream has been reached.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the first byte cannot be read for any reason
other than end of file, the stream has been closed and the underlying
input stream does not support reading after close, or another I/O
error occurs.
