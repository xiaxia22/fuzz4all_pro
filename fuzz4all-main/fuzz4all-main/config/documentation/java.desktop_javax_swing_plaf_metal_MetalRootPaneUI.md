# Class MetalRootPaneUI

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\plaf\metal\MetalRootPaneUI.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
MetalRootPaneUI

extends
BasicRootPaneUI
```

Provides the metal look and feel implementation of

RootPaneUI

.

MetalRootPaneUI

provides support for the

windowDecorationStyle

property of

JRootPane

.

MetalRootPaneUI

does this by way of installing a custom

LayoutManager

, a private

Component

to render
the appropriate widgets, and a private

Border

. The

LayoutManager

is always installed, regardless of the value of
the

windowDecorationStyle

property, but the

Border

and

Component

are only installed/added if
the

windowDecorationStyle

is other than

JRootPane.NONE

.

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.

### Method Details

#### public static
ComponentUI
createUI​(
JComponent
c)

Creates a UI for a

JRootPane

.

**Parameters:**
- c

- the JRootPane the RootPaneUI will be created for

**Returns:**
- the RootPaneUI implementation for the passed in JRootPane

---

#### public void installUI​(
JComponent
c)

Invokes supers implementation of

installUI

to install
the necessary state onto the passed in

JRootPane

to render the metal look and feel implementation of

RootPaneUI

. If
the

windowDecorationStyle

property of the

JRootPane

is other than

JRootPane.NONE

,
this will add a custom

Component

to render the widgets to

JRootPane

, as well as installing a custom

Border

and

LayoutManager

on the

JRootPane

.

**Overrides:**
- installUI

in class

ComponentUI

**Parameters:**
- c

- the JRootPane to install state onto

**See Also:**
- ComponentUI.uninstallUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

,

JComponent.setUI(javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI)

,

JComponent.updateUI()

---

#### public void uninstallUI​(
JComponent
c)

Invokes supers implementation to uninstall any of its state. This will
also reset the

LayoutManager

of the

JRootPane

.
If a

Component

has been added to the

JRootPane

to render the window decoration style, this method will remove it.
Similarly, this will revert the Border and LayoutManager of the

JRootPane

to what it was before

installUI

was invoked.

**Overrides:**
- uninstallUI

in class

ComponentUI

**Parameters:**
- c

- the JRootPane to uninstall state from

**See Also:**
- ComponentUI.installUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

,

JComponent.updateUI()

---

#### public void propertyChange​(
PropertyChangeEvent
e)

Invoked when a property changes.

MetalRootPaneUI

is
primarily interested in events originating from the

JRootPane

it has been installed on identifying the
property

windowDecorationStyle

. If the

windowDecorationStyle

has changed to a value other
than

JRootPane.NONE

, this will add a

Component

to the

JRootPane

to render the window decorations, as well
as installing a

Border

on the

JRootPane

.
On the other hand, if the

windowDecorationStyle

has
changed to

JRootPane.NONE

, this will remove the

Component

that has been added to the

JRootPane

as well resetting the Border to what it was before

installUI

was invoked.

**Specified by:**
- propertyChange

in interface

PropertyChangeListener

**Overrides:**
- propertyChange

in class

BasicRootPaneUI

**Parameters:**
- e

- A PropertyChangeEvent object describing the event source
and the property that has changed.
