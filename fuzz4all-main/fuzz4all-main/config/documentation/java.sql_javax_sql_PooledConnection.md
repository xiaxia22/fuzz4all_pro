# Interface PooledConnection

**Source:** `java.sql\javax\sql\PooledConnection.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
PooledConnection
```

An object that provides hooks for connection pool management.
A

PooledConnection

object
represents a physical connection to a data source. The connection
can be recycled rather than being closed when an application is
finished with it, thus reducing the number of connections that
need to be made.

An application programmer does not use the

PooledConnection

interface directly; rather, it is used by a middle tier infrastructure
that manages the pooling of connections.

When an application calls the method

DataSource.getConnection

,
it gets back a

Connection

object. If connection pooling is
being done, that

Connection

object is actually a handle to
a

PooledConnection

object, which is a physical connection.

The connection pool manager, typically the application server, maintains
a pool of

PooledConnection

objects. If there is a

PooledConnection

object available in the pool, the
connection pool manager returns a

Connection

object that
is a handle to that physical connection.
If no

PooledConnection

object is available, the
connection pool manager calls the

ConnectionPoolDataSource

method

getPoolConnection

to create a new physical connection. The
JDBC driver implementing

ConnectionPoolDataSource

creates a
new

PooledConnection

object and returns a handle to it.

When an application closes a connection, it calls the

Connection

method

close

. When connection pooling is being done,
the connection pool manager is notified because it has registered itself as
a

ConnectionEventListener

object using the

ConnectionPool

method

addConnectionEventListener

.
The connection pool manager deactivates the handle to
the

PooledConnection

object and returns the

PooledConnection

object to the pool of connections so that
it can be used again. Thus, when an application closes its connection,
the underlying physical connection is recycled rather than being closed.

If the connection pool manager wraps or provides a proxy to the logical
handle returned from a call to

PoolConnection.getConnection

, the pool
manager must do one of the following when the connection pool manager
closes or returns the

PooledConnection

to the pool in response to
the application calling

Connection.close

:

- call

endRequest

on the logical

Connection

handle

call

close

on the logical

Connection

handle

The physical connection is not closed until the connection pool manager
calls the

PooledConnection

method

close

.
This method is generally called to have an orderly shutdown of the server or
if a fatal error has made the connection unusable.

A connection pool manager is often also a statement pool manager, maintaining
a pool of

PreparedStatement

objects.
When an application closes a prepared statement, it calls the

PreparedStatement

method

close

. When

Statement

pooling is being done,
the pool manager is notified because it has registered itself as
a

StatementEventListener

object using the

ConnectionPool

method

addStatementEventListener

.
Thus, when an application closes its

PreparedStatement

,
the underlying prepared statement is recycled rather than being closed.

### Method Details

#### Connection
getConnection()
throws
SQLException

Creates and returns a

Connection

object that is a handle
for the physical connection that
this

PooledConnection

object represents.
The connection pool manager calls this method when an application has
called the method

DataSource.getConnection

and there are
no

PooledConnection

objects available. See the

interface description

for more information.

**Returns:**
- a

Connection

object that is a handle to
this

PooledConnection

object

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs
- SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver does not support
this method

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### void close()
throws
SQLException

Closes the physical connection that this

PooledConnection

object represents. An application never calls this method directly;
it is called by the connection pool module, or manager.

See the

interface description

for more
information.

**Throws:**
- SQLException

- if a database access error occurs
- SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

#### void addConnectionEventListener​(
ConnectionEventListener
listener)

Registers the given event listener so that it will be notified
when an event occurs on this

PooledConnection

object.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- a component, usually the connection pool manager,
that has implemented the

ConnectionEventListener

interface and wants to be

ConnectionPoolDataSource

method

getPoolConnection

to create a new physical connection. The
JDBC driver implementing
