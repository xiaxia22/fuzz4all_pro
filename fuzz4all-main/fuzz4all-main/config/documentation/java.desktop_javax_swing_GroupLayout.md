### Class Description

```java
public class
GroupLayout

extends
Object

implements
LayoutManager2
```

GroupLayout

is a

LayoutManager

that hierarchically
groups components in order to position them in a

Container

.

GroupLayout

is intended for use by builders, but may be
hand-coded as well.
Grouping is done by instances of the

Group

class.

GroupLayout

supports two types of groups. A sequential group
positions its child elements sequentially, one after another. A
parallel group aligns its child elements in one of four ways.

Each group may contain any number of elements, where an element is
a

Group

,

Component

, or gap. A gap can be thought
of as an invisible component with a minimum, preferred and maximum
size. In addition

GroupLayout

supports a preferred gap,
whose value comes from

LayoutStyle

.

Elements are similar to a spring. Each element has a range as
specified by a minimum, preferred and maximum. Gaps have either a
developer-specified range, or a range determined by

LayoutStyle

. The range for

Component

s is determined from
the

Component

's

getMinimumSize

,

getPreferredSize

and

getMaximumSize

methods. In addition,
when adding

Component

s you may specify a particular range
to use instead of that from the component. The range for a

Group

is determined by the type of group. A

ParallelGroup

's
range is the maximum of the ranges of its elements. A

SequentialGroup

's range is the sum of the ranges of its elements.

GroupLayout

treats each axis independently. That is, there
is a group representing the horizontal axis, and a group
representing the vertical axis. The horizontal group is
responsible for determining the minimum, preferred and maximum size
along the horizontal axis as well as setting the x and width of the
components contained in it. The vertical group is responsible for
determining the minimum, preferred and maximum size along the
vertical axis as well as setting the y and height of the
components contained in it. Each

Component

must exist in both
a horizontal and vertical group, otherwise an

IllegalStateException

is thrown during layout, or when the minimum, preferred or
maximum size is requested.

The following diagram shows a sequential group along the horizontal
axis. The sequential group contains three components. A parallel group
was used along the vertical axis.

To reinforce that each axis is treated independently the diagram shows
the range of each group and element along each axis. The
range of each component has been projected onto the axes,
and the groups are rendered in blue (horizontal) and red (vertical).
For readability there is a gap between each of the elements in the
sequential group.

The sequential group along the horizontal axis is rendered as a solid
blue line. Notice the sequential group is the sum of the children elements
it contains.

Along the vertical axis the parallel group is the maximum of the height
of each of the components. As all three components have the same height,
the parallel group has the same height.

The following diagram shows the same three components, but with the
parallel group along the horizontal axis and the sequential group along
the vertical axis.

As

c1

is the largest of the three components, the parallel
group is sized to

c1

. As

c2

and

c3

are smaller
than

c1

they are aligned based on the alignment specified
for the component (if specified) or the default alignment of the
parallel group. In the diagram

c2

and

c3

were created
with an alignment of

LEADING

. If the component orientation were
right-to-left then

c2

and

c3

would be positioned on
the opposite side.

The following diagram shows a sequential group along both the horizontal
and vertical axis.

GroupLayout

provides the ability to insert gaps between

Component

s. The size of the gap is determined by an
instance of

LayoutStyle

. This may be turned on using the

setAutoCreateGaps

method. Similarly, you may use
the

setAutoCreateContainerGaps

method to insert gaps
between components that touch the edge of the parent container and the
container.

The following builds a panel consisting of two labels in
one column, followed by two textfields in the next column:

```java
JComponent panel = ...;
GroupLayout layout = new GroupLayout(panel);
panel.setLayout(layout);

// Turn on automatically adding gaps between components
layout.setAutoCreateGaps(true);

// Turn on automatically creating gaps between components that touch
// the edge of the container and the container.
layout.setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true);

// Create a sequential group for the horizontal axis.

GroupLayout.SequentialGroup hGroup = layout.createSequentialGroup();

// The sequential group in turn contains two parallel groups.
// One parallel group contains the labels, the other the text fields.
// Putting the labels in a parallel group along the horizontal axis
// positions them at the same x location.
//
// Variable indentation is used to reinforce the level of grouping.
hGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup().
addComponent(label1).addComponent(label2));
hGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup().
addComponent(tf1).addComponent(tf2));
layout.setHorizontalGroup(hGroup);

// Create a sequential group for the vertical axis.
GroupLayout.SequentialGroup vGroup = layout.createSequentialGroup();

// The sequential group contains two parallel groups that align
// the contents along the baseline. The first parallel group contains
// the first label and text field, and the second parallel group contains
// the second label and text field. By using a sequential group
// the labels and text fields are positioned vertically after one another.
vGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup(Alignment.BASELINE).
addComponent(label1).addComponent(tf1));
vGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup(Alignment.BASELINE).
addComponent(label2).addComponent(tf2));
layout.setVerticalGroup(vGroup);
```

When run the following is produced.

This layout consists of the following.

- The horizontal axis consists of a sequential group containing two
parallel groups. The first parallel group contains the labels,
and the second parallel group contains the text fields.

The vertical axis consists of a sequential group
containing two parallel groups. The parallel groups are configured
to align their components along the baseline. The first parallel
group contains the first label and first text field, and
the second group consists of the second label and second
text field.

There are a couple of things to notice in this code:

- You need not explicitly add the components to the container; this
is indirectly done by using one of the

add

methods of

Group

.

The various

add

methods return
the caller. This allows for easy chaining of invocations. For
example,

group.addComponent(label1).addComponent(label2);

is
equivalent to

group.addComponent(label1); group.addComponent(label2);

.

There are no public constructors for

Group

s; instead
use the create methods of

GroupLayout

.

, or gap. A gap can be thought
of as an invisible component with a minimum, preferred and maximum
size. In addition

GroupLayout

supports a preferred gap,
whose value comes from

LayoutStyle

.

Elements are similar to a spring. Each element has a range as
specified by a minimum, preferred and maximum. Gaps have either a
developer-specified range, or a range determined by

LayoutStyle

. The range for

Component

s is determined from
the

Component

's

getMinimumSize

,

getPreferredSize

and

getMaximumSize

methods. In addition,
when adding

Component

s you may specify a particular range
to use instead of that from the component. The range for a

Group

is determined by the type of group. A

ParallelGroup

's
range is the maximum of the ranges of its elements. A

SequentialGroup

's range is the sum of the ranges of its elements.

GroupLayout

treats each axis independently. That is, there
is a group representing the horizontal axis, and a group
representing the vertical axis. The horizontal group is
responsible for determining the minimum, preferred and maximum size
along the horizontal axis as well as setting the x and width of the
components contained in it. The vertical group is responsible for
determining the minimum, preferred and maximum size along the
vertical axis as well as setting the y and height of the
components contained in it. Each

Component

must exist in both
a horizontal and vertical group, otherwise an

IllegalStateException

is thrown during layout, or when the minimum, preferred or
maximum size is requested.

The following diagram shows a sequential group along the horizontal
axis. The sequential group contains three components. A parallel group
was used along the vertical axis.

To reinforce that each axis is treated independently the diagram shows
the range of each group and element along each axis. The
range of each component has been projected onto the axes,
and the groups are rendered in blue (horizontal) and red (vertical).
For readability there is a gap between each of the elements in the
sequential group.

The sequential group along the horizontal axis is rendered as a solid
blue line. Notice the sequential group is the sum of the children elements
it contains.

Along the vertical axis the parallel group is the maximum of the height
of each of the components. As all three components have the same height,
the parallel group has the same height.

The following diagram shows the same three components, but with the
parallel group along the horizontal axis and the sequential group along
the vertical axis.

As

c1

is the largest of the three components, the parallel
group is sized to

c1

. As

c2

and

c3

are smaller
than

c1

they are aligned based on the alignment specified
for the component (if specified) or the default alignment of the
parallel group. In the diagram

c2

and

c3

were created
with an alignment of

LEADING

. If the component orientation were
right-to-left then

c2

and

c3

would be positioned on
the opposite side.

The following diagram shows a sequential group along both the horizontal
and vertical axis.

GroupLayout

provides the ability to insert gaps between

Component

s. The size of the gap is determined by an
instance of

LayoutStyle

. This may be turned on using the

setAutoCreateGaps

method. Similarly, you may use
the

setAutoCreateContainerGaps

method to insert gaps
between components that touch the edge of the parent container and the
container.

The following builds a panel consisting of two labels in
one column, followed by two textfields in the next column:

```java
JComponent panel = ...;
GroupLayout layout = new GroupLayout(panel);
panel.setLayout(layout);

// Turn on automatically adding gaps between components
layout.setAutoCreateGaps(true);

// Turn on automatically creating gaps between components that touch
// the edge of the container and the container.
layout.setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true);

// Create a sequential group for the horizontal axis.

GroupLayout.SequentialGroup hGroup = layout.createSequentialGroup();

// The sequential group in turn contains two parallel groups.
// One parallel group contains the labels, the other the text fields.
// Putting the labels in a parallel group along the horizontal axis
// positions them at the same x location.
//
// Variable indentation is used to reinforce the level of grouping.
hGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup().
addComponent(label1).addComponent(label2));
hGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup().
addComponent(tf1).addComponent(tf2));
layout.setHorizontalGroup(hGroup);

// Create a sequential group for the vertical axis.
GroupLayout.SequentialGroup vGroup = layout.createSequentialGroup();

// The sequential group contains two parallel groups that align
// the contents along the baseline. The first parallel group contains
// the first label and text field, and the second parallel group contains
// the second label and text field. By using a sequential group
// the labels and text fields are positioned vertically after one another.
vGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup(Alignment.BASELINE).
addComponent(label1).addComponent(tf1));
vGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup(Alignment.BASELINE).
addComponent(label2).addComponent(tf2));
layout.setVerticalGroup(vGroup);
```

When run the following is produced.

This layout consists of the following.

- The horizontal axis consists of a sequential group containing two
parallel groups. The first parallel group contains the labels,
and the second parallel group contains the text fields.

The vertical axis consists of a sequential group
containing two parallel groups. The parallel groups are configured
to align their components along the baseline. The first parallel
group contains the first label and first text field, and
the second group consists of the second label and second
text field.

There are a couple of things to notice in this code:

- You need not explicitly add the components to the container; this
is indirectly done by using one of the

add

methods of

Group

.

The various

add

methods return
the caller. This allows for easy chaining of invocations. For
example,

group.addComponent(label1).addComponent(label2);

is
equivalent to

group.addComponent(label1); group.addComponent(label2);

.

There are no public constructors for

Group

s; instead
use the create methods of

GroupLayout

.

Each group may contain any number of elements, where an element is
a

Group

,

Component

, or gap. A gap can be thought
of as an invisible component with a minimum, preferred and maximum
size. In addition

GroupLayout

supports a preferred gap,
whose value comes from

LayoutStyle

.

Elements are similar to a spring. Each element has a range as
specified by a minimum, preferred and maximum. Gaps have either a
developer-specified range, or a range determined by

LayoutStyle

. The range for

Component

s is determined from
the

Component

's

getMinimumSize

,

getPreferredSize

and

getMaximumSize

methods. In addition,
when adding

Component

s you may specify a particular range
to use instead of that from the component. The range for a

The following diagram shows a sequential group along the horizontal
axis. The sequential group contains three components. A parallel group
was used along the vertical axis.

To reinforce that each axis is treated independently the diagram shows
the range of each group and element along each axis. The

it contains.

Along the vertical axis the parallel group is the maximum of the height
of each of the components. As all three components have the same height,
the parallel group has the same height.

The following diagram shows the same three components, but with the
parallel group along the horizontal axis and the sequential group along
the vertical axis.

As

c1

is the largest of the three components, the parallel
group is sized to

c1

. As

c2

and

c3

are smaller
than

c1

they are aligned based on the alignment specified
for the component (if specified) or the default alignment of the
parallel group. In the diagram

c2

and

c3

were created
with an alignment of

LEADING

When run the following is produced.

This layout consists of the following.

- The horizontal axis consists of a sequential group containing two
parallel groups. The first parallel group contains the labels,
and the second parallel group contains the text fields.

The vertical axis consists of a sequential group
containing two parallel groups. The parallel groups are configured
to align their components along the baseline. The first parallel
group contains the first label and first text field, and
the second group consists of the second label and second
text field.

There are a couple of things to notice in this code:

- You need not explicitly add the components to the container; this
is indirectly done by using one of the

add

methods of

Group

.

The various

add

methods return
the caller. This allows for easy chaining of invocations. For
example,

group.addComponent(label1).addComponent(label2);

is
equivalent to

group.addComponent(label1); group.addComponent(label2);

.

There are no public constructors for

Group

s; instead
use the create methods of

GroupLayout

.

The sequential group along the horizontal axis is rendered as a solid
blue line. Notice the sequential group is the sum of the children elements
it contains.

Along the vertical axis the parallel group is the maximum of the height
of each of the components. As all three components have the same height,
the parallel group has the same height.

The following diagram shows the same three components, but with the
parallel group along the horizontal axis and the sequential group along
the vertical axis.

As

c1

is the largest of the three components, the parallel
group is sized to

c1

. As

c2

and

c3

are smaller
than

c1

they are aligned based on the alignment specified
for the component (if specified) or the default alignment of the
parallel group. In the diagram

c2

and

c3

were created
with an alignment of

LEADING

. If the component orientation were
right-to-left then

c2

and

c3

would be positioned on
the opposite side.

The following diagram shows a sequential group along both the horizontal
and vertical axis.

GroupLayout

provides the ability to insert gaps between

Component

s. The size of the gap is determined by an
instance of

LayoutStyle

. This may be turned on using the

setAutoCreateGaps

method. Similarly, you may use
the

setAutoCreateContainerGaps

method to insert gaps
between components that touch the edge of the parent container and the
container.

The following builds a panel consisting of two labels in
one column, followed by two textfields in the next column:

```java
JComponent panel = ...;
GroupLayout layout = new GroupLayout(panel);
panel.setLayout(layout);

// Turn on automatically adding gaps between components

// The sequential group in turn contains two parallel groups.
// One parallel group contains the labels, the other the text fields.
// Putting the labels in a parallel group along the horizontal axis
// positions them at the same x location.
//
// Variable indentation is used to reinforce the level of grouping.
