# Class LocaleServiceProvider

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\spi\LocaleServiceProvider.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
LocaleServiceProvider

extends
Object
```

This is the super class of all the locale sensitive service provider
interfaces (SPIs).

Locale sensitive service provider interfaces are interfaces that
correspond to locale sensitive classes in the

java.text

and

java.util

packages. The interfaces enable the
construction of locale sensitive objects and the retrieval of
localized names for these packages. Locale sensitive factory methods
and methods for name retrieval in the

java.text

and

java.util

packages use implementations of the provider
interfaces to offer support for locales beyond the set of locales
supported by the Java runtime environment itself.

Packaging of Locale Sensitive Service Provider Implementations

Implementations of these locale sensitive services can be made available
by adding them to the application's class path. A provider identifies itself with a
provider-configuration file in the resource directory META-INF/services,
using the fully qualified provider interface class name as the file name.
The file should contain a list of fully-qualified concrete provider class names,
one per line. A line is terminated by any one of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage
return ('\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed. Space
and tab characters surrounding each name, as well as blank lines, are ignored.
The comment character is '#' ('#'); on each line all characters following
the first comment character are ignored. The file must be encoded in UTF-8.

If a particular concrete provider class is named in more than one configuration
file, or is named in the same configuration file more than once, then the
duplicates will be ignored. The configuration file naming a particular provider
need not be in the same jar file or other distribution unit as the provider itself.
The provider must be accessible from the same class loader that was initially
queried to locate the configuration file; this is not necessarily the class loader
that loaded the file.

For example, an implementation of the

DateFormatProvider

class should
take the form of a jar file which contains the file:

```java
META-INF/services/java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider
```

And the file

java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider

should have
a line such as:

```java
com.foo.DateFormatProviderImpl
```

which is the fully qualified class name of the class implementing

DateFormatProvider

.

Invocation of Locale Sensitive Services

Locale sensitive factory methods and methods for name retrieval in the

java.text

and

java.util

packages invoke
service provider methods when needed to support the requested locale.
The methods first check whether the Java runtime environment itself
supports the requested locale, and use its support if available.
Otherwise, they call the

isSupportedLocale

methods of installed providers for the appropriate interface to find one that
supports the requested locale. If such a provider is found, its other
methods are called to obtain the requested object or name. When checking
whether a locale is supported, the

locale's extensions

are ignored by default. (If locale's extensions should
also be checked, the

isSupportedLocale

method must be overridden.)
If neither the Java runtime environment itself nor an installed provider
supports the requested locale, the methods go through a list of candidate
locales and repeat the availability check for each until a match is found.
The algorithm used for creating a list of candidate locales is same as
the one used by

ResourceBundle

by default (see

getCandidateLocales

for the details). Even if a locale is resolved from the candidate list,
methods that return requested objects or names are invoked with the original
requested locale including

Locale

extensions. The Java runtime
environment must support the root locale for all locale sensitive services in
order to guarantee that this process terminates.

Providers of names (but not providers of other objects) are allowed to
return null for some name requests even for locales that they claim to
support by including them in their return value for

getAvailableLocales

. Similarly, the Java runtime
environment itself may not have all names for all locales that it
supports. This is because the sets of objects for which names are
requested can be large and vary over time, so that it's not always
feasible to cover them completely. If the Java runtime environment or a
provider returns null instead of a name, the lookup will proceed as
described above as if the locale was not supported.

The search order of locale sensitive services can
be configured by using the "java.locale.providers" system property.
This system property declares the user's preferred order for looking up
the locale sensitive services separated by a comma. It is only read at
the Java runtime startup, so the later call to System.setProperty() won't
affect the order.

Java Runtime Environment provides the following four locale providers:

- "CLDR": A provider based on Unicode Consortium's

CLDR Project

.

"COMPAT": represents the locale sensitive services that is compatible
with the prior JDK releases up to JDK8 (same as JDK8's "JRE").

"SPI": represents the locale sensitive services implementing the subclasses of
this

LocaleServiceProvider

class.

"HOST": A provider that reflects the user's custom settings in the
underlying operating system. This provider may not be available, depending
on the Java Runtime Environment implementation.

"JRE": represents a synonym to "COMPAT". This name
is deprecated and will be removed in the future release of JDK.

For example, if the following is specified in the property:

```java
java.locale.providers=SPI,CLDR,COMPAT
```

the locale sensitive services in the SPI providers are looked up first. If the
desired locale sensitive service is not available, then the runtime looks for CLDR,
COMPAT in that order.

The default order for looking up the preferred locale providers is "CLDR,COMPAT",
so specifying "CLDR,COMPAT" is identical to the default behavior. Applications which
require implementations of the locale sensitive services must explicitly specify
"SPI" in order for the Java runtime to load them from the classpath.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected LocaleServiceProvider()

Initializes a new locale service provider.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- If a security manager has been installed and it denies

RuntimePermission("localeServiceProvider")

---

### Method Details

#### public abstract
Locale
[] getAvailableLocales()

Returns an array of all locales for which this locale service provider
can provide localized objects or names. This information is used to
compose

getAvailableLocales()

values of the locale-dependent
services, such as

DateFormat.getAvailableLocales()

.

The array returned by this method should not include two or more

Locale

objects only differing in their extensions.

**Returns:**
- An array of all locales for which this locale service provider
can provide localized objects or names.

---

#### public boolean isSupportedLocale​(
Locale
locale)

Returns

true

if the given

locale

is supported by
this locale service provider. The given

locale

may contain

extensions

that should be
taken into account for the support determination.

The default implementation returns

true

if the given

locale

is equal to any of the available

Locale

s returned by

getAvailableLocales()

with ignoring any extensions in both the
given

locale

and the available locales. Concrete locale service
provider implementations should override this method if those
implementations are

Locale

extensions-aware. For example,

DecimalFormatSymbolsProvider

implementations will need to check
extensions in the given

locale

to see if any numbering system is
specified and can be supported. However,

CollatorProvider

implementations may not be affected by any particular numbering systems,
and in that case, extensions for numbering systems should be ignored.

**Parameters:**
- locale

- a

Locale

to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if the given

locale

is supported by this
provider;

false

otherwise.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the given

locale

is

null

**See Also:**
- Locale.hasExtensions()

,

Locale.stripExtensions()

described above as if the locale was not supported.

The search order of locale sensitive services can
be configured by using the "java.locale.providers" system property.
This system property declares the user's preferred order for looking up
the locale sensitive services separated by a comma. It is only read at
the Java runtime startup, so the later call to System.setProperty() won't
affect the order.

Java Runtime Environment provides the following four locale providers:

- "CLDR": A provider based on Unicode Consortium's

CLDR Project

.

"COMPAT": represents the locale sensitive services that is compatible
with the prior JDK releases up to JDK8 (same as JDK8's "JRE").

"SPI": represents the locale sensitive services implementing the subclasses of
this

LocaleServiceProvider

class.

"HOST": A provider that reflects the user's custom settings in the
underlying operating system. This provider may not be available, depending
on the Java Runtime Environment implementation.

"JRE": represents a synonym to "COMPAT". This name
is deprecated and will be removed in the future release of JDK.

For example, if the following is specified in the property:

```java
java.locale.providers=SPI,CLDR,COMPAT
```

the locale sensitive services in the SPI providers are looked up first. If the
desired locale sensitive service is not available, then the runtime looks for CLDR,
COMPAT in that order.

The default order for looking up the preferred locale providers is "CLDR,COMPAT",
so specifying "CLDR,COMPAT" is identical to the default behavior. Applications which
require implementations of the locale sensitive services must explicitly specify
"SPI" in order for the Java runtime to load them from the classpath.

#### Invocation of Locale Sensitive Services

Locale sensitive factory methods and methods for name retrieval in the

java.text

and

java.util

packages invoke
service provider methods when needed to support the requested locale.
The methods first check whether the Java runtime environment itself
supports the requested locale, and use its support if available.
Otherwise, they call the

isSupportedLocale

methods of installed providers for the appropriate interface to find one that
supports the requested locale. If such a provider is found, its other
methods are called to obtain the requested object or name. When checking
whether a locale is supported, the

locale's extensions

are ignored by default. (If locale's extensions should
also be checked, the

isSupportedLocale

method must be overridden.)
If neither the Java runtime environment itself nor an installed provider
supports the requested locale, the methods go through a list of candidate
locales and repeat the availability check for each until a match is found.
The algorithm used for creating a list of candidate locales is same as
the one used by

ResourceBundle

by default (see

getCandidateLocales

for the details). Even if a locale is resolved from the candidate list,
methods that return requested objects or names are invoked with the original
requested locale including

Locale

extensions. The Java runtime
environment must support the root locale for all locale sensitive services in
order to guarantee that this process terminates.

Providers of names (but not providers of other objects) are allowed to
return null for some name requests even for locales that they claim to
support by including them in their return value for

getAvailableLocales

. Similarly, the Java runtime
environment itself may not have all names for all locales that it
supports. This is because the sets of objects for which names are
requested can be large and vary over time, so that it's not always
feasible to cover them completely. If the Java runtime environment or a
provider returns null instead of a name, the lookup will proceed as
described above as if the locale was not supported.

The search order of locale sensitive services can
be configured by using the "java.locale.providers" system property.
