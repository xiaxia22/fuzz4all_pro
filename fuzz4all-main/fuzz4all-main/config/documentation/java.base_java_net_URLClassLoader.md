# Class URLClassLoader

**Source:** `java.base\java\net\URLClassLoader.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
URLClassLoader

extends
SecureClassLoader

implements
Closeable
```

This class loader is used to load classes and resources from a search
path of URLs referring to both JAR files and directories. Any

jar:

scheme URL (see

JarURLConnection

) is assumed to refer to a
JAR file. Any

file:

scheme URL that ends with a '/' is assumed to
refer to a directory. Otherwise, the URL is assumed to refer to a JAR file
which will be opened as needed.

This class loader supports the loading of classes and resources from the
contents of a

multi-release

JAR file that is referred to by a given URL.

The AccessControlContext of the thread that created the instance of
URLClassLoader will be used when subsequently loading classes and
resources.

The classes that are loaded are by default granted permission only to
access the URLs specified when the URLClassLoader was created.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Closeable

,

AutoCloseable

### Constructor Details

#### public URLClassLoader​(
URL
[] urls,

ClassLoader
parent)

Constructs a new URLClassLoader for the given URLs. The URLs will be
searched in the order specified for classes and resources after first
searching in the specified parent class loader. Any

jar:

scheme URL is assumed to refer to a JAR file. Any

file:

scheme
URL that ends with a '/' is assumed to refer to a directory. Otherwise,
the URL is assumed to refer to a JAR file which will be downloaded and
opened as needed.

If there is a security manager, this method first
calls the security manager's

checkCreateClassLoader

method
to ensure creation of a class loader is allowed.

**Parameters:**
- urls

- the URLs from which to load classes and resources
- parent

- the parent class loader for delegation

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

### Method Details

#### public
InputStream
getResourceAsStream​(
String
name)

Returns an input stream for reading the specified resource.
If this loader is closed, then any resources opened by this method
will be closed.

The search order is described in the documentation for

ClassLoader.getResource(String)

.

**Overrides:**
- getResourceAsStream

in class

ClassLoader

**Parameters:**
- name

- The resource name

**Returns:**
- An input stream for reading the resource, or

null

if the resource could not be found

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- If

name

is

null

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public void close()
throws
IOException

Closes this URLClassLoader, so that it can no longer be used to load
new classes or resources that are defined by this loader.
Classes and resources defined by any of this loader's parents in the
delegation hierarchy are still accessible. Also, any classes or resources
that are already loaded, are still accessible.

In the case of jar: and file: URLs, it also closes any files
that were opened by it. If another thread is loading a
class when the

close

method is invoked, then the result of
that load is undefined.

The method makes a best effort attempt to close all opened files,
by catching

IOException

s internally. Unchecked exceptions
and errors are not caught. Calling close on an already closed
loader has no effect.

**Specified by:**
- close

in interface

AutoCloseable
- close

in interface

Closeable

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if closing any file opened by this class loader
resulted in an IOException. Any such exceptions are caught internally.
If only one is caught, then it is re-thrown. If more than one exception
is caught, then the second and following exceptions are added
as suppressed exceptions of the first one caught, which is then re-thrown.
- SecurityException

- if a security manager is set, and it denies

RuntimePermission

("closeClassLoader")

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### protected void addURL​(
URL
url)

Appends the specified URL to the list of URLs to search for
classes and resources.

If the URL specified is

null

or is already in the
list of URLs, or if this loader is closed, then invoking this
method has no effect.

**Parameters:**
- url

- the URL to be added to the search path of URLs

---

#### public
URL
[] getURLs()

Returns the search path of URLs for loading classes and resources.
This includes the original list of URLs specified to the constructor,
along with any URLs subsequently appended by the addURL() method.

**Returns:**
- the search path of URLs for loading classes and resources.

---

#### protected
Class
<?> findClass​(
String
name)
throws
ClassNotFoundException

Finds and loads the class with the specified name from the URL search
path. Any URLs referring to JAR files are loaded and opened as needed
until the class is found.

**Overrides:**
- findClass

in class

ClassLoader

**Parameters:**
- name

- the name of the class

**Returns:**
- the resulting class

**Throws:**
- ClassNotFoundException

- if the class could not be found,

- a

URL

for the resource, or

null

if the resource could not be found, or if the loader is closed.

---

#### public
Enumeration
<
URL
> findResources​(
String
name)
throws
IOException

Returns an Enumeration of URLs representing all of the resources
on the URL search path having the specified name.

**Overrides:**
- findResources

in class

---

#### protected
PermissionCollection
getPermissions​(
CodeSource
codesource)

Returns the permissions for the given codesource object.
The implementation of this method first calls super.getPermissions
and then adds permissions based on the URL of the codesource.

If the protocol of this URL is "jar", then the permission granted
is based on the permission that is required by the URL of the Jar
file.

If the protocol is "file" and there is an authority component, then
permission to connect to and accept connections from that authority
may be granted. If the protocol is "file"
and the path specifies a file, then permission to read that
file is granted. If protocol is "file" and the path is
a directory, permission is granted to read all files
and (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in
that directory.

If the protocol is not "file", then permission
to connect to and accept connections from the URL's host is granted.

**Overrides:**
- getPermissions

in class

SecureClassLoader

**Parameters:**
- codesource

- the codesource

**Returns:**
- the permissions granted to the codesource

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

codesource

is

null

.

#### public static
URLClassLoader
newInstance​(
URL
[] urls,

ClassLoader
parent)

Creates a new instance of URLClassLoader for the specified
URLs and parent class loader. If a security manager is
installed, the

loadClass

method of the URLClassLoader
returned by this method will invoke the

SecurityManager.checkPackageAccess

method before
loading the class.

**Parameters:**
- urls

- the URLs to search for classes and resources
- parent

- the parent class loader for delegation

**Returns:**
- the resulting class loader

URLs and default parent class loader. If a security manager is
installed, the

loadClass

method of the URLClassLoader
returned by this method will invoke the

SecurityManager.checkPackageAccess

before
loading the class.

**Parameters:**
- urls

- the URLs to search for classes and resources

**Returns:**
- the resulting class loader

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

urls

or any of its
elements is

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getResourceAsStream

```java
public
InputStream
getResourceAsStream​(
String
name)
```

Returns an input stream for reading the specified resource.
If this loader is closed, then any resources opened by this method
will be closed.

The search order is described in the documentation for

ClassLoader.getResource(String)

.

**Overrides:** getResourceAsStream

in class

ClassLoader
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** An input stream for reading the resource, or

null

if the resource could not be found
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

name

is

null
**Since:** 1.7

- close

```java
public void close()
throws
IOException
```

Closes this URLClassLoader, so that it can no longer be used to load
new classes or resources that are defined by this loader.
Classes and resources defined by any of this loader's parents in the
delegation hierarchy are still accessible. Also, any classes or resources
that are already loaded, are still accessible.

In the case of jar: and file: URLs, it also closes any files
that were opened by it. If another thread is loading a
class when the

close

method is invoked, then the result of
that load is undefined.

The method makes a best effort attempt to close all opened files,
by catching

IOException

s internally. Unchecked exceptions
and errors are not caught. Calling close on an already closed
loader has no effect.

**Specified by:** close

in interface

AutoCloseable
**Specified by:** close

in interface

Closeable
**Throws:** IOException

- if closing any file opened by this class loader
resulted in an IOException. Any such exceptions are caught internally.
If only one is caught, then it is re-thrown. If more than one exception
is caught, then the second and following exceptions are added
as suppressed exceptions of the first one caught, which is then re-thrown.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is set, and it denies

RuntimePermission

("closeClassLoader")
**Since:** 1.7

- addURL

```java
protected void addURL​(
URL
url)
```

URLs and default parent class loader. If a security manager is
installed, the

loadClass

method of the URLClassLoader
returned by this method will invoke the

SecurityManager.checkPackageAccess

before
loading the class.

**Parameters:** urls

- the URLs to search for classes and resources
**Returns:** the resulting class loader
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

urls

or any of its
elements is

null

.

#### Method Detail

getResourceAsStream

```java
public
InputStream
getResourceAsStream​(
String
name)
```

If this loader is closed, then any resources opened by this method
will be closed.

The search order is described in the documentation for

ClassLoader.getResource(String)

.

**Overrides:** getResourceAsStream

in class

ClassLoader
**Parameters:** name

- The resource name
**Returns:** An input stream for reading the resource, or

null

if the resource could not be found
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- If

name

is

null

close

```java
public void close()
throws
IOException
```

Closes this URLClassLoader, so that it can no longer be used to load
new classes or resources that are defined by this loader.
Classes and resources defined by any of this loader's parents in the
delegation hierarchy are still accessible. Also, any classes or resources
that are already loaded, are still accessible.

In the case of jar: and file: URLs, it also closes any files
that were opened by it. If another thread is loading a
class when the

close

method is invoked, then the result of
that load is undefined.

The method makes a best effort attempt to close all opened files,
by catching

IOException

s internally. Unchecked exceptions
and errors are not caught. Calling close on an already closed
loader has no effect.

**Specified by:** close

in interface

AutoCloseable
**Specified by:** close

in interface

Closeable
**Throws:** IOException

- if closing any file opened by this class loader
resulted in an IOException. Any such exceptions are caught internally.
If only one is caught, then it is re-thrown. If more than one exception
is caught, then the second and following exceptions are added
as suppressed exceptions of the first one caught, which is then re-thrown.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager is set, and it denies

RuntimePermission

("closeClassLoader")
**Since:** 1.7

getPermissions

```java
protected
PermissionCollection
getPermissions​(
CodeSource
codesource)
```

Returns the permissions for the given codesource object.
The implementation of this method first calls super.getPermissions
and then adds permissions based on the URL of the codesource.

If the protocol of this URL is "jar", then the permission granted
is based on the permission that is required by the URL of the Jar
file.

If the protocol is "file" and there is an authority component, then
permission to connect to and accept connections from that authority
may be granted. If the protocol is "file"
and the path specifies a file, then permission to read that
file is granted. If protocol is "file" and the path is
a directory, permission is granted to read all files
and (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in
that directory.

If the protocol is not "file", then permission
to connect to and accept connections from the URL's host is granted.
