# Class IdentityHashMap<K,​V>

### Class Description

```java
public class
IdentityHashMap<K,​V>

extends
AbstractMap
<K,​V>
implements
Map
<K,​V>,
Serializable
,
Cloneable
```

This class implements the

Map

interface with a hash table, using
reference-equality in place of object-equality when comparing keys (and
values). In other words, in an

IdentityHashMap

, two keys

k1

and

k2

are considered equal if and only if

(k1==k2)

. (In normal

Map

implementations (like

HashMap

) two keys

k1

and

k2

are considered equal
if and only if

(k1==null ? k2==null : k1.equals(k2))

.)

This class is

not

a general-purpose

Map

implementation! While this class implements the

Map

interface, it
intentionally violates

Map's

general contract, which mandates the
use of the

equals

method when comparing objects. This class is
designed for use only in the rare cases wherein reference-equality
semantics are required.

A typical use of this class is

topology-preserving object graph
transformations

, such as serialization or deep-copying. To perform such
a transformation, a program must maintain a "node table" that keeps track
of all the object references that have already been processed. The node
table must not equate distinct objects even if they happen to be equal.
Another typical use of this class is to maintain

proxy objects

. For
example, a debugging facility might wish to maintain a proxy object for
each object in the program being debugged.

This class provides all of the optional map operations, and permits

null

values and the

null

key. This class makes no
guarantees as to the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee
that the order will remain constant over time.

This class provides constant-time performance for the basic
operations (

get

and

put

), assuming the system
identity hash function (

System.identityHashCode(Object)

)
disperses elements properly among the buckets.

This class has one tuning parameter (which affects performance but not
semantics):

expected maximum size

. This parameter is the maximum
number of key-value mappings that the map is expected to hold. Internally,
this parameter is used to determine the number of buckets initially
comprising the hash table. The precise relationship between the expected
maximum size and the number of buckets is unspecified.

If the size of the map (the number of key-value mappings) sufficiently
exceeds the expected maximum size, the number of buckets is increased.
Increasing the number of buckets ("rehashing") may be fairly expensive, so
it pays to create identity hash maps with a sufficiently large expected
maximum size. On the other hand, iteration over collection views requires
time proportional to the number of buckets in the hash table, so it
pays not to set the expected maximum size too high if you are especially
concerned with iteration performance or memory usage.

Note that this implementation is not synchronized.

If multiple threads access an identity hash map concurrently, and at
least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it

must

be synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation
that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value
associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a
structural modification.) This is typically accomplished by
synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.

If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the

Collections.synchronizedMap

method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
unsynchronized access to the map:

```java
Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new IdentityHashMap(...));
```

The iterators returned by the

iterator

method of the
collections returned by all of this class's "collection view
methods" are

fail-fast

: if the map is structurally modified
at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except
through the iterator's own

remove

method, the iterator
will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the
face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and
cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior
at an undetermined time in the future.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

fail-fast iterators should be used only
to detect bugs.

Implementation note: This is a simple

linear-probe

hash table,
as described for example in texts by Sedgewick and Knuth. The array
alternates holding keys and values. (This has better locality for large
tables than does using separate arrays.) For many JRE implementations
and operation mixes, this class will yield better performance than

HashMap

(which uses

chaining

rather than linear-probing).

This class is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public IdentityHashMap()

Constructs a new, empty identity hash map with a default expected
maximum size (21).

---

#### public IdentityHashMap​(int expectedMaxSize)

Constructs a new, empty map with the specified expected maximum size.
Putting more than the expected number of key-value mappings into
the map may cause the internal data structure to grow, which may be
somewhat time-consuming.

**Parameters:**
- expectedMaxSize

- the expected maximum size of the map

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

expectedMaxSize

is negative

---

#### public IdentityHashMap​(
Map
<? extends
K
,​? extends
V
> m)

Constructs a new identity hash map containing the keys-value mappings
in the specified map.

**Parameters:**
- m

- the map whose mappings are to be placed into this map

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the specified map is null

---

### Method Details

#### public
V
get​(
Object
key)

Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key

k

to a value

v

such that

(key == k)

,
then this method returns

v

; otherwise it returns

null

. (There can be at most one such mapping.)

A return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map contains no mapping for the key; it's also
possible that the map explicitly maps the key to

null

.
The

containsKey

operation may be used to
distinguish these two cases.

**Specified by:**

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
o)

Compares the specified object with this map for equality. Returns

true

if the given object is also a map and the two maps
represent identical object-reference mappings. More formally, this
map is equal to another map

m

if and only if

this.entrySet().equals(m.entrySet())

.

Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of this map it is
possible that the symmetry and transitivity requirements of the

Object.equals

contract may be violated if this map is compared
to a normal map. However, the

Object.equals

contract is
guaranteed to hold among

IdentityHashMap

instances.

**Specified by:**
- equals

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

AbstractMap

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- o

- object to be compared for equality with this map

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified object is equal to this map

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(Object)

---

#### public int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this map. The hash code of a map is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's

entrySet()

view. This ensures that

m1.equals(m2)

implies that

m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()

for any two

IdentityHashMap

instances

m1

and

m2

, as
required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of the

Map.Entry

instances in the set returned by this map's

entrySet

method, it is possible that the contractual
requirement of

Object.hashCode

mentioned in the previous
paragraph will be violated if one of the two objects being compared is
an

IdentityHashMap

instance and the other is a normal map.

**Specified by:**
- hashCode

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

AbstractMap

<

K

,​

V

>

**Returns:**
- the hash code value for this map

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(Object)

,

equals(Object)

---

#### public
Object
clone()

Returns a shallow copy of this identity hash map: the keys and values
themselves are not cloned.

**Overrides:**
- clone

in class

AbstractMap

<

K

,​

V

>

**Returns:**
- a shallow copy of this map

**See Also:**
- Cloneable

---

#### public
Set
<
K
> keySet()

Returns an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in
the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration
over the set is in progress, the results of the iteration are
undefined. The set supports element removal, which removes the
corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

methods. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

methods.

While the object returned by this method implements the

Set

interface, it does

not

obey

Set's

general
contract. Like its backing map, the set returned by this method
defines element equality as reference-equality rather than
object-equality. This affects the behavior of its

contains

,

remove

,

containsAll

,

equals

, and

hashCode

methods.

The

equals

method of the returned set returns

true

only if the specified object is a set containing exactly the same
object references as the returned set. The symmetry and transitivity
requirements of the

Object.equals

contract may be violated if
the set returned by this method is compared to a normal set. However,
the

Object.equals

contract is guaranteed to hold among sets
returned by this method.

The

hashCode

method of the returned set returns the sum of
the

identity hashcodes

of the elements in the set, rather than
the sum of their hashcodes. This is mandated by the change in the
semantics of the

equals

method, in order to enforce the
general contract of the

Object.hashCode

method among sets
returned by this method.

**Specified by:**
- keySet

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Overrides:**
- keySet

in class

AbstractMap

<

K

,​

V

>

**Returns:**
- an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(Object)

---

#### public
Collection
<
V
> values()

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress,
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

methods. It does not
support the

add

or

addAll

methods.

While the object returned by this method implements the

Collection

interface, it does

not

obey

Collection's

general contract. Like its backing map,
the collection returned by this method defines element equality as
reference-equality rather than object-equality. This affects the
behavior of its

contains

,

remove

and

containsAll

methods.

**Specified by:**
- values

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Overrides:**
- values

in class

AbstractMap

<

K

,​

V

>

**Returns:**
- a collection view of the values contained in this map

---

#### public
Set
<
Map.Entry
<
K
,​
V
>> entrySet()

Returns a

Set

view of the mappings contained in this map.
Each element in the returned set is a reference-equality-based

Map.Entry

. The set is backed by the map, so changes
to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the
map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress,
the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports
element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from
the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

methods. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

methods.

Like the backing map, the

Map.Entry

objects in the set
returned by this method define key and value equality as
reference-equality rather than object-equality. This affects the
behavior of the

equals

and

hashCode

methods of these

Map.Entry

objects. A reference-equality based

Map.Entry
e

is equal to an object

o

if and only if

o

is a

Map.Entry

and

e.getKey()==o.getKey() &&
e.getValue()==o.getValue()

. To accommodate these equals
semantics, the

hashCode

method returns

System.identityHashCode(e.getKey()) ^
System.identityHashCode(e.getValue())

.

Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of the

Map.Entry

instances in the set returned by this method,
it is possible that the symmetry and transitivity requirements of
the

Object.equals(Object)

contract may be violated if any of
the entries in the set is compared to a normal map entry, or if
the set returned by this method is compared to a set of normal map
entries (such as would be returned by a call to this method on a normal
map). However, the

Object.equals

contract is guaranteed to
hold among identity-based map entries, and among sets of such entries.

**Specified by:**
- entrySet

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Returns:**
- a set view of the identity-mappings contained in this map

and operation mixes, this class will yield better performance than

HashMap

(which uses

chaining

rather than linear-probing).

This class is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

This class is

not

a general-purpose

Map

implementation! While this class implements the

Map

interface, it
intentionally violates

Map's

general contract, which mandates the
use of the

equals

method when comparing objects. This class is
designed for use only in the rare cases wherein reference-equality
semantics are required.

A typical use of this class is

topology-preserving object graph
transformations

, such as serialization or deep-copying. To perform such
a transformation, a program must maintain a "node table" that keeps track
of all the object references that have already been processed. The node
table must not equate distinct objects even if they happen to be equal.
Another typical use of this class is to maintain

proxy objects

. For
example, a debugging facility might wish to maintain a proxy object for
each object in the program being debugged.

This class provides all of the optional map operations, and permits

null

values and the

null

key. This class makes no
guarantees as to the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee
that the order will remain constant over time.

This class provides constant-time performance for the basic
operations (

get

and

put

), assuming the system
identity hash function (

System.identityHashCode(Object)

)
disperses elements properly among the buckets.

This class has one tuning parameter (which affects performance but not
semantics):

expected maximum size

. This parameter is the maximum
number of key-value mappings that the map is expected to hold. Internally,
this parameter is used to determine the number of buckets initially
comprising the hash table. The precise relationship between the expected
maximum size and the number of buckets is unspecified.

If the size of the map (the number of key-value mappings) sufficiently
exceeds the expected maximum size, the number of buckets is increased.
Increasing the number of buckets ("rehashing") may be fairly expensive, so
it pays to create identity hash maps with a sufficiently large expected
maximum size. On the other hand, iteration over collection views requires
time proportional to the number of buckets in the hash table, so it
pays not to set the expected maximum size too high if you are especially
concerned with iteration performance or memory usage.

Note that this implementation is not synchronized.

If multiple threads access an identity hash map concurrently, and at
least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it

must

be synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation
that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value
associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a
structural modification.) This is typically accomplished by
synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.

If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the

Collections.synchronizedMap

method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
unsynchronized access to the map:

```java
Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new IdentityHashMap(...));
```

The iterators returned by the

iterator

method of the
collections returned by all of this class's "collection view
methods" are

fail-fast

: if the map is structurally modified
at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except
through the iterator's own

remove

method, the iterator
will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the
face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and
cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior
at an undetermined time in the future.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

fail-fast iterators should be used only
to detect bugs.

Implementation note: This is a simple

linear-probe

hash table,
as described for example in texts by Sedgewick and Knuth. The array
alternates holding keys and values. (This has better locality for large
tables than does using separate arrays.) For many JRE implementations
and operation mixes, this class will yield better performance than

HashMap

chaining

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- IdentityHashMap

```java
public IdentityHashMap()
```

Constructs a new, empty identity hash map with a default expected
maximum size (21).

- IdentityHashMap

```java
public IdentityHashMap​(int expectedMaxSize)
```

Constructs a new, empty map with the specified expected maximum size.
Putting more than the expected number of key-value mappings into
the map may cause the internal data structure to grow, which may be
somewhat time-consuming.

**Parameters:** expectedMaxSize

- the expected maximum size of the map
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

expectedMaxSize

is negative

- IdentityHashMap

```java
public IdentityHashMap​(
Map
<? extends
K
,​? extends
V
> m)
```

Constructs a new identity hash map containing the keys-value mappings
in the specified map.

**Parameters:** m

- the map whose mappings are to be placed into this map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified map is null

- get

```java
public
V
get​(
Object
key)
```

Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key

k

to a value

v

such that

(key == k)

,
then this method returns

v

; otherwise it returns

null

. (There can be at most one such mapping.)

A return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map contains no mapping for the key; it's also
possible that the map explicitly maps the key to

null

.
The

containsKey

operation may be used to
distinguish these two cases.

(A

null

return can also indicate that the map

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Compares the specified object with this map for equality. Returns

true

if the given object is also a map and the two maps
represent identical object-reference mappings. More formally, this
map is equal to another map

m

if and only if

this.entrySet().equals(m.entrySet())

.

Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of this map it is
possible that the symmetry and transitivity requirements of the

Object.equals

contract may be violated if this map is compared
to a normal map. However, the

Object.equals

contract is
guaranteed to hold among

IdentityHashMap

instances.

**Specified by:** equals

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Overrides:** equals

in class

AbstractMap

<

K

,​

>
**Parameters:** o

- object to be compared for equality with this map
**Returns:** true

if the specified object is equal to this map
**See Also:** Object.equals(Object)

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this map. The hash code of a map is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's

entrySet()

view. This ensures that

m1.equals(m2)

implies that

m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()

for any two

IdentityHashMap

instances

m1

and

m2

, as
required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of the

Map.Entry

instances in the set returned by this map's

entrySet

method, it is possible that the contractual
requirement of

Object.hashCode

mentioned in the previous
paragraph will be violated if one of the two objects being compared is
an

IdentityHashMap

instance and the other is a normal map.

**Specified by:** hashCode

in interface

Map

<

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

**Returns:** the hash code value for this map
**See Also:** Object.equals(Object)

equals(Object)

- clone

```java
public
Object
clone()
```

Returns a shallow copy of this identity hash map: the keys and values
themselves are not cloned.

**Overrides:** clone

in class

AbstractMap

<

K

,​

V

>
**Returns:** a shallow copy of this map
**See Also:** Cloneable

- keySet

```java
public
Set
<
K
> keySet()
```

Returns an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in
the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration
over the set is in progress, the results of the iteration are
undefined. The set supports element removal, which removes the
corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

methods. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

methods.

While the object returned by this method implements the

Set

interface, it does

not

obey

Set's

general
contract. Like its backing map, the set returned by this method
defines element equality as reference-equality rather than
object-equality. This affects the behavior of its

contains

,

remove

,

containsAll

,

equals

, and

hashCode

methods.

The

equals

method of the returned set returns

true

only if the specified object is a set containing exactly the same
object references as the returned set. The symmetry and transitivity
requirements of the

Object.equals

contract may be violated if
the set returned by this method is compared to a normal set. However,
the

Object.equals

contract is guaranteed to hold among sets
returned by this method.

The

hashCode

method of the returned set returns the sum of
the

identity hashcodes

of the elements in the set, rather than
the sum of their hashcodes. This is mandated by the change in the
semantics of the

equals

method, in order to enforce the
general contract of the

Object.hashCode

method among sets
returned by this method.

**Specified by:** keySet

**See Also:** Object.equals(Object)

System.identityHashCode(Object)

- values

```java
public
Collection
<
V
> values()
```

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress,
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

methods. It does not
support the

add

or

addAll

methods.

While the object returned by this method implements the

Collection

interface, it does

not

obey

Collection's

general contract. Like its backing map,
the collection returned by this method defines element equality as
reference-equality rather than object-equality. This affects the
behavior of its

contains

,

remove

and

containsAll

methods.

**Returns:** a collection view of the values contained in this map

- entrySet

```java
public
Set
<
Map.Entry
<
K
,​
V
>> entrySet()
```

Returns a

Set

view of the mappings contained in this map.
Each element in the returned set is a reference-equality-based

Map.Entry

. The set is backed by the map, so changes
to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the
map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress,
the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports
element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from
the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

methods. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

methods.

Like the backing map, the

Map.Entry

objects in the set
returned by this method define key and value equality as
reference-equality rather than object-equality. This affects the
behavior of the

equals

and

hashCode

methods of these

Map.Entry

objects. A reference-equality based

Map.Entry
e

is equal to an object

o

if and only if

o

is a

Map.Entry

and

e.getKey()==o.getKey() &&
e.getValue()==o.getValue()

. To accommodate these equals
semantics, the

hashCode

method returns

System.identityHashCode(e.getKey()) ^
System.identityHashCode(e.getValue())

.

Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of the

Map.Entry

instances in the set returned by this method,
it is possible that the symmetry and transitivity requirements of
the

Object.equals(Object)

contract may be violated if any of
the entries in the set is compared to a normal map entry, or if
the set returned by this method is compared to a set of normal map
entries (such as would be returned by a call to this method on a normal
map). However, the

Object.equals

contract is guaranteed to
hold among identity-based map entries, and among sets of such entries.

if and only if

this.entrySet().equals(m.entrySet())

- hashCode

```java

Returns the hash code value for this map. The hash code of a map is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's

view. This ensures that

m1.equals(m2)

implies that

m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()

- keySet

```java

Returns an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in
the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration

methods.

The

equals

method of the returned set returns

true

only if the specified object is a set containing exactly the same
object references as the returned set. The symmetry and transitivity
requirements of the

Object.equals

contract may be violated if
the set returned by this method is compared to a normal set. However,
the

Object.equals

contract is guaranteed to hold among sets
returned by this method.

The

hashCode

method of the returned set returns the sum of
the

identity hashcodes

of the elements in the set, rather than
the sum of their hashcodes. This is mandated by the change in the
semantics of the

method, in order to enforce the
general contract of the

Object.hashCode

method among sets
returned by this method.

Returns a

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress,
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding

the collection returned by this method defines element equality as
reference-equality rather than object-equality. This affects the

Returns a

Each element in the returned set is a reference-equality-based

Map.Entry

. The set is backed by the map, so changes
to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the

Like the backing map, the

Map.Entry

objects in the set
returned by this method define key and value equality as
reference-equality rather than object-equality. This affects the
behavior of the

methods of these

Map.Entry

objects. A reference-equality based

Map.Entry
e

is equal to an object

o

if and only if

o

is a

Map.Entry

and

e.getKey()==o.getKey() &&
e.getValue()==o.getValue()

. To accommodate these equals
semantics, the

hashCode

method returns

System.identityHashCode(e.getKey()) ^
System.identityHashCode(e.getValue())

.

Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of the

Map.Entry

instances in the set returned by this method,
it is possible that the symmetry and transitivity requirements of
the

Object.equals(Object)

contract may be violated if any of
the entries in the set is compared to a normal map entry, or if
the set returned by this method is compared to a set of normal map
entries (such as would be returned by a call to this method on a normal

o

if and only if

o

is a

Map.Entry

and

e.getKey()==o.getKey() &&
e.getValue()==o.getValue()

. To accommodate these equals
semantics, the

hashCode

method returns

System.identityHashCode(e.getKey()) ^
System.identityHashCode(e.getValue())

.

Owing to the reference-equality-based semantics of the

Map.Entry

instances in the set returned by this method,
it is possible that the symmetry and transitivity requirements of
the

Object.equals(Object)

contract may be violated if any of
the entries in the set is compared to a normal map entry, or if
the set returned by this method is compared to a set of normal map
entries (such as would be returned by a call to this method on a normal
map). However, the

Object.equals

contract is guaranteed to
hold among identity-based map entries, and among sets of such entries.

Like the backing map, the

Map.Entry

objects in the set
returned by this method define key and value equality as
reference-equality rather than object-equality. This affects the
behavior of the

equals

and

hashCode

methods of these

Map.Entry

objects. A reference-equality based

Map.Entry
e

is equal to an object

o

if and only if

o

is a

Map.Entry

and

e.getKey()==o.getKey() &&
e.getValue()==o.getValue()

. To accommodate these equals
semantics, the

hashCode

method returns

System.identityHashCode(e.getKey()) ^
System.identityHashCode(e.getValue())
