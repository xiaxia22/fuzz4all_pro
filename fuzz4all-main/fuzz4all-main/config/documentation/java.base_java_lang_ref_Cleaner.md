# Class Cleaner

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\ref\Cleaner.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
Cleaner

extends
Object
```

Cleaner

manages a set of object references and corresponding cleaning actions.

Cleaning actions are

registered

to run after the cleaner is notified that the object has become
phantom reachable.
The cleaner uses

PhantomReference

and

ReferenceQueue

to be
notified when the

reachability

changes.

Each cleaner operates independently, managing the pending cleaning actions
and handling threading and termination when the cleaner is no longer in use.
Registering an object reference and corresponding cleaning action returns
a

Cleanable

. The most efficient use is to explicitly invoke
the

clean

method when the object is closed or
no longer needed.
The cleaning action is a

Runnable

to be invoked at most once when
the object has become phantom reachable unless it has already been explicitly cleaned.
Note that the cleaning action must not refer to the object being registered.
If so, the object will not become phantom reachable and the cleaning action
will not be invoked automatically.

The execution of the cleaning action is performed
by a thread associated with the cleaner.
All exceptions thrown by the cleaning action are ignored.
The cleaner and other cleaning actions are not affected by
exceptions in a cleaning action.
The thread runs until all registered cleaning actions have
completed and the cleaner itself is reclaimed by the garbage collector.

The behavior of cleaners during

System.exit

is implementation specific. No guarantees are made relating
to whether cleaning actions are invoked or not.

Unless otherwise noted, passing a

null

argument to a constructor or
method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

**API Note:** The cleaning action is invoked only after the associated object becomes
phantom reachable, so it is important that the object implementing the
cleaning action does not hold references to the object.
In this example, a static class encapsulates the cleaning state and action.
An "inner" class, anonymous or not, must not be used because it implicitly
contains a reference to the outer instance, preventing it from becoming
phantom reachable.
The choice of a new cleaner or sharing an existing cleaner is determined
by the use case.

If the CleaningExample is used in a try-finally block then the

close

method calls the cleaning action.
If the

close

method is not called, the cleaning action is called
by the Cleaner when the CleaningExample instance has become phantom reachable.

```java
public class CleaningExample implements AutoCloseable {
// A cleaner, preferably one shared within a library
private static final Cleaner cleaner = <cleaner>;

static class State implements Runnable {

State(...) {
// initialize State needed for cleaning action
}

public void run() {
// cleanup action accessing State, executed at most once
}
}

private final State;
private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable

public CleaningExample() {
this.state = new State(...);
this.cleanable = cleaner.register(this, state);
}

public void close() {
cleanable.clean();
}
}
```

The cleaning action could be a lambda but all too easily will capture
the object reference, by referring to fields of the object being cleaned,
preventing the object from becoming phantom reachable.
Using a static nested class, as above, will avoid accidentally retaining the
object reference.

Cleaning actions should be prepared to be invoked concurrently with
other cleaning actions.
Typically the cleaning actions should be very quick to execute
and not block. If the cleaning action blocks, it may delay processing
other cleaning actions registered to the same cleaner.
All cleaning actions registered to a cleaner should be mutually compatible.

### Constructor Details

### Method Details

#### public static
Cleaner
create()

Returns a new

Cleaner

.

The cleaner creates a

daemon thread

to process the phantom reachable objects and to invoke cleaning actions.
The

context class loader

of the thread is set to the

system class loader

.
The thread has no permissions, enforced only if a

SecurityManager is set

.

The cleaner terminates when it is phantom reachable and all of the
registered cleaning actions are complete.

**Returns:**
- a new

Cleaner

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if the current thread is not allowed to
create or start the thread.

---

#### public static
Cleaner
create​(
ThreadFactory
threadFactory)

Returns a new

Cleaner

using a

Thread

from the

ThreadFactory

.

A thread from the thread factory's

newThread

method is set to be a

daemon thread

and started to process phantom reachable objects and invoke cleaning actions.
On each call the

thread factory

must provide a Thread that is suitable for performing the cleaning actions.

The cleaner terminates when it is phantom reachable and all of the
registered cleaning actions are complete.

**Parameters:**
- threadFactory

- a

ThreadFactory

to return a new

Thread

to process cleaning actions

**Returns:**
- a new

Cleaner

**Throws:**
- IllegalThreadStateException

- if the thread from the thread
factory was

not a new thread

.
- SecurityException

- if the current thread is not allowed to
create or start the thread.

---

#### public
Cleaner.Cleanable
register​(
Object
obj,

Runnable
action)

Registers an object and a cleaning action to run when the object
becomes phantom reachable.
Refer to the

API Note

above for
cautions about the behavior of cleaning actions.

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to monitor
- action

- a

Runnable

to invoke when the object becomes phantom reachable

**Returns:**
- a

Cleanable

instance
