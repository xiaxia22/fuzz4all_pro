# Class ModuleDescriptor.Version

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\module\ModuleDescriptor.Version.html`

### Class Description

```java
public static final class
ModuleDescriptor.Version

extends
Object

implements
Comparable
<
ModuleDescriptor.Version
>
```

A module's version string.

A version string has three components: The version number itself, an
optional pre-release version, and an optional build version. Each
component is a sequence of tokens; each token is either a non-negative
integer or a string. Tokens are separated by the punctuation characters

'.'

,

'-'

, or

'+'

, or by transitions from a
sequence of digits to a sequence of characters that are neither digits
nor punctuation characters, or vice versa.

- The

version number

is a sequence of tokens separated by

'.'

characters, terminated by the first

'-'

or

'+'

character.
- The

pre-release version

is a sequence of tokens separated
by

'.'

or

'-'

characters, terminated by the first

'+'

character.
- The

build version

is a sequence of tokens separated by

'.'

,

'-'

, or

'+'

characters.

When comparing two version strings, the elements of their
corresponding components are compared in pointwise fashion. If one
component is longer than the other, but otherwise equal to it, then the
first component is considered the greater of the two; otherwise, if two
corresponding elements are integers then they are compared as such;
otherwise, at least one of the elements is a string, so the other is
converted into a string if it is an integer and the two are compared
lexicographically. Trailing integer elements with the value zero are
ignored.

Given two version strings, if their version numbers differ then the
result of comparing them is the result of comparing their version
numbers; otherwise, if one of them has a pre-release version but the
other does not then the first is considered to precede the second,
otherwise the result of comparing them is the result of comparing their
pre-release versions; otherwise, the result of comparing them is the
result of comparing their build versions.

#### public static
ModuleDescriptor.Version
parse​(
String
v)

Parses the given string as a version string.

**Parameters:**
- v

- The string to parse

**Returns:**
- The resulting

Version

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If

v

is

null

, an empty string, or cannot be
parsed as a version string

---

#### public int compareTo​(
ModuleDescriptor.Version
that)

Compares this module version to another module version. Module
versions are compared as described in the class description.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

ModuleDescriptor.Version

>

**Parameters:**
- that

- The module version to compare

**Returns:**
- A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this
module version is less than, equal to, or greater than the
given module version

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
ob)

Tests this module version for equality with the given object.

If the given object is not a

Version

then this method
returns

false

. Two module version are equal if their
corresponding components are equal.

This method satisfies the general contract of the

Object.equals

method.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- ob

- the object to which this object is to be compared

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, the given object is a module
reference that is equal to this module reference

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### public int hashCode()

Computes a hash code for this module version.

The hash code is based upon the components of the version and
satisfies the general contract of the

Object.hashCode

method.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- The hash-code value for this module version

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns the string from which this version was parsed.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- The string from which this version was parsed.
