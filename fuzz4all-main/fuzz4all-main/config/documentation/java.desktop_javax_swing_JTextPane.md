### Class Description

```java
@JavaBean
(
description
="A text component that can be marked up with attributes that are graphically represented.")
public class
JTextPane

extends
JEditorPane
```

A text component that can be marked up with attributes that are
represented graphically.
You can find how-to information and examples of using text panes in

Using Text Components

,
a section in

The Java Tutorial.

This component models paragraphs
that are composed of runs of character level attributes. Each
paragraph may have a logical style attached to it which contains
the default attributes to use if not overridden by attributes set
on the paragraph or character run. Components and images may
be embedded in the flow of text.

Warning:

Swing is not thread safe. For more
information see

Swing's Threading
Policy

Warning:

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public JTextPane()

Creates a new

JTextPane

. A new instance of

StyledEditorKit

is
created and set, and the document model set to

null

.

---

#### public JTextPane​(
StyledDocument
doc)

Creates a new

JTextPane

, with a specified document model.
A new instance of

javax.swing.text.StyledEditorKit

is created and set.

**Parameters:**
- doc

- the document model

---

### Method Details

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
String
getUIClassID()

Returns the class ID for the UI.

**Overrides:**
- getUIClassID

in class

JEditorPane

**Returns:**
- the string "TextPaneUI"

**See Also:**
- JComponent.getUIClassID()

,

UIDefaults.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

---

#### public void setDocument​(
Document
doc)

Associates the editor with a text document. This
must be a

StyledDocument

.

**Overrides:**
- setDocument

in class

JTextComponent

**Parameters:**
- doc

- the document to display/edit

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

doc

can't
be narrowed to a

StyledDocument

which is the
required type of model for this text component

**See Also:**
- JTextComponent.getDocument()

---

#### public void setStyledDocument​(
StyledDocument
doc)

Associates the editor with a text document.
The currently registered factory is used to build a view for
the document, which gets displayed by the editor.

**Parameters:**
- doc

- the document to display/edit

---

#### public
StyledDocument
getStyledDocument()

Fetches the model associated with the editor.

**Returns:**
- the model

---

#### public void replaceSelection​(
String
content)

Replaces the currently selected content with new content
represented by the given string. If there is no selection
this amounts to an insert of the given text. If there
is no replacement text this amounts to a removal of the
current selection. The replacement text will have the
attributes currently defined for input at the point of
insertion. If the document is not editable, beep and return.

**Overrides:**
- replaceSelection

in class

JEditorPane

**Parameters:**
- content

- the content to replace the selection with

---

#### public void insertComponent​(
Component
c)

Inserts a component into the document as a replacement
for the currently selected content. If there is no
selection the component is effectively inserted at the
current position of the caret. This is represented in
the associated document as an attribute of one character
of content.

The component given is the actual component used by the
JTextPane. Since components cannot be a child of more than
one container, this method should not be used in situations
where the model is shared by text components.

The component is placed relative to the text baseline
according to the value returned by

Component.getAlignmentY

. For Swing components
this value can be conveniently set using the method

JComponent.setAlignmentY

. For example, setting
a value of

0.75

will cause 75 percent of the
component to be above the baseline, and 25 percent of the
component to be below the baseline.

**Parameters:**
- c

- the component to insert

---

#### public void insertIcon​(
Icon
g)

Inserts an icon into the document as a replacement
for the currently selected content. If there is no
selection the icon is effectively inserted at the
current position of the caret. This is represented in
the associated document as an attribute of one character
of content.

**Parameters:**
- g

- the icon to insert

**See Also:**
- Icon

---

#### public
Style
addStyle​(
String
nm,

Style
parent)

Adds a new style into the logical style hierarchy. Style attributes
resolve from bottom up so an attribute specified in a child
will override an attribute specified in the parent.

**Parameters:**
- nm

- the name of the style (must be unique within the
collection of named styles). The name may be

null

if the style is unnamed, but the caller is responsible
for managing the reference returned as an unnamed style can't
be fetched by name. An unnamed style may be useful for things
like character attribute overrides such as found in a style
run.
- parent

- the parent style. This may be

null

if unspecified
attributes need not be resolved in some other style.

**Returns:**
- the new

Style

---

#### public void removeStyle​(
String
nm)

Removes a named non-

null

style previously added to
the document.

**Parameters:**
- nm

- the name of the style to remove

---

#### public
Style
getStyle​(
String
nm)

Fetches a named non-

null

style previously added.

**Parameters:**
- nm

- the name of the style

**Returns:**
- the

Style

---

#### public void setLogicalStyle​(
Style
s)

Sets the logical style to use for the paragraph at the
current caret position. If attributes aren't explicitly set
for character and paragraph attributes they will resolve
through the logical style assigned to the paragraph, which
in term may resolve through some hierarchy completely
independent of the element hierarchy in the document.

**Parameters:**
- s

- the logical style to assign to the paragraph,
or

null

for no style

---

#### public
Style
getLogicalStyle()

Fetches the logical style assigned to the paragraph represented
by the current position of the caret, or

null

.

**Returns:**
- the

Style

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
AttributeSet
getCharacterAttributes()

Fetches the character attributes in effect at the
current location of the caret, or

null

.

**Returns:**
- the attributes, or

null

---

#### public void setCharacterAttributes​(
AttributeSet
attr,
boolean replace)

Applies the given attributes to character
content. If there is a selection, the attributes
are applied to the selection range. If there
is no selection, the attributes are applied to
the input attribute set which defines the attributes
for any new text that gets inserted.

**Parameters:**
- attr

- the attributes
- replace

- if true, then replace the existing attributes first

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
AttributeSet
getParagraphAttributes()

Fetches the current paragraph attributes in effect
at the location of the caret, or

null

if none.

**Returns:**
- the attributes

---

#### public void setParagraphAttributes​(
AttributeSet
attr,
boolean replace)

Applies the given attributes to paragraphs. If
there is a selection, the attributes are applied
to the paragraphs that intersect the selection.
If there is no selection, the attributes are applied
to the paragraph at the current caret position.

**Parameters:**
- attr

- the non-

null

attributes
- replace

- if true, replace the existing attributes first

---

#### @BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
MutableAttributeSet

---

#### protected
EditorKit
createDefaultEditorKit()

Creates the

EditorKit

to use by default. This
is implemented to return

javax.swing.text.StyledEditorKit

.

**Overrides:**
- createDefaultEditorKit

in class

JEditorPane

**Returns:**
- the editor kit

---

#### public final void setEditorKit​(
EditorKit
kit)

Sets the currently installed kit for handling
content. This is the bound property that
establishes the content type of the editor.

**Overrides:**
- setEditorKit

in class

JEditorPane

**Parameters:**
- kit

- the desired editor behavior

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if kit is not a

StyledEditorKit

**See Also:**
- JEditorPane.getEditorKit()

---

#### protected
String
paramString()

Returns a string representation of this

JTextPane

.
This method
is intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and the
content and format of the returned string may vary between
implementations. The returned string may be empty but may not
be

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getUIClassID

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)
public
String
getUIClassID()
```

Returns the class ID for the UI.

**Overrides:** getUIClassID

in class

JEditorPane
**Returns:** the string "TextPaneUI"
**See Also:** JComponent.getUIClassID()

,

UIDefaults.getUI(javax.swing.JComponent)

- setDocument

```java
public void setDocument​(
Document
doc)
```

Associates the editor with a text document. This
must be a

StyledDocument

.

**Overrides:** setDocument

in class

JTextComponent
**Parameters:** doc

- the document to display/edit
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

doc

can't
be narrowed to a

StyledDocument

which is the
required type of model for this text component
**See Also:** JTextComponent.getDocument()

- setStyledDocument

```java
public void setStyledDocument​(
StyledDocument
doc)
```

Associates the editor with a text document.
The currently registered factory is used to build a view for
the document, which gets displayed by the editor.

**Parameters:** doc

- the document to display/edit

- getStyledDocument

```java
public
StyledDocument
getStyledDocument()
```

Fetches the model associated with the editor.

**Returns:** the model

- replaceSelection

```java
public void replaceSelection​(
String
content)
```

Replaces the currently selected content with new content
represented by the given string. If there is no selection
this amounts to an insert of the given text. If there
is no replacement text this amounts to a removal of the
current selection. The replacement text will have the
attributes currently defined for input at the point of
insertion. If the document is not editable, beep and return.

**Overrides:** replaceSelection

in class

JEditorPane
**Parameters:** content

- the content to replace the selection with

- insertComponent

```java
public void insertComponent​(
Component
c)
```

Inserts a component into the document as a replacement
for the currently selected content. If there is no
selection the component is effectively inserted at the
current position of the caret. This is represented in
the associated document as an attribute of one character
of content.

The component given is the actual component used by the
JTextPane. Since components cannot be a child of more than
one container, this method should not be used in situations
where the model is shared by text components.

The component is placed relative to the text baseline
according to the value returned by

Component.getAlignmentY

. For Swing components
this value can be conveniently set using the method

JComponent.setAlignmentY

. For example, setting
a value of

0.75

will cause 75 percent of the
component to be above the baseline, and 25 percent of the
component to be below the baseline.

**Parameters:** c

- the component to insert

- insertIcon

```java
public void insertIcon​(
Icon
g)
```

Inserts an icon into the document as a replacement
for the currently selected content. If there is no
selection the icon is effectively inserted at the
current position of the caret. This is represented in
the associated document as an attribute of one character
of content.

**Parameters:** g

- the icon to insert
**See Also:** Icon

- addStyle

```java
public
Style
addStyle​(
String
nm,

Style
parent)
```

Adds a new style into the logical style hierarchy. Style attributes
resolve from bottom up so an attribute specified in a child
will override an attribute specified in the parent.

**Parameters:** nm

- the name of the style (must be unique within the
collection of named styles). The name may be

null

if the style is unnamed, but the caller is responsible
for managing the reference returned as an unnamed style can't
be fetched by name. An unnamed style may be useful for things
like character attribute overrides such as found in a style
run.
**Parameters:** parent

- the parent style. This may be

null

if unspecified
attributes need not be resolved in some other style.
**Returns:** the new

Style

- removeStyle

```java
public void removeStyle​(
String
nm)
```

Removes a named non-

null

style previously added to
the document.

**Parameters:** nm

- the name of the style to remove

- getStyle

```java
public
Style
getStyle​(
String
nm)
```

Fetches a named non-

null

style previously added.

**Parameters:** nm

- the name of the style
**Returns:** the

Style

- setLogicalStyle

```java
public void setLogicalStyle​(
Style
s)
```

Sets the logical style to use for the paragraph at the
current caret position. If attributes aren't explicitly set
for character and paragraph attributes they will resolve
through the logical style assigned to the paragraph, which
in term may resolve through some hierarchy completely
independent of the element hierarchy in the document.

**Parameters:** s

- the logical style to assign to the paragraph,
or

null

for no style

- getLogicalStyle

```java
public
Style
getLogicalStyle()
```

Fetches the logical style assigned to the paragraph represented
by the current position of the caret, or

null

.

**Returns:** the

Style

current location of the caret, or

null

.

**Returns:** the attributes, or

null

- setCharacterAttributes

```java
public void setCharacterAttributes​(
AttributeSet
attr,
boolean replace)
```

Applies the given attributes to character
content. If there is a selection, the attributes
are applied to the selection range. If there
is no selection, the attributes are applied to
the input attribute set which defines the attributes
for any new text that gets inserted.

**Parameters:** attr

- the attributes
**Parameters:** replace

- if true, then replace the existing attributes first

- getParagraphAttributes

```java
@BeanProperty
(
bound
=false)

JTextPane. Since components cannot be a child of more than
one container, this method should not be used in situations
where the model is shared by text components.

The component is placed relative to the text baseline
according to the value returned by

Component.getAlignmentY

. For Swing components
this value can be conveniently set using the method

JComponent.setAlignmentY

. For example, setting
a value of

0.75

will cause 75 percent of the
component to be above the baseline, and 25 percent of the
component to be below the baseline.

insertIcon

```java
public void insertIcon​(
Icon
g)
```

Inserts an icon into the document as a replacement
for the currently selected content. If there is no
selection the icon is effectively inserted at the
current position of the caret. This is represented in
the associated document as an attribute of one character
of content.

**Parameters:** g

- the icon to insert
**See Also:** Icon

of content.

addStyle

```java
public
Style
addStyle​(
String
nm,

Style
parent)
```

Adds a new style into the logical style hierarchy. Style attributes
resolve from bottom up so an attribute specified in a child
will override an attribute specified in the parent.

**Parameters:** nm

- the name of the style (must be unique within the
collection of named styles). The name may be

null

if the style is unnamed, but the caller is responsible
for managing the reference returned as an unnamed style can't
be fetched by name. An unnamed style may be useful for things
like character attribute overrides such as found in a style
run.
**Parameters:** parent

- the parent style. This may be

null

if unspecified
attributes need not be resolved in some other style.
**Returns:** the new

Style
