# Interface JavaFileManager

**Source:** `java.compiler\javax\tools\JavaFileManager.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
JavaFileManager

extends
Closeable
,
Flushable
,
OptionChecker
```

File manager for tools operating on Java™ programming language
source and class files. In this context,

file

means an
abstraction of regular files and other sources of data.

When constructing new JavaFileObjects, the file manager must
determine where to create them. For example, if a file manager
manages regular files on a file system, it would most likely have a
current/working directory to use as default location when creating
or finding files. A number of hints can be provided to a file
manager as to where to create files. Any file manager might choose
to ignore these hints.

Some methods in this interface use class names. Such class
names must be given in the Java Virtual Machine internal form of
fully qualified class and interface names. For convenience '.'
and '/' are interchangeable. The internal form is defined in
chapter four of

The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification

.

Discussion:

this means that the names
"java/lang.package-info", "java/lang/package-info",
"java.lang.package-info", are valid and equivalent. Compare to
binary name as defined in

The Java™ Language Specification

,
section 13.1 "The Form of a Binary".

The case of names is significant. All names should be treated
as case-sensitive. For example, some file systems have
case-insensitive, case-aware file names. File objects representing
such files should take care to preserve case by using

File.getCanonicalFile()

or similar means. If the system is
not case-aware, file objects must use other means to preserve case.

Relative names

:

some
methods in this interface use relative names. A relative name is a
non-null, non-empty sequence of path segments separated by '/'.
'.' or '..' are invalid path segments. A valid relative name must
match the "path-rootless" rule of

RFC 3986

,
section 3.3. Informally, this should be true:

URI.create(relativeName).normalize().getPath().equals(relativeName)

```java
URI.
create
(relativeName).
normalize
().
getPath
().equals(relativeName)
```

All methods in this interface might throw a SecurityException.

An object of this interface is not required to support
multi-threaded access, that is, be synchronized. However, it must
support concurrent access to different file objects created by this
object.

Implementation note:

a consequence of this requirement
is that a trivial implementation of output to a

JarOutputStream

is not a sufficient implementation.
That is, rather than creating a JavaFileObject that returns the
JarOutputStream directly, the contents must be cached until closed
and then written to the JarOutputStream.

Unless explicitly allowed, all methods in this interface might
throw a NullPointerException if given a

null

argument.

file object

for output
representing the specified class of the specified kind in the
given package-oriented location.

Optionally, this file manager might consider the sibling as
a hint for where to place the output. The exact semantics of
this hint is unspecified. The JDK compiler, javac, for
example, will place class files in the same directories as
originating source files unless a class file output directory
is provided. To facilitate this behavior, javac might provide
the originating source file as sibling when calling this
method.

#### FileObject
getFileForInput​(
JavaFileManager.Location
location,

String
packageName,

String
relativeName)
throws
IOException

Returns a

file object

for input
representing the specified

relative
name

in the specified package in the given package-oriented location.

If the returned object represents a

source

or

class

file, it must be an instance
of

JavaFileObject

.

Informally, the file object returned by this method is
located in the concatenation of the location, package name, and
relative name. For example, to locate the properties file
"resources/compiler.properties" in the package
"com.sun.tools.javac" in the

SOURCE_PATH

location, this method
might be called like so:

```java
getFileForInput(SOURCE_PATH, "com.sun.tools.javac", "resources/compiler.properties");
```

If the call was executed on Windows, with SOURCE_PATH set to

"C:\Documents and Settings\UncleBob\src\share\classes"

,
a valid result would be a file object representing the file

"C:\Documents and Settings\UncleBob\src\share\classes\com\sun\tools\javac\resources\compiler.properties"

.

close()

has been called and this file manager cannot be
reopened
- IllegalStateException

- if

close()

has been called
and this file manager cannot be reopened

#### FileObject
getFileForOutput​(
JavaFileManager.Location
location,

String
packageName,

String
relativeName,

FileObject
sibling)
throws
IOException

Returns a

file object

for output
representing the specified

relative
name

in the specified package in the given location.

Optionally, this file manager might consider the sibling as
a hint for where to place the output. The exact semantics of
this hint is unspecified. The JDK compiler, javac, for
example, will place class files in the same directories as
originating source files unless a class file output directory
is provided. To facilitate this behavior, javac might provide
the originating source file as sibling when calling this
method.

If the returned object represents a

source

or

class

file, it must be an instance
of

JavaFileObject

.

Informally, the file object returned by this method is
located in the concatenation of the location, package name, and
relative name or next to the sibling argument. See

getFileForInput

for an example.

**Parameters:**
- location

- an output location
- packageName

- a package name
- relativeName

- a relative name
- sibling

- a file object to be used as hint for placement;

Flushable

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurred

**See Also:**
- close()

---

#### void close()
throws
IOException

Releases any resources opened by this file manager directly or
indirectly. This might render this file manager useless and
the effect of subsequent calls to methods on this object or any
objects obtained through this object is undefined unless
explicitly allowed. However, closing a file manager which has
already been closed has no effect.

**Specified by:**
- close

in interface

AutoCloseable
- close

in interface

Closeable

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurred

**See Also:**

not case-aware, file objects must use other means to preserve case.

Relative names

:

some
methods in this interface use relative names. A relative name is a
non-null, non-empty sequence of path segments separated by '/'.
'.' or '..' are invalid path segments. A valid relative name must
match the "path-rootless" rule of

RFC 3986

,
section 3.3. Informally, this should be true:

URI.create(relativeName).normalize().getPath().equals(relativeName)

```java
URI.
create
(relativeName).
normalize
().
getPath
().equals(relativeName)
```

All methods in this interface might throw a SecurityException.

An object of this interface is not required to support
multi-threaded access, that is, be synchronized. However, it must
support concurrent access to different file objects created by this
object.

Implementation note:

a consequence of this requirement
is that a trivial implementation of output to a

JarOutputStream

is not a sufficient implementation.
That is, rather than creating a JavaFileObject that returns the
JarOutputStream directly, the contents must be cached until closed
and then written to the JarOutputStream.

Unless explicitly allowed, all methods in this interface might
throw a NullPointerException if given a

null

argument.

FileObject
sibling)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a

file object

for output
representing the specified class of the specified kind in the
given package-oriented location.

Optionally, this file manager might consider the sibling as
a hint for where to place the output. The exact semantics of
this hint is unspecified. The JDK compiler, javac, for
example, will place class files in the same directories as
originating source files unless a class file output directory
is provided. To facilitate this behavior, javac might provide
the originating source file as sibling when calling this
method.

**Parameters:** location

- a package-oriented location
**Parameters:** className

- the name of a class
**Parameters:** kind

- the kind of file, must be one of

SOURCE

location,

String
packageName,

String
relativeName)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a

file object

for input
representing the specified

relative
name

in the specified package in the given package-oriented location.

If the returned object represents a

source

or

class

file, it must be an instance
of

JavaFileObject

.

Informally, the file object returned by this method is
located in the concatenation of the location, package name, and
relative name. For example, to locate the properties file
"resources/compiler.properties" in the package
"com.sun.tools.javac" in the

SOURCE_PATH

location, this method
might be called like so:

```java
getFileForInput(SOURCE_PATH, "com.sun.tools.javac", "resources/compiler.properties");
```

If the call was executed on Windows, with SOURCE_PATH set to

"C:\Documents and Settings\UncleBob\src\share\classes"

,
a valid result would be a file object representing the file

"C:\Documents and Settings\UncleBob\src\share\classes\com\sun\tools\javac\resources\compiler.properties"

.

to this file manager and the file manager does not support
unknown locations, or if

relativeName

is not valid,
or if the location is a module-oriented location
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurred, or if

close()

has been called and this file manager cannot be
reopened
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if

close()

has been called
and this file manager cannot be reopened

- getFileForOutput

```java
FileObject
getFileForOutput​(
JavaFileManager.Location
location,

String
packageName,

String
relativeName,

FileObject
sibling)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a

file object

for output
representing the specified

relative
name

in the specified package in the given location.

Optionally, this file manager might consider the sibling as
a hint for where to place the output. The exact semantics of
this hint is unspecified. The JDK compiler, javac, for
example, will place class files in the same directories as
originating source files unless a class file output directory
is provided. To facilitate this behavior, javac might provide
the originating source file as sibling when calling this
method.

If the returned object represents a

source

or

class

file, it must be an instance
of

JavaFileObject

.

Informally, the file object returned by this method is
located in the concatenation of the location, package name, and
relative name or next to the sibling argument. See

getFileForInput

for an example.

**Parameters:** location

- an output location
**Parameters:** packageName

- a package name
**Parameters:** relativeName

- a relative name
**Parameters:** sibling

- a file object to be used as hint for placement;
might be

null

- if an I/O error occurred, or if

close()

has been called and this file manager cannot be
reopened
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if

close()

has been called
and this file manager cannot be reopened

- flush

```java
void flush()
throws
IOException
```

Flushes any resources opened for output by this file manager
directly or indirectly. Flushing a closed file manager has no
effect.

**Specified by:** flush

in interface

Flushable
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurred
**See Also:** close()

- close

```java
void close()
throws
IOException
```

Releases any resources opened by this file manager directly or
indirectly. This might render this file manager useless and
the effect of subsequent calls to methods on this object or any
objects obtained through this object is undefined unless
explicitly allowed. However, closing a file manager which has
already been closed has no effect.

**Specified by:** close

in interface

AutoCloseable
**Specified by:** close

in interface

Closeable
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurred
**See Also:** flush()

getFileForInput(SOURCE_PATH, "com.sun.tools.javac", "resources/compiler.properties");
```

If the call was executed on Windows, with SOURCE_PATH set to

"C:\Documents and Settings\UncleBob\src\share\classes"

,
a valid result would be a file object representing the file

"C:\Documents and Settings\UncleBob\src\share\classes\com\sun\tools\javac\resources\compiler.properties"

.

If the returned object represents a

source

or

class

file, it must be an instance
of

JavaFileObject

.

Informally, the file object returned by this method is
located in the concatenation of the location, package name, and
relative name. For example, to locate the properties file
"resources/compiler.properties" in the package
"com.sun.tools.javac" in the

SOURCE_PATH

location, this method
might be called like so:

```java
getFileForInput(SOURCE_PATH, "com.sun.tools.javac", "resources/compiler.properties");

getFileForOutput

```java
FileObject
getFileForOutput​(
JavaFileManager.Location
location,

String
packageName,

String
relativeName,

FileObject
sibling)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a

file object

for output
representing the specified

relative
name

in the specified package in the given location.

Optionally, this file manager might consider the sibling as
a hint for where to place the output. The exact semantics of
this hint is unspecified. The JDK compiler, javac, for
example, will place class files in the same directories as
originating source files unless a class file output directory
is provided. To facilitate this behavior, javac might provide
the originating source file as sibling when calling this
method.

If the returned object represents a

source

or

class

file, it must be an instance
of

JavaFileObject

.

Informally, the file object returned by this method is
located in the concatenation of the location, package name, and
relative name or next to the sibling argument. See

getFileForInput

for an example.

**Parameters:** location

- an output location
**Parameters:** packageName
