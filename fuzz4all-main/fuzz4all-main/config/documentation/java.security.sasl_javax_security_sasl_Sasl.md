# Class Sasl

**Source:** `java.security.sasl\javax\security\sasl\Sasl.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Sasl

extends
Object
```

A static class for creating SASL clients and servers.

This class defines the policy of how to locate, load, and instantiate
SASL clients and servers.

For example, an application or library gets a SASL client by doing
something like:

```java
SaslClient sc = Sasl.createSaslClient(mechanisms,
authorizationId, protocol, serverName, props, callbackHandler);
```

It can then proceed to use the instance to create an authentication connection.

Similarly, a server gets a SASL server by using code that looks as follows:

```java
SaslServer ss = Sasl.createSaslServer(mechanism,
protocol, serverName, props, callbackHandler);
```

**Since:** 1.5

### Field Details

#### public static final
String
QOP

The name of a property that specifies the quality-of-protection to use.
The property contains a comma-separated, ordered list
of quality-of-protection values that the
client or server is willing to support. A qop value is one of

- "auth"

- authentication only
- "auth-int"

- authentication plus integrity protection
- "auth-conf"

- authentication plus integrity and confidentiality
protection

The order of the list specifies the preference order of the client or
server. If this property is absent, the default qop is

"auth"

.
The value of this constant is

"javax.security.sasl.qop"

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### public static final
String
STRENGTH

The name of a property that specifies the cipher strength to use.
The property contains a comma-separated, ordered list
of cipher strength values that
the client or server is willing to support. A strength value is one of

- "low"
- "medium"
- "high"

The order of the list specifies the preference order of the client or
server. An implementation should allow configuration of the meaning
of these values. An application may use the Java Cryptography
Extension (JCE) with JCE-aware mechanisms to control the selection of
cipher suites that match the strength values.

If this property is absent, the default strength is

"high,medium,low"

.
The value of this constant is

"javax.security.sasl.strength"

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### public static final
String
SERVER_AUTH

The name of a property that specifies whether the
server must authenticate to the client. The property contains

"true"

if the server must
authenticate the to client;

"false"

otherwise.
The default is

"false"

.

The value of this constant is

"javax.security.sasl.server.authentication"

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### public static final
String
BOUND_SERVER_NAME

The name of a property that specifies the bound server name for
an unbound server. A server is created as an unbound server by setting
the

serverName

argument in

createSaslServer(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.util.Map<java.lang.String, ?>, javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler)

as null.
The property contains the bound host name after the authentication
exchange has completed. It is only available on the server side.

The value of this constant is

"javax.security.sasl.bound.server.name"

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### public static final
String
MAX_BUFFER

The name of a property that specifies the maximum size of the receive
buffer in bytes of

SaslClient

/

SaslServer

.
The property contains the string representation of an integer.

If this property is absent, the default size
is defined by the mechanism.

The value of this constant is

"javax.security.sasl.maxbuffer"

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### public static final
String
RAW_SEND_SIZE

The name of a property that specifies the maximum size of the raw send
buffer in bytes of

SaslClient

/

SaslServer

.
The property contains the string representation of an integer.
The value of this property is negotiated between the client and server
during the authentication exchange.

The value of this constant is

"javax.security.sasl.rawsendsize"

.

**See Also:**
- Constant Field Values

---

#### public static final
String
REUSE

The name of a property that specifies whether to reuse previously
authenticated session information. The property contains "true" if the
mechanism implementation may attempt to reuse previously authenticated
session information; it contains "false" if the implementation must
not reuse previously authenticated session information. A setting of
"true" serves only as a hint: it does not necessarily entail actual
reuse because reuse might not be possible due to a number of reasons,
including, but not limited to, lack of mechanism support for reuse,
expiration of reusable information, and the peer's refusal to support
reuse.

The property's default value is "false". The value of this constant
is "javax.security.sasl.reuse".

Note that all other parameters and properties required to create a
SASL client/server instance must be provided regardless of whether
this property has been supplied. That is, you cannot supply any less
information in anticipation of reuse.

Mechanism implementations that support reuse might allow customization
of its implementation, for factors such as cache size, timeouts, and
criteria for reusability. Such customizations are
implementation-dependent.

SaslClient
createSaslClient​(
String
[] mechanisms,

String
authorizationId,

String
protocol,

String
serverName,

Map
<
String
,​?> props,

CallbackHandler
cbh)
throws
SaslException

Creates a

SaslClient

using the parameters supplied.

This method uses the

JCA Security Provider Framework

,
described in the
"Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) Reference Guide", for
locating and selecting a

SaslClient

implementation.

First, it
obtains an ordered list of

SaslClientFactory

instances from
the registered security providers for the "SaslClientFactory" service
and the specified SASL mechanism(s). It then invokes

createSaslClient()

on each factory instance on the list
until one produces a non-null

SaslClient

instance. It returns
the non-null

SaslClient

instance, or null if the search fails
to produce a non-null

SaslClient

instance.

A security provider for SaslClientFactory registers with the
JCA Security Provider Framework keys of the form

SaslClientFactory.

mechanism_name

and values that are class names of implementations of

javax.security.sasl.SaslClientFactory

.

For example, a provider that contains a factory class,

com.wiz.sasl.digest.ClientFactory

, that supports the
"DIGEST-MD5" mechanism would register the following entry with the JCA:

SaslClientFactory.DIGEST-MD5 com.wiz.sasl.digest.ClientFactory

See the
"Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference"
for information about how to install and configure security service
providers.

**Parameters:**
- mechanisms

- The non-null list of mechanism names to try. Each is the
IANA-registered name of a SASL mechanism. (e.g. "GSSAPI", "CRAM-MD5").
- authorizationId

- The possibly null protocol-dependent
identification to be used for authorization.
If null or empty, the server derives an authorization
ID from the client's authentication credentials.
When the SASL authentication completes successfully,
the specified entity is granted access.
- protocol

- The non-null string name of the protocol for which
the authentication is being performed (e.g., "ldap").
- serverName

- The non-null fully-qualified host name of the server
to authenticate to.
- props

- The possibly null set of properties used to
select the SASL mechanism and to configure the authentication
exchange of the selected mechanism.
For example, if

props

contains the

Sasl.POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT

property with the value

"true"

, then the selected
SASL mechanism must not be susceptible to simple plain passive attacks.
In addition to the standard properties declared in this class,
other, possibly mechanism-specific, properties can be included.
Properties not relevant to the selected mechanism are ignored,
including any map entries with non-String keys.
- cbh

- The possibly null callback handler to used by the SASL
mechanisms to get further information from the application/library
to complete the authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism might
require the authentication ID, password and realm from the caller.
The authentication ID is requested by using a

NameCallback

.
The password is requested by using a

PasswordCallback

.
The realm is requested by using a

RealmChoiceCallback

if there is a list
of realms to choose from, and by using a

RealmCallback

if
the realm must be entered.

**Returns:**
- A possibly null

SaslClient

created using the parameters
supplied. If null, cannot find a

SaslClientFactory

that will produce one.

**Throws:**
- SaslException

- If cannot create a

SaslClient

because
of an error.

**Implementation Note:**
- The JDK Reference Implementation additionally uses the

jdk.security.provider.preferred

Security

property to determine
the preferred provider order for the specified algorithm. This
may be different than the order of providers returned by

Security.getProviders()

.

If a mechanism is listed in the

jdk.sasl.disabledMechanisms

security property, it will be ignored and won't be negotiated.

and values that are class names of implementations of

javax.security.sasl.SaslServerFactory

.

For example, a provider that contains a factory class,

SaslServerFactory.DIGEST-MD5 com.wiz.sasl.digest.ServerFactory

See the
"Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference"
for information about how to install and configure security
service providers.

**Parameters:**
- mechanism

- The non-null mechanism name. It must be an
IANA-registered name of a SASL mechanism. (e.g. "GSSAPI", "CRAM-MD5").
- protocol

- The non-null string name of the protocol for which
the authentication is being performed (e.g., "ldap").
- serverName

- The fully qualified host name of the server, or null
if the server is not bound to any specific host name. If the mechanism
does not allow an unbound server, a

SaslException

will
be thrown.
- props

- The possibly null set of properties used to
select the SASL mechanism and to configure the authentication
exchange of the selected mechanism.
For example, if

props

contains the

Sasl.POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT

property with the value

"true"

, then the selected
SASL mechanism must not be susceptible to simple plain passive attacks.
In addition to the standard properties declared in this class,
other, possibly mechanism-specific, properties can be included.
Properties not relevant to the selected mechanism are ignored,
including any map entries with non-String keys.

```java
public static final
String
QOP
```

The name of a property that specifies the quality-of-protection to use.
The property contains a comma-separated, ordered list
of quality-of-protection values that the
client or server is willing to support. A qop value is one of

- "auth"

- authentication only
- "auth-int"

- authentication plus integrity protection
- "auth-conf"

- authentication plus integrity and confidentiality
protection

The order of the list specifies the preference order of the client or
server. If this property is absent, the default qop is

"auth"

.
The value of this constant is

"javax.security.sasl.qop"

[] mechanisms,

String
authorizationId,

String
protocol,

String
serverName,

Map
<
String
,​?> props,

CallbackHandler
cbh)
throws
SaslException
```

Creates a

SaslClient

using the parameters supplied.

This method uses the

JCA Security Provider Framework

,
described in the
"Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) Reference Guide", for
locating and selecting a

SaslClient

implementation.

First, it
obtains an ordered list of

SaslClientFactory

instances from
the registered security providers for the "SaslClientFactory" service
and the specified SASL mechanism(s). It then invokes

createSaslClient()

on each factory instance on the list
until one produces a non-null

SaslClient

instance. It returns
the non-null

SaslClient

instance, or null if the search fails
to produce a non-null

SaslClient

instance.

A security provider for SaslClientFactory registers with the
JCA Security Provider Framework keys of the form

SaslClientFactory.

mechanism_name

and values that are class names of implementations of

javax.security.sasl.SaslClientFactory

.

For example, a provider that contains a factory class,

com.wiz.sasl.digest.ClientFactory

, that supports the
"DIGEST-MD5" mechanism would register the following entry with the JCA:

SaslClientFactory.DIGEST-MD5 com.wiz.sasl.digest.ClientFactory

See the
"Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference"
for information about how to install and configure security service
providers.

**Implementation Note:** The JDK Reference Implementation additionally uses the

jdk.security.provider.preferred

Security

property to determine
the preferred provider order for the specified algorithm. This
may be different than the order of providers returned by

Security.getProviders()

.

If a mechanism is listed in the

jdk.sasl.disabledMechanisms

security property, it will be ignored and won't be negotiated.
**Parameters:** mechanisms

- The non-null list of mechanism names to try. Each is the
IANA-registered name of a SASL mechanism. (e.g. "GSSAPI", "CRAM-MD5").
**Parameters:** authorizationId

- The possibly null protocol-dependent
identification to be used for authorization.
If null or empty, the server derives an authorization
ID from the client's authentication credentials.
When the SASL authentication completes successfully,
the specified entity is granted access.
**Parameters:** protocol

- The non-null string name of the protocol for which
the authentication is being performed (e.g., "ldap").
**Parameters:** serverName

- The non-null fully-qualified host name of the server
to authenticate to.
**Parameters:** props

- The possibly null set of properties used to
select the SASL mechanism and to configure the authentication
exchange of the selected mechanism.
For example, if

props

contains the

Sasl.POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT

property with the value

"true"

, then the selected
SASL mechanism must not be susceptible to simple plain passive attacks.
In addition to the standard properties declared in this class,
other, possibly mechanism-specific, properties can be included.
Properties not relevant to the selected mechanism are ignored,
including any map entries with non-String keys.
**Parameters:** cbh

- The possibly null callback handler to used by the SASL
mechanisms to get further information from the application/library
to complete the authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism might
require the authentication ID, password and realm from the caller.
The authentication ID is requested by using a

NameCallback

.
The password is requested by using a

PasswordCallback

.
The realm is requested by using a

RealmChoiceCallback

if there is a list
of realms to choose from, and by using a

RealmCallback

if
the realm must be entered.
**Returns:** A possibly null

SaslClient

created using the parameters
supplied. If null, cannot find a

SaslClientFactory

that will produce one.
**Throws:** SaslException

- If cannot create a

SaslClient

because
of an error.

REUSE

```java
public static final
String
REUSE
```

The name of a property that specifies whether to reuse previously
authenticated session information. The property contains "true" if the
mechanism implementation may attempt to reuse previously authenticated
session information; it contains "false" if the implementation must
not reuse previously authenticated session information. A setting of
"true" serves only as a hint: it does not necessarily entail actual
reuse because reuse might not be possible due to a number of reasons,
including, but not limited to, lack of mechanism support for reuse,
expiration of reusable information, and the peer's refusal to support
reuse.

The property's default value is "false". The value of this constant
is "javax.security.sasl.reuse".

Note that all other parameters and properties required to create a
SASL client/server instance must be provided regardless of whether
this property has been supplied. That is, you cannot supply any less
information in anticipation of reuse.

[] mechanisms,

String
authorizationId,

String
protocol,

String
serverName,

Map
<
String
,​?> props,

CallbackHandler
cbh)
throws
SaslException
```

Creates a

SaslClient

using the parameters supplied.

This method uses the

JCA Security Provider Framework

,
described in the
"Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) Reference Guide", for
locating and selecting a

SaslClient

implementation.

First, it
obtains an ordered list of

SaslClientFactory

instances from
the registered security providers for the "SaslClientFactory" service
and the specified SASL mechanism(s). It then invokes

createSaslClient()

on each factory instance on the list
until one produces a non-null

SaslClient

instance. It returns
the non-null

SaslClient

instance, or null if the search fails
to produce a non-null

SaslClient

instance.

A security provider for SaslClientFactory registers with the
JCA Security Provider Framework keys of the form

SaslClientFactory.

mechanism_name

and values that are class names of implementations of

javax.security.sasl.SaslClientFactory

.

For example, a provider that contains a factory class,

com.wiz.sasl.digest.ClientFactory

, that supports the
"DIGEST-MD5" mechanism would register the following entry with the JCA:

SaslClientFactory.DIGEST-MD5 com.wiz.sasl.digest.ClientFactory

See the
"Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference"
for information about how to install and configure security service
providers.

**Implementation Note:** The JDK Reference Implementation additionally uses the

jdk.security.provider.preferred

Security

property to determine
the preferred provider order for the specified algorithm. This
may be different than the order of providers returned by

Security.getProviders()

.

If a mechanism is listed in the

jdk.sasl.disabledMechanisms

security property, it will be ignored and won't be negotiated.
**Parameters:** mechanisms

- The non-null list of mechanism names to try. Each is the
IANA-registered name of a SASL mechanism. (e.g. "GSSAPI", "CRAM-MD5").
**Parameters:** authorizationId

- The possibly null protocol-dependent
identification to be used for authorization.
If null or empty, the server derives an authorization
ID from the client's authentication credentials.
When the SASL authentication completes successfully,
the specified entity is granted access.
**Parameters:** protocol

- The non-null string name of the protocol for which
the authentication is being performed (e.g., "ldap").
**Parameters:** serverName

- The non-null fully-qualified host name of the server
to authenticate to.
**Parameters:** props

- The possibly null set of properties used to
select the SASL mechanism and to configure the authentication
exchange of the selected mechanism.
For example, if

props

contains the

Sasl.POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT

property with the value

"true"

, then the selected
SASL mechanism must not be susceptible to simple plain passive attacks.
In addition to the standard properties declared in this class,
other, possibly mechanism-specific, properties can be included.
Properties not relevant to the selected mechanism are ignored,
including any map entries with non-String keys.
**Parameters:** cbh

- The possibly null callback handler to used by the SASL
mechanisms to get further information from the application/library
to complete the authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism might
require the authentication ID, password and realm from the caller.
The authentication ID is requested by using a

NameCallback

.
The password is requested by using a

PasswordCallback

.
The realm is requested by using a

RealmChoiceCallback

if there is a list
of realms to choose from, and by using a

RealmCallback

if
the realm must be entered.
**Returns:** A possibly null

SaslClient

created using the parameters
supplied. If null, cannot find a

SaslClientFactory

that will produce one.
**Throws:** SaslException

- If cannot create a

SaslClient

because
of an error.

to complete the authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism might
require the authentication ID, password and realm from the caller.
The authentication ID is requested by using a

NameCallback

.
The password is requested by using a

PasswordCallback

.
The realm is requested by using a

RealmChoiceCallback

if there is a list
of realms to choose from, and by using a

RealmCallback

if
the realm must be entered.
**Returns:** A possibly null

SaslServer

created using the parameters
supplied. If null, cannot find a

SaslServerFactory

that will produce one.
**Throws:** SaslException

- If cannot create a

SaslServer

because
of an error.

throws

SaslException

Creates a

SaslServer

for the specified mechanism.

This method uses the

JCA Security Provider Framework

,
described in the
"Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) Reference Guide", for
locating and selecting a

SaslClient

implementation.

First, it
obtains an ordered list of

SaslServerFactory

instances from
the registered security providers for the "SaslServerFactory" service
and the specified mechanism. It then invokes

createSaslServer()

on each factory instance on the list
until one produces a non-null

SaslServer

instance. It returns
the non-null

SaslServer

instance, or null if the search fails
to produce a non-null

SaslServer

instance.

A security provider for SaslServerFactory registers with the
JCA Security Provider Framework keys of the form

SaslServerFactory.

mechanism_name

and values that are class names of implementations of

javax.security.sasl.SaslServerFactory

.

For example, a provider that contains a factory class,

com.wiz.sasl.digest.ServerFactory

, that supports the
"DIGEST-MD5" mechanism would register the following entry with the JCA:

SaslServerFactory.DIGEST-MD5 com.wiz.sasl.digest.ServerFactory

See the
"Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference"
for information about how to install and configure security
service providers.
