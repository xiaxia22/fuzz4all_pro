# Class Path2D

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\geom\Path2D.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Path2D

extends
Object

implements
Shape
,
Cloneable
```

The

Path2D

class provides a simple, yet flexible
shape which represents an arbitrary geometric path.
It can fully represent any path which can be iterated by the

PathIterator

interface including all of its segment
types and winding rules and it implements all of the
basic hit testing methods of the

Shape

interface.

Use

Path2D.Float

when dealing with data that can be represented
and used with floating point precision. Use

Path2D.Double

for data that requires the accuracy or range of double precision.

Path2D

provides exactly those facilities required for
basic construction and management of a geometric path and
implementation of the above interfaces with little added
interpretation.
If it is useful to manipulate the interiors of closed
geometric shapes beyond simple hit testing then the

Area

class provides additional capabilities
specifically targeted at closed figures.
While both classes nominally implement the

Shape

interface, they differ in purpose and together they provide
two useful views of a geometric shape where

Path2D

deals primarily with a trajectory formed by path segments
and

Area

deals more with interpretation and manipulation
of enclosed regions of 2D geometric space.

The

PathIterator

interface has more detailed descriptions
of the types of segments that make up a path and the winding rules
that control how to determine which regions are inside or outside
the path.

Transforms the geometry of this path using the specified

AffineTransform

.
The geometry is transformed in place, which permanently changes the
boundary defined by this object.

**Parameters:**

---

#### public final
Shape
createTransformedShape​(
AffineTransform
at)

Returns a new

Shape

representing a transformed version
of this

Path2D

.
Note that the exact type and coordinate precision of the return
value is not specified for this method.
The method will return a Shape that contains no less precision
for the transformed geometry than this

Path2D

currently
maintains, but it may contain no more precision either.
If the tradeoff of precision vs. storage size in the result is
important then the convenience constructors in the

Path2D.Float

and

Path2D.Double

subclasses should be used to make the choice explicit.

**Parameters:**
- at

- the

AffineTransform

used to transform a
new

Shape

Shape

, transformed with the specified

AffineTransform

#### public final
Rectangle
getBounds()

Returns an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses the

Shape

. Note that there is no guarantee that the
returned

Rectangle

is the smallest bounding box that
encloses the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies entirely within the indicated

Rectangle

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a
tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
representation.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then
it must be inside the returned

Rectangle

bounds object
according to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(x,y)

requires

bounds.contains(x,y)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(x,y)

does not imply

shape.contains(x,y)

**Specified by:**
- getBounds

in interface

Shape

**Returns:**
- an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses
the

Shape

.

**See Also:**
- Shape.getBounds2D()

#### public static boolean contains​(
PathIterator
pi,
double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)

Tests if the specified rectangular area is entirely inside the
closed boundary of the specified

PathIterator

.

This method provides a basic facility for implementors of
the

Shape

interface to implement support for the

Shape.contains(double, double, double, double)

method.

This method object may conservatively return false in
cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a
segment of the path, but that segment does not represent a
boundary between the interior and exterior of the path.
Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the
path if they are part of a path with a

WIND_NON_ZERO

winding rule or if the segments are retraced in the reverse
direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each
other out without any exterior area falling between them.
To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of
the interior of the path would require extensive calculations
involving all of the segments of the path and the winding
rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.

method.

This method object may conservatively return false in
cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a

boundary between the interior and exterior of the path.
Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the
path if they are part of a path with a

#### public final boolean contains​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains
the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
the rectangular area must lie within the

Shape

for the
entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the

Shape

.

The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

The

Area

more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

This method object may conservatively return false in
cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a
segment of the path, but that segment does not represent a
boundary between the interior and exterior of the path.
Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the
path if they are part of a path with a

WIND_NON_ZERO

winding rule or if the segments are retraced in the reverse
direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each
other out without any exterior area falling between them.
To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of
the interior of the path would require extensive calculations
involving all of the segments of the path and the winding
rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

#### public final
PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at,
double flatness)

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the

Shape

boundary and provides access to a flattened view of the

Shape

outline geometry.

Only SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, and SEG_CLOSE point types are
returned by the iterator.

If an optional

AffineTransform

is specified,
the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed
accordingly.

The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled
by the

flatness

parameter, which specifies the
maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed
curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments.
Note that a limit on the accuracy of the flattened path might be
silently imposed, causing very small flattening parameters to be
treated as larger values. This limit, if there is one, is
defined by the particular implementation that is used.

Each call to this method returns a fresh

PathIterator

object that traverses the

Shape

object geometry
independently from any other

PathIterator

objects in use at
the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

Shape

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe,
which means that this

Path2D

class does not
guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this

Path2D

object do not affect any iterations of
that geometry that are already in process.

**Specified by:**
- getPathIterator

in interface

Shape

**Parameters:**
- at

- an optional

AffineTransform

to be applied to the
coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or

null

if untransformed coordinates are desired
- flatness

- the maximum distance that the line segments used to
approximate the curved segments are allowed to deviate
from any point on the original curve

**Returns:**
- a new

PathIterator

that independently traverses
a flattened view of the geometry of the

Shape

.

- append

```java
public final void append​(
Shape
s,
boolean connect)
```

Appends the geometry of the specified

Shape

object to the
path, possibly connecting the new geometry to the existing path
segments with a line segment.
If the

connect

parameter is

true

and the
path is not empty then any initial

moveTo

in the
geometry of the appended

Shape

is turned into a

lineTo

segment.
If the destination coordinates of such a connecting

lineTo

segment match the ending coordinates of a currently open
subpath then the segment is omitted as superfluous.
The winding rule of the specified

Shape

is ignored
and the appended geometry is governed by the winding
rule specified for this path.

**Parameters:** s

- the

Shape

whose geometry is appended
to this path
**Parameters:** connect

- a boolean to control whether or not to turn an initial

moveTo

segment into a

If the

connect

parameter is

true

and the
path is not empty then any initial

moveTo

in the
geometry of the appended

Shape

is turned into a

lineTo

segment.
If the destination coordinates of such a connecting

lineTo

segment match the ending coordinates of a currently open
subpath then the segment is omitted as superfluous.
The winding rule of the specified

Shape

is ignored
and the appended geometry is governed by the winding
rule specified for this path.

**Parameters:** pi

- the

PathIterator

whose geometry is appended to
this path
**Parameters:** connect

WIND_EVEN_ODD

or

WIND_NON_ZERO
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** getWindingRule()

- getCurrentPoint

```java
public final
Point2D
getCurrentPoint()
```

Returns the coordinates most recently added to the end of the path
as a

Point2D

object.

**Returns:** a

Point2D

object containing the ending coordinates of
the path or

null

if there are no points in the path.
**Since:** 1.6

- reset

public final void reset()
```

Resets the path to empty. The append position is set back to the
beginning of the path and all coordinates and point types are
forgotten.

**Since:** 1.6

- transform

```java
public abstract void transform​(
AffineTransform
at)
```

Transforms the geometry of this path using the specified

AffineTransform

.
The geometry is transformed in place, which permanently changes the
boundary defined by this object.

**Parameters:** at

- the

AffineTransform

used to transform the area
**Since:** 1.6

- createTransformedShape

```java
public final
Shape
createTransformedShape​(
AffineTransform
at)
```

Returns a new

Shape

representing a transformed version
of this

Path2D

.
Note that the exact type and coordinate precision of the return
value is not specified for this method.
The method will return a Shape that contains no less precision
for the transformed geometry than this

Path2D

currently
maintains, but it may contain no more precision either.
If the tradeoff of precision vs. storage size in the result is
important then the convenience constructors in the

Path2D.Float

and

Path2D.Double

subclasses should be used to make the choice explicit.

**Parameters:** at

- the

AffineTransform

used to transform a
new

Shape

.
**Returns:** a new

Shape

, transformed with the specified

AffineTransform

.
**Since:** 1.6

- getBounds

```java
public final
Rectangle
getBounds()
```

Returns an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses the

Shape

. Note that there is no guarantee that the
returned

Rectangle

is the smallest bounding box that
encloses the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies entirely within the indicated

Rectangle

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a

method, then
it must be inside the returned

- getPathIterator

```java
public final
PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at,
double flatness)
```

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the

Shape

boundary and provides access to a flattened view of the

Shape

outline geometry.

Only SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, and SEG_CLOSE point types are
returned by the iterator.

If an optional

AffineTransform

is specified,
the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed
accordingly.

The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled
by the

flatness

parameter, which specifies the
maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed
curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments.
Note that a limit on the accuracy of the flattened path might be
silently imposed, causing very small flattening parameters to be
treated as larger values. This limit, if there is one, is
defined by the particular implementation that is used.

Each call to this method returns a fresh

PathIterator

object that traverses the

Shape

object geometry
independently from any other

PathIterator

objects in use at
the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

Shape

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe,
which means that this

Path2D

class does not
guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this

Path2D

object do not affect any iterations of
that geometry that are already in process.

**Specified by:** getPathIterator

in interface

Shape
**Parameters:** at

- an optional

AffineTransform

to be applied to the
coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or

Rectangle

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a
tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
representation.

Note that the

contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

This method object may conservatively return false in
cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a
segment of the path, but that segment does not represent a
boundary between the interior and exterior of the path.
Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the
path if they are part of a path with a

winding rule or if the segments are retraced in the reverse
direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each
other out without any exterior area falling between them.

- getPathIterator

```java
public final
PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at,
double flatness)
```

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the

Shape

boundary and provides access to a flattened view of the

Shape

outline geometry.

Only SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, and SEG_CLOSE point types are
returned by the iterator.

If an optional

AffineTransform

is specified,
the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed
accordingly.

The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled
by the

flatness

parameter, which specifies the
maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed
curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments.
Note that a limit on the accuracy of the flattened path might be
silently imposed, causing very small flattening parameters to be
treated as larger values. This limit, if there is one, is
defined by the particular implementation that is used.

Each call to this method returns a fresh

PathIterator

object that traverses the

Shape

object geometry
independently from any other

PathIterator

objects in use at
the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

Shape

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe,
which means that this

Path2D

class does not
guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this

Path2D

object do not affect any iterations of
that geometry that are already in process.

**Specified by:** getPathIterator

in interface

Shape
**Parameters:** at

- an optional

AffineTransform

to be applied to the
coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or

null

if untransformed coordinates are desired
**Parameters:** flatness

- the maximum distance that the line segments used to
approximate the curved segments are allowed to deviate
from any point on the original curve
**Returns:** a new

PathIterator

that independently traverses
a flattened view of the geometry of the

Shape

intersects

```java

```

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified rectangular area.
The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

getPathIterator

```java
public final
PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at,
double flatness)
```

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the

Shape

boundary and provides access to a flattened view of the

Shape

outline geometry.

Only SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, and SEG_CLOSE point types are
returned by the iterator.

If an optional

AffineTransform

is specified,
the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed
accordingly.

The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled
by the

flatness

parameter, which specifies the
maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed
curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments.
Note that a limit on the accuracy of the flattened path might be
silently imposed, causing very small flattening parameters to be
treated as larger values. This limit, if there is one, is
defined by the particular implementation that is used.

Each call to this method returns a fresh

PathIterator

object that traverses the

Shape

object geometry
independently from any other

PathIterator

objects in use at
the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

Shape

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe,
which means that this

Path2D

class does not
guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this

Path2D

object do not affect any iterations of
that geometry that are already in process.

**Specified by:** getPathIterator

in interface

Shape
**Parameters:** at

- an optional

AffineTransform

to be applied to the
coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or

null

if untransformed coordinates are desired
**Parameters:** flatness

- the maximum distance that the line segments used to
approximate the curved segments are allowed to deviate
from any point on the original curve
**Returns:** a new
