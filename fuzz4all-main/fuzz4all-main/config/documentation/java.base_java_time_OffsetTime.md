# Class OffsetTime

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\OffsetTime.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
OffsetTime

extends
Object

implements
Temporal
,
TemporalAdjuster
,
Comparable
<
OffsetTime
>,
Serializable
```

A time with an offset from UTC/Greenwich in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
such as

10:15:30+01:00

.

OffsetTime

is an immutable date-time object that represents a time, often
viewed as hour-minute-second-offset.
This class stores all time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
as well as a zone offset.
For example, the value "13:45:30.123456789+02:00" can be stored
in an

OffsetTime

.

This is a

value-based

class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
(

==

), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of

OffsetTime

may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
The

equals

method should be used for comparisons.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

,

Comparable

,

Temporal

,

TemporalAccessor

,

### Field Details

#### public static final
OffsetTime
MIN

The minimum supported

OffsetTime

, '00:00:00+18:00'.
This is the time of midnight at the start of the day in the maximum offset
(larger offsets are earlier on the time-line).
This combines

LocalTime.MIN

and

ZoneOffset.MAX

.
This could be used by an application as a "far past" date.

---

#### public static final
OffsetTime
MAX

The maximum supported

OffsetTime

, '23:59:59.999999999-18:00'.
This is the time just before midnight at the end of the day in the minimum offset
(larger negative offsets are later on the time-line).
This combines

LocalTime.MAX

and

ZoneOffset.MIN

.
This could be used by an application as a "far future" date.

### Method Details

#### public static
OffsetTime
now()

Obtains the current time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current time.
The offset will be calculated from the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Returns:**
- the current time using the system clock and default time-zone, not null

---

#### public static
OffsetTime
now​(
ZoneId
zone)

Obtains the current time from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current time.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
The offset will be calculated from the specified time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:**
- zone

- the zone ID to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the current time using the system clock, not null

---

#### public static
OffsetTime
now​(
Clock
clock)

Obtains the current time from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current time.
The offset will be calculated from the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

**Parameters:**
- clock

- the clock to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the current time, not null

---

#### public static
OffsetTime
of​(
LocalTime
time,

ZoneOffset
offset)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a local time and an offset.

**Parameters:**
- time

- the local time, not null
- offset

- the zone offset, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset time, not null

---

#### public static
OffsetTime
of​(int hour,
int minute,
int second,
int nanoOfSecond,

ZoneOffset
offset)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from an hour, minute, second and nanosecond.

This creates an offset time with the four specified fields.

This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.

LocalTime

has two additional convenience variants of the
equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.

**Parameters:**
- hour

- the hour-of-day to represent, from 0 to 23
- minute

- the minute-of-hour to represent, from 0 to 59
- second

- the second-of-minute to represent, from 0 to 59
- nanoOfSecond

- the nano-of-second to represent, from 0 to 999,999,999
- offset

- the zone offset, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the value of any field is out of range

---

#### public static
OffsetTime
ofInstant​(
Instant
instant,

ZoneId
zone)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from an

Instant

and zone ID.

This creates an offset time with the same instant as that specified.
Finding the offset from UTC/Greenwich is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant.

The date component of the instant is dropped during the conversion.
This means that the conversion can never fail due to the instant being
out of the valid range of dates.

**Parameters:**
- instant

- the instant to create the time from, not null
- zone

- the time-zone, which may be an offset, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset time, not null

---

#### public static
OffsetTime
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains an offset time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

OffsetTime

.

The conversion extracts and combines the

ZoneOffset

and the

LocalTime

from the temporal object.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

OffsetTime::from

.

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to an

OffsetTime

---

#### public static
OffsetTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a text string such as

10:15:30+01:00

.

The string must represent a valid time and is parsed using

DateTimeFormatter.ISO_OFFSET_TIME

.

**Parameters:**
- text

- the text to parse such as "10:15:30+01:00", not null

**Returns:**
- the parsed local time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

---

#### public static
OffsetTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text,

DateTimeFormatter
formatter)

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a text string using a specific formatter.

The text is parsed using the formatter, returning a time.

**Parameters:**
- text

- the text to parse, not null
- formatter

- the formatter to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the parsed offset time, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

---

#### public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if this time can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The supported fields are:

- NANO_OF_SECOND

NANO_OF_DAY

MICRO_OF_SECOND

MICRO_OF_DAY

MILLI_OF_SECOND

MILLI_OF_DAY

SECOND_OF_MINUTE

MINUTE_OF_HOUR

MINUTE_OF_DAY

HOUR_OF_AMPM

CLOCK_HOUR_OF_AMPM

HOUR_OF_DAY

CLOCK_HOUR_OF_DAY

AMPM_OF_DAY

OFFSET_SECONDS

All other

ChronoField

instances will return false.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

If the unit is a

ChronoUnit

then the query is implemented here.
The supported units are:

- NANOS

MICROS

MILLIS

SECONDS

MINUTES

HOURS

HALF_DAYS

All other

ChronoUnit

instances will return false.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

int

.

This queries this time for the value of the specified field.
The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return valid
values based on this time, except

NANO_OF_DAY

and

MICRO_OF_DAY

which are too large to fit in an

int

and throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

- the zone offset, not null

---

#### public
OffsetTime
withOffsetSameLocal​(
ZoneOffset
offset)

Returns a copy of this

OffsetTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result has the same local time.

This method returns an object with the same

LocalTime

and the specified

ZoneOffset

.
No calculation is needed or performed.
For example, if this time represents

10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

10:30+03:00

.

To take into account the difference between the offsets, and adjust the time fields,
use

withOffsetSameInstant(java.time.ZoneOffset)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- the zone offset to change to, not null

**Returns:**
- an

OffsetTime

based on this time with the requested offset, not null

---

#### public
OffsetTime
withOffsetSameInstant​(
ZoneOffset
offset)

Returns a copy of this

OffsetTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result is at the same instant on an implied day.

This method returns an object with the specified

ZoneOffset

and a

LocalTime

adjusted by the difference between the two offsets.
This will result in the old and new objects representing the same instant on an implied day.
This is useful for finding the local time in a different offset.
For example, if this time represents

10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

11:30+03:00

.

To change the offset without adjusting the local time use

withOffsetSameLocal(java.time.ZoneOffset)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- the zone offset to change to, not null

**Returns:**
- an

OffsetTime

based on this time with the requested offset, not null

---

#### public
LocalTime
toLocalTime()

---

#### public
OffsetTime
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)

Returns an adjusted copy of this time.

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the hour field.
A more complex adjuster might set the time to the last hour of the day.

The classes

LocalTime

and

ZoneOffset

implement

TemporalAdjuster

,
thus this method can be used to change the time or offset:

```java
result = offsetTime.with(time);
result = offsetTime.with(offset);
```

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

method on the
specified adjuster passing

this

as the argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- with

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null

**Returns:**

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the hour, minute or second.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

OFFSET_SECONDS

field will return a time with the specified offset.
The local time is unaltered. If the new offset value is outside the valid range
then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalTime.with(TemporalField, long)

LocalTime}.
In this case, the offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

unit)

Returns a copy of this

OffsetTime

with the time truncated.

Truncation returns a copy of the original time with fields
smaller than the specified unit set to zero.
For example, truncating with the

minutes

unit
will set the second-of-minute and nano-of-second field to zero.

The unit must have a

duration

that divides into the length of a standard day without remainder.
This includes all supplied time units on

ChronoUnit

and

#### public <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)

Queries this time using the specified query.

This queries this time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:**
- query

in interface

TemporalAccessor

**Parameters:**
- query

- the query to invoke, not null

**Returns:**
- the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

**Type Parameters:**
- R

- the type of the result

---

#### public
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same offset and time
as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the offset and time changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

and

ChronoField.OFFSET_SECONDS

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisOffsetTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisOffsetTime);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster

**Parameters:**
- temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null

**Returns:**
- the adjusted object, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Calculates the amount of time until another time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

OffsetTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in hours between two times can be calculated
using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

OffsetTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the offset differs between the two times, then the specified
end time is normalized to have the same offset as this time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two times.
For example, the amount in hours between 11:30Z and 13:29Z will only
be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MINUTES);
amount = MINUTES.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:**
- until

in interface

Temporal

**Parameters:**
- endExclusive

- the end time, exclusive, which is converted to an

OffsetTime

, not null
- unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null

**Returns:**
- the amount of time between this time and the end time

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to an

OffsetTime
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

---

#### public
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)

Formats this time using the specified formatter.

This time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

**Parameters:**
- formatter

- the formatter to use, not null

**Returns:**
- the formatted time string, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

---

#### public
OffsetDateTime
atDate​(
LocalDate
date)

Combines this time with a date to create an

OffsetDateTime

.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

formed from this time and the specified date.
All possible combinations of date and time are valid.

**Parameters:**
- date

- the date to combine with, not null

**Returns:**
- the offset date-time formed from this time and the specified date, not null

---

#### public long toEpochSecond​(
LocalDate
date)

Converts this

OffsetTime

to the number of seconds since the epoch
of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This combines this offset time with the specified date to calculate the
epoch-second value, which is the number of elapsed seconds from
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier
are negative.

**Parameters:**
- date

- the localdate, not null

**Returns:**
- the number of seconds since the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z, may be negative

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public int compareTo​(
OffsetTime
other)

Compares this

OffsetTime

to another time.

The comparison is based first on the UTC equivalent instant, then on the local time.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 10:30+01:00
- 11:00+01:00
- 12:00+02:00
- 11:30+01:00
- 12:00+01:00
- 12:30+01:00

Values #2 and #3 represent the same instant on the time-line.
When two values represent the same instant, the local time is compared
to distinguish them. This step is needed to make the ordering
consistent with

equals()

.

To compare the underlying local time of two

TemporalAccessor

instances,
use

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as a comparator.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

OffsetTime

>

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

---

#### public boolean isAfter​(
OffsetTime
other)

OffsetTime

is after that of the
specified time applying both times to a common date.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetTime)

in that it
only compares the instant of the time. This is equivalent to converting both
times to an instant using the same date and comparing the instants.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this is after the instant of the specified time

---

#### public boolean isBefore​(
OffsetTime
other)

Checks if the instant of this

OffsetTime

is before that of the
specified time applying both times to a common date.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetTime)

in that it
only compares the instant of the time. This is equivalent to converting both
times to an instant using the same date and comparing the instants.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this is before the instant of the specified time

---

#### public boolean isEqual​(
OffsetTime
other)

OffsetTime

is equal to that of the
specified time applying both times to a common date.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetTime)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it only compares the instant of the time. This is equivalent to converting both
times to an instant using the same date and comparing the instants.

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other time to compare to, not null

**Returns:**
- true if this is equal to the instant of the specified time

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Checks if this time is equal to another time.

The comparison is based on the local-time and the offset.
To compare for the same instant on the time-line, use

isEqual(OffsetTime)

.

Only objects of type

OffsetTime

are compared, other types return false.
To compare the underlying local time of two

TemporalAccessor

instances,
use

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as a comparator.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if this is equal to the other time

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public
String
toString()

Outputs this time as a

String

, such as

10:15:30+01:00

.

The output will be one of the following ISO-8601 formats:

- HH:mmXXXXX
- HH:mm:ssXXXXX
- HH:mm:ss.SSSXXXXX
- HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSXXXXX
- HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSSSSXXXXX

The format used will be the shortest that outputs the full value of
the time where the omitted parts are implied to be zero.

**Overrides:**

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- MIN

```java
public static final
OffsetTime
MIN
```

The minimum supported

OffsetTime

, '00:00:00+18:00'.
This is the time of midnight at the start of the day in the maximum offset
(larger offsets are earlier on the time-line).
This combines

LocalTime.MIN

and

ZoneOffset.MAX

.
This could be used by an application as a "far past" date.

- MAX

```java
public static final
OffsetTime
MAX
```

The maximum supported

OffsetTime

, '23:59:59.999999999-18:00'.
This is the time just before midnight at the end of the day in the minimum offset
(larger negative offsets are later on the time-line).
This combines

LocalTime.MAX

and

ZoneOffset.MIN

.
This could be used by an application as a "far future" date.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- now

```java
public static
OffsetTime
now()
```

Obtains the current time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current time.
The offset will be calculated from the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Returns:** the current time using the system clock and default time-zone, not null

- now

```java
public static
OffsetTime
now​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains the current time from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current time.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
The offset will be calculated from the specified time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:** zone

- the zone ID to use, not null
**Returns:** the current time using the system clock, not null

- now

```java
public static
OffsetTime
now​(
Clock
clock)
```

Obtains the current time from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current time.
The offset will be calculated from the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

**Parameters:** clock

- the clock to use, not null
**Returns:** the current time, not null

- of

```java
public static
OffsetTime
of​(
LocalTime
time,

ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a local time and an offset.

**Parameters:** time

- the local time, not null
**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset, not null
**Returns:** the offset time, not null

- of

```java
public static
OffsetTime
of​(int hour,
int minute,
int second,
int nanoOfSecond,

ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from an hour, minute, second and nanosecond.

This creates an offset time with the four specified fields.

This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.

LocalTime

has two additional convenience variants of the
equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.

**Parameters:** hour

- the hour-of-day to represent, from 0 to 23
**Parameters:** minute

- the minute-of-hour to represent, from 0 to 59
**Parameters:** second

- the second-of-minute to represent, from 0 to 59
**Parameters:** nanoOfSecond

- the nano-of-second to represent, from 0 to 999,999,999
**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset, not null
**Returns:** the offset time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the value of any field is out of range

- ofInstant

```java
public static
OffsetTime
ofInstant​(
Instant
instant,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from an

Instant

and zone ID.

This creates an offset time with the same instant as that specified.
Finding the offset from UTC/Greenwich is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant.

The date component of the instant is dropped during the conversion.
This means that the conversion can never fail due to the instant being
out of the valid range of dates.

**Parameters:** instant

- the instant to create the time from, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, which may be an offset, not null
**Returns:** the offset time, not null

- from

```java
public static
OffsetTime
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains an offset time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

OffsetTime

.

The conversion extracts and combines the

ZoneOffset

and the

LocalTime

from the temporal object.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

OffsetTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the offset time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to an

OffsetTime

- parse

```java
public static
OffsetTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a text string such as

10:15:30+01:00

.

The string must represent a valid time and is parsed using

DateTimeFormatter.ISO_OFFSET_TIME

.

**Parameters:** text

- the text to parse such as "10:15:30+01:00", not null
**Returns:** the parsed local time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- parse

```java
public static
OffsetTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text,

DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a text string using a specific formatter.

The text is parsed using the formatter, returning a time.

**Parameters:** text

- the text to parse, not null
**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the parsed offset time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- isSupported

```java
public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if this time can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The supported fields are:

- NANO_OF_SECOND

NANO_OF_DAY

MICRO_OF_SECOND

MICRO_OF_DAY

MILLI_OF_SECOND

MILLI_OF_DAY

SECOND_OF_MINUTE

SECOND_OF_DAY

MINUTE_OF_HOUR

MINUTE_OF_DAY

HOUR_OF_AMPM

CLOCK_HOUR_OF_AMPM

HOUR_OF_DAY

CLOCK_HOUR_OF_DAY

AMPM_OF_DAY

OFFSET_SECONDS

All other

ChronoField

instances will return false.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the field is supported on this time, false if not

- isSupported

```java
public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this offset-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

If the unit is a

ChronoUnit

then the query is implemented here.
The supported units are:

- NANOS

MICROS

MILLIS

SECONDS

MINUTES

HOURS

HALF_DAYS

All other

ChronoUnit

instances will return false.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

- range

```java
public
ValueRange
range​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
This time is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return
appropriate range instances.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the range can be obtained is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** range

in interface

TemporalAccessor

- the field to query the range for, not null
**Returns:** the range of valid values for the field, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the range for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported

- get

```java
public int get​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the value of the specified field from this time as an

int

.

This queries this time for the value of the specified field.
The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return valid
values based on this time, except

NANO_OF_DAY

and

MICRO_OF_DAY

which are too large to fit in an

int

and throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** get

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to get, not null
**Returns:** the value for the field
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained or
the value is outside the range of valid values for the field
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return valid
values based on this time.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** getLong

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to get, not null
**Returns:** the value for the field
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- getOffset

```java
public
ZoneOffset
getOffset()
```

Gets the zone offset, such as '+01:00'.

This is the offset of the local time from UTC/Greenwich.

**Returns:** the zone offset, not null

- withOffsetSameLocal

```java
public
OffsetTime
withOffsetSameLocal​(
ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Returns a copy of this

OffsetTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result has the same local time.

This method returns an object with the same

LocalTime

and the specified

ZoneOffset

.
No calculation is needed or performed.
For example, if this time represents

10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

10:30+03:00

.

To take into account the difference between the offsets, and adjust the time fields,
use

withOffsetSameInstant(java.time.ZoneOffset)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset to change to, not null
**Returns:** an

OffsetTime

based on this time with the requested offset, not null

- withOffsetSameInstant

```java
public
OffsetTime
withOffsetSameInstant​(
ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Returns a copy of this

OffsetTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result is at the same instant on an implied day.

This method returns an object with the specified

ZoneOffset

and a

LocalTime

adjusted by the difference between the two offsets.
This will result in the old and new objects representing the same instant on an implied day.
This is useful for finding the local time in a different offset.
For example, if this time represents

10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

11:30+03:00

.

To change the offset without adjusting the local time use

withOffsetSameLocal(java.time.ZoneOffset)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset to change to, not null
**Returns:** an

OffsetTime

based on this time with the requested offset, not null

- toLocalTime

```java
public
LocalTime
toLocalTime()
```

Gets the

LocalTime

part of this date-time.

This returns a

LocalTime

with the same hour, minute, second and
nanosecond as this date-time.

**Returns:** the time part of this date-time, not null

- getHour

```java
public int getHour()
```

Gets the hour-of-day field.

**Returns:** the hour-of-day, from 0 to 23

- getMinute

- with

```java
public
OffsetTime
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted copy of this time.

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the hour field.
A more complex adjuster might set the time to the last hour of the day.

The classes

LocalTime

and

ZoneOffset

implement

TemporalAdjuster

,
thus this method can be used to change the time or offset:

```java
result = offsetTime.with(time);
result = offsetTime.with(offset);
```

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

method on the
specified adjuster passing

this

as the argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an

OffsetTime

based on

this

with the adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the adjustment cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
public
OffsetTime
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns a copy of this time with the specified field set to a new value.

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the hour, minute or second.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

OFFSET_SECONDS

field will return a time with the specified offset.
The local time is unaltered. If the new offset value is outside the valid range
then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalTime.with(TemporalField, long)

LocalTime}.
In this case, the offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal

- if the nanos value is invalid

- truncatedTo

```java
public
OffsetTime
truncatedTo​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns a copy of this

OffsetTime

with the time truncated.

Truncation returns a copy of the original time with fields
smaller than the specified unit set to zero.
For example, truncating with the

minutes

unit
will set the second-of-minute and nano-of-second field to zero.

The unit must have a

duration

that divides into the length of a standard day without remainder.
This includes all supplied time units on

ChronoUnit

and

DAYS

. Other units throw an exception.

The offset does not affect the calculation and will be the same in the result.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to truncate to, not null
**Returns:** an

OffsetTime

based on this time with the time truncated, not null

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the specified amount added.
The amount is typically

Duration

but may be any other type implementing
the

The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling

TemporalAmount.addTo(Temporal)

. The amount implementation is free
to implement the addition in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

. Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully added.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** amountToAdd

- the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an

OffsetTime

based on this time with the addition made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
public
OffsetTime
plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns a copy of this time with the specified amount added.

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the amount
in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoUnit

then the addition is implemented by

LocalTime.plus(long, TemporalUnit)

.
The offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged in the result.

If the field is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
whether and how to perform the addition.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** plus

in interface

Temporal

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the specified amount subtracted.
The amount is typically

Duration

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface.

The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling

TemporalAmount.subtractFrom(Temporal)

. The amount implementation is free
to implement the subtraction in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to

minus(long, TemporalUnit)

. Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully subtracted.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

- query

```java
public <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this time using the specified query.

This queries this time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)

- adjustInto

```java
public
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)
```

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same offset and time
as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the offset and time changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

and

ChronoField.OFFSET_SECONDS

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisOffsetTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisOffsetTime);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

OffsetTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in hours between two times can be calculated
using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

OffsetTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the offset differs between the two times, then the specified
end time is normalized to have the same offset as this time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two times.
For example, the amount in hours between 11:30Z and 13:29Z will only
be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MINUTES);
amount = MINUTES.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** until

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** endExclusive

- the end time, exclusive, which is converted to an

OffsetTime

, not null
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null
**Returns:** the amount of time between this time and the end time
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to an

OffsetTime
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- format

```java
public
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Formats this time using the specified formatter.

This time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the formatted time string, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

- atDate

```java
public
OffsetDateTime
atDate​(
LocalDate
date)
```

Combines this time with a date to create an

OffsetDateTime

.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

formed from this time and the specified date.
All possible combinations of date and time are valid.

**Parameters:** date

- the date to combine with, not null
**Returns:** the offset date-time formed from this time and the specified date, not null

- toEpochSecond

```java
public long toEpochSecond​(
LocalDate
date)
```

Converts this

OffsetTime

to the number of seconds since the epoch
of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This combines this offset time with the specified date to calculate the
epoch-second value, which is the number of elapsed seconds from
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier
are negative.

**Parameters:** date

- the localdate, not null
**Returns:** the number of seconds since the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z, may be negative
**Since:** 9

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
OffsetTime
other)
```

Compares this

OffsetTime

to another time.

The comparison is based first on the UTC equivalent instant, then on the local time.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 10:30+01:00
- 11:00+01:00
- 12:00+02:00
- 11:30+01:00
- 12:00+01:00
- 12:30+01:00

Values #2 and #3 represent the same instant on the time-line.
When two values represent the same instant, the local time is compared
to distinguish them. This step is needed to make the ordering
consistent with

equals()

.

To compare the underlying local time of two

TemporalAccessor

instances,
use

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as a comparator.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

OffsetTime

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

- isAfter

```java
public boolean isAfter​(
OffsetTime
other)
```

Checks if the instant of this

OffsetTime

is after that of the
specified time applying both times to a common date.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetTime)

in that it
only compares the instant of the time. This is equivalent to converting both
times to an instant using the same date and comparing the instants.

**Parameters:** other

- the other time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is after the instant of the specified time

- isBefore

```java
public boolean isBefore​(
OffsetTime
other)
```

OffsetTime

is before that of the
specified time applying both times to a common date.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetTime)

in that it
only compares the instant of the time. This is equivalent to converting both
times to an instant using the same date and comparing the instants.

**Parameters:** other

- the other time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is before the instant of the specified time

- isEqual

```java
public boolean isEqual​(
OffsetTime
other)
```

Checks if the instant of this

OffsetTime

is equal to that of the
specified time applying both times to a common date.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetTime)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it only compares the instant of the time. This is equivalent to converting both
times to an instant using the same date and comparing the instants.

**Parameters:** other

- the other time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is equal to the instant of the specified time

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Checks if this time is equal to another time.

The comparison is based on the local-time and the offset.
To compare for the same instant on the time-line, use

isEqual(OffsetTime)

.

Only objects of type

OffsetTime

are compared, other types return false.
To compare the underlying local time of two

TemporalAccessor

instances,
use

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as a comparator.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the object to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if this is equal to the other time
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

A hash code for this time.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** a suitable hash code
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Outputs this time as a

String

, such as

10:15:30+01:00

.

The output will be one of the following ISO-8601 formats:

- HH:mmXXXXX
- HH:mm:ssXXXXX
- HH:mm:ss.SSSXXXXX
- HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSXXXXX
- HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSSSSXXXXX

The format used will be the shortest that outputs the full value of
the time where the omitted parts are implied to be zero.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of this time, not null

Method Detail

- now

```java
public static
OffsetTime
now()
```

Obtains the current time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

in the default
time-zone to obtain the current time.
The offset will be calculated from the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Returns:** the current time using the system clock and default time-zone, not null

- now

```java
public static
OffsetTime
now​(
ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains the current time from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

This will query the

system clock

to obtain the current time.
Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
The offset will be calculated from the specified time-zone.

Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
because the clock is hard-coded.

**Parameters:** zone

- the zone ID to use, not null
**Returns:** the current time using the system clock, not null

- now

```java
public static
OffsetTime
now​(
Clock
clock)
```

Obtains the current time from the specified clock.

This will query the specified clock to obtain the current time.
The offset will be calculated from the time-zone in the clock.

Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
The alternate clock may be introduced using

dependency injection

.

**Parameters:** clock

- the clock to use, not null
**Returns:** the current time, not null

- of

```java
public static
OffsetTime
of​(
LocalTime
time,

ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a local time and an offset.

**Parameters:** time

- the local time, not null
**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset, not null
**Returns:** the offset time, not null

- of

```java
public static
OffsetTime
of​(int hour,
int minute,
int second,
int nanoOfSecond,

ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from an hour, minute, second and nanosecond.

This creates an offset time with the four specified fields.

This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.

LocalTime

has two additional convenience variants of the
equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.

**Parameters:** hour

- the hour-of-day to represent, from 0 to 23
**Parameters:** minute

- the minute-of-hour to represent, from 0 to 59
**Parameters:** second

- the second-of-minute to represent, from 0 to 59
**Parameters:** nanoOfSecond

- the nano-of-second to represent, from 0 to 999,999,999
**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset, not null
**Returns:** the offset time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the value of any field is out of range

- ofInstant

```java
public static
OffsetTime
ofInstant​(
Instant
instant,

ZoneId
zone)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from an

Instant

and zone ID.

This creates an offset time with the same instant as that specified.
Finding the offset from UTC/Greenwich is simple as there is only one valid
offset for each instant.

The date component of the instant is dropped during the conversion.
This means that the conversion can never fail due to the instant being
out of the valid range of dates.

**Parameters:** instant

- the instant to create the time from, not null
**Parameters:** zone

- the time-zone, which may be an offset, not null
**Returns:** the offset time, not null

- from

```java
public static
OffsetTime
from​(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a temporal object.

This obtains an offset time based on the specified temporal.
A

TemporalAccessor

represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
which this factory converts to an instance of

OffsetTime

.

The conversion extracts and combines the

ZoneOffset

and the

LocalTime

from the temporal object.
Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

This method matches the signature of the functional interface

TemporalQuery

allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,

OffsetTime::from

.

**Parameters:** temporal

- the temporal object to convert, not null
**Returns:** the offset time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to convert to an

OffsetTime

- parse

```java
public static
OffsetTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a text string such as

10:15:30+01:00

.

The string must represent a valid time and is parsed using

DateTimeFormatter.ISO_OFFSET_TIME

.

**Parameters:** text

- the text to parse such as "10:15:30+01:00", not null
**Returns:** the parsed local time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- parse

```java
public static
OffsetTime
parse​(
CharSequence
text,

DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

Obtains an instance of

OffsetTime

from a text string using a specific formatter.

The text is parsed using the formatter, returning a time.

**Parameters:** text

- the text to parse, not null
**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the parsed offset time, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeParseException

- if the text cannot be parsed

- isSupported

```java
public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if this time can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

range

,

get

and

with(TemporalField, long)

methods will throw an exception.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The supported fields are:

- NANO_OF_SECOND

NANO_OF_DAY

MICRO_OF_SECOND

MICRO_OF_DAY

MILLI_OF_SECOND

MILLI_OF_DAY

SECOND_OF_MINUTE

SECOND_OF_DAY

MINUTE_OF_HOUR

MINUTE_OF_DAY

HOUR_OF_AMPM

CLOCK_HOUR_OF_AMPM

HOUR_OF_DAY

CLOCK_HOUR_OF_DAY

AMPM_OF_DAY

OFFSET_SECONDS

All other

ChronoField

instances will return false.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the field is supported on this time, false if not

- isSupported

```java
public boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this offset-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

If the unit is a

ChronoUnit

then the query is implemented here.
The supported units are:

- NANOS

MICROS

MILLIS

SECONDS

MINUTES

HOURS

HALF_DAYS

All other

ChronoUnit

instances will return false.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

**Specified by:** isSupported

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

- range

```java
public
ValueRange
range​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
This time is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return
appropriate range instances.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.
Whether the range can be obtained is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** range

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to query the range for, not null
**Returns:** the range of valid values for the field, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the range for the field cannot be obtained

TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the value of the specified field from this time as an

int

.

This queries this time for the value of the specified field.
The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return valid
values based on this time, except

NANO_OF_DAY

and

MICRO_OF_DAY

which are too large to fit in an

int

and throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** get

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to get, not null
**Returns:** the value for the field
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained or
the value is outside the range of valid values for the field
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported or
the range of values exceeds an

int
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- getLong

```java
public long getLong​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the value of the specified field from this time as a

long

.

This queries this time for the value of the specified field.
If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the query is implemented here.
The

supported fields

will return valid
values based on this time.
All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

**Specified by:** getLong

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Parameters:** field

- the field to get, not null
**Returns:** the value for the field
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- getOffset

```java
public
ZoneOffset
getOffset()
```

Gets the zone offset, such as '+01:00'.

This is the offset of the local time from UTC/Greenwich.

**Returns:** the zone offset, not null

- withOffsetSameLocal

```java
public
OffsetTime
withOffsetSameLocal​(
ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Returns a copy of this

OffsetTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result has the same local time.

This method returns an object with the same

LocalTime

and the specified

ZoneOffset

.
No calculation is needed or performed.
For example, if this time represents

10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

10:30+03:00

.

To take into account the difference between the offsets, and adjust the time fields,
use

withOffsetSameInstant(java.time.ZoneOffset)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** offset

- the zone offset to change to, not null
**Returns:** an

OffsetTime

based on this time with the requested offset, not null

- withOffsetSameInstant

```java
public
OffsetTime
withOffsetSameInstant​(
ZoneOffset
offset)
```

Returns a copy of this

OffsetTime

with the specified offset ensuring
that the result is at the same instant on an implied day.

This method returns an object with the specified

ZoneOffset

and a

LocalTime

adjusted by the difference between the two offsets.
This will result in the old and new objects representing the same instant on an implied day.
This is useful for finding the local time in a different offset.
For example, if this time represents

10:30+02:00

and the offset specified is

+03:00

, then this method will return

11:30+03:00

.

To change the offset without adjusting the local time use

withOffsetSameLocal(java.time.ZoneOffset)

.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** offset

- getNano

```java
public int getNano()
```

Gets the nano-of-second field.

**Returns:** the nano-of-second, from 0 to 999,999,999

- with

```java
public
OffsetTime
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted copy of this time.

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the time adjusted.
The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the hour field.
A more complex adjuster might set the time to the last hour of the day.

The classes

LocalTime

and

ZoneOffset

implement

TemporalAdjuster

,
thus this method can be used to change the time or offset:

```java
result = offsetTime.with(time);
result = offsetTime.with(offset);
```

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)

method on the
specified adjuster passing

this

as the argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an

OffsetTime

based on

this

with the adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the adjustment cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
public
OffsetTime
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns a copy of this time with the specified field set to a new value.

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the value
for the specified field changed.
This can be used to change any supported field, such as the hour, minute or second.
If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoField

then the adjustment is implemented here.

The

OFFSET_SECONDS

field will return a time with the specified offset.
The local time is unaltered. If the new offset value is outside the valid range
then a

DateTimeException

will be thrown.

The other

supported fields

will behave as per
the matching method on

LocalTime.with(TemporalField, long)

LocalTime}.
In this case, the offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.

All other

ChronoField

instances will throw an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the field determines
whether and how to adjust the instant.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** with

in interface

Temporal

- truncatedTo

```java
public
OffsetTime
truncatedTo​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns a copy of this

OffsetTime

with the time truncated.

Truncation returns a copy of the original time with fields
smaller than the specified unit set to zero.
For example, truncating with the

minutes

unit
will set the second-of-minute and nano-of-second field to zero.

The unit must have a

duration

that divides into the length of a standard day without remainder.
This includes all supplied time units on

ChronoUnit

and

DAYS

. Other units throw an exception.

The offset does not affect the calculation and will be the same in the result.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to truncate to, not null

```java
public
OffsetTime
plus​(
TemporalAmount
amountToAdd)
```

Returns a copy of this time with the specified amount added.

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the specified amount added.
The amount is typically

Duration

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface.

The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling

TemporalAmount.addTo(Temporal)

. The amount implementation is free
to implement the addition in any way it wishes, however it typically
calls back to

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

. Consult the documentation
of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully added.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns a copy of this time with the specified amount added.

This returns an

OffsetTime

, based on this one, with the amount
in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

If the field is a

ChronoUnit

then the addition is implemented by

LocalTime.plus(long, TemporalUnit)

.
The offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged in the result.

If the field is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
whether and how to perform the addition.

- query

```java
public <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this time using the specified query.

This queries this time using the specified query strategy object.
The

TemporalQuery

object defines the logic to be used to
obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
what the result of this method will be.

The result of this method is obtained by invoking the

TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)

method on the
specified query passing

this

as the argument.

**Specified by:** query

in interface

TemporalAccessor
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query (defined by the query)

- adjustInto

```java
public
Temporal
adjustInto​(
Temporal
temporal)
```

Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same offset and time
as this object.

This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
with the offset and time changed to be the same as this.

The adjustment is equivalent to using

Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)

twice, passing

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

and

ChronoField.OFFSET_SECONDS

as the fields.

In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
temporal = thisOffsetTime.adjustInto(temporal);
temporal = temporal.with(thisOffsetTime);
```

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** adjustInto

in interface

TemporalAdjuster
**Parameters:** temporal

- the target object to be adjusted, not null
**Returns:** the adjusted object, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
public long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

OffsetTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in hours between two times can be calculated
using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The

Temporal

passed to this method is converted to a

OffsetTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the offset differs between the two times, then the specified
end time is normalized to have the same offset as this time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two times.
For example, the amount in hours between 11:30Z and 13:29Z will only
be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MINUTES);
amount = MINUTES.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

**Specified by:** until

in interface

Temporal
**Parameters:** endExclusive

- the end time, exclusive, which is converted to an

OffsetTime

, not null
**Parameters:** unit

**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- format

```java
public
String
format​(
DateTimeFormatter
formatter)
```

This time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

**Parameters:** formatter

- the formatter to use, not null
**Returns:** the formatted time string, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if an error occurs during printing

- atDate

```java
public
OffsetDateTime
atDate​(
LocalDate
date)
```

Combines this time with a date to create an

OffsetDateTime

.

This returns an

OffsetDateTime

formed from this time and the specified date.
All possible combinations of date and time are valid.

**Parameters:** date

- the date to combine with, not null
**Returns:** the offset date-time formed from this time and the specified date, not null

- toEpochSecond

```java
public long toEpochSecond​(
LocalDate
date)
```

Converts this

OffsetTime

to the number of seconds since the epoch
of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This combines this offset time with the specified date to calculate the
epoch-second value, which is the number of elapsed seconds from
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier
are negative.

**Parameters:** date

- the localdate, not null
**Returns:** the number of seconds since the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z, may be negative
**Since:** 9

- compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
OffsetTime
other)
```

Compares this

OffsetTime

to another time.

The comparison is based first on the UTC equivalent instant, then on the local time.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 10:30+01:00
- 11:00+01:00
- 12:00+02:00
- 11:30+01:00
- 12:00+01:00
- 12:30+01:00

Values #2 and #3 represent the same instant on the time-line.
When two values represent the same instant, the local time is compared
to distinguish them. This step is needed to make the ordering
consistent with

equals()

.

To compare the underlying local time of two

TemporalAccessor

instances,
use

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as a comparator.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

OffsetTime

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater

- isAfter

```java
public boolean isAfter​(
OffsetTime
other)
```

Checks if the instant of this

OffsetTime

is after that of the
specified time applying both times to a common date.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetTime)

in that it
only compares the instant of the time. This is equivalent to converting both
times to an instant using the same date and comparing the instants.

**Parameters:** other

- the other time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is after the instant of the specified time

- isBefore

```java
public boolean isBefore​(
OffsetTime
other)
```

Checks if the instant of this

OffsetTime

is before that of the
specified time applying both times to a common date.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetTime)

in that it
only compares the instant of the time. This is equivalent to converting both
times to an instant using the same date and comparing the instants.

**Parameters:** other

- the other time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is before the instant of the specified time

- isEqual

```java
public boolean isEqual​(
OffsetTime
other)
```

Checks if the instant of this

OffsetTime

is equal to that of the
specified time applying both times to a common date.

This method differs from the comparison in

compareTo(java.time.OffsetTime)

and

equals(java.lang.Object)

in that it only compares the instant of the time. This is equivalent to converting both
times to an instant using the same date and comparing the instants.

**Parameters:** other

- the other time to compare to, not null
**Returns:** true if this is equal to the instant of the specified time

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Checks if this time is equal to another time.

The comparison is based on the local-time and the offset.
To compare for the same instant on the time-line, use

isEqual(OffsetTime)

.

Only objects of type

OffsetTime

are compared, other types return false.
To compare the underlying local time of two

TemporalAccessor

instances,
use

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as a comparator.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the object to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if this is equal to the other time

```

Calculates the amount of time until another time in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two

OffsetTime

objects in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified time.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in hours between two times can be calculated
using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The

Temporal

OffsetTime

using

from(TemporalAccessor)

.
If the offset differs between the two times, then the specified
end time is normalized to have the same offset as this time.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two times.
For example, the amount in hours between 11:30Z and 13:29Z will only
be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

The calculation is implemented in this method for

ChronoUnit

.
The units

NANOS

,

MICROS

,

MILLIS

,

SECONDS

,

MINUTES

,

HOURS

and

HALF_DAYS

are supported.
Other

ChronoUnit

values will throw an exception.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal
as the second argument.

This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two times.
For example, the amount in hours between 11:30Z and 13:29Z will only
be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
amount = start.until(end, MINUTES);
amount = MINUTES.between(start, end);

compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
OffsetTime
other)
```

Compares this

OffsetTime

to another time.

The comparison is based first on the UTC equivalent instant, then on the local time.
It is "consistent with equals", as defined by

Comparable

.

For example, the following is the comparator order:

- 10:30+01:00
- 11:00+01:00
- 12:00+02:00
- 11:30+01:00
- 12:00+01:00
- 12:30+01:00

Values #2 and #3 represent the same instant on the time-line.
When two values represent the same instant, the local time is compared
to distinguish them. This step is needed to make the ordering
consistent with

equals()

.

To compare the underlying local time of two

TemporalAccessor

instances,
use

ChronoField.NANO_OF_DAY

as a comparator.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface
