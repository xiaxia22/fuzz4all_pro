# Class PKIXBuilderParameters

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\cert\PKIXBuilderParameters.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
PKIXBuilderParameters

extends
PKIXParameters
```

Parameters used as input for the PKIX

CertPathBuilder

algorithm.

A PKIX

CertPathBuilder

uses these parameters to

build

a

CertPath

which has been
validated according to the PKIX certification path validation algorithm.

To instantiate a

PKIXBuilderParameters

object, an
application must specify one or more

most-trusted CAs

as defined by
the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. The most-trusted CA
can be specified using one of two constructors. An application
can call

PKIXBuilderParameters(Set, CertSelector)

, specifying a

Set

of

TrustAnchor

objects, each of which
identifies a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call

PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, CertSelector)

, specifying a

KeyStore

instance containing trusted certificate entries, each
of which will be considered as a most-trusted CA.

In addition, an application must specify constraints on the target
certificate that the

CertPathBuilder

will attempt
to build a path to. The constraints are specified as a

CertSelector

object. These constraints should provide the

CertPathBuilder

with enough search criteria to find the target
certificate. Minimal criteria for an

X509Certificate

usually
include the subject name and/or one or more subject alternative names.
If enough criteria is not specified, the

CertPathBuilder

may throw a

CertPathBuilderException

.

Concurrent Access

Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
separate objects need not synchronize.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Cloneable

### Method Details

#### public void setMaxPathLength​(int maxPathLength)

Sets the value of the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate
certificates that may exist in a certification path. A certificate
is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject and issuer
fields are identical and are not empty. Note that the last certificate
in a certification path is not an intermediate certificate, and is not
included in this limit. Usually the last certificate is an end entity
certificate, but it can be a CA certificate. A PKIX

CertPathBuilder

instance must not build
paths longer than the length specified.

A value of 0 implies that the path can only contain
a single certificate. A value of -1 implies that the
path length is unconstrained (i.e. there is no maximum).
The default maximum path length, if not specified, is 5.
Setting a value less than -1 will cause an exception to be thrown.

If any of the CA certificates contain the

BasicConstraintsExtension

, the value of the

pathLenConstraint

field of the extension overrides
the maximum path length parameter whenever the result is a
certification path of smaller length.

**Parameters:**
- maxPathLength

- the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate
certificates that may exist in a certification path

**Throws:**
- InvalidParameterException

- if

maxPathLength

is set
to a value less than -1

**See Also:**
- getMaxPathLength()

---

#### public int getMaxPathLength()

Returns the value of the maximum number of intermediate non-self-issued
certificates that may exist in a certification path. See
the

setMaxPathLength(int)

method for more details.

**Returns:**
- the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates
that may exist in a certification path, or -1 if there is no limit

**See Also:**
- setMaxPathLength(int)

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a formatted string describing the parameters.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

PKIXParameters

**Returns:**
- a formatted string describing the parameters

CertPathParameters

```java
public class
PKIXBuilderParameters

extends
PKIXParameters
```

Parameters used as input for the PKIX

CertPathBuilder

algorithm.

A PKIX

CertPathBuilder

uses these parameters to

build

a

CertPath

which has been
validated according to the PKIX certification path validation algorithm.

To instantiate a

PKIXBuilderParameters

object, an
application must specify one or more

most-trusted CAs

as defined by
the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. The most-trusted CA
can be specified using one of two constructors. An application
can call

PKIXBuilderParameters(Set, CertSelector)

, specifying a

Set

of

TrustAnchor

objects, each of which
identifies a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call

PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, CertSelector)

, specifying a

KeyStore

instance containing trusted certificate entries, each
of which will be considered as a most-trusted CA.

In addition, an application must specify constraints on the target
certificate that the

CertPathBuilder

will attempt
to build a path to. The constraints are specified as a

CertSelector

object. These constraints should provide the

CertPathBuilder

with enough search criteria to find the target
certificate. Minimal criteria for an

X509Certificate

usually
include the subject name and/or one or more subject alternative names.
If enough criteria is not specified, the

CertPathBuilder

may throw a

CertPathBuilderException

.

Concurrent Access

Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
separate objects need not synchronize.

- Method Detail

- setMaxPathLength

```java
public void setMaxPathLength​(int maxPathLength)
```

Sets the value of the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate
certificates that may exist in a certification path. A certificate
is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject and issuer
fields are identical and are not empty. Note that the last certificate
in a certification path is not an intermediate certificate, and is not
included in this limit. Usually the last certificate is an end entity
certificate, but it can be a CA certificate. A PKIX

CertPathBuilder

instance must not build
paths longer than the length specified.

A value of 0 implies that the path can only contain
a single certificate. A value of -1 implies that the
path length is unconstrained (i.e. there is no maximum).
The default maximum path length, if not specified, is 5.
Setting a value less than -1 will cause an exception to be thrown.

If any of the CA certificates contain the

BasicConstraintsExtension

, the value of the

pathLenConstraint

field of the extension overrides
the maximum path length parameter whenever the result is a
certification path of smaller length.

**Parameters:** maxPathLength

- the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate
certificates that may exist in a certification path
**Throws:** InvalidParameterException

- if

maxPathLength

is set
to a value less than -1

#### Method Detail

setMaxPathLength

```java
public void setMaxPathLength​(int maxPathLength)
```

Sets the value of the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate
certificates that may exist in a certification path. A certificate
is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject and issuer
fields are identical and are not empty. Note that the last certificate
in a certification path is not an intermediate certificate, and is not
included in this limit. Usually the last certificate is an end entity
certificate, but it can be a CA certificate. A PKIX

CertPathBuilder

instance must not build
paths longer than the length specified.

A value of 0 implies that the path can only contain
a single certificate. A value of -1 implies that the
path length is unconstrained (i.e. there is no maximum).
The default maximum path length, if not specified, is 5.
Setting a value less than -1 will cause an exception to be thrown.

If any of the CA certificates contain the

BasicConstraintsExtension

, the value of the

pathLenConstraint

field of the extension overrides
the maximum path length parameter whenever the result is a
certification path of smaller length.

**Parameters:** maxPathLength

- the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate
certificates that may exist in a certification path
**Throws:** InvalidParameterException

- if

maxPathLength

is set
to a value less than -1
**See Also:** getMaxPathLength()
