# Class Hashtable<K,​V>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Hashtable.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Hashtable<K,​V>

extends
Dictionary
<K,​V>
implements
Map
<K,​V>,
Cloneable
,
Serializable
```

This class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any
non-

null

object can be used as a key or as a value.

To successfully store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the
objects used as keys must implement the

hashCode

method and the

equals

method.

An instance of

Hashtable

has two parameters that affect its
performance:

initial capacity

and

load factor

. The

capacity

is the number of

buckets

in the hash table, and the

initial capacity

is simply the capacity at the time the hash table
is created. Note that the hash table is

open

: in the case of a "hash
collision", a single bucket stores multiple entries, which must be searched
sequentially. The

load factor

is a measure of how full the hash
table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased.
The initial capacity and load factor parameters are merely hints to
the implementation. The exact details as to when and whether the rehash
method is invoked are implementation-dependent.

Generally, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff between
time and space costs. Higher values decrease the space overhead but
increase the time cost to look up an entry (which is reflected in most

Hashtable

operations, including

get

and

put

).

The initial capacity controls a tradeoff between wasted space and the
need for

rehash

operations, which are time-consuming.
No

rehash

operations will

ever

occur if the initial
capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries the

Hashtable

will contain divided by its load factor. However,
setting the initial capacity too high can waste space.

If many entries are to be made into a

Hashtable

,
creating it with a sufficiently large capacity may allow the
entries to be inserted more efficiently than letting it perform
automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.

This example creates a hashtable of numbers. It uses the names of
the numbers as keys:

```java
Hashtable<String, Integer> numbers
= new Hashtable<String, Integer>();
numbers.put("one", 1);
numbers.put("two", 2);
numbers.put("three", 3);
```

To retrieve a number, use the following code:

```java
Integer n = numbers.get("two");
if (n != null) {
System.out.println("two = " + n);
}
```

The iterators returned by the

iterator

method of the collections
returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are

fail-fast

: if the Hashtable is structurally modified at any time
after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own

remove

method, the iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of concurrent
modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
The Enumerations returned by Hashtable's

keys

and

elements

methods are

not

fail-fast; if the
Hashtable is structurally modified at any time after the enumeration is
created then the results of enumerating are undefined.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.

As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to
implement the

Map

interface, making it a member of the

Java Collections Framework

. Unlike the new collection
implementations,

Hashtable

is synchronized. If a
thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use

HashMap

in place of

Hashtable

. If a thread-safe
highly-concurrent implementation is desired, then it is recommended
to use

ConcurrentHashMap

in place of

Hashtable

.

or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key

k

to a value

v

such that

(key.equals(k))

,
then this method returns

v

; otherwise it returns

null

. (There can be at most one such mapping.)

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string representation of this

Hashtable

object
in the form of a set of entries, enclosed in braces and separated
by the ASCII characters "

, and the
associated element, where the

toString

method is used to
convert the key and element to strings.

---

#### public
Set
<
K
> keySet()

Returns a

Set

view of the keys contained in this map.

reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

#### public
Set
<
Map.Entry
<
K
,​
V
>> entrySet()

Returns a

Set

view of the mappings contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation, or through the

setValue

operation on a map entry returned by the
iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Specified by:**

#### public
Collection
<
V
> values()

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

remove

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

,

removeAll

#### public
V
computeIfAbsent​(
K
key,

Function
<? super
K
,​? extends
V
> mappingFunction)

If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped
to

null

), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping
function and enters it into this map unless

null

.

If the mapping function returns

null

, no mapping is recorded.
If the mapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and no mapping is recorded. The most
common usage is to construct a new object serving as an initial
mapped value or memoized result, as in:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new Value(f(k)));
```

Or to implement a multi-value map,

Map<K,Collection<V>>

,
supporting multiple values per key:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new HashSet<V>()).add(v);
```

The mapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the mapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:**
- computeIfAbsent

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
- mappingFunction

- the mapping function to compute a value

**Returns:**
- the current (existing or computed) value associated with
the specified key, or null if the computed value is null

**Throws:**
- ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected that the
mapping function modified this map

---

#### public
V
computeIfPresent​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)

If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to
compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the remapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:**
- computeIfPresent

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
- remappingFunction

- the remapping function to compute a value

**Returns:**
- the new value associated with the specified key, or null if none

**Throws:**
- ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected that the
remapping function modified this map

---

#### public
V
compute​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)

Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current
mapped value (or

null

if there is no current mapping). For
example, to either create or append a

String

msg to a value
mapping:

```java
map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? msg : v.concat(msg))
```

(Method

merge()

is often simpler to use for such purposes.)

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed
(or remains absent if initially absent). If the remapping function
itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception is rethrown, and
the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the remapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:**
- compute

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
- remappingFunction

- the remapping function to compute a value

**Returns:**
- the new value associated with the specified key, or null if none

**Throws:**
- ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected that the
remapping function modified this map

---

#### public
V
merge​(
K
key,

V
value,

BiFunction
<? super
V
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)

If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is
associated with null, associates it with the given non-null value.
Otherwise, replaces the associated value with the results of the given
remapping function, or removes if the result is

null

. This
method may be of use when combining multiple mapped values for a key.
For example, to either create or append a

String msg

to a
value mapping:

```java
map.merge(key, msg, String::concat)
```

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the remapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:**
- merge

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the resulting value is to be associated
- value

- the non-null value to be merged with the existing value
associated with the key or, if no existing value or a null value
is associated with the key, to be associated with the key
- remappingFunction

- the remapping function to recompute a value if
present

**Returns:**
- the new value associated with the specified key, or null if no
value is associated with the key

**Throws:**
- ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected that the
remapping function modified this map

public class
Hashtable<K,​V>

extends

implements
Map
<K,​V>,
Cloneable
,
Serializable
```

This class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any
non-

null

object can be used as a key or as a value.

To successfully store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the
objects used as keys must implement the

hashCode

method and the

equals

method.

An instance of

Hashtable

has two parameters that affect its
performance:

initial capacity

and

load factor

. The

capacity

is the number of

buckets

in the hash table, and the

initial capacity

is simply the capacity at the time the hash table
is created. Note that the hash table is

open

: in the case of a "hash
collision", a single bucket stores multiple entries, which must be searched
sequentially. The

load factor

is a measure of how full the hash
table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased.
The initial capacity and load factor parameters are merely hints to
the implementation. The exact details as to when and whether the rehash
method is invoked are implementation-dependent.

Generally, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff between
time and space costs. Higher values decrease the space overhead but
increase the time cost to look up an entry (which is reflected in most

Hashtable

operations, including

get

and

put

).

The initial capacity controls a tradeoff between wasted space and the
need for

rehash

operations, which are time-consuming.
No

rehash

operations will

ever

occur if the initial
capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries the

Hashtable

will contain divided by its load factor. However,
setting the initial capacity too high can waste space.

If many entries are to be made into a

Hashtable

,
creating it with a sufficiently large capacity may allow the
entries to be inserted more efficiently than letting it perform
automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.

This example creates a hashtable of numbers. It uses the names of
the numbers as keys:

```java
Hashtable<String, Integer> numbers
= new Hashtable<String, Integer>();
numbers.put("one", 1);
numbers.put("two", 2);
numbers.put("three", 3);
```

To retrieve a number, use the following code:

```java
Integer n = numbers.get("two");
if (n != null) {
System.out.println("two = " + n);
}
```

The iterators returned by the

iterator

method of the collections
returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are

fail-fast

: if the Hashtable is structurally modified at any time
after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own

remove

method, the iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of concurrent
modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
The Enumerations returned by Hashtable's

keys

and

elements

methods are

not

fail-fast; if the
Hashtable is structurally modified at any time after the enumeration is
created then the results of enumerating are undefined.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.

As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to
implement the

Map

interface, making it a member of the

Java Collections Framework

. Unlike the new collection
implementations,

Hashtable

is synchronized. If a
thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use

to use

increase the time cost to look up an entry (which is reflected in most

Hashtable

operations, including

get

and

put

).

The initial capacity controls a tradeoff between wasted space and the
need for

rehash

operations, which are time-consuming.
No

rehash

operations will

ever

occur if the initial
capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries the

Hashtable

will contain divided by its load factor. However,
setting the initial capacity too high can waste space.

If many entries are to be made into a

Hashtable

,
creating it with a sufficiently large capacity may allow the
entries to be inserted more efficiently than letting it perform
automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.

This example creates a hashtable of numbers. It uses the names of
the numbers as keys:

```java
Hashtable<String, Integer> numbers
= new Hashtable<String, Integer>();
numbers.put("one", 1);
numbers.put("two", 2);
numbers.put("three", 3);
```

To retrieve a number, use the following code:

```java
Integer n = numbers.get("two");
if (n != null) {
System.out.println("two = " + n);
}
```

The iterators returned by the

iterator

method of the collections
returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are

fail-fast

: if the Hashtable is structurally modified at any time
after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own

remove

method, the iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of concurrent
modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
The Enumerations returned by Hashtable's

keys

and

elements

methods are

not

fail-fast; if the
Hashtable is structurally modified at any time after the enumeration is
created then the results of enumerating are undefined.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.

As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to
implement the

Map

interface, making it a member of the

Java Collections Framework

. Unlike the new collection
implementations,

Hashtable

is synchronized. If a
thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use

HashMap

in place of

Hashtable

. If a thread-safe
highly-concurrent implementation is desired, then it is recommended
to use

ConcurrentHashMap

in place of

Hashtable

.

To successfully store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the
objects used as keys must implement the

hashCode

method and the

equals

method.

An instance of

Hashtable

has two parameters that affect its
performance:

initial capacity

and

load factor

. The

capacity

is the number of

buckets

in the hash table, and the

initial capacity

is simply the capacity at the time the hash table
is created. Note that the hash table is

open

: in the case of a "hash
collision", a single bucket stores multiple entries, which must be searched
sequentially. The

load factor

is a measure of how full the hash
table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased.
The initial capacity and load factor parameters are merely hints to
the implementation. The exact details as to when and whether the rehash
method is invoked are implementation-dependent.

Generally, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff between
time and space costs. Higher values decrease the space overhead but
increase the time cost to look up an entry (which is reflected in most

Hashtable

operations, including

get

and

put

).

The initial capacity controls a tradeoff between wasted space and the
need for

,

Map

- contains

```java
public boolean contains​(
Object
value)
```

Tests if some key maps into the specified value in this hashtable.
This operation is more expensive than the

containsKey

method.

Note that this method is identical in functionality to

containsValue

, (which is part of the

Map

interface in the collections framework).

**Parameters:** value

- a value to search for
**Returns:** true

if and only if some key maps to the

value

argument in this hashtable as
determined by the

equals

method;

false

otherwise.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the value is

null

- containsValue

```java
public boolean containsValue​(
Object
value)
```

Returns true if this hashtable maps one or more keys to this value.

Note that this method is identical in functionality to

contains

(which predates the

Map

interface).

**Specified by:** containsValue

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** value

- value whose presence in this hashtable is to be tested
**Returns:** true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the value is

null
**Since:** 1.2

```

Tests if the specified object is a key in this hashtable.

**Specified by:** containsKey

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** key

- possible key
**Returns:** true

if and only if the specified object
is a key in this hashtable, as determined by the

equals

method;

false

otherwise.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the key is

null
**See Also:** contains(Object)

- get

```java
public
V
get​(
Object
key)
```

Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key

k

to a value

v

such that

(key.equals(k))

,
then this method returns

v

; otherwise it returns

null

. (There can be at most one such mapping.)

**Specified by:** get

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Specified by:** get

in class

Dictionary

<

K

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** key

- the key whose associated value is to be returned
**Returns:** the value to which the specified key is mapped, or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null
**See Also:** put(Object, Object)

- rehash

```java
protected void rehash()
```

Increases the capacity of and internally reorganizes this
hashtable, in order to accommodate and access its entries more
efficiently. This method is called automatically when the
number of keys in the hashtable exceeds this hashtable's capacity
and load factor.

- put

```java
public
V
put​(
K
key,

V
value)
```

Maps the specified

key

to the specified

value

in this hashtable. Neither the key nor the
value can be

null

.

The value can be retrieved by calling the

get

method
with a key that is equal to the original key.

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** t

- mappings to be stored in this map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified map is null
**Since:** 1.2

- clear

- clone

```java
public
Object
clone()
```

Creates a shallow copy of this hashtable. All the structure of the
hashtable itself is copied, but the keys and values are not cloned.
This is a relatively expensive operation.

**Overrides:** clone

in class

Object
**Returns:** a clone of the hashtable
**See Also:** Cloneable

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

Hashtable

object
in the form of a set of entries, enclosed in braces and separated
by the ASCII characters "

,

" (comma and space). Each
entry is rendered as the key, an equals sign

=

, and the
associated element, where the

toString

method is used to
convert the key and element to strings.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of this hashtable

- keySet

```java
public
Set
<
K
> keySet()
```

Returns a

Set

view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Specified by:** keySet

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Returns:** a set view of the keys contained in this map
**Since:** 1.2

- entrySet

```java
public
Set
<
Map.Entry
<
K
,​
V
>> entrySet()
```

Returns a

Set

view of the mappings contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation, or through the

setValue

operation on a map entry returned by the
iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Specified by:** entrySet

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Returns:** a set view of the mappings contained in this map
**Since:** 1.2

- values

```java
public
Collection
<
V
> values()
```

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

remove

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not
support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Specified by:** values

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Returns:** a collection view of the values contained in this map
**Since:** 1.2

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Compares the specified Object with this Map for equality,
as per the definition in the Map interface.

**Specified by:** equals

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** o

- object to be compared for equality with this hashtable
**Returns:** true if the specified Object is equal to this Map
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Map.equals(Object)

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this Map as per the definition in the
Map interface.

**Specified by:** hashCode

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** a hash code value for this object.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Map.hashCode()

- computeIfAbsent

```java
public
V
computeIfAbsent​(
K
key,

Function
<? super
K
,​? extends
V
> mappingFunction)
```

If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped
to

null

), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping
function and enters it into this map unless

null

.

If the mapping function returns

null

, no mapping is recorded.
If the mapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and no mapping is recorded. The most
common usage is to construct a new object serving as an initial
mapped value or memoized result, as in:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new Value(f(k)));
```

Or to implement a multi-value map,

Map<K,Collection<V>>

,
supporting multiple values per key:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new HashSet<V>()).add(v);
```

The mapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the mapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:** computeIfAbsent

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** mappingFunction

- the mapping function to compute a value
**Returns:** the current (existing or computed) value associated with
the specified key, or null if the computed value is null
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected that the
mapping function modified this map

- computeIfPresent

```java
public
V
computeIfPresent​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)
```

If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to
compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the remapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:** computeIfPresent

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** remappingFunction

- the remapping function to compute a value
**Returns:** the new value associated with the specified key, or null if none
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected that the
remapping function modified this map

- compute

```java
public
V
compute​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)
```

Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current
mapped value (or

null

if there is no current mapping). For
example, to either create or append a

String

msg to a value
mapping:

```java
map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? msg : v.concat(msg))
```

(Method

merge()

is often simpler to use for such purposes.)

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed
(or remains absent if initially absent). If the remapping function
itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception is rethrown, and
the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the remapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:** compute

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** remappingFunction

- the remapping function to compute a value
**Returns:** the new value associated with the specified key, or null if none
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected that the
remapping function modified this map

- merge

```java
public
V
merge​(
K
key,

V
value,

BiFunction
<? super
V
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)
```

If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is
associated with null, associates it with the given non-null value.
Otherwise, replaces the associated value with the results of the given
remapping function, or removes if the result is

null

. This
method may be of use when combining multiple mapped values for a key.
For example, to either create or append a

String msg

to a
value mapping:

```java
map.merge(key, msg, String::concat)
```

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the remapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:** merge

in interface

Map

<

K

**Parameters:** key

- key with which the resulting value is to be associated
**Parameters:** value

- the non-null value to be merged with the existing value
associated with the key or, if no existing value or a null value
is associated with the key, to be associated with the key
**Parameters:** remappingFunction

- the remapping function to recompute a value if
present
**Returns:** the new value associated with the specified key, or null if no
value is associated with the key
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this

Hashtable

object
in the form of a set of entries, enclosed in braces and separated

- keySet

```java
public
Set
<
K
> keySet()
```

Returns a

Set

view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Specified by:** keySet

```

Returns a

Set

view of the mappings contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation, or through the

setValue

operation on a map entry returned by the
iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

**Since:** 1.2

- values

```java
public
Collection
<
V
> values()
```

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

remove

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

- computeIfAbsent

```java
public
V
computeIfAbsent​(
K
key,

Function
<? super
K
,​? extends
V
> mappingFunction)
```

If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped
to

null

), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping
function and enters it into this map unless

null

.

If the mapping function returns

null

, no mapping is recorded.
If the mapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and no mapping is recorded. The most
common usage is to construct a new object serving as an initial
mapped value or memoized result, as in:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new Value(f(k)));
```

Or to implement a multi-value map,

Map<K,Collection<V>>

,
supporting multiple values per key:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new HashSet<V>()).add(v);
```

The mapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the mapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:** computeIfAbsent

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** mappingFunction

- the mapping function to compute a value
**Returns:** the current (existing or computed) value associated with
the specified key, or null if the computed value is null
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected that the
mapping function modified this map

- computeIfPresent

```java
public
V
computeIfPresent​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)
```

If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to
compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the remapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:** computeIfPresent

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** remappingFunction

- the remapping function to compute a value
**Returns:** the new value associated with the specified key, or null if none
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected that the
remapping function modified this map

- compute

```java
public
V
compute​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)
```

Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current
mapped value (or

null

if there is no current mapping). For
example, to either create or append a

String

msg to a value
mapping:

```java
map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? msg : v.concat(msg))
```

(Method

merge()

is often simpler to use for such purposes.)

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed
(or remains absent if initially absent). If the remapping function
itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception is rethrown, and
the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the remapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:** compute

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** remappingFunction

- the remapping function to compute a value
**Returns:** the new value associated with the specified key, or null if none
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

- if it is detected that the
remapping function modified this map

- merge

```java
public
V
merge​(
K
key,

V
value,

BiFunction
<? super
V
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)
```

If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is
associated with null, associates it with the given non-null value.
Otherwise, replaces the associated value with the results of the given
remapping function, or removes if the result is

null

. This
method may be of use when combining multiple mapped values for a key.
For example, to either create or append a

String msg

to a
value mapping:

```java
map.merge(key, msg, String::concat)
```

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

This method will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if the remapping
function modified this map during computation.

**Specified by:** merge

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the resulting value is to be associated
**Parameters:** value

- the non-null value to be merged with the existing value
associated with the key or, if no existing value or a null value
is associated with the key, to be associated with the key
**Parameters:** remappingFunction

- the remapping function to recompute a value if
present
**Returns:** the new value associated with the specified key, or null if no
value is associated with the key
**Throws:** ConcurrentModificationException

If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped
to

null

), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping
function and enters it into this map unless

null

.

If the mapping function returns

null

, no mapping is recorded.
If the mapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and no mapping is recorded. The most
common usage is to construct a new object serving as an initial
mapped value or memoized result, as in:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new Value(f(k)));
```

Or to implement a multi-value map,

Map<K,Collection<V>>
