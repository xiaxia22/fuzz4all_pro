# Class Arc2D

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\geom\Arc2D.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Arc2D

extends
RectangularShape
```

Arc2D

is the abstract superclass for all objects that
store a 2D arc defined by a framing rectangle,
start angle, angular extent (length of the arc), and a closure type
(

OPEN

,

CHORD

, or

PIE

).

The arc is a partial section of a full ellipse which
inscribes the framing rectangle of its parent

RectangularShape

.

The angles are specified relative to the non-square
framing rectangle such that 45 degrees always falls on the line from
the center of the ellipse to the upper right corner of the framing
rectangle.
As a result, if the framing rectangle is noticeably longer along one
axis than the other, the angles to the start and end of the arc segment
will be skewed farther along the longer axis of the frame.

The actual storage representation of the coordinates is left to
the subclass.

public void setAngles​(
Point2D
p1,

Point2D
p2)
```

Sets the starting angle and angular extent of this arc using
two points. The first point is used to determine the angle of
the starting point relative to the arc's center.
The second point is used to determine the angle of the end point
relative to the arc's center.
The arc will always be non-empty and extend counterclockwise
from the first point around to the second point.

**Parameters:** p1

- The

Point2D

that defines the arc's
starting point.
**Parameters:** p2

- The

Point2D

that defines the arc's
ending point.
**Since:** 1.2
