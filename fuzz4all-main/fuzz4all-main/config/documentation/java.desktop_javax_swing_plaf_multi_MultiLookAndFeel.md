### Class Description

```java
public class
MultiLookAndFeel

extends
LookAndFeel
```

A multiplexing look and feel that allows more than one UI
to be associated with a component at the same time.
The primary look and feel is called
the

default

look and feel,
and the other look and feels are called

auxiliary

.

Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans™
has been added to the

java.beans

package.

#### public
UIDefaults
getDefaults()

Creates, initializes, and returns
the look and feel specific defaults.
For this look and feel,
the defaults consist solely of
mappings of UI class IDs
(such as "ButtonUI")
to

ComponentUI

class names
(such as "javax.swing.plaf.multi.MultiButtonUI").

**Overrides:**
- getDefaults

in class

LookAndFeel

**Returns:**
- an initialized

UIDefaults

object

- JComponent.getUIClassID()

---

#### public static
ComponentUI
createUIs​(
ComponentUI
mui,

Vector
<
ComponentUI
> uis,

JComponent
target)

Creates the

ComponentUI

objects
required to present
the

target

component,
placing the objects in the

uis

vector and
returning the

ComponentUI

object
that best represents the component's UI.
This method finds the

ComponentUI

objects
by invoking

getDefaults().getUI(target)

on each
default and auxiliary look and feel currently in use.
The first UI object this method adds
to the

uis

vector
is for the default look and feel.

This method is invoked by the

createUI

method
of

MultiXxxxUI

classes.

**Parameters:**
- mui

- the

ComponentUI

object
that represents the complete UI
for the

target

component;
this should be an instance
of one of the

MultiXxxxUI

classes
- uis

- a

Vector

;
generally this is the

uis

field
of the

mui

argument
- target

- a component whose UI is represented by

mui

**Returns:**
- mui

if the component has any auxiliary UI objects;
otherwise, returns the UI object for the default look and feel
or

null

if the default UI object couldn't be found

**See Also:**
- UIManager.getAuxiliaryLookAndFeels()

,

---

#### protected static
ComponentUI
[] uisToArray​(
Vector
<? extends
ComponentUI
> uis)

Creates an array,
populates it with UI objects from the passed-in vector,
and returns the array.
If

uis

is null,
this method returns an array with zero elements.
If

uis

is an empty vector,
this method returns

null

.
A run-time error occurs if any objects in the

uis

vector
are not of type

ComponentUI

.

**Parameters:**
- uis

- a vector containing

ComponentUI

objects

**Returns:**
- an array equivalent to the passed-in vector
