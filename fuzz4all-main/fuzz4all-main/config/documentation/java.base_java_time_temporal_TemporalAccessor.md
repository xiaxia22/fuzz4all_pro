# Interface TemporalAccessor

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\temporal\TemporalAccessor.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
TemporalAccessor
```

Framework-level interface defining read-only access to a temporal object,
such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.

This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects.
It is implemented by those classes that can provide information
as

fields

or

queries

.

Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
These are modeled using

TemporalField

with the number held using
a

long

to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
See

ChronoField

for the standard set of fields.

Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
the

chronology

and the

time-zone

.
These can be accessed via

queries

using
the static methods defined on

TemporalQuery

.

A sub-interface,

Temporal

, extends this definition to one that also
supports adjustment and manipulation on more complete temporal objects.

This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
around instances of concrete types, such as

LocalDate

.
There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
See

ChronoLocalDate

for a fuller discussion of the issues.

### Method Details

#### boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if the date-time can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

range

and

get

methods will throw an exception.

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if this date-time can be queried for the field, false if not

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in

ChronoField

.
If the field is supported, then true must be returned, otherwise false must be returned.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.

---

#### default
ValueRange
range​(
TemporalField
field)

Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

All fields can be expressed as a

long

integer.
This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.
The value of this temporal object is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If the date-time cannot return the range, because the field is unsupported or for
some other reason, an exception will be thrown.

Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to query the range for, not null

**Returns:**
- the range of valid values for the field, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the range for the field cannot be obtained
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in

ChronoField

.
If the field is supported, then the range of the field must be returned.
If unsupported, then an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessorl)

passing

this

as the argument.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
if (field instanceof ChronoField) {
if (isSupported(field)) {
return field.range();
}
throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException("Unsupported field: " + field);
}
return field.rangeRefinedBy(this);
```

---

#### default int get​(
TemporalField
field)

Gets the value of the specified field as an

int

.

This queries the date-time for the value of the specified field.
The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
If the date-time cannot return the value, because the field is unsupported or for
some other reason, an exception will be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to get, not null

**Returns:**
- the value for the field, within the valid range of values

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained or
the value is outside the range of valid values for the field
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported or
the range of values exceeds an

int
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in

ChronoField

.
If the field is supported and has an

int

range, then the value of
the field must be returned.
If unsupported, then an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
if (range(field).isIntValue()) {
return range(field).checkValidIntValue(getLong(field), field);
}
throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException("Invalid field " + field + " + for get() method, use getLong() instead");
```

---

#### long getLong​(
TemporalField
field)

Gets the value of the specified field as a

long

.

This queries the date-time for the value of the specified field.
The returned value may be outside the valid range of values for the field.
If the date-time cannot return the value, because the field is unsupported or for
some other reason, an exception will be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to get, not null

**Returns:**
- the value for the field

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in

ChronoField

.
If the field is supported, then the value of the field must be returned.
If unsupported, then an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.

---

#### default <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)

Queries this date-time.

This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.

Queries are a key tool for extracting information from date-times.
They exists to externalize the process of querying, permitting different
approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.
Examples might be a query that checks if the date is the day before February 29th
in a leap year, or calculates the number of days to your next birthday.

The most common query implementations are method references, such as

LocalDate::from

and

ZoneId::from

.
Additional implementations are provided as static methods on

TemporalQuery

.

**Parameters:**
- query

- the query to invoke, not null

**Returns:**
- the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to query
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
if (query == TemporalQueries.zoneId() ||
query == TemporalQueries.chronology() || query == TemporalQueries.precision()) {
return null;
}
return query.queryFrom(this);
```

Future versions are permitted to add further queries to the if statement.

All classes implementing this interface and overriding this method must call

TemporalAccessor.super.query(query)

. JDK classes may avoid calling
super if they provide behavior equivalent to the default behaviour, however
non-JDK classes may not utilize this optimization and must call

super

.

If the implementation can supply a value for one of the queries listed in the
if statement of the default implementation, then it must do so.
For example, an application-defined

HourMin

class storing the hour
and minute must override this method as follows:

```java
if (query == TemporalQueries.precision()) {
return MINUTES;
}
return TemporalAccessor.super.query(query);
```

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.

**Type Parameters:**
- R

- the type of the result

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.
**Parameters:** field

- the field to get, not null
**Returns:** the value for the field
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if a value for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- query

```java
default <R> R query​(
TemporalQuery
<R> query)
```

Queries this date-time.

This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.

Queries are a key tool for extracting information from date-times.
They exists to externalize the process of querying, permitting different
approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.
Examples might be a query that checks if the date is the day before February 29th
in a leap year, or calculates the number of days to your next birthday.

The most common query implementations are method references, such as

LocalDate::from

and

ZoneId::from

.
Additional implementations are provided as static methods on

TemporalQuery

.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
if (query == TemporalQueries.zoneId() ||
query == TemporalQueries.chronology() || query == TemporalQueries.precision()) {
return null;
}
return query.queryFrom(this);
```

Future versions are permitted to add further queries to the if statement.

All classes implementing this interface and overriding this method must call

TemporalAccessor.super.query(query)

. JDK classes may avoid calling
super if they provide behavior equivalent to the default behaviour, however
non-JDK classes may not utilize this optimization and must call

super

.

If the implementation can supply a value for one of the queries listed in the
if statement of the default implementation, then it must do so.
For example, an application-defined

HourMin

class storing the hour
and minute must override this method as follows:

```java
if (query == TemporalQueries.precision()) {
return MINUTES;
}
return TemporalAccessor.super.query(query);
```

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.
**Type Parameters:** R

- the type of the result
**Parameters:** query

- the query to invoke, not null
**Returns:** the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to query
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

#### Method Detail

isSupported

```java
boolean isSupported​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Checks if the specified field is supported.

This checks if the date-time can be queried for the specified field.
If false, then calling the

range

and

get

methods will throw an exception.

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in

ChronoField

.
If the field is supported, then true must be returned, otherwise false must be returned.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)

passing

this

as the argument.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.
**Parameters:** field

- the field to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if this date-time can be queried for the field, false if not

range

```java
default
ValueRange
range​(
TemporalField
field)
```

Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

All fields can be expressed as a

long

integer.
This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.
The value of this temporal object is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
If the date-time cannot return the range, because the field is unsupported or for
some other reason, an exception will be thrown.

Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in

ChronoField

.
If the field is supported, then the range of the field must be returned.
If unsupported, then an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessorl)

passing

this

as the argument.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
if (field instanceof ChronoField) {
if (isSupported(field)) {
return field.range();
}
throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException("Unsupported field: " + field);
}
return field.rangeRefinedBy(this);
```
**Parameters:** field

- the field to query the range for, not null
**Returns:** the range of valid values for the field, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the range for the field cannot be obtained
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
