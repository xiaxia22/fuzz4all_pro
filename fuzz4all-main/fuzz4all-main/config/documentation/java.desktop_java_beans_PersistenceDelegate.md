# Class PersistenceDelegate

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\beans\PersistenceDelegate.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
PersistenceDelegate

extends
Object
```

The PersistenceDelegate class takes the responsibility
for expressing the state of an instance of a given class
in terms of the methods in the class's public API. Instead
of associating the responsibility of persistence with
the class itself as is done, for example, by the

readObject

and

writeObject

methods used by the

ObjectOutputStream

, streams like
the

XMLEncoder

which
use this delegation model can have their behavior controlled
independently of the classes themselves. Normally, the class
is the best place to put such information and conventions
can easily be expressed in this delegation scheme to do just that.
Sometimes however, it is the case that a minor problem
in a single class prevents an entire object graph from
being written and this can leave the application
developer with no recourse but to attempt to shadow
the problematic classes locally or use alternative
persistence techniques. In situations like these, the
delegation model gives a relatively clean mechanism for
the application developer to intervene in all parts of the
serialization process without requiring that modifications
be made to the implementation of classes which are not part
of the application itself.

In addition to using a delegation model, this persistence
scheme differs from traditional serialization schemes
in requiring an analog of the

writeObject

method without a corresponding

readObject

method. The

writeObject

analog encodes each
instance in terms of its public API and there is no need to
define a

readObject

analog
since the procedure for reading the serialized form
is defined by the semantics of method invocation as laid
out in the Java Language Specification.
Breaking the dependency between

writeObject

and

readObject

implementations, which may
change from version to version, is the key factor
in making the archives produced by this technique immune
to changes in the private implementations of the classes
to which they refer.

A persistence delegate, may take control of all
aspects of the persistence of an object including:

- Deciding whether or not an instance can be mutated
into another instance of the same class.

Instantiating the object, either by calling a
public constructor or a public factory method.

Performing the initialization of the object.

### Method Details

#### public void writeObject​(
Object
oldInstance,

Encoder
out)

The

writeObject

is a single entry point to the persistence
and is used by an

Encoder

in the traditional
mode of delegation. Although this method is not final,
it should not need to be subclassed under normal circumstances.

This implementation first checks to see if the stream
has already encountered this object. Next the

mutatesTo

method is called to see if
that candidate returned from the stream can
be mutated into an accurate copy of

oldInstance

.
If it can, the

initialize

method is called to
perform the initialization. If not, the candidate is removed
from the stream, and the

instantiate

method
is called to create a new candidate for this object.

**Parameters:**
- oldInstance

- The instance that will be created by this expression.
- out

- The stream to which this expression will be written.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

out

is

null

---

#### protected boolean mutatesTo​(
Object
oldInstance,

Object
newInstance)

Returns true if an

equivalent

copy of

oldInstance

may be
created by applying a series of statements to

newInstance

.
In the specification of this method, we mean by equivalent that the modified instance
is indistinguishable from

oldInstance

in the behavior
of the relevant methods in its public API. [Note: we use the
phrase

relevant

methods rather than

all

methods
here only because, to be strictly correct, methods like

hashCode

and

toString

prevent most classes from producing truly
indistinguishable copies of their instances].

The default behavior returns

true

if the classes of the two instances are the same.

**Parameters:**
- oldInstance

- The instance to be copied.
- newInstance

- The instance that is to be modified.

**Returns:**
- True if an equivalent copy of

newInstance

may be
created by applying a series of mutations to

oldInstance

.

---

#### protected abstract
Expression
instantiate​(
Object
oldInstance,

Encoder
out)

Returns an expression whose value is

oldInstance

.
This method is used to characterize the constructor
or factory method that should be used to create the given object.
For example, the

instantiate

method of the persistence
delegate for the

Field

class could be defined as follows:

```java
Field f = (Field)oldInstance;
return new Expression(f, f.getDeclaringClass(), "getField", new Object[]{f.getName()});
```

Note that we declare the value of the returned expression so that
the value of the expression (as returned by

getValue

)
will be identical to

oldInstance

.

**Parameters:**
- oldInstance

- The instance that will be created by this expression.
- out

- The stream to which this expression will be written.

**Returns:**
- An expression whose value is

oldInstance

.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

out

is

null

and this value is used in the method

---

#### protected void initialize​(
Class
<?> type,

Object
oldInstance,

Object
newInstance,

Encoder
out)

Produce a series of statements with side effects on

newInstance

so that the new instance becomes

equivalent

to

oldInstance

.
In the specification of this method, we mean by equivalent that, after the method
returns, the modified instance is indistinguishable from

newInstance

in the behavior of all methods in its
public API.

The implementation typically achieves this goal by producing a series of
"what happened" statements involving the

oldInstance

and its publicly available state. These statements are sent
to the output stream using its

writeExpression

method which returns an expression involving elements in
a cloned environment simulating the state of an input stream during
reading. Each statement returned will have had all instances
the old environment replaced with objects which exist in the new
one. In particular, references to the target of these statements,
which start out as references to

oldInstance

are returned
as references to the

newInstance

instead.
Executing these statements effects an incremental
alignment of the state of the two objects as a series of
modifications to the objects in the new environment.
By the time the initialize method returns it should be impossible
to tell the two instances apart by using their public APIs.
Most importantly, the sequence of steps that were used to make
these objects appear equivalent will have been recorded
by the output stream and will form the actual output when
the stream is flushed.

The default implementation, calls the

initialize

method of the type's superclass.

**Parameters:**
- type

- the type of the instances
- oldInstance

- The instance to be copied.
- newInstance

- The instance that is to be modified.
- out

- The stream to which any initialization statements should be written.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

out

is

null

instantiate

```java
protected abstract
Expression
instantiate​(
Object
oldInstance,

Encoder
out)
```

Returns an expression whose value is

oldInstance

.
This method is used to characterize the constructor
or factory method that should be used to create the given object.
For example, the

instantiate

method of the persistence
delegate for the

Field

class could be defined as follows:

```java
Field f = (Field)oldInstance;
return new Expression(f, f.getDeclaringClass(), "getField", new Object[]{f.getName()});
```

Note that we declare the value of the returned expression so that
the value of the expression (as returned by

getValue

)
will be identical to

oldInstance

.

**Parameters:** oldInstance

- The instance that will be created by this expression.
**Parameters:** out

- The stream to which this expression will be written.
**Returns:** An expression whose value is

oldInstance

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

out

is

null

and this value is used in the method

Expression

instantiate​(

Object

oldInstance,

Returns an expression whose value is

oldInstance

.
This method is used to characterize the constructor
or factory method that should be used to create the given object.
For example, the

method of the persistence

return new Expression(f, f.getDeclaringClass(), "getField", new Object[]{f.getName()});

initialize

```java
protected void initialize​(
Class
<?> type,

Object
oldInstance,

Object
newInstance,

Encoder
out)
```

Produce a series of statements with side effects on

newInstance

so that the new instance becomes

equivalent

to

oldInstance

.
In the specification of this method, we mean by equivalent that, after the method
returns, the modified instance is indistinguishable from

newInstance

in the behavior of all methods in its
public API.

The implementation typically achieves this goal by producing a series of
"what happened" statements involving the

oldInstance

and its publicly available state. These statements are sent
to the output stream using its

writeExpression

method which returns an expression involving elements in
a cloned environment simulating the state of an input stream during
reading. Each statement returned will have had all instances
the old environment replaced with objects which exist in the new
one. In particular, references to the target of these statements,
which start out as references to

oldInstance

are returned
as references to the

newInstance

instead.
Executing these statements effects an incremental
alignment of the state of the two objects as a series of
modifications to the objects in the new environment.
By the time the initialize method returns it should be impossible
to tell the two instances apart by using their public APIs.
Most importantly, the sequence of steps that were used to make
these objects appear equivalent will have been recorded
by the output stream and will form the actual output when
the stream is flushed.

The default implementation, calls the

initialize

method of the type's superclass.

**Parameters:** type

- the type of the instances
**Parameters:** oldInstance

- The instance to be copied.
**Parameters:** newInstance

- The instance that is to be modified.
**Parameters:** out

- The stream to which any initialization statements should be written.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

out

is

null
