# Class VoiceStatus

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\sound\midi\VoiceStatus.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
VoiceStatus

extends
Object
```

A

VoiceStatus

object contains information about the current status of
one of the voices produced by a

Synthesizer

.

MIDI synthesizers are generally capable of producing some maximum number of
simultaneous notes, also referred to as voices. A voice is a stream of
successive single notes, and the process of assigning incoming MIDI notes to
specific voices is known as voice allocation. However, the voice-allocation
algorithm and the contents of each voice are normally internal to a MIDI
synthesizer and hidden from outside view. One can, of course, learn from MIDI
messages which notes the synthesizer is playing, and one might be able deduce
something about the assignment of notes to voices. But MIDI itself does not
provide a means to report which notes a synthesizer has assigned to which
voice, nor even to report how many voices the synthesizer is capable of
synthesizing.

In Java Sound, however, a

Synthesizer

class can expose the contents
of its voices through its

getVoiceStatus()

method. This behavior
is recommended but optional; synthesizers that don't expose their voice
allocation simply return a zero-length array. A

Synthesizer

that does
report its voice status should maintain this information at all times for all
of its voices, whether they are currently sounding or not. In other words, a
given type of

Synthesizer

always has a fixed number of voices, equal
to the maximum number of simultaneous notes it is capable of sounding.

If the voice is not currently processing a
MIDI note, it is considered inactive. A voice is inactive when it has been
given no note-on commands, or when every note-on command received has been
terminated by a corresponding note-off (or by an "all notes off" message).
For example, this happens when a synthesizer capable of playing 16
simultaneous notes is told to play a four-note chord; only four voices are
active in this case (assuming no earlier notes are still playing). Usually, a
voice whose status is reported as active is producing audible sound, but this
is not always true; it depends on the details of the instrument (that is, the
synthesis algorithm) and how long the note has been going on. For example, a
voice may be synthesizing the sound of a single hand-clap. Because this sound
dies away so quickly, it may become inaudible before a note-off message is
received. In such a situation, the voice is still considered active even
though no sound is currently being produced.

Besides its active or inactive status, the

VoiceStatus

class provides
fields that reveal the voice's current MIDI channel, bank and program number,
MIDI note number, and MIDI volume. All of these can change during the course
of a voice. While the voice is inactive, each of these fields has an
unspecified value, so you should check the active field first.

### Field Details

#### public boolean active

Indicates whether the voice is currently processing a MIDI note. See the
explanation of

active and inactive voices

.

---

#### public int channel

The MIDI channel on which this voice is playing. The value is a
zero-based channel number if the voice is active, or unspecified if the
voice is inactive.

**See Also:**
- MidiChannel

,

active

---

#### public int bank

The bank number of the instrument that this voice is currently using.
This is a number dictated by the MIDI bank-select message; it does not
refer to a

SoundBank

object. The value ranges from 0 to 16383 if
the voice is active, and is unspecified if the voice is inactive.

**See Also:**
- Patch

,

,

active

,

MidiChannel.programChange(int, int)

---

#### public int program

The program number of the instrument that this voice is currently using.
The value ranges from 0 to 127 if the voice is active, and is unspecified
if the voice is inactive.

**See Also:**
- MidiChannel.getProgram()

,

Patch

,

active

---

#### public int note

The MIDI note that this voice is playing. The range for an active voice
is from 0 to 127 in semitones, with 60 referring to Middle C. The value
is unspecified if the voice is inactive.

**See Also:**
- MidiChannel.noteOn(int, int)

,

active

---

#### public int volume

The current MIDI volume level for the voice. The value ranges from 0 to
127 if the voice is active, and is unspecified if the voice is inactive.

Note that this value does not necessarily reflect the instantaneous level
of the sound produced by this voice; that level is the result of many
contributing factors, including the current instrument and the shape of
the amplitude envelope it produces.
