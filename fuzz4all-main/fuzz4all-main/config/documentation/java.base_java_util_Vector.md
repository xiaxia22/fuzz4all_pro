# Class Vector<E>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Vector.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Vector<E>

extends
AbstractList
<E>
implements
List
<E>,
RandomAccess
,
Cloneable
,
Serializable
```

The

Vector

class implements a growable array of
objects. Like an array, it contains components that can be
accessed using an integer index. However, the size of a

Vector

can grow or shrink as needed to accommodate
adding and removing items after the

Vector

has been created.

Each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining a

capacity

and a

capacityIncrement

. The

capacity

is always at least as large as the vector
size; it is usually larger because as components are added to the
vector, the vector's storage increases in chunks the size of

capacityIncrement

. An application can increase the
capacity of a vector before inserting a large number of
components; this reduces the amount of incremental reallocation.

The iterators returned by this class's

iterator

and

listIterator

methods are

fail-fast

:
if the vector is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is
created, in any way except through the iterator's own

remove

or

add

methods, the iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of
concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather
than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future. The

Enumerations

returned by
the

elements

method are

not

fail-fast; if the
Vector is structurally modified at any time after the enumeration is
created then the results of enumerating are undefined.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.

As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to
implement the

List

interface, making it a member of the

Java Collections Framework

. Unlike the new collection
implementations,

Vector

is synchronized. If a thread-safe
implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use

ArrayList

in place of

Vector

.

**Type Parameters:** E

- Type of component elements

---

### Field Details

#### protected
Object
[] elementData

The array buffer into which the components of the vector are
stored. The capacity of the vector is the length of this array buffer,
and is at least large enough to contain all the vector's elements.

Any array elements following the last element in the Vector are null.

---

#### protected int elementCount

The number of valid components in this

Vector

object.
Components

elementData[0]

through

elementData[elementCount-1]

are the actual items.

---

#### protected int capacityIncrement

The amount by which the capacity of the vector is automatically
incremented when its size becomes greater than its capacity. If
the capacity increment is less than or equal to zero, the capacity
of the vector is doubled each time it needs to grow.

---

### Constructor Details

#### public Vector​(int initialCapacity,
int capacityIncrement)

Constructs an empty vector with the specified initial capacity and
capacity increment.

**Parameters:**
- initialCapacity

- the initial capacity of the vector
- capacityIncrement

- the amount by which the capacity is
increased when the vector overflows

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified initial capacity
is negative

---

#### public Vector​(int initialCapacity)

Constructs an empty vector with the specified initial capacity and
with its capacity increment equal to zero.

**Parameters:**
- initialCapacity

- the initial capacity of the vector

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified initial capacity
is negative

---

#### public Vector()

Constructs an empty vector so that its internal data array
has size

10

and its standard capacity increment is
zero.

---

#### public Vector​(
Collection
<? extends
E
> c)

Constructs a vector containing the elements of the specified
collection, in the order they are returned by the collection's
iterator.

**Parameters:**
- c

- the collection whose elements are to be placed into this
vector

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the specified collection is null

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

### Method Details

#### public void copyInto​(
Object
[] anArray)

Copies the components of this vector into the specified array.
The item at index

k

in this vector is copied into
component

k

of

anArray

.

**Parameters:**
- anArray

- the array into which the components get copied

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the given array is null
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the specified array is not
large enough to hold all the components of this vector
- ArrayStoreException

- if a component of this vector is not of
a runtime type that can be stored in the specified array

**See Also:**
- toArray(Object[])

---

#### public void trimToSize()

Trims the capacity of this vector to be the vector's current
size. If the capacity of this vector is larger than its current
size, then the capacity is changed to equal the size by replacing
its internal data array, kept in the field

elementData

,
with a smaller one. An application can use this operation to
minimize the storage of a vector.

---

#### public void ensureCapacity​(int minCapacity)

Increases the capacity of this vector, if necessary, to ensure
that it can hold at least the number of components specified by
the minimum capacity argument.

If the current capacity of this vector is less than

minCapacity

, then its capacity is increased by replacing its
internal data array, kept in the field

elementData

, with a
larger one. The size of the new data array will be the old size plus

capacityIncrement

, unless the value of

capacityIncrement

is less than or equal to zero, in which case
the new capacity will be twice the old capacity; but if this new size
is still smaller than

minCapacity

, then the new capacity will
be

minCapacity

.

**Parameters:**
- minCapacity

- the desired minimum capacity

---

#### public void setSize​(int newSize)

Sets the size of this vector. If the new size is greater than the
current size, new

null

items are added to the end of
the vector. If the new size is less than the current size, all
components at index

newSize

and greater are discarded.

**Parameters:**
- newSize

- the new size of this vector

**Throws:**
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the new size is negative

---

#### public int capacity()

Returns the current capacity of this vector.

**Returns:**
- the current capacity (the length of its internal
data array, kept in the field

elementData

of this vector)

Returns an enumeration of the components of this vector. The
returned

Enumeration

object will generate all items in
this vector. The first item generated is the item at index

0

,
then the item at index

0

and less than the current size of the vector.

This method is identical in functionality to the

set(int, E)

method (which is part of the

List

interface). Note that the

set

method reverses the order of the parameters, to more closely
match array usage. Note also that the

set

method returns the
old value that was stored at the specified position.

**Parameters:**

- index

- the specified index

**Throws:**
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the index is out of range
(

#### public void removeElementAt​(int index)

Deletes the component at the specified index. Each component in
this vector with an index greater or equal to the specified

index

is shifted downward to have an index one
smaller than the value it had previously. The size of this vector
is decreased by

1

.

The index must be a value greater than or equal to

0

and less than the current size of the vector.

This method is identical in functionality to the

remove(int)

method (which is part of the

List

interface). Note that the

remove

method returns the old value that was stored at the
specified position.

**Parameters:**

#### public void insertElementAt​(
E
obj,
int index)

Inserts the specified object as a component in this vector at the
specified

index

. Each component in this vector with
an index greater or equal to the specified

index

is
shifted upward to have an index one greater than the value it had
previously.

The index must be a value greater than or equal to

0

and less than or equal to the current size of the vector. (If the
index is equal to the current size of the vector, the new element
is appended to the Vector.)

This method is identical in functionality to the

add(int, E)

method (which is part of the

List

interface). Note that the

add

method reverses the order of the parameters, to more closely
match array usage.

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the component to insert
- index

- where to insert the new component

**Throws:**
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the index is out of range
(

index < 0 || index > size()

)

---

#### public void addElement​(
E
obj)

Adds the specified component to the end of this vector,
increasing its size by one. The capacity of this vector is
increased if its size becomes greater than its capacity.

This method is identical in functionality to the

add(E)

method (which is part of the

List

interface).

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the component to be added

---

#### public boolean removeElement​(
Object
obj)

Removes the first (lowest-indexed) occurrence of the argument
from this vector. If the object is found in this vector, each
component in the vector with an index greater or equal to the
object's index is shifted downward to have an index one smaller
than the value it had previously.

This method is identical in functionality to the

remove(Object)

method (which is part of the

List

interface).

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the component to be removed

**Returns:**
- true

if the argument was a component of this
vector;

false

otherwise.

---

#### public void removeAllElements()

Removes all components from this vector and sets its size to zero.

This method is identical in functionality to the

clear()

method (which is part of the

List

interface).

---

#### public
Object
clone()

reference to a clone of the internal data array, not a reference
to the original internal data array of this

Vector

object.

#### public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this Vector in the
correct order; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the
specified array. If the Vector fits in the specified array, it is
returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime
type of the specified array and the size of this Vector.

If the Vector fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than the Vector),
the element in the array immediately following the end of the
Vector is set to null. (This is useful in determining the length
of the Vector

only

if the caller knows that the Vector
does not contain any null elements.)

#### public
List
<
E
> subList​(int fromIndex,
int toIndex)

Returns a view of the portion of this List between fromIndex,
inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive. (If fromIndex and toIndex are
equal, the returned List is empty.) The returned List is backed by this
List, so changes in the returned List are reflected in this List, and
vice-versa. The returned List supports all of the optional List
operations supported by this List.

This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
the sort that commonly exist for arrays). Any operation that expects
a List can be used as a range operation by operating on a subList view
instead of a whole List. For example, the following idiom
removes a range of elements from a List:

```java
list.subList(from, to).clear();
```

Similar idioms may be constructed for indexOf and lastIndexOf,
and all of the algorithms in the Collections class can be applied to
a subList.

The semantics of the List returned by this method become undefined if
the backing list (i.e., this List) is

structurally modified

in
any way other than via the returned List. (Structural modifications are
those that change the size of the List, or otherwise perturb it in such
a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)

Shifts any succeeding elements to the left (reduces their index).
This call shortens the list by

(toIndex - fromIndex)

The

Vector

class implements a growable array of
objects. Like an array, it contains components that can be
accessed using an integer index. However, the size of a

Vector

can grow or shrink as needed to accommodate
adding and removing items after the

Vector

has been created.

Each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining a

capacity

and a

capacityIncrement

. The

capacity

is always at least as large as the vector
size; it is usually larger because as components are added to the
vector, the vector's storage increases in chunks the size of

capacityIncrement

. An application can increase the
capacity of a vector before inserting a large number of
components; this reduces the amount of incremental reallocation.

The iterators returned by this class's

iterator

and

listIterator

methods are

fail-fast

:
if the vector is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is
created, in any way except through the iterator's own

remove

or

add

methods, the iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of
concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather
than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future. The

Enumerations

returned by
the

elements

method are

not

fail-fast; if the
Vector is structurally modified at any time after the enumeration is
created then the results of enumerating are undefined.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.

As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to
implement the

List

interface, making it a member of the

Java Collections Framework

. Unlike the new collection
implementations,

Vector

is synchronized. If a thread-safe
implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- elementData

```java
protected
Object
[] elementData
```

The array buffer into which the components of the vector are
stored. The capacity of the vector is the length of this array buffer,
and is at least large enough to contain all the vector's elements.

Any array elements following the last element in the Vector are null.

- elementCount

```java
protected int elementCount
```

The number of valid components in this

Vector

object.
Components

elementData[0]

through

elementData[elementCount-1]

are the actual items.

- capacityIncrement

```java
protected int capacityIncrement
```

The amount by which the capacity of the vector is automatically
incremented when its size becomes greater than its capacity. If
the capacity increment is less than or equal to zero, the capacity
of the vector is doubled each time it needs to grow.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- Vector

```java
public Vector​(int initialCapacity,
int capacityIncrement)
```

Constructs an empty vector with the specified initial capacity and
capacity increment.

**Parameters:** initialCapacity

- the initial capacity of the vector
**Parameters:** capacityIncrement

- the amount by which the capacity is
increased when the vector overflows
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified initial capacity
is negative

- Vector

```java
public Vector​(int initialCapacity)
```

Constructs an empty vector with the specified initial capacity and
with its capacity increment equal to zero.

**Parameters:** initialCapacity

- the initial capacity of the vector
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified initial capacity
is negative

- Vector

```java
public Vector()
```

Constructs an empty vector so that its internal data array
has size

10

and its standard capacity increment is
zero.

- Vector

```java
public Vector​(
Collection
<? extends
E
> c)
```

Constructs a vector containing the elements of the specified
collection, in the order they are returned by the collection's
iterator.

**Parameters:** c

- the collection whose elements are to be placed into this
vector
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified collection is null
**Since:** 1.2

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- copyInto

```java
public void copyInto​(
Object
[] anArray)
```

Copies the components of this vector into the specified array.
The item at index

k

in this vector is copied into
component

k

of

anArray

.

**Parameters:** anArray

- the array into which the components get copied
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the given array is null
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the specified array is not
large enough to hold all the components of this vector
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if a component of this vector is not of
a runtime type that can be stored in the specified array
**See Also:** toArray(Object[])

- trimToSize

```java
public void trimToSize()
```

Trims the capacity of this vector to be the vector's current
size. If the capacity of this vector is larger than its current
size, then the capacity is changed to equal the size by replacing
its internal data array, kept in the field

elementData

,
with a smaller one. An application can use this operation to
minimize the storage of a vector.

- ensureCapacity

```java
public void ensureCapacity​(int minCapacity)
```

Increases the capacity of this vector, if necessary, to ensure
that it can hold at least the number of components specified by
the minimum capacity argument.

If the current capacity of this vector is less than

minCapacity

, then its capacity is increased by replacing its
internal data array, kept in the field

elementData

, with a
larger one. The size of the new data array will be the old size plus

capacityIncrement

, unless the value of

capacityIncrement

is less than or equal to zero, in which case
the new capacity will be twice the old capacity; but if this new size
is still smaller than

minCapacity

, then the new capacity will
be

minCapacity

.

**Parameters:** minCapacity

- the desired minimum capacity

- setSize

```java
public void setSize​(int newSize)
```

Sets the size of this vector. If the new size is greater than the
current size, new

null

items are added to the end of
the vector. If the new size is less than the current size, all
components at index

newSize

and greater are discarded.

**Parameters:** newSize

- the new size of this vector
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the new size is negative

- capacity

```java
public int capacity()
```

Returns the current capacity of this vector.

**Returns:** the current capacity (the length of its internal
data array, kept in the field

elementData

of this vector)

index

is
shifted upward to have an index one greater than the value it had
previously.

The index must be a value greater than or equal to

0

and less than or equal to the current size of the vector. (If the
index is equal to the current size of the vector, the new element
is appended to the Vector.)

This method is identical in functionality to the

add(int, E)

method (which is part of the

List

interface). Note that the

add

method reverses the order of the parameters, to more closely
match array usage.

**Parameters:** obj

- the component to insert
**Parameters:** index

- where to insert the new component
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the index is out of range
(

index < 0 || index > size()

List

interface).

**Parameters:** obj

- the component to be added

- removeElement

```java
public boolean removeElement​(
Object
obj)
```

Removes the first (lowest-indexed) occurrence of the argument
from this vector. If the object is found in this vector, each
component in the vector with an index greater or equal to the
object's index is shifted downward to have an index one smaller
than the value it had previously.

This method is identical in functionality to the

remove(Object)

method (which is part of the

List

interface).

**Parameters:** obj

- the component to be removed
**Returns:** true

if the argument was a component of this
vector;

false

otherwise.

- removeAllElements

```java
public void removeAllElements()
```

Removes all components from this vector and sets its size to zero.

This method is identical in functionality to the

clear()

method (which is part of the

List

interface).

- clone

```java
public
Object
clone()
```

If the Vector fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than the Vector),
the element in the array immediately following the end of the
Vector is set to null. (This is useful in determining the length
of the Vector

only

have the same size, and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two
Lists are

equal

. (Two elements

e1

- subList

```java
public
List
<
E
> subList​(int fromIndex,
int toIndex)
```

Returns a view of the portion of this List between fromIndex,
inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive. (If fromIndex and toIndex are
equal, the returned List is empty.) The returned List is backed by this
List, so changes in the returned List are reflected in this List, and
vice-versa. The returned List supports all of the optional List
operations supported by this List.

This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
the sort that commonly exist for arrays). Any operation that expects
a List can be used as a range operation by operating on a subList view
instead of a whole List. For example, the following idiom
removes a range of elements from a List:

```java
list.subList(from, to).clear();
```

Similar idioms may be constructed for indexOf and lastIndexOf,
and all of the algorithms in the Collections class can be applied to
a subList.

The semantics of the List returned by this method become undefined if
the backing list (i.e., this List) is

structurally modified

in
any way other than via the returned List. (Structural modifications are
those that change the size of the List, or otherwise perturb it in such
a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)

**Specified by:** subList

(fromIndex < 0 || toIndex > size)
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the endpoint indices are out of order

(fromIndex > toIndex)

- removeRange

```java
protected void removeRange​(int fromIndex,
int toIndex)
```

Removes from this list all of the elements whose index is between

fromIndex

, inclusive, and

toIndex

, exclusive.
Shifts any succeeding elements to the left (reduces their index).
This call shortens the list by

(toIndex - fromIndex)

elements.
(If

toIndex==fromIndex

, this operation has no effect.)

Method Detail

- copyInto

```java
public void copyInto​(
Object
[] anArray)
```

Copies the components of this vector into the specified array.
The item at index

k

in this vector is copied into
component

k

of

anArray

.

**Parameters:** anArray

- the array into which the components get copied
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the given array is null
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the specified array is not
large enough to hold all the components of this vector
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if a component of this vector is not of
a runtime type that can be stored in the specified array
**See Also:** toArray(Object[])

- trimToSize

```java
public void trimToSize()
```

Trims the capacity of this vector to be the vector's current
size. If the capacity of this vector is larger than its current
size, then the capacity is changed to equal the size by replacing
its internal data array, kept in the field

elementData

,
with a smaller one. An application can use this operation to
minimize the storage of a vector.

- ensureCapacity

```java
public void ensureCapacity​(int minCapacity)
```

Increases the capacity of this vector, if necessary, to ensure
that it can hold at least the number of components specified by
the minimum capacity argument.

If the current capacity of this vector is less than

minCapacity

, then its capacity is increased by replacing its
internal data array, kept in the field

elementData

, with a
larger one. The size of the new data array will be the old size plus

capacityIncrement

, unless the value of

capacityIncrement

is less than or equal to zero, in which case
the new capacity will be twice the old capacity; but if this new size
is still smaller than

minCapacity

, then the new capacity will
be

minCapacity

.

**Parameters:** minCapacity

- the desired minimum capacity

- setSize

```java
public void setSize​(int newSize)
```

Sets the size of this vector. If the new size is greater than the
current size, new

null

items are added to the end of
the vector. If the new size is less than the current size, all
components at index

newSize

and greater are discarded.

**Parameters:** newSize

- the new size of this vector
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the new size is negative

- capacity

```java
public int capacity()
```

Returns the current capacity of this vector.

**Returns:** the current capacity (the length of its internal
data array, kept in the field

this vector with an index greater or equal to the specified

index

is shifted downward to have an index one
smaller than the value it had previously. The size of this vector
is decreased by

1

.

The index must be a value greater than or equal to

0

and less than the current size of the vector.

This method is identical in functionality to the

remove(int)

method (which is part of the

List

interface). Note that the

remove

method returns the old value that was stored at the
specified position.

**Parameters:** index

- the index of the object to remove
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the index is out of range
(

index < 0 || index >= size()

)

- insertElementAt

```java
public void insertElementAt​(
E
obj,
int index)
```

Inserts the specified object as a component in this vector at the
specified

index

. Each component in this vector with
an index greater or equal to the specified

index

is
shifted upward to have an index one greater than the value it had
previously.

The index must be a value greater than or equal to

0

and less than or equal to the current size of the vector. (If the
index is equal to the current size of the vector, the new element
is appended to the Vector.)

This method is identical in functionality to the

add(int, E)

method (which is part of the

List

interface). Note that the

add

method reverses the order of the parameters, to more closely
match array usage.

**Parameters:** obj

- the component to insert
**Parameters:** index

- where to insert the new component
**Throws:** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the index is out of range
(

index < 0 || index > size()

)

- addElement

```java
public void addElement​(
E
obj)
```

Adds the specified component to the end of this vector,
increasing its size by one. The capacity of this vector is
increased if its size becomes greater than its capacity.

This method is identical in functionality to the

add(E)

method (which is part of the

List

interface).

**Parameters:** obj

- the component to be added

- removeElement

```java
public boolean removeElement​(
Object
obj)
```

Removes the first (lowest-indexed) occurrence of the argument
from this vector. If the object is found in this vector, each
component in the vector with an index greater or equal to the
object's index is shifted downward to have an index one smaller
than the value it had previously.

This method is identical in functionality to the

remove(Object)

method (which is part of the

List

interface).

**Parameters:** obj

- the component to be removed
**Returns:** true

if the argument was a component of this
vector;

false

otherwise.

- removeAllElements

```java
public void removeAllElements()
```

Removes all components from this vector and sets its size to zero.

This method is identical in functionality to the

clear()

method (which is part of the

List

interface).

- clone

```java
public
Object
clone()
```

Returns a clone of this vector. The copy will contain a
reference to a clone of the internal data array, not a reference
to the original internal data array of this

Vector

object.

**Overrides:** clone

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this Vector in the
correct order; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the
specified array. If the Vector fits in the specified array, it is
returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime
type of the specified array and the size of this Vector.

If the Vector fits in the specified array with room to spare
(i.e., the array has more elements than the Vector),
the element in the array immediately following the end of the
Vector is set to null. (This is useful in determining the length
of the Vector

only

if the caller knows that the Vector
does not contain any null elements.)

true if and only if the specified Object is also a List, both Lists
have the same size, and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two
Lists are

equal

. (Two elements

e1

- subList

```java
public
List
<
E
> subList​(int fromIndex,
int toIndex)
```

Returns a view of the portion of this List between fromIndex,
inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive. (If fromIndex and toIndex are
equal, the returned List is empty.) The returned List is backed by this
List, so changes in the returned List are reflected in this List, and
vice-versa. The returned List supports all of the optional List
operations supported by this List.

This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
the sort that commonly exist for arrays). Any operation that expects
a List can be used as a range operation by operating on a subList view
instead of a whole List. For example, the following idiom
removes a range of elements from a List:

```java
list.subList(from, to).clear();
```

Similar idioms may be constructed for indexOf and lastIndexOf,
and all of the algorithms in the Collections class can be applied to
a subList.

The semantics of the List returned by this method become undefined if
the backing list (i.e., this List) is

structurally modified

in
any way other than via the returned List. (Structural modifications are
those that change the size of the List, or otherwise perturb it in such
a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)

**Specified by:** subList

**Returns:** a view of the specified range within this List
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an endpoint index value is out of range

(fromIndex < 0 || toIndex > size)
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the endpoint indices are out of order

(fromIndex > toIndex)

- removeRange

```java
protected void removeRange​(int fromIndex,
int toIndex)
```

Removes from this list all of the elements whose index is between

fromIndex

, inclusive, and

toIndex

, exclusive.
Shifts any succeeding elements to the left (reduces their index).
This call shortens the list by

(toIndex - fromIndex)

elements.
(If

toIndex==fromIndex

, this operation has no effect.)

```

Compares the specified Object with this Vector for equality. Returns
true if and only if the specified Object is also a List, both Lists
have the same size, and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two
Lists are

subList

```java
public
List
<
E
> subList​(int fromIndex,
int toIndex)
```

Returns a view of the portion of this List between fromIndex,
inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive. (If fromIndex and toIndex are
equal, the returned List is empty.) The returned List is backed by this
List, so changes in the returned List are reflected in this List, and
vice-versa. The returned List supports all of the optional List
operations supported by this List.

This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
the sort that commonly exist for arrays). Any operation that expects
a List can be used as a range operation by operating on a subList view
instead of a whole List. For example, the following idiom
removes a range of elements from a List:

```java
list.subList(from, to).clear();
```

Similar idioms may be constructed for indexOf and lastIndexOf,
and all of the algorithms in the Collections class can be applied to
a subList.

The semantics of the List returned by this method become undefined if
the backing list (i.e., this List) is

structurally modified

in
any way other than via the returned List. (Structural modifications are
those that change the size of the List, or otherwise perturb it in such
a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)

**Parameters:** fromIndex

- low endpoint (inclusive) of the subList
**Parameters:** toIndex

**Returns:** a view of the specified range within this List
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if an endpoint index value is out of range

(fromIndex < 0 || toIndex > size)
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the endpoint indices are out of order

(fromIndex > toIndex)
