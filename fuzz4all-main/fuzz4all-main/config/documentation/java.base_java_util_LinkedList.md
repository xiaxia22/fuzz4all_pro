# Class LinkedList<E>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\LinkedList.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
LinkedList<E>

extends
AbstractSequentialList
<E>
implements
List
<E>,
Deque
<E>,
Cloneable
,
Serializable
```

Doubly-linked list implementation of the

List

and

Deque

interfaces. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all
elements (including

null

).

All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked
list. Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from
the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index.

Note that this implementation is not synchronized.

If multiple threads access a linked list concurrently, and at least
one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it

must

be
synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation
that adds or deletes one or more elements; merely setting the value of
an element is not a structural modification.) This is typically
accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally
encapsulates the list.

If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the

Collections.synchronizedList

method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
unsynchronized access to the list:

```java
List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...));
```

The iterators returned by this class's

iterator

and

listIterator

methods are

fail-fast

: if the list is
structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in
any way except through the Iterator's own

remove

or

add

methods, the iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of concurrent
modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than
risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.

This class is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

- the type of elements held in this collection

modified at any time after the Iterator is created, in any way except
through the list-iterator's own

remove

add

methods, the list-iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of
concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather
than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future.

**Specified by:**

<

E

>
- listIterator

in class

AbstractSequentialList

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- index

- index of the first element to be returned from the
list-iterator (by a call to

next

)

---

#### public
Object
clone()

Returns a shallow copy of this

LinkedList

. (The elements
themselves are not cloned.)

**Overrides:**
- clone

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a shallow copy of this

LinkedList

instance

**See Also:**
- Cloneable

---

#### public
Object
[] toArray()

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list
in proper sequence (from first to last element).

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this list. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Specified by:**
- toArray

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
- toArray

in interface

List

<

E

>

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Returns:**
- an array containing all of the elements in this list
in proper sequence

**See Also:**
- Arrays.asList(Object[])

---

#### public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in
proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of
the returned array is that of the specified array. If the list fits
in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new
array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and
the size of this list.

If the list fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e.,
the array has more elements than the list), the element in the array
immediately following the end of the list is set to

null

.
(This is useful in determining the length of the list

only

if
the caller knows that the list does not contain any null elements.)

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a list known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the list into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Specified by:**

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
- toArray

in interface

List

<

E

**Overrides:**
- toArray

in class

AbstractCollection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- a

- the array into which the elements of the list are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose.

**Returns:**
- an array containing the elements of the list

**Throws:**
- ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this list
- NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection

#### public
Spliterator
<
E
> spliterator()

Creates a

late-binding

and

fail-fast

Spliterator

over the elements in this
list.

The

Spliterator

reports

Spliterator.SIZED

and

Spliterator.ORDERED

. Overriding implementations should document
the reporting of additional characteristic values.

```

Doubly-linked list implementation of the

List

and

Deque

interfaces. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all
elements (including

null

).

All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked
list. Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from
the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index.

Note that this implementation is not synchronized.

If multiple threads access a linked list concurrently, and at least
one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it

must

be
synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation
that adds or deletes one or more elements; merely setting the value of
an element is not a structural modification.) This is typically
accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally
encapsulates the list.

If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the

Collections.synchronizedList

method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
unsynchronized access to the list:

```java
List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...));
```

The iterators returned by this class's

iterator

and

listIterator

methods are

fail-fast

: if the list is
structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in
any way except through the Iterator's own

remove

or

add

methods, the iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of concurrent
modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than
risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.

Deque

interfaces. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all
elements (including

null

).

All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked
list. Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from
the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index.

Note that this implementation is not synchronized.

If multiple threads access a linked list concurrently, and at least
one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it

must

be
synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation
that adds or deletes one or more elements; merely setting the value of
an element is not a structural modification.) This is typically
accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally
encapsulates the list.

If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the

Collections.synchronizedList

method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
unsynchronized access to the list:

```java
List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...));
```

The iterators returned by this class's

iterator

and

listIterator

methods are

fail-fast

: if the list is
structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in
any way except through the Iterator's own

remove

or

add

methods, the iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of concurrent
modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than
risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw

ConcurrentModificationException

on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness:

the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.

E
> listIterator​(int index)
```

Returns a list-iterator of the elements in this list (in proper
sequence), starting at the specified position in the list.
Obeys the general contract of

List.listIterator(int)

.

The list-iterator is

fail-fast

: if the list is structurally
modified at any time after the Iterator is created, in any way except
through the list-iterator's own

remove

or

add

methods, the list-iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of
concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather
than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future.

**Specified by:** listIterator

- clone

- toArray

```java
public
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list
in proper sequence (from first to last element).

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this list. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this list

**See Also:** Arrays.asList(Object[])

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in
proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of
the returned array is that of the specified array. If the list fits
in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new
array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and
the size of this list.

If the list fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e.,
the array has more elements than the list), the element in the array
immediately following the end of the list is set to

null

.
(This is useful in determining the length of the list

only

if
the caller knows that the list does not contain any null elements.)

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a list known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the list into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Type Parameters:** T

- the component type of the array to contain the collection
**Parameters:** a

- the array into which the elements of the list are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose.
**Returns:** an array containing the elements of the list
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this list
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

- spliterator

```java
public
Spliterator

```

Creates a

late-binding

and

fail-fast

Spliterator

over the elements in this
list.

The

Spliterator

reports

Spliterator.SIZED

and

Spliterator.ORDERED

. Overriding implementations should document
the reporting of additional characteristic values.

- listIterator

```java
public
ListIterator
<
E
> listIterator​(int index)
```

Returns a list-iterator of the elements in this list (in proper
sequence), starting at the specified position in the list.
Obeys the general contract of

List.listIterator(int)

.

The list-iterator is

fail-fast

: if the list is structurally
modified at any time after the Iterator is created, in any way except
through the list-iterator's own

remove

or

add

methods, the list-iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of
concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather
than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future.

**Specified by:** listIterator

in interface

List

**Parameters:** index

- index of the first element to be returned from the
list-iterator (by a call to

)
**Returns:** a ListIterator of the elements in this list (in proper
sequence), starting at the specified position in the list
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the index is out of range
(

index < 0 || index > size()

)

- descendingIterator

```java
public

sequential order. The elements will be returned in order from
last (tail) to first (head).

**Returns:** a shallow copy of this

LinkedList

instance

- toArray

```java
public
Object
[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list
in proper sequence (from first to last element).

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this list. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

in interface

Collection

<

E

**Specified by:** toArray

in interface

List

<

**Overrides:** toArray

>
**Returns:** an array containing all of the elements in this list
in proper sequence
**See Also:** Arrays.asList(Object[])

- toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in
proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of
the returned array is that of the specified array. If the list fits
in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new
array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and
the size of this list.

If the list fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e.,
the array has more elements than the list), the element in the array
immediately following the end of the list is set to

null

.
(This is useful in determining the length of the list

only

if
the caller knows that the list does not contain any null elements.)

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a list known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the list into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()

.

**Parameters:** a

- the array into which the elements of the list are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose.
**Returns:** an array containing the elements of the list
**Throws:** ArrayStoreException

- if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this list
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified array is null

- spliterator

```java
public
Spliterator

```

Creates a

late-binding

and

fail-fast

Spliterator

over the elements in this
list.

The

Spliterator

reports

Spliterator.SIZED

and

Spliterator.ORDERED

. Overriding implementations should document
the reporting of additional characteristic values.

Returns a list-iterator of the elements in this list (in proper
sequence), starting at the specified position in the list.
Obeys the general contract of

List.listIterator(int)

.

The list-iterator is

fail-fast

: if the list is structurally
modified at any time after the Iterator is created, in any way except
through the list-iterator's own

remove

or

add

methods, the list-iterator will throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

. Thus, in the face of
concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather
than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future.

toArray

```java

[] toArray()
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list
in proper sequence (from first to last element).

The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
maintained by this list. (In other words, this method must allocate
a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
APIs.

toArray

```java
public <T> T[] toArray​(T[] a)
```

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in
proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of
the returned array is that of the specified array. If the list fits
in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new
array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and
the size of this list.

If the list fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e.,
the array has more elements than the list), the element in the array
immediately following the end of the list is set to

null

.
(This is useful in determining the length of the list

only

if
the caller knows that the list does not contain any null elements.)

Like the

toArray()

method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Suppose

x

is a list known to contain only strings.
The following code can be used to dump the list into a newly
allocated array of

String

:

```java
String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
```

Note that

toArray(new Object[0])

is identical in function to

toArray()
