# Interface Relation

**Source:** `java.management\javax\management\relation\Relation.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Relation
```

This interface has to be implemented by any MBean class expected to
represent a relation managed using the Relation Service.

Simple relations, i.e. having only roles, no properties or methods, can
be created directly by the Relation Service (represented as RelationSupport
objects, internally handled by the Relation Service).

If the user wants to represent more complex relations, involving
properties and/or methods, he has to provide his own class implementing the
Relation interface. This can be achieved either by inheriting from
RelationSupport class, or by implementing the interface (fully or delegation to
a RelationSupport object member).

Specifying such user relation class is to introduce properties and/or
methods. Those have to be exposed for remote management. So this means that
any user relation class must be a MBean class.

**All Known Implementing Classes:** RelationSupport

```java
public interface
Relation
```

This interface has to be implemented by any MBean class expected to
represent a relation managed using the Relation Service.

Simple relations, i.e. having only roles, no properties or methods, can
be created directly by the Relation Service (represented as RelationSupport
objects, internally handled by the Relation Service).

If the user wants to represent more complex relations, involving
properties and/or methods, he has to provide his own class implementing the
Relation interface. This can be achieved either by inheriting from
RelationSupport class, or by implementing the interface (fully or delegation to
a RelationSupport object member).

Specifying such user relation class is to introduce properties and/or
methods. Those have to be exposed for remote management. So this means that
any user relation class must be a MBean class.

Callback used by the Relation Service when a MBean referenced in a role
is unregistered.

The Relation Service will call this method to let the relation
take action to reflect the impact of such unregistration.

**Throws:** RelationServiceNotRegisteredException

- if the Relation
Service is not registered in the MBean Server
**Throws:** RelationTypeNotFoundException

- if the relation type has not
