# Interface SQLXML

**Source:** `java.sql\java\sql\SQLXML.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
SQLXML
```

The mapping in the JavaTM programming language for the SQL XML type.
XML is a built-in type that stores an XML value
as a column value in a row of a database table.
By default drivers implement an SQLXML object as
a logical pointer to the XML data
rather than the data itself.
An SQLXML object is valid for the duration of the transaction in which it was created.

The SQLXML interface provides methods for accessing the XML value
as a String, a Reader or Writer, or as a Stream. The XML value
may also be accessed through a Source or set as a Result, which
are used with XML Parser APIs such as DOM, SAX, and StAX, as
well as with XSLT transforms and XPath evaluations.

Methods in the interfaces ResultSet, CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement,
such as getSQLXML allow a programmer to access an XML value.
In addition, this interface has methods for updating an XML value.

The XML value of the SQLXML instance may be obtained as a BinaryStream using

```java
SQLXML sqlxml = resultSet.getSQLXML(column);
InputStream binaryStream = sqlxml.getBinaryStream();
```

For example, to parse an XML value with a DOM parser:

```java
DocumentBuilder parser = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder();
Document result = parser.parse(binaryStream);
```

or to parse an XML value with a SAX parser to your handler:

```java
SAXParser parser = SAXParserFactory.newInstance().newSAXParser();
parser.parse(binaryStream, myHandler);
```

or to parse an XML value with a StAX parser:

```java
XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();
XMLStreamReader streamReader = factory.createXMLStreamReader(binaryStream);
```

Because databases may use an optimized representation for the XML,
accessing the value through getSource() and
setResult() can lead to improved processing performance
without serializing to a stream representation and parsing the XML.

For example, to obtain a DOM Document Node:

```java
DOMSource domSource = sqlxml.getSource(DOMSource.class);
Document document = (Document) domSource.getNode();
```

or to set the value to a DOM Document Node to myNode:

```java
DOMResult domResult = sqlxml.setResult(DOMResult.class);
domResult.setNode(myNode);
```

or, to send SAX events to your handler:

```java
SAXSource saxSource = sqlxml.getSource(SAXSource.class);
XMLReader xmlReader = saxSource.getXMLReader();
xmlReader.setContentHandler(myHandler);
xmlReader.parse(saxSource.getInputSource());
```

or, to set the result value from SAX events:

```java
SAXResult saxResult = sqlxml.setResult(SAXResult.class);
ContentHandler contentHandler = saxResult.getHandler();
contentHandler.startDocument();
// set the XML elements and attributes into the result
contentHandler.endDocument();
```

or, to obtain StAX events:

```java
StAXSource staxSource = sqlxml.getSource(StAXSource.class);
XMLStreamReader streamReader = staxSource.getXMLStreamReader();
```

or, to set the result value from StAX events:

```java
StAXResult staxResult = sqlxml.setResult(StAXResult.class);
XMLStreamWriter streamWriter = staxResult.getXMLStreamWriter();
```

or, to perform XSLT transformations on the XML value using the XSLT in xsltFile
output to file resultFile:

```java
File xsltFile = new File("a.xslt");
File myFile = new File("result.xml");
Transformer xslt = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(new StreamSource(xsltFile));
Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
Result result = new StreamResult(myFile);
xslt.transform(source, result);
```

or, to evaluate an XPath expression on the XML value:

```java
XPath xpath = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath();
DOMSource domSource = sqlxml.getSource(DOMSource.class);
Document document = (Document) domSource.getNode();
String expression = "/foo/@bar";
String barValue = xpath.evaluate(expression, document);
```

To set the XML value to be the result of an XSLT transform:

```java
File sourceFile = new File("source.xml");
Transformer xslt = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(new StreamSource(xsltFile));
Source streamSource = new StreamSource(sourceFile);
Result result = sqlxml.setResult(null);
xslt.transform(streamSource, result);
```

Any Source can be transformed to a Result using the identity transform
specified by calling newTransformer():

```java
Transformer identity = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer();
Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
File myFile = new File("result.xml");
Result result = new StreamResult(myFile);
identity.transform(source, result);
```

To write the contents of a Source to standard output:

```java
Transformer identity = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer();
Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
Result result = new StreamResult(System.out);
identity.transform(source, result);
```

To create a DOMSource from a DOMResult:

```java
DOMSource domSource = new DOMSource(domResult.getNode());
```

Incomplete or invalid XML values may cause an SQLException when
set or the exception may occur when execute() occurs. All streams
must be closed before execute() occurs or an SQLException will be thrown.

Reading and writing XML values to or from an SQLXML object can happen at most once.
The conceptual states of readable and not readable determine if one
of the reading APIs will return a value or throw an exception.
The conceptual states of writable and not writable determine if one
of the writing APIs will set a value or throw an exception.

The state moves from readable to not readable once free() or any of the
reading APIs are called: getBinaryStream(), getCharacterStream(), getSource(), and getString().
Implementations may also change the state to not writable when this occurs.

The state moves from writable to not writable once free() or any of the
writing APIs are called: setBinaryStream(), setCharacterStream(), setResult(), and setString().
Implementations may also change the state to not readable when this occurs.

All methods on the

SQLXML

interface must be fully implemented if the
JDBC driver supports the data type.

SAXResult has a content handler assigned that will receive the
SAX events based on the contents of the XML. Call the content
handler with the contents of the XML document to assign the values.

```java
SAXResult saxResult = sqlxml.setResult(SAXResult.class);
ContentHandler contentHandler = saxResult.getXMLReader().getContentHandler();
contentHandler.startDocument();

Transformer xslt = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(new StreamSource(xsltFile));
Source streamSource = new StreamSource(sourceFile);
Result result = sqlxml.setResult(null);
xslt.transform(streamSource, result);

specified by calling newTransformer():

```java
Transformer identity = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer();
Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
File myFile = new File("result.xml");
Result result = new StreamResult(myFile);
identity.transform(source, result);
```

To write the contents of a Source to standard output:

```java
Transformer identity = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer();
Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
Result result = new StreamResult(System.out);
identity.transform(source, result);
```

To create a DOMSource from a DOMResult:

```java
DOMSource domSource = new DOMSource(domResult.getNode());
```

Incomplete or invalid XML values may cause an SQLException when
set or the exception may occur when execute() occurs. All streams
must be closed before execute() occurs or an SQLException will be thrown.

Reading and writing XML values to or from an SQLXML object can happen at most once.
The conceptual states of readable and not readable determine if one
of the reading APIs will return a value or throw an exception.
The conceptual states of writable and not writable determine if one
of the writing APIs will set a value or throw an exception.

The state moves from readable to not readable once free() or any of the
reading APIs are called: getBinaryStream(), getCharacterStream(), getSource(), and getString().
Implementations may also change the state to not writable when this occurs.

The state moves from writable to not writable once free() or any of the
writing APIs are called: setBinaryStream(), setCharacterStream(), setResult(), and setString().
Implementations may also change the state to not readable when this occurs.

```

or, to set the result value from SAX events:

```

or, to evaluate an XPath expression on the XML value:

```java
XPath xpath = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath();
DOMSource domSource = sqlxml.getSource(DOMSource.class);
Document document = (Document) domSource.getNode();
String expression = "/foo/@bar";
String barValue = xpath.evaluate(expression, document);
```

To set the XML value to be the result of an XSLT transform:

File sourceFile = new File("source.xml");
Transformer xslt = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(new StreamSource(xsltFile));
Source streamSource = new StreamSource(sourceFile);
Result result = sqlxml.setResult(null);
xslt.transform(streamSource, result);
```

Any Source can be transformed to a Result using the identity transform
specified by calling newTransformer():

```java
Transformer identity = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer();
Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
File myFile = new File("result.xml");
Result result = new StreamResult(myFile);
identity.transform(source, result);
```

```java
Transformer identity = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer();
Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
Result result = new StreamResult(System.out);
identity.transform(source, result);
```

To create a DOMSource from a DOMResult:

```java
DOMSource domSource = new DOMSource(domResult.getNode());
```

Incomplete or invalid XML values may cause an SQLException when
set or the exception may occur when execute() occurs. All streams
must be closed before execute() occurs or an SQLException will be thrown.

Reading and writing XML values to or from an SQLXML object can happen at most once.
The conceptual states of readable and not readable determine if one
of the reading APIs will return a value or throw an exception.
The conceptual states of writable and not writable determine if one
of the writing APIs will set a value or throw an exception.

The state moves from readable to not readable once free() or any of the
reading APIs are called: getBinaryStream(), getCharacterStream(), getSource(), and getString().
Implementations may also change the state to not writable when this occurs.

The state moves from writable to not writable once free() or any of the
writing APIs are called: setBinaryStream(), setCharacterStream(), setResult(), and setString().
Implementations may also change the state to not readable when this occurs.

All methods on the

SQLXML

interface must be fully implemented if the
JDBC driver supports the data type.

Methods in the interfaces ResultSet, CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement,
such as getSQLXML allow a programmer to access an XML value.
In addition, this interface has methods for updating an XML value.

The XML value of the SQLXML instance may be obtained as a BinaryStream using

```java
SQLXML sqlxml = resultSet.getSQLXML(column);
InputStream binaryStream = sqlxml.getBinaryStream();
```

For example, to parse an XML value with a DOM parser:

```java
DocumentBuilder parser = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder();
Document result = parser.parse(binaryStream);
```

or to parse an XML value with a SAX parser to your handler:

```java
SAXParser parser = SAXParserFactory.newInstance().newSAXParser();
parser.parse(binaryStream, myHandler);
```

or to parse an XML value with a StAX parser:

```java
XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();
XMLStreamReader streamReader = factory.createXMLStreamReader(binaryStream);
```

Because databases may use an optimized representation for the XML,
accessing the value through getSource() and
setResult() can lead to improved processing performance
without serializing to a stream representation and parsing the XML.

For example, to obtain a DOM Document Node:

```java
DOMSource domSource = sqlxml.getSource(DOMSource.class);
Document document = (Document) domSource.getNode();
```

or to set the value to a DOM Document Node to myNode:

```java
DOMResult domResult = sqlxml.setResult(DOMResult.class);
domResult.setNode(myNode);
```

or, to send SAX events to your handler:

```java
SAXSource saxSource = sqlxml.getSource(SAXSource.class);
XMLReader xmlReader = saxSource.getXMLReader();
xmlReader.setContentHandler(myHandler);
xmlReader.parse(saxSource.getInputSource());
```

or, to set the result value from SAX events:

```java
SAXResult saxResult = sqlxml.setResult(SAXResult.class);
ContentHandler contentHandler = saxResult.getHandler();
contentHandler.startDocument();
// set the XML elements and attributes into the result
contentHandler.endDocument();
```

or, to obtain StAX events:

```java
StAXSource staxSource = sqlxml.getSource(StAXSource.class);
XMLStreamReader streamReader = staxSource.getXMLStreamReader();
```

or, to set the result value from StAX events:

```java
StAXResult staxResult = sqlxml.setResult(StAXResult.class);
XMLStreamWriter streamWriter = staxResult.getXMLStreamWriter();
```

or, to perform XSLT transformations on the XML value using the XSLT in xsltFile
output to file resultFile:

```java
File xsltFile = new File("a.xslt");
File myFile = new File("result.xml");
Transformer xslt = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(new StreamSource(xsltFile));
Source source = sqlxml.getSource(null);
Result result = new StreamResult(myFile);
xslt.transform(source, result);
```

or, to evaluate an XPath expression on the XML value:

```java
XPath xpath = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath();
DOMSource domSource = sqlxml.getSource(DOMSource.class);
Document document = (Document) domSource.getNode();
String expression = "/foo/@bar";
String barValue = xpath.evaluate(expression, document);
```

To set the XML value to be the result of an XSLT transform:

```java
File sourceFile = new File("source.xml");
Transformer xslt = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(new StreamSource(xsltFile));
Source streamSource = new StreamSource(sourceFile);
Result result = sqlxml.setResult(null);
xslt.transform(streamSource, result);
```

```

getSource

```java
<T extends
Source
> T getSource​(
Class
<T> sourceClass)
throws
SQLException
```

Returns a Source for reading the XML value designated by this SQLXML instance.
Sources are used as inputs to XML parsers and XSLT transformers.

Sources for XML parsers will have namespace processing on by default.
The systemID of the Source is implementation dependent.

The SQL XML object becomes not readable when this method is called and
may also become not writable depending on implementation.

Note that SAX is a callback architecture, so a returned
SAXSource should then be set with a content handler that will
receive the SAX events from parsing. The content handler
will receive callbacks based on the contents of the XML.

```java
SAXSource saxSource = sqlxml.getSource(SAXSource.class);
XMLReader xmlReader = saxSource.getXMLReader();
xmlReader.setContentHandler(myHandler);
xmlReader.parse(saxSource.getInputSource());
```

**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the class modeled by this Class object
**Parameters:** sourceClass

- The class of the source, or null.
If the class is null, a vendor specific Source implementation will be returned.
The following classes are supported at a minimum:

```java
javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource - returns a DOMSource
javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource - returns a SAXSource
javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource - returns a StAXSource
javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource - returns a StreamSource
```
**Returns:** a Source for reading the XML value.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if there is an error processing the XML value
or if this feature is not supported.
The getCause() method of the exception may provide a more detailed exception, for example,
if an XML parser exception occurs.
An exception is thrown if the state is not readable.
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
