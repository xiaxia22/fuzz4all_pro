### Method Details

#### public static
FileTime
from​(long value,

TimeUnit
unit)

Returns a

FileTime

representing a value at the given unit of
granularity.

**Parameters:**
- value

- the value since the epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z); can be
negative
- unit

- the unit of granularity to interpret the value

**Returns:**
- a

FileTime

representing the given value

---

#### public static
FileTime
fromMillis​(long value)

Returns a

FileTime

representing the given value in milliseconds.

**Parameters:**
- value

- the value, in milliseconds, since the epoch
(1970-01-01T00:00:00Z); can be negative

**Returns:**
- a

FileTime

representing the given value

---

#### public static
FileTime
from​(
Instant
instant)

Returns a

FileTime

representing the same point of time value
on the time-line as the provided

Instant

object.

**Parameters:**
- instant

- the instant to convert

**Returns:**
- a

FileTime

representing the same point on the time-line
as the provided instant

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public long to​(
TimeUnit
unit)

Returns the value at the given unit of granularity.

Conversion from a coarser granularity that would numerically overflow
saturate to

Long.MIN_VALUE

if negative or

Long.MAX_VALUE

if positive.

**Parameters:**
- unit

- the unit of granularity for the return value

**Returns:**
- value in the given unit of granularity, since the epoch
since the epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z); can be negative

---

#### public long toMillis()

Returns the value in milliseconds.

Conversion from a coarser granularity that would numerically overflow
saturate to

Long.MIN_VALUE

if negative or

Long.MAX_VALUE

if positive.

**Returns:**
- the value in milliseconds, since the epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)

---

#### public
Instant
toInstant()

Converts this

FileTime

object to an

Instant

.

The conversion creates an

Instant

that represents the
same point on the time-line as this

FileTime

.

FileTime

can store points on the time-line further in the
future and further in the past than

Instant

. Conversion
from such further time points saturates to

Instant.MIN

if
earlier than

Instant.MIN

or

Instant.MAX

if later
than

Instant.MAX

.

**Returns:**
- an instant representing the same point on the time-line as
this

FileTime

object

**Since:**
- 1.8

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)

Tests this

FileTime

for equality with the given object.

The result is

true

if and only if the argument is not

null

and is a

FileTime

that represents the same time. This
method satisfies the general contract of the

Object.equals

method.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- obj

- the object to compare with

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, the given object is a

FileTime

that represents the same time

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### public int hashCode()

Computes a hash code for this file time.

The hash code is based upon the value represented, and satisfies the
general contract of the

Object.hashCode()

method.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- the hash-code value

**See Also:**
- Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

,

System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)

---

#### public int compareTo​(
FileTime
other)

Compares the value of two

FileTime

objects for order.

**Specified by:**
- compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

FileTime

>

**Parameters:**
- other

- the other

FileTime

to be compared

**Returns:**
- 0

if this

FileTime

is equal to

other

, a
value less than 0 if this

FileTime

represents a time
that is before

other

, and a value greater than 0 if this

FileTime

represents a time that is after

other

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns the string representation of this

FileTime

. The string
is returned in the

ISO 8601

format:

```java
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.s+]Z
```

where "

[.s+]

" represents a dot followed by one of more digits
for the decimal fraction of a second. It is only present when the decimal
fraction of a second is not zero. For example,

FileTime.fromMillis(1234567890000L).toString()

yields

"2009-02-13T23:31:30Z"

, and

FileTime.fromMillis(1234567890123L).toString()

yields

"2009-02-13T23:31:30.123Z"

.

A

FileTime

is primarily intended to represent the value of a
file's time stamp. Where used to represent

extreme values

, where
the year is less than "

0001

" or greater than "

9999

" then
this method deviates from ISO 8601 in the same manner as the

XML Schema
language

. That is, the year may be expanded to more than four digits
and may be negative-signed. If more than four digits then leading zeros
are not present. The year before "

0001

" is "

-0001

".

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- the string representation of this file time

equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
obj)
```

Tests this

FileTime

for equality with the given object.

The result is

true

if and only if the argument is not

null

and is a

FileTime

that represents the same time. This
method satisfies the general contract of the

Object.equals

method.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** obj

- the object to compare with
**Returns:** true

if, and only if, the given object is a

FileTime

that represents the same time
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Computes a hash code for this file time.

The hash code is based upon the value represented, and satisfies the
general contract of the

Object.hashCode()

method.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** the hash-code value
**See Also:** Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

#### hashCode

public int hashCode()

Computes a hash code for this file time.

The hash code is based upon the value represented, and satisfies the
general contract of the

Object.hashCode()

method.

compareTo

```java
public int compareTo​(
FileTime

```

Compares the value of two

FileTime

objects for order.

**Specified by:** compareTo

in interface

Comparable

<

FileTime

>
**Parameters:** other

- the other

FileTime

to be compared
**Returns:** 0

if this

FileTime

is equal to

other

, a
value less than 0 if this

FileTime

represents a time
that is before

other

, and a value greater than 0 if this

FileTime

represents a time that is after

other

#### compareTo

public int compareTo​(

FileTime

other)

Compares the value of two

FileTime

objects for order.

toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the string representation of this

FileTime

. The string
is returned in the

ISO 8601

format:

```java
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[.s+]Z
```

where "

[.s+]

" represents a dot followed by one of more digits
for the decimal fraction of a second. It is only present when the decimal
fraction of a second is not zero. For example,

FileTime.fromMillis(1234567890000L).toString()

yields

"2009-02-13T23:31:30Z"

, and

FileTime.fromMillis(1234567890123L).toString()

yields

"2009-02-13T23:31:30.123Z"

.

A

FileTime

is primarily intended to represent the value of a
file's time stamp. Where used to represent

extreme values

, where
the year is less than "

0001

" or greater than "

9999

" then
this method deviates from ISO 8601 in the same manner as the

XML Schema
language

. That is, the year may be expanded to more than four digits
and may be negative-signed. If more than four digits then leading zeros
are not present. The year before "

0001

" is "

-0001

".
