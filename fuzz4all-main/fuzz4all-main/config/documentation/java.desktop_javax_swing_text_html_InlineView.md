### Constructor Details

#### public InlineView​(
Element
elem)

Constructs a new view wrapped on an element.

**Parameters:**
- elem

- the element

---

### Method Details

#### public void insertUpdate​(
DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)

Gives notification that something was inserted into
the document in a location that this view is responsible for.
If either parameter is

null

, behavior of this method is
implementation dependent.

**Overrides:**
- insertUpdate

in class

GlyphView

**Parameters:**
- e

- the change information from the associated document
- a

- the current allocation of the view
- f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

**See Also:**
- View.insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public void removeUpdate​(
DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)

Gives notification that something was removed from the document
in a location that this view is responsible for.
If either parameter is

null

, behavior of this method is
implementation dependent.

**Overrides:**
- removeUpdate

in class

GlyphView

**Parameters:**
- e

- the change information from the associated document
- a

- the current allocation of the view
- f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

**See Also:**
- View.removeUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public void changedUpdate​(
DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)

Gives notification from the document that attributes were changed
in a location that this view is responsible for.

**Overrides:**
- changedUpdate

in class

LabelView

**Parameters:**
- e

- the change information from the associated document
- a

- the current allocation of the view
- f

- the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

**See Also:**
- View.changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)

---

#### public
AttributeSet
getAttributes()

Fetches the attributes to use when rendering. This is
implemented to multiplex the attributes specified in the
model with a StyleSheet.

**Overrides:**
- getAttributes

in class

View

**Returns:**
- the attributes to use when rendering

---

#### public int getBreakWeight​(int axis,
float pos,
float len)

Determines how attractive a break opportunity in
this view is. This can be used for determining which
view is the most attractive to call

breakView

on in the process of formatting. A view that represents
text that has whitespace in it might be more attractive
than a view that has no whitespace, for example. The
higher the weight, the more attractive the break. A
value equal to or lower than

BadBreakWeight

should not be considered for a break. A value greater
than or equal to

ForcedBreakWeight

should
be broken.

This is implemented to provide the default behavior
of returning

BadBreakWeight

unless the length
is greater than the length of the view in which case the
entire view represents the fragment. Unless a view has
been written to support breaking behavior, it is not
attractive to try and break the view. An example of
a view that does support breaking is

LabelView

.
An example of a view that uses break weight is

ParagraphView

.

**Overrides:**
- getBreakWeight

in class

GlyphView

**Parameters:**
- axis

- may be either View.X_AXIS or View.Y_AXIS
- pos

- the potential location of the start of the
broken view >= 0. This may be useful for calculating tab
positions.
- len

- specifies the relative length from

pos

where a potential break is desired >= 0.

**Returns:**
- the weight, which should be a value between
ForcedBreakWeight and BadBreakWeight.

**See Also:**
- LabelView

View.GoodBreakWeight

#### public
View
breakView​(int axis,
int offset,
float pos,
float len)

Tries to break this view on the given axis. Refer to

View.breakView(int, int, float, float)

for a complete
description of this method.

Behavior of this method is unspecified in case

axis

is neither

View.X_AXIS

nor

View.Y_AXIS

, and
in case

offset

,

pos

, or

len

is null.

**Overrides:**
- breakView

in class

GlyphView

**Parameters:**
- axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
- offset

- the location in the document model
that a broken fragment would occupy >= 0. This
would be the starting offset of the fragment
returned
- pos

- the position along the axis that the
broken view would occupy >= 0. This may be useful for
things like tab calculations
- len

- specifies the distance along the axis
where a potential break is desired >= 0

**Returns:**
- the fragment of the view that represents the
given span.

**See Also:**
- View.breakView(int, int, float, float)

**Since:**
- 1.5

#### protected void setPropertiesFromAttributes()

Set the cached properties from the attributes.

**Overrides:**
- setPropertiesFromAttributes

in class

LabelView

---

#### protected
StyleSheet
getStyleSheet()

GlyphView
**Parameters:** axis

- may be either View.X_AXIS or View.Y_AXIS
**Parameters:** pos

- the potential location of the start of the
broken view >= 0. This may be useful for calculating tab
positions.
**Parameters:** len

- specifies the relative length from

pos

where a potential break is desired >= 0.

- breakView

```java

breakView​(int axis,
int offset,
float pos,

```

Tries to break this view on the given axis. Refer to

View.breakView(int, int, float, float)

for a complete
description of this method.

Behavior of this method is unspecified in case

axis

is neither

View.X_AXIS

nor

View.Y_AXIS

, and
in case

offset

,

pos

, or

len

is null.

**Overrides:** breakView

in class

GlyphView
**Parameters:** axis

- may be either

View.X_AXIS

or

View.Y_AXIS
**Parameters:** offset

- the location in the document model
that a broken fragment would occupy >= 0. This
would be the starting offset of the fragment
returned
**Parameters:** pos

- the position along the axis that the
broken view would occupy >= 0. This may be useful for
things like tab calculations
**Parameters:** len

- specifies the distance along the axis
where a potential break is desired >= 0
**Returns:** the fragment of the view that represents the
given span.
**Since:** 1.5

DocumentEvent
e,

Shape
a,

ViewFactory

changedUpdate

```java
public void changedUpdate​(

Shape
a,

ViewFactory
f)
```

Gives notification from the document that attributes were changed
in a location that this view is responsible for.

**Overrides:** changedUpdate

in class

LabelView
**Parameters:** e

- the change information from the associated document
**Parameters:** a

- the current allocation of the view
**Parameters:** f

getAttributes

```java
public
AttributeSet
getAttributes()
```

Fetches the attributes to use when rendering. This is
implemented to multiplex the attributes specified in the
model with a StyleSheet.

**Overrides:** getAttributes

in class

**Returns:** the attributes to use when rendering

model with a StyleSheet.

getBreakWeight

```java
public int getBreakWeight​(int axis,
float pos,
float len)
```

Determines how attractive a break opportunity in
this view is. This can be used for determining which
view is the most attractive to call

breakView

on in the process of formatting. A view that represents
text that has whitespace in it might be more attractive
than a view that has no whitespace, for example. The
higher the weight, the more attractive the break. A
value equal to or lower than

BadBreakWeight

should not be considered for a break. A value greater
than or equal to

ForcedBreakWeight

should
be broken.

This is implemented to provide the default behavior
of returning

BadBreakWeight

unless the length
is greater than the length of the view in which case the
entire view represents the fragment. Unless a view has
been written to support breaking behavior, it is not
attractive to try and break the view. An example of
a view that does support breaking is
