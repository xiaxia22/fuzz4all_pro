# Class ManagementFactory

**Source:** `java.management\java\lang\management\ManagementFactory.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ManagementFactory

extends
Object
```

The

ManagementFactory

class is a factory class for getting
managed beans for the Java platform.
This class consists of static methods each of which returns
one or more

platform MXBeans

representing
the management interface of a component of the Java virtual
machine.

Platform MXBeans

A platform MXBean is a

managed bean

that
conforms to the

JMX

Instrumentation Specification and only uses a set of basic data types.
A JMX management application and the

platform MBeanServer

can interoperate without requiring classes for MXBean specific
data types.
The data types being transmitted between the JMX connector
server and the connector client are

open types

and this allows interoperation across versions.
See

the specification of MXBeans

for details.

Each platform MXBean is a

PlatformManagedObject

and it has a unique

ObjectName

for
registration in the platform

MBeanServer

as returned by
by the

getObjectName

method.

An application can access a platform MXBean in the following ways:

1. Direct access to an MXBean interface

- Get an MXBean instance by calling the

getPlatformMXBean

or

getPlatformMXBeans

method
and access the MXBean locally in the running
virtual machine.
- Construct an MXBean proxy instance that forwards the
method calls to a given

MBeanServer

by calling
the

getPlatformMXBean(MBeanServerConnection, Class)

or

getPlatformMXBeans(MBeanServerConnection, Class)

method.
The

newPlatformMXBeanProxy

method
can also be used to construct an MXBean proxy instance of
a given

ObjectName

.
A proxy is typically constructed to remotely access
an MXBean of another running virtual machine.

2. Indirect access to an MXBean interface via MBeanServer

- Go through the platform

MBeanServer

to access MXBeans
locally or a specific

MBeanServerConnection

to access
MXBeans remotely.
The attributes and operations of an MXBean use only

JMX open types

which include basic data types,

CompositeData

,
and

TabularData

defined in

OpenType

.
The mapping is specified in
the

MXBean

specification
for details.

The

getPlatformManagementInterfaces

method returns all management interfaces supported in the Java virtual machine
including the standard management interfaces listed in the tables
below as well as the management interfaces extended by the JDK implementation.

A Java virtual machine has a single instance of the following management
interfaces:

---

#### public static
MBeanServer
getPlatformMBeanServer()

Returns the platform

MBeanServer

.
On the first call to this method, it first creates the platform

MBeanServer

by calling the

MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer

method and registers each platform MXBean in this platform

MBeanServer

with its

ObjectName

.
This method, in subsequent calls, will simply return the
initially created platform

MBeanServer

.

MXBeans that get created and destroyed dynamically, for example,
memory

pools

and

managers

,
will automatically be registered and deregistered into the platform

MBeanServer

.

If the system property

javax.management.builder.initial

is set, the platform

MBeanServer

creation will be done
by the specified

MBeanServerBuilder

.

It is recommended that this platform MBeanServer also be used
to register other application managed beans
besides the platform MXBeans.
This will allow all MBeans to be published through the same

MBeanServer

and hence allow for easier network publishing
and discovery.
Name conflicts with the platform MXBeans should be avoided.

**Returns:**
- the platform

MBeanServer

; the platform
MXBeans are registered into the platform

MBeanServer

at the first time this method is called.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if there is a security manager
and the caller does not have the permission required by

MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer()

.

#### public static <T> T newPlatformMXBeanProxy​(
MBeanServerConnection
connection,

String
mxbeanName,

Class
<T> mxbeanInterface)
throws
IOException

Returns a proxy for a platform MXBean interface of a
given

MXBean name

that forwards its method calls through the given

MBeanServerConnection

.

This method is equivalent to:

Proxy.newProxyInstance

(mxbeanInterface.getClassLoader(),
new Class[] { mxbeanInterface }, handler)

where

handler

is an

InvocationHandler

to which method invocations to the MXBean interface
are dispatched. This

handler

converts an input parameter
from an MXBean data type to its mapped open type before forwarding
to the

MBeanServer

and converts a return value from
an MXBean method call through the

MBeanServer

from an open type to the corresponding return type declared in
the MXBean interface.

If the MXBean is a notification emitter (i.e.,
it implements

NotificationEmitter

),
both the

mxbeanInterface

and

NotificationEmitter

will be implemented by this proxy.

Notes:

- Using an MXBean proxy is a convenience remote access to
a platform MXBean of a running virtual machine. All method
calls to the MXBean proxy are forwarded to an

MBeanServerConnection

where

IOException

may be thrown
when the communication problem occurs with the connector server.
If thrown,

IOException

will be wrappped in

UndeclaredThrowableException

.
An application remotely accessing the platform MXBeans using
proxy should prepare to catch

UndeclaredThrowableException

and
handle its

cause

as if that cause had been thrown by the

MBeanServerConnection

interface.
- When a client application is designed to remotely access MXBeans
for a running virtual machine whose version is different than
the version on which the application is running,
it should prepare to catch

InvalidObjectException

which is thrown when an MXBean proxy receives a name of an
enum constant which is missing in the enum class loaded in
the client application. If thrown,

InvalidObjectException

will be
wrappped in

UndeclaredThrowableException

.
- MBeanServerInvocationHandler

or its

newProxyInstance

method cannot be used to create
a proxy for a platform MXBean. The proxy object created
by

MBeanServerInvocationHandler

does not handle
the properties of the platform MXBeans described in
the

class specification

.

**Parameters:**
- connection

- the

MBeanServerConnection

to forward to.
- mxbeanName

- the name of a platform MXBean within

connection

to forward to.

mxbeanName

must be
in the format of

ObjectName

.
- mxbeanInterface

- the MXBean interface to be implemented
by the proxy.

**Returns:**
- a proxy for a platform MXBean interface of a
given

MXBean name

that forwards its method calls through the given

MBeanServerConnection

, or

null

if not exist.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

- mxbeanName

is not with a valid

ObjectName

format, or
- the named MXBean in the

connection

is
not a MXBean provided by the platform, or
- the named MXBean is not registered in the

MBeanServerConnection

, or
- the named MXBean is not an instance of the given

mxbeanInterface
- IOException

- if a communication problem
occurred when accessing the

MBeanServerConnection

.

to have one single instance in the Java virtual machine.
This method may return

null

if the management interface
is not implemented in the Java virtual machine (for example,
a Java virtual machine with no compilation system does not
implement

CompilationMXBean

);
otherwise, this method is equivalent to calling:

```java
getPlatformMXBeans(mxbeanInterface)
.get(0);
```

Each platform MXBean is a

PlatformManagedObject

and it has a unique

ObjectName

for
registration in the platform

MBeanServer

as returned by
by the

getObjectName

method.

An application can access a platform MXBean in the following ways:

1. Direct access to an MXBean interface

- Get an MXBean instance by calling the

getPlatformMXBean

or

getPlatformMXBeans

method
and access the MXBean locally in the running
virtual machine.
- Construct an MXBean proxy instance that forwards the
method calls to a given

MBeanServer

by calling
the

getPlatformMXBean(MBeanServerConnection, Class)

or

getPlatformMXBeans(MBeanServerConnection, Class)

method.
The

newPlatformMXBeanProxy

method
can also be used to construct an MXBean proxy instance of
a given

ObjectName

.
A proxy is typically constructed to remotely access
an MXBean of another running virtual machine.

2. Indirect access to an MXBean interface via MBeanServer

- Go through the platform

MBeanServer

to access MXBeans
locally or a specific

MBeanServerConnection

to access
MXBeans remotely.
The attributes and operations of an MXBean use only

JMX open types

which include basic data types,

CompositeData

,
and

TabularData

defined in

OpenType

.
The mapping is specified in
the

MXBean

specification
for details.

The

getPlatformManagementInterfaces

method returns all management interfaces supported in the Java virtual machine
including the standard management interfaces listed in the tables
below as well as the management interfaces extended by the JDK implementation.

A Java virtual machine has a single instance of the following management
interfaces:

If the system property

javax.management.builder.initial

is set, the platform

MBeanServer

creation will be done
by the specified

MBeanServerBuilder

.

It is recommended that this platform MBeanServer also be used
to register other application managed beans
besides the platform MXBeans.
This will allow all MBeans to be published through the same

MBeanServer

and hence allow for easier network publishing
and discovery.
Name conflicts with the platform MXBeans should be avoided.

**Returns:** the platform

MBeanServer

; the platform
MXBeans are registered into the platform

MBeanServer

at the first time this method is called.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if there is a security manager
and the caller does not have the permission required by

MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer()

.
**See Also:** MBeanServerFactory

,

MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer()

- newPlatformMXBeanProxy

```java
public static <T> T newPlatformMXBeanProxy​(
MBeanServerConnection
connection,

String
mxbeanName,

Class
<T> mxbeanInterface)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a proxy for a platform MXBean interface of a
given

MXBean name

that forwards its method calls through the given

MBeanServerConnection

.

This method is equivalent to:

Proxy.newProxyInstance

(mxbeanInterface.getClassLoader(),
new Class[] { mxbeanInterface }, handler)

where

handler

is an

InvocationHandler

to which method invocations to the MXBean interface
are dispatched. This

handler

converts an input parameter
from an MXBean data type to its mapped open type before forwarding
to the

MBeanServer

and converts a return value from
an MXBean method call through the

MBeanServer

from an open type to the corresponding return type declared in
the MXBean interface.

If the MXBean is a notification emitter (i.e.,
it implements

NotificationEmitter

),
both the

mxbeanInterface

and

NotificationEmitter

will be implemented by this proxy.

Notes:

- Using an MXBean proxy is a convenience remote access to
a platform MXBean of a running virtual machine. All method
calls to the MXBean proxy are forwarded to an

MBeanServerConnection

where

IOException

may be thrown
when the communication problem occurs with the connector server.
If thrown,

IOException

will be wrappped in

UndeclaredThrowableException

.
An application remotely accessing the platform MXBeans using
proxy should prepare to catch

UndeclaredThrowableException

and
handle its

cause

as if that cause had been thrown by the

MBeanServerConnection

interface.
- When a client application is designed to remotely access MXBeans
for a running virtual machine whose version is different than
the version on which the application is running,
it should prepare to catch

InvalidObjectException

which is thrown when an MXBean proxy receives a name of an
enum constant which is missing in the enum class loaded in
the client application. If thrown,

InvalidObjectException

will be
wrappped in

UndeclaredThrowableException

.
- MBeanServerInvocationHandler

or its

newProxyInstance

method cannot be used to create
a proxy for a platform MXBean. The proxy object created
by

MBeanServerInvocationHandler

does not handle
the properties of the platform MXBeans described in
the

class specification

.

by calling the

MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer

method and registers each platform MXBean in this platform

MBeanServer

with its

ObjectName

.
This method, in subsequent calls, will simply return the
initially created platform

MBeanServer

.

MXBeans that get created and destroyed dynamically, for example,
memory

pools

and

managers

,
will automatically be registered and deregistered into the platform

MBeanServer

.

If the system property

javax.management.builder.initial

is set, the platform

MBeanServer

creation will be done
by the specified

MBeanServerBuilder

.

It is recommended that this platform MBeanServer also be used
to register other application managed beans
besides the platform MXBeans.
This will allow all MBeans to be published through the same

MBeanServer

and hence allow for easier network publishing
and discovery.
Name conflicts with the platform MXBeans should be avoided.

**Returns:** the platform

MBeanServer

; the platform
MXBeans are registered into the platform

MBeanServer

at the first time this method is called.
**Throws:** SecurityException

newPlatformMXBeanProxy

```java
public static <T> T newPlatformMXBeanProxy​(
MBeanServerConnection
connection,

String
mxbeanName,

Class
<T> mxbeanInterface)
throws
IOException
```

Returns a proxy for a platform MXBean interface of a
given

MXBean name

that forwards its method calls through the given

MBeanServerConnection

.

This method is equivalent to:

Proxy.newProxyInstance

(mxbeanInterface.getClassLoader(),
new Class[] { mxbeanInterface }, handler)

where

handler

is an

InvocationHandler

to which method invocations to the MXBean interface
are dispatched. This

handler

converts an input parameter
from an MXBean data type to its mapped open type before forwarding
to the

MBeanServer

and converts a return value from
an MXBean method call through the

MBeanServer

from an open type to the corresponding return type declared in
the MXBean interface.

If the MXBean is a notification emitter (i.e.,
it implements

NotificationEmitter

),
both the

mxbeanInterface

and

NotificationEmitter

will be implemented by this proxy.

Notes:

- Using an MXBean proxy is a convenience remote access to
a platform MXBean of a running virtual machine. All method
calls to the MXBean proxy are forwarded to an

MBeanServerConnection

where

IOException

may be thrown
when the communication problem occurs with the connector server.
If thrown,

IOException

will be wrappped in

UndeclaredThrowableException

.
An application remotely accessing the platform MXBeans using
proxy should prepare to catch

UndeclaredThrowableException

and
handle its

cause

as if that cause had been thrown by the

MBeanServerConnection

interface.
- When a client application is designed to remotely access MXBeans
for a running virtual machine whose version is different than
the version on which the application is running,
it should prepare to catch

InvalidObjectException

which is thrown when an MXBean proxy receives a name of an
enum constant which is missing in the enum class loaded in
the client application. If thrown,

InvalidObjectException

will be
wrappped in

UndeclaredThrowableException

.
- MBeanServerInvocationHandler

or its

newProxyInstance

method cannot be used to create
a proxy for a platform MXBean. The proxy object created
by

MBeanServerInvocationHandler

does not handle
the properties of the platform MXBeans described in
the

class specification

.

**Type Parameters:** T

- an

mxbeanInterface

type parameter
**Parameters:** connection

- the

MBeanServerConnection

to forward to.
**Parameters:** mxbeanName

- the name of a platform MXBean within

connection

to forward to.

mxbeanName

must be
in the format of

ObjectName

.
**Parameters:** mxbeanInterface

- the MXBean interface to be implemented
by the proxy.
**Returns:** a proxy for a platform MXBean interface of a
given

MXBean name

that forwards its method calls through the given

MBeanServerConnection

, or

null

if not exist.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

- mxbeanName

is not with a valid

format, or
- the named MXBean in the

connection

is
not a MXBean provided by the platform, or
- the named MXBean is not registered in the

MBeanServerConnection
