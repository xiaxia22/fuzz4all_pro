# Class SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

**Source:** `java.sql\java\sql\SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

extends
SQLNonTransientException
```

The subclass of

SQLException

thrown when the SQLState class value is '

0A

'
( the value is 'zero' A).
This indicates that the JDBC driver does not support an optional JDBC feature.
Optional JDBC features can fall into the fallowing categories:

- no support for an optional feature

no support for an optional overloaded method

no support for an optional mode for a method. The mode for a method is
determined based on constants passed as parameter values to a method
