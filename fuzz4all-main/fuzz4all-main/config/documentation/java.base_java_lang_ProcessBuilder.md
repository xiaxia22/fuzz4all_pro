# Class ProcessBuilder

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\ProcessBuilder.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
ProcessBuilder

extends
Object
```

This class is used to create operating system processes.

Each

ProcessBuilder

instance manages a collection
of process attributes. The

start()

method creates a new

Process

instance with those attributes. The

start()

method can be invoked repeatedly from the same instance
to create new subprocesses with identical or related attributes.

The

startPipeline

method can be invoked to create
a pipeline of new processes that send the output of each process
directly to the next process. Each process has the attributes of
its respective ProcessBuilder.

Each process builder manages these process attributes:

- a

command

, a list of strings which signifies the
external program file to be invoked and its arguments, if any.
Which string lists represent a valid operating system command is
system-dependent. For example, it is common for each conceptual
argument to be an element in this list, but there are operating
systems where programs are expected to tokenize command line
strings themselves - on such a system a Java implementation might
require commands to contain exactly two elements.

an

environment

, which is a system-dependent mapping from

variables

to

values

. The initial value is a copy of
the environment of the current process (see

System.getenv()

).

a

working directory

. The default value is the current
working directory of the current process, usually the directory
named by the system property

user.dir

.

a source of

standard input

.
By default, the subprocess reads input from a pipe. Java code
can access this pipe via the output stream returned by

Process.getOutputStream()

. However, standard input may
be redirected to another source using

redirectInput

.
In this case,

Process.getOutputStream()

will return a

null output stream

, for which:

- the

write

methods always
throw

IOException

the

close

method does nothing

a destination for

standard output

and

standard error

. By default, the subprocess writes standard
output and standard error to pipes. Java code can access these pipes
via the input streams returned by

Process.getOutputStream()

and

Process.getErrorStream()

. However, standard output and
standard error may be redirected to other destinations using

redirectOutput

and

redirectError

.
In this case,

Process.getInputStream()

and/or

Process.getErrorStream()

will return a

null input
stream

, for which:

- the

read

methods always return

-1

the

available

method always returns

0

the

close

method does nothing

a

redirectErrorStream

property. Initially, this property
is

false

, meaning that the standard output and error
output of a subprocess are sent to two separate streams, which can
be accessed using the

Process.getInputStream()

and

Process.getErrorStream()

methods.

If the value is set to

true

, then:

- standard error is merged with the standard output and always sent
to the same destination (this makes it easier to correlate error
messages with the corresponding output)

the common destination of standard error and standard output can be
redirected using

redirectOutput

any redirection set by the

redirectError

method is ignored when creating a subprocess

the stream returned from

Process.getErrorStream()

will
always be a

null input stream

Modifying a process builder's attributes will affect processes
subsequently started by that object's

start()

method, but
will never affect previously started processes or the Java process
itself.

Most error checking is performed by the

start()

method.
It is possible to modify the state of an object so that

start()

will fail. For example, setting the command attribute to
an empty list will not throw an exception unless

start()

is invoked.

Note that this class is not synchronized.

If multiple threads access a

ProcessBuilder

instance
concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies one of the
attributes structurally, it

must

be synchronized externally.

Starting a new process which uses the default working directory
and environment is easy:

```java
Process p = new ProcessBuilder("myCommand", "myArg").start();
```

Here is an example that starts a process with a modified working
directory and environment, and redirects standard output and error
to be appended to a log file:

```java
ProcessBuilder pb =
new ProcessBuilder("myCommand", "myArg1", "myArg2");
Map<String, String> env = pb.environment();
env.put("VAR1", "myValue");
env.remove("OTHERVAR");
env.put("VAR2", env.get("VAR1") + "suffix");
pb.directory(new File("myDir"));
File log = new File("log");
pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
pb.redirectOutput(Redirect.appendTo(log));
Process p = pb.start();
assert pb.redirectInput() == Redirect.PIPE;
assert pb.redirectOutput().file() == log;
assert p.getInputStream().read() == -1;
```

To start a process with an explicit set of environment
variables, first call

Map.clear()

before adding environment variables.

Unless otherwise noted, passing a

null

argument to a constructor
or method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be
thrown.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public ProcessBuilder​(
List
<
String
> command)

Constructs a process builder with the specified operating
system program and arguments. This constructor does

not

make a copy of the

command

list. Subsequent
updates to the list will be reflected in the state of the
process builder. It is not checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid operating system
command.

**Parameters:**
- command

- the list containing the program and its arguments

---

#### public ProcessBuilder​(
String
... command)

Constructs a process builder with the specified operating
system program and arguments. This is a convenience
constructor that sets the process builder's command to a string
list containing the same strings as the

command

array, in the same order. It is not checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid operating system
command.

**Parameters:**
- command

- a string array containing the program and its arguments

---

### Method Details

#### public
ProcessBuilder
command​(
List
<
String
> command)

Sets this process builder's operating system program and
arguments. This method does

not

make a copy of the

command

list. Subsequent updates to the list will
be reflected in the state of the process builder. It is not
checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid
operating system command.

**Parameters:**
- command

- the list containing the program and its arguments

**Returns:**
- this process builder

---

#### public
ProcessBuilder
command​(
String
... command)

Sets this process builder's operating system program and
arguments. This is a convenience method that sets the command
to a string list containing the same strings as the

command

array, in the same order. It is not
checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid
operating system command.

**Parameters:**
- command

- a string array containing the program and its arguments

**Returns:**
- this process builder

---

#### public
List
<
String
> command()

Returns this process builder's operating system program and
arguments. The returned list is

not

a copy. Subsequent
updates to the list will be reflected in the state of this
process builder.

**Returns:**
- this process builder's program and its arguments

---

#### public
Map
<
String
,​
String
> environment()

Returns a string map view of this process builder's environment.

Whenever a process builder is created, the environment is
initialized to a copy of the current process environment (see

System.getenv()

). Subprocesses subsequently started by
this object's

start()

method will use this map as
their environment.

The returned object may be modified using ordinary

Map

operations. These modifications will be
visible to subprocesses started via the

start()

method. Two

ProcessBuilder

instances always
contain independent process environments, so changes to the
returned map will never be reflected in any other

ProcessBuilder

instance or the values returned by

System.getenv

.

If the system does not support environment variables, an
empty map is returned.

The returned map does not permit null keys or values.
Attempting to insert or query the presence of a null key or
value will throw a

NullPointerException

.
Attempting to query the presence of a key or value which is not
of type

String

will throw a

ClassCastException

.

The behavior of the returned map is system-dependent. A
system may not allow modifications to environment variables or
may forbid certain variable names or values. For this reason,
attempts to modify the map may fail with

UnsupportedOperationException

or

IllegalArgumentException

if the modification is not permitted by the operating system.

Since the external format of environment variable names and
values is system-dependent, there may not be a one-to-one
mapping between them and Java's Unicode strings. Nevertheless,
the map is implemented in such a way that environment variables
which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified
native representation in the subprocess.

The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
general contract of the

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

and

Object.hashCode()

methods.

The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method
is called with a

RuntimePermission

("getenv.*")

permission.
This may result in a

SecurityException

being thrown.

When passing information to a Java subprocess,

system properties

are generally preferred over environment variables.

**Returns:**
- this process builder's environment

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow access to the process environment

**See Also:**
- Runtime.exec(String[],String[],java.io.File)

,

System.getenv()

---

#### public
File
directory()

Returns this process builder's working directory.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will use this as their working directory.
The returned value may be

null

-- this means to use
the working directory of the current Java process, usually the
directory named by the system property

user.dir

,
as the working directory of the child process.

**Returns:**
- this process builder's working directory

---

#### public
ProcessBuilder
directory​(
File
directory)

Sets this process builder's working directory.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will use this as their working directory.
The argument may be

null

-- this means to use the
working directory of the current Java process, usually the
directory named by the system property

user.dir

,
as the working directory of the child process.

**Parameters:**
- directory

- the new working directory

**Returns:**
- this process builder

---

#### public
ProcessBuilder
redirectInput​(
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
source)

Sets this process builder's standard input source.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method obtain their standard input from this source.

If the source is

Redirect.PIPE

(the initial value), then the standard input of a
subprocess can be written to using the output stream
returned by

Process.getOutputStream()

.
If the source is set to any other value, then

Process.getOutputStream()

will return a

null output stream

.

**Parameters:**
- source

- the new standard input source

**Returns:**
- this process builder

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the redirect does not correspond to a valid source
of data, that is, has type

WRITE

or

APPEND

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public
ProcessBuilder
redirectOutput​(
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
destination)

Sets this process builder's standard output destination.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method send their standard output to this destination.

If the destination is

Redirect.PIPE

(the initial value), then the standard output of a subprocess
can be read using the input stream returned by

Process.getInputStream()

.
If the destination is set to any other value, then

Process.getInputStream()

will return a

null input stream

.

**Parameters:**
- destination

- the new standard output destination

**Returns:**
- this process builder

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the redirect does not correspond to a valid
destination of data, that is, has type

READ

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public
ProcessBuilder
redirectError​(
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
destination)

Sets this process builder's standard error destination.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method send their standard error to this destination.

If the destination is

Redirect.PIPE

(the initial value), then the error output of a subprocess
can be read using the input stream returned by

Process.getErrorStream()

.
If the destination is set to any other value, then

Process.getErrorStream()

will return a

null input stream

.

If the

redirectErrorStream

attribute has been set

true

, then the redirection set
by this method has no effect.

**Parameters:**
- destination

- the new standard error destination

**Returns:**
- this process builder

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the redirect does not correspond to a valid
destination of data, that is, has type

READ

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public
ProcessBuilder
redirectInput​(
File
file)

#### public
ProcessBuilder
inheritIO()

Sets the source and destination for subprocess standard I/O
to be the same as those of the current Java process.

This is a convenience method. An invocation of the form

```java
pb.inheritIO()
```

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
pb.redirectInput(Redirect.INHERIT)
.redirectOutput(Redirect.INHERIT)
.redirectError(Redirect.INHERIT)
```

This gives behavior equivalent to most operating system
command interpreters, or the standard C library function

system()

.

**Returns:**
- this process builder

**Since:**
- 1.7

---

#### public boolean redirectErrorStream()

Tells whether this process builder merges standard error and
standard output.

If this property is

true

, then any error output
generated by subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will be merged with the standard
output, so that both can be read using the

Process.getInputStream()

method. This makes it easier
to correlate error messages with the corresponding output.
The initial value is

false

.

**Returns:**
- this process builder's

redirectErrorStream

property

---

#### public
ProcessBuilder
redirectErrorStream​(boolean redirectErrorStream)

Sets this process builder's

redirectErrorStream

property.

If this property is

true

, then any error output
generated by subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will be merged with the standard
output, so that both can be read using the

Process.getInputStream()

method. This makes it easier
to correlate error messages with the corresponding output.
The initial value is

false

.

**Parameters:**
- redirectErrorStream

- the new property value

**Returns:**
- this process builder

---

#### public
Process
start()
throws
IOException

Starts a new process using the attributes of this process builder.

The new process will
invoke the command and arguments given by

command()

,
in a working directory as given by

directory()

,
with a process environment as given by

environment()

.

This method checks that the command is a valid operating
system command. Which commands are valid is system-dependent,
but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of
non-null strings.

A minimal set of system dependent environment variables may
be required to start a process on some operating systems.
As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable
settings beyond those in the process builder's

environment()

.

If there is a security manager, its

checkExec

method is called with the first component of this object's

command

array as its argument. This may result in
a

SecurityException

being thrown.

Starting an operating system process is highly system-dependent.
Among the many things that can go wrong are:

- The operating system program file was not found.

Access to the program file was denied.

The working directory does not exist.

Invalid character in command argument, such as NUL.

In such cases an exception will be thrown. The exact nature
of the exception is system-dependent, but it will always be a
subclass of

IOException

.

If the operating system does not support the creation of
processes, an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

Subsequent modifications to this process builder will not
affect the returned

Process

.

**Returns:**
- a new

Process

object for managing the subprocess

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if an element of the command list is null
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the command is an empty list (has size

0

)
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and

- its

checkExec

method doesn't allow creation of the subprocess, or

the standard input to the subprocess was

redirected from a file

and the security manager's

checkRead

method
denies read access to the file, or

the standard output or standard error of the
subprocess was

redirected to a file

and the security manager's

checkWrite

method
denies write access to the file
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If the operating system does not support the creation of processes.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs

#### public static
List
<
Process
> startPipeline​(
List
<
ProcessBuilder
> builders)
throws
IOException

Starts a Process for each ProcessBuilder, creating a pipeline of
processes linked by their standard output and standard input streams.
The attributes of each ProcessBuilder are used to start the respective
process except that as each process is started, its standard output
is directed to the standard input of the next. The redirects for standard
input of the first process and standard output of the last process are
initialized using the redirect settings of the respective ProcessBuilder.
All other

ProcessBuilder

redirects should be

Redirect.PIPE

.

All input and output streams between the intermediate processes are
not accessible.
The

standard input

of all processes
except the first process are

null output streams

The

standard output

of all processes
except the last process are

null input streams

.

The

redirectErrorStream()

of each ProcessBuilder applies to the
respective process. If set to

true

, the error stream is written
to the same stream as standard output.

If starting any of the processes throws an Exception, all processes
are forcibly destroyed.

The

startPipeline

method performs the same checks on
each ProcessBuilder as does the

start()

method. The new process
will invoke the command and arguments given by

command()

,
in a working directory as given by

directory()

,
with a process environment as given by

environment()

.

This method checks that the command is a valid operating
system command. Which commands are valid is system-dependent,
but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of
non-null strings.

A minimal set of system dependent environment variables may
be required to start a process on some operating systems.
As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable
settings beyond those in the process builder's

environment()

.

If there is a security manager, its

checkExec

method is called with the first component of this object's

command

array as its argument. This may result in
a

SecurityException

being thrown.

Starting an operating system process is highly system-dependent.
Among the many things that can go wrong are:

- The operating system program file was not found.

Access to the program file was denied.

The working directory does not exist.

In such cases an exception will be thrown. The exact nature
of the exception is system-dependent, but it will always be a
subclass of

IOException

.

If the operating system does not support the creation of
processes, an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

Subsequent modifications to this process builder will not
affect the returned

Process

.

**Parameters:**
- builders

- a List of ProcessBuilders

**Returns:**
- a

List<Process>

es started from the corresponding
ProcessBuilder

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- any of the redirects except the
standard input of the first builder and the standard output of
the last builder are not

- if the command is an empty list (has size

0

)
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and

- its

redirected from a file

and the security manager's

checkRead

method
denies read access to the file, or

the standard output or standard error of the
subprocess was

redirected to a file

### Additional Sections

#### Class ProcessBuilder

java.lang.Object

- java.lang.ProcessBuilder

java.lang.ProcessBuilder

```java
public final class
ProcessBuilder

extends
Object
```

This class is used to create operating system processes.

Each

ProcessBuilder

instance manages a collection
of process attributes. The

start()

method creates a new

Process

instance with those attributes. The

start()

method can be invoked repeatedly from the same instance
to create new subprocesses with identical or related attributes.

The

startPipeline

method can be invoked to create
a pipeline of new processes that send the output of each process
directly to the next process. Each process has the attributes of
its respective ProcessBuilder.

Each process builder manages these process attributes:

- a

command

, a list of strings which signifies the
external program file to be invoked and its arguments, if any.
Which string lists represent a valid operating system command is
system-dependent. For example, it is common for each conceptual
argument to be an element in this list, but there are operating
systems where programs are expected to tokenize command line
strings themselves - on such a system a Java implementation might
require commands to contain exactly two elements.

an

environment

, which is a system-dependent mapping from

variables

to

values

. The initial value is a copy of
the environment of the current process (see

System.getenv()

).

a

working directory

. The default value is the current
working directory of the current process, usually the directory
named by the system property

user.dir

.

a source of

standard input

.
By default, the subprocess reads input from a pipe. Java code
can access this pipe via the output stream returned by

Process.getOutputStream()

. However, standard input may
be redirected to another source using

redirectInput

.
In this case,

Process.getOutputStream()

will return a

null output stream

, for which:

- the

write

methods always
throw

IOException

the

close

method does nothing

a destination for

standard output

and

standard error

. By default, the subprocess writes standard
output and standard error to pipes. Java code can access these pipes
via the input streams returned by

Process.getOutputStream()

and

Process.getErrorStream()

. However, standard output and
standard error may be redirected to other destinations using

redirectOutput

and

redirectError

.
In this case,

Process.getInputStream()

and/or

Process.getErrorStream()

will return a

null input
stream

, for which:

- the

read

methods always return

-1

the

available

method always returns

0

the

close

method does nothing

a

redirectErrorStream

property. Initially, this property
is

false

, meaning that the standard output and error
output of a subprocess are sent to two separate streams, which can
be accessed using the

Process.getInputStream()

and

Process.getErrorStream()

methods.

If the value is set to

true

, then:

- standard error is merged with the standard output and always sent
to the same destination (this makes it easier to correlate error
messages with the corresponding output)

the common destination of standard error and standard output can be
redirected using

redirectOutput

any redirection set by the

redirectError

method is ignored when creating a subprocess

the stream returned from

Process.getErrorStream()

will
always be a

null input stream

Modifying a process builder's attributes will affect processes
subsequently started by that object's

start()

method, but
will never affect previously started processes or the Java process
itself.

Most error checking is performed by the

start()

method.
It is possible to modify the state of an object so that

start()

will fail. For example, setting the command attribute to
an empty list will not throw an exception unless

start()

is invoked.

Note that this class is not synchronized.

If multiple threads access a

ProcessBuilder

instance
concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies one of the
attributes structurally, it

must

be synchronized externally.

Starting a new process which uses the default working directory
and environment is easy:

```java
Process p = new ProcessBuilder("myCommand", "myArg").start();
```

Here is an example that starts a process with a modified working
directory and environment, and redirects standard output and error
to be appended to a log file:

```java
ProcessBuilder pb =
new ProcessBuilder("myCommand", "myArg1", "myArg2");
Map<String, String> env = pb.environment();
env.put("VAR1", "myValue");
env.remove("OTHERVAR");
env.put("VAR2", env.get("VAR1") + "suffix");
pb.directory(new File("myDir"));
File log = new File("log");
pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
pb.redirectOutput(Redirect.appendTo(log));
Process p = pb.start();
assert pb.redirectInput() == Redirect.PIPE;
assert pb.redirectOutput().file() == log;
assert p.getInputStream().read() == -1;
```

To start a process with an explicit set of environment
variables, first call

Map.clear()

before adding environment variables.

Unless otherwise noted, passing a

null

argument to a constructor
or method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be
thrown.

a pipeline of new processes that send the output of each process
directly to the next process. Each process has the attributes of
its respective ProcessBuilder.

Each process builder manages these process attributes:

- a

command

, a list of strings which signifies the
external program file to be invoked and its arguments, if any.
Which string lists represent a valid operating system command is
system-dependent. For example, it is common for each conceptual
argument to be an element in this list, but there are operating
systems where programs are expected to tokenize command line
strings themselves - on such a system a Java implementation might
require commands to contain exactly two elements.

an

environment

, which is a system-dependent mapping from

variables

to

values

. The initial value is a copy of
the environment of the current process (see

System.getenv()

).

a

working directory

. The default value is the current
working directory of the current process, usually the directory
named by the system property

user.dir

.

a source of

standard input

.
By default, the subprocess reads input from a pipe. Java code
can access this pipe via the output stream returned by

Process.getOutputStream()

. However, standard input may
be redirected to another source using

redirectInput

.
In this case,

Process.getOutputStream()

will return a

null output stream

, for which:

- the

write

methods always
throw

IOException

the

close

method does nothing

a destination for

standard output

and

standard error

. By default, the subprocess writes standard
output and standard error to pipes. Java code can access these pipes
via the input streams returned by

Process.getOutputStream()

and

Process.getErrorStream()

. However, standard output and
standard error may be redirected to other destinations using

redirectOutput

and

redirectError

.
In this case,

Process.getInputStream()

and/or

Process.getErrorStream()

will return a

null input
stream

, for which:

- the

read

methods always return

-1

the

available

method always returns

0

the

close

method does nothing

a

redirectErrorStream

property. Initially, this property
is

false

, meaning that the standard output and error
output of a subprocess are sent to two separate streams, which can
be accessed using the

Process.getInputStream()

and

Process.getErrorStream()

methods.

If the value is set to

true

, then:

- standard error is merged with the standard output and always sent
to the same destination (this makes it easier to correlate error
messages with the corresponding output)

the common destination of standard error and standard output can be
redirected using

redirectOutput

any redirection set by the

redirectError

method is ignored when creating a subprocess

the stream returned from

Process.getErrorStream()

will
always be a

null input stream

Modifying a process builder's attributes will affect processes
subsequently started by that object's

start()

method, but
will never affect previously started processes or the Java process
itself.

Most error checking is performed by the

start()

method.
It is possible to modify the state of an object so that

start()

will fail. For example, setting the command attribute to
an empty list will not throw an exception unless

start()

is invoked.

Note that this class is not synchronized.

If multiple threads access a

ProcessBuilder

instance
concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies one of the
attributes structurally, it

must

be synchronized externally.

Starting a new process which uses the default working directory
and environment is easy:

```java
Process p = new ProcessBuilder("myCommand", "myArg").start();
```

Here is an example that starts a process with a modified working
directory and environment, and redirects standard output and error
to be appended to a log file:

```java
ProcessBuilder pb =
new ProcessBuilder("myCommand", "myArg1", "myArg2");
Map<String, String> env = pb.environment();
env.put("VAR1", "myValue");
env.remove("OTHERVAR");
env.put("VAR2", env.get("VAR1") + "suffix");
pb.directory(new File("myDir"));
File log = new File("log");
pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
pb.redirectOutput(Redirect.appendTo(log));
Process p = pb.start();
assert pb.redirectInput() == Redirect.PIPE;
assert pb.redirectOutput().file() == log;
assert p.getInputStream().read() == -1;
```

To start a process with an explicit set of environment
variables, first call

Map.clear()

before adding environment variables.

Unless otherwise noted, passing a

null

argument to a constructor
or method in this class will cause a

NullPointerException

to be
thrown.

Each

ProcessBuilder

instance manages a collection
of process attributes. The

start()

method creates a new

Process

instance with those attributes. The

start()

method can be invoked repeatedly from the same instance
to create new subprocesses with identical or related attributes.

a pipeline of new processes that send the output of each process
directly to the next process. Each process has the attributes of

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- ProcessBuilder

```java
public ProcessBuilder​(
List
<
String
> command)
```

Constructs a process builder with the specified operating
system program and arguments. This constructor does

not

make a copy of the

command

list. Subsequent
updates to the list will be reflected in the state of the
process builder. It is not checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid operating system
command.

**Parameters:** command

- the list containing the program and its arguments

- ProcessBuilder

```java
public ProcessBuilder​(
String
... command)
```

Constructs a process builder with the specified operating
system program and arguments. This is a convenience
constructor that sets the process builder's command to a string
list containing the same strings as the

command

array, in the same order. It is not checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid operating system
command.

**Parameters:** command

- a string array containing the program and its arguments

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- command

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
command​(
List
<
String
> command)
```

Sets this process builder's operating system program and
arguments. This method does

not

make a copy of the

command

list. Subsequent updates to the list will
be reflected in the state of the process builder. It is not
checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid
operating system command.

**Parameters:** command

- the list containing the program and its arguments
**Returns:** this process builder

- command

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
command​(
String
... command)
```

Sets this process builder's operating system program and
arguments. This is a convenience method that sets the command
to a string list containing the same strings as the

command

array, in the same order. It is not
checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid
operating system command.

**Parameters:** command

- a string array containing the program and its arguments
**Returns:** this process builder

- command

```java
public
List
<
String
> command()
```

Returns this process builder's operating system program and
arguments. The returned list is

not

a copy. Subsequent
updates to the list will be reflected in the state of this
process builder.

**Returns:** this process builder's program and its arguments

- environment

```java
public
Map
<
String
,​
String
> environment()
```

Returns a string map view of this process builder's environment.

Whenever a process builder is created, the environment is
initialized to a copy of the current process environment (see

System.getenv()

). Subprocesses subsequently started by
this object's

start()

method will use this map as
their environment.

The returned object may be modified using ordinary

Map

operations. These modifications will be
visible to subprocesses started via the

start()

method. Two

ProcessBuilder

instances always
contain independent process environments, so changes to the
returned map will never be reflected in any other

ProcessBuilder

instance or the values returned by

System.getenv

.

If the system does not support environment variables, an
empty map is returned.

The returned map does not permit null keys or values.
Attempting to insert or query the presence of a null key or
value will throw a

NullPointerException

.
Attempting to query the presence of a key or value which is not
of type

String

will throw a

ClassCastException

.

The behavior of the returned map is system-dependent. A
system may not allow modifications to environment variables or
may forbid certain variable names or values. For this reason,
attempts to modify the map may fail with

UnsupportedOperationException

or

IllegalArgumentException

if the modification is not permitted by the operating system.

Since the external format of environment variable names and
values is system-dependent, there may not be a one-to-one
mapping between them and Java's Unicode strings. Nevertheless,
the map is implemented in such a way that environment variables
which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified
native representation in the subprocess.

The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
general contract of the

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

and

Object.hashCode()

methods.

The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method
is called with a

RuntimePermission

("getenv.*")

permission.
This may result in a

SecurityException

being thrown.

When passing information to a Java subprocess,

system properties

are generally preferred over environment variables.

**Returns:** this process builder's environment
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow access to the process environment
**See Also:** Runtime.exec(String[],String[],java.io.File)

,

System.getenv()

- directory

```java
public
File
directory()
```

Returns this process builder's working directory.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will use this as their working directory.
The returned value may be

null

-- this means to use
the working directory of the current Java process, usually the
directory named by the system property

user.dir

,
as the working directory of the child process.

**Returns:** this process builder's working directory

- directory

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
directory​(
File
directory)
```

Sets this process builder's working directory.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will use this as their working directory.
The argument may be

null

-- this means to use the
working directory of the current Java process, usually the
directory named by the system property

user.dir

,
as the working directory of the child process.

**Parameters:** directory

- the new working directory
**Returns:** this process builder

- redirectInput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectInput​(
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
source)
```

Sets this process builder's standard input source.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method obtain their standard input from this source.

If the source is

Redirect.PIPE

(the initial value), then the standard input of a
subprocess can be written to using the output stream
returned by

Process.getOutputStream()

.
If the source is set to any other value, then

Process.getOutputStream()

will return a

null output stream

.

**Parameters:** source

- the new standard input source
**Returns:** this process builder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the redirect does not correspond to a valid source
of data, that is, has type

WRITE

or

APPEND
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectOutput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectOutput​(
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
destination)
```

Sets this process builder's standard output destination.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method send their standard output to this destination.

If the destination is

Redirect.PIPE

(the initial value), then the standard output of a subprocess
can be read using the input stream returned by

Process.getInputStream()

.
If the destination is set to any other value, then

Process.getInputStream()

will return a

null input stream

.

**Parameters:** destination

- the new standard output destination
**Returns:** this process builder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the redirect does not correspond to a valid
destination of data, that is, has type

READ
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectError

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectError​(
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
destination)
```

Sets this process builder's standard error destination.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method send their standard error to this destination.

If the destination is

Redirect.PIPE

(the initial value), then the error output of a subprocess
can be read using the input stream returned by

Process.getErrorStream()

.
If the destination is set to any other value, then

Process.getErrorStream()

will return a

null input stream

.

If the

redirectErrorStream

attribute has been set

true

, then the redirection set
by this method has no effect.

**Parameters:** destination

- the new standard error destination
**Returns:** this process builder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the redirect does not correspond to a valid
destination of data, that is, has type

READ
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectInput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectInput​(
File
file)
```

Sets this process builder's standard input source to a file.

This is a convenience method. An invocation of the form

redirectInput(file)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

redirectInput

(Redirect.from(file))

.

**Parameters:** file

- the new standard input source
**Returns:** this process builder
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectOutput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectOutput​(
File
file)
```

Sets this process builder's standard output destination to a file.

This is a convenience method. An invocation of the form

redirectOutput(file)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

redirectOutput

(Redirect.to(file))

.

**Parameters:** file

- the new standard output destination
**Returns:** this process builder
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectError

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectError​(
File
file)
```

Sets this process builder's standard error destination to a file.

This is a convenience method. An invocation of the form

redirectError(file)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

redirectError

(Redirect.to(file))

.

**Parameters:** file

- the new standard error destination
**Returns:** this process builder
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectInput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
redirectInput()
```

Returns this process builder's standard input source.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method obtain their standard input from this source.
The initial value is

Redirect.PIPE

.

**Returns:** this process builder's standard input source
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectOutput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
redirectOutput()
```

Returns this process builder's standard output destination.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method redirect their standard output to this destination.
The initial value is

Redirect.PIPE

.

**Returns:** this process builder's standard output destination
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectError

```java
public
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
redirectError()
```

Returns this process builder's standard error destination.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method redirect their standard error to this destination.
The initial value is

Redirect.PIPE

.

**Returns:** this process builder's standard error destination
**Since:** 1.7

- inheritIO

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
inheritIO()
```

Sets the source and destination for subprocess standard I/O
to be the same as those of the current Java process.

This is a convenience method. An invocation of the form

```java
pb.inheritIO()
```

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
pb.redirectInput(Redirect.INHERIT)
.redirectOutput(Redirect.INHERIT)
.redirectError(Redirect.INHERIT)
```

This gives behavior equivalent to most operating system
command interpreters, or the standard C library function

system()

.

**Returns:** this process builder
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectErrorStream

```java
public boolean redirectErrorStream()
```

Tells whether this process builder merges standard error and
standard output.

If this property is

true

, then any error output
generated by subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will be merged with the standard
output, so that both can be read using the

Process.getInputStream()

method. This makes it easier
to correlate error messages with the corresponding output.
The initial value is

false

.

**Returns:** this process builder's

redirectErrorStream

property

- redirectErrorStream

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectErrorStream​(boolean redirectErrorStream)
```

Sets this process builder's

redirectErrorStream

property.

If this property is

true

, then any error output
generated by subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will be merged with the standard
output, so that both can be read using the

Process.getInputStream()

method. This makes it easier
to correlate error messages with the corresponding output.
The initial value is

false

.

**Parameters:** redirectErrorStream

- the new property value
**Returns:** this process builder

- start

```java
public
Process
start()
throws
IOException
```

Starts a new process using the attributes of this process builder.

The new process will
invoke the command and arguments given by

command()

,
in a working directory as given by

directory()

,
with a process environment as given by

environment()

.

This method checks that the command is a valid operating
system command. Which commands are valid is system-dependent,
but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of
non-null strings.

A minimal set of system dependent environment variables may
be required to start a process on some operating systems.
As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable
settings beyond those in the process builder's

environment()

.

If there is a security manager, its

checkExec

method is called with the first component of this object's

command

array as its argument. This may result in
a

SecurityException

being thrown.

Starting an operating system process is highly system-dependent.
Among the many things that can go wrong are:

- The operating system program file was not found.

Access to the program file was denied.

The working directory does not exist.

Invalid character in command argument, such as NUL.

In such cases an exception will be thrown. The exact nature
of the exception is system-dependent, but it will always be a
subclass of

IOException

.

If the operating system does not support the creation of
processes, an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

Subsequent modifications to this process builder will not
affect the returned

Process

.

**Returns:** a new

Process

object for managing the subprocess
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if an element of the command list is null
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the command is an empty list (has size

0

)
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and

- its

checkExec

method doesn't allow creation of the subprocess, or

the standard input to the subprocess was

redirected from a file

and the security manager's

checkRead

method
denies read access to the file, or

the standard output or standard error of the
subprocess was

redirected to a file

and the security manager's

checkWrite

method
denies write access to the file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the operating system does not support the creation of processes.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**See Also:** Runtime.exec(String[], String[], java.io.File)

- startPipeline

```java
public static
List
<
Process
> startPipeline​(
List
<
ProcessBuilder
> builders)
throws
IOException
```

Starts a Process for each ProcessBuilder, creating a pipeline of
processes linked by their standard output and standard input streams.
The attributes of each ProcessBuilder are used to start the respective
process except that as each process is started, its standard output
is directed to the standard input of the next. The redirects for standard
input of the first process and standard output of the last process are
initialized using the redirect settings of the respective ProcessBuilder.
All other

ProcessBuilder

redirects should be

Redirect.PIPE

.

All input and output streams between the intermediate processes are
not accessible.
The

standard input

of all processes
except the first process are

null output streams

The

standard output

of all processes
except the last process are

null input streams

.

The

redirectErrorStream()

of each ProcessBuilder applies to the
respective process. If set to

true

, the error stream is written
to the same stream as standard output.

If starting any of the processes throws an Exception, all processes
are forcibly destroyed.

The

startPipeline

method performs the same checks on
each ProcessBuilder as does the

start()

method. The new process
will invoke the command and arguments given by

command()

,
in a working directory as given by

directory()

,
with a process environment as given by

environment()

.

This method checks that the command is a valid operating
system command. Which commands are valid is system-dependent,
but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of
non-null strings.

A minimal set of system dependent environment variables may
be required to start a process on some operating systems.
As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable
settings beyond those in the process builder's

environment()

.

If there is a security manager, its

checkExec

method is called with the first component of this object's

command

array as its argument. This may result in
a

SecurityException

being thrown.

Starting an operating system process is highly system-dependent.
Among the many things that can go wrong are:

- The operating system program file was not found.

Access to the program file was denied.

The working directory does not exist.

Invalid character in command argument, such as NUL.

In such cases an exception will be thrown. The exact nature
of the exception is system-dependent, but it will always be a
subclass of

IOException

.

If the operating system does not support the creation of
processes, an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

Subsequent modifications to this process builder will not
affect the returned

Process

.

**API Note:** For example to count the unique imports for all the files in a file hierarchy
on a Unix compatible platform:

```java
String directory = "/home/duke/src";
ProcessBuilder[] builders = {
new ProcessBuilder("find", directory, "-type", "f"),
new ProcessBuilder("xargs", "grep", "-h", "^import "),
new ProcessBuilder("awk", "{print $2;}"),
new ProcessBuilder("sort", "-u")};
List<Process> processes = ProcessBuilder.startPipeline(
Arrays.asList(builders));
Process last = processes.get(processes.size()-1);
try (InputStream is = last.getInputStream();
Reader isr = new InputStreamReader(is);
BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(isr)) {
long count = r.lines().count();
}
```
**Parameters:** builders

- a List of ProcessBuilders
**Returns:** a

List<Process>

es started from the corresponding
ProcessBuilder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- any of the redirects except the
standard input of the first builder and the standard output of
the last builder are not

ProcessBuilder.Redirect.PIPE

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if an element of the command list is null or
if an element of the ProcessBuilder list is null or
the builders argument is null
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the command is an empty list (has size

0

)
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and

- its

#### ProcessBuilder

public ProcessBuilder​(

String

... command)

Constructs a process builder with the specified operating
system program and arguments. This is a convenience
constructor that sets the process builder's command to a string
list containing the same strings as the

command

array, in the same order. It is not checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid operating system
command.

Method Detail

- command

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
command​(
List
<
String
> command)
```

Sets this process builder's operating system program and
arguments. This method does

not

make a copy of the

command

list. Subsequent updates to the list will
be reflected in the state of the process builder. It is not
checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid
operating system command.

**Parameters:** command

- the list containing the program and its arguments
**Returns:** this process builder

- command

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
command​(
String
... command)
```

Sets this process builder's operating system program and
arguments. This is a convenience method that sets the command
to a string list containing the same strings as the

command

array, in the same order. It is not
checked whether

command

corresponds to a valid
operating system command.

**Parameters:** command

- a string array containing the program and its arguments
**Returns:** this process builder

- command

```java
public
List
<
String
> command()
```

Returns this process builder's operating system program and
arguments. The returned list is

not

a copy. Subsequent
updates to the list will be reflected in the state of this
process builder.

**Returns:** this process builder's program and its arguments

- environment

```java
public
Map
<
String
,​
String
> environment()
```

Returns a string map view of this process builder's environment.

Whenever a process builder is created, the environment is
initialized to a copy of the current process environment (see

System.getenv()

). Subprocesses subsequently started by
this object's

start()

method will use this map as
their environment.

The returned object may be modified using ordinary

Map

operations. These modifications will be
visible to subprocesses started via the

start()

method. Two

ProcessBuilder

instances always
contain independent process environments, so changes to the
returned map will never be reflected in any other

ProcessBuilder

instance or the values returned by

System.getenv

.

If the system does not support environment variables, an
empty map is returned.

The returned map does not permit null keys or values.
Attempting to insert or query the presence of a null key or
value will throw a

NullPointerException

.
Attempting to query the presence of a key or value which is not
of type

String

will throw a

ClassCastException

.

The behavior of the returned map is system-dependent. A
system may not allow modifications to environment variables or
may forbid certain variable names or values. For this reason,
attempts to modify the map may fail with

UnsupportedOperationException

or

IllegalArgumentException

if the modification is not permitted by the operating system.

Since the external format of environment variable names and
values is system-dependent, there may not be a one-to-one
mapping between them and Java's Unicode strings. Nevertheless,
the map is implemented in such a way that environment variables
which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified
native representation in the subprocess.

The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
general contract of the

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

and

Object.hashCode()

methods.

The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method
is called with a

RuntimePermission

("getenv.*")

permission.
This may result in a

SecurityException

being thrown.

When passing information to a Java subprocess,

system properties

are generally preferred over environment variables.

**Returns:** this process builder's environment
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method doesn't allow access to the process environment
**See Also:** Runtime.exec(String[],String[],java.io.File)

,

System.getenv()

- directory

```java
public
File
directory()
```

Returns this process builder's working directory.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will use this as their working directory.
The returned value may be

null

-- this means to use
the working directory of the current Java process, usually the
directory named by the system property

user.dir

,
as the working directory of the child process.

**Returns:** this process builder's working directory

- directory

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
directory​(
File
directory)
```

Sets this process builder's working directory.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will use this as their working directory.
The argument may be

null

-- this means to use the
working directory of the current Java process, usually the
directory named by the system property

user.dir

,
as the working directory of the child process.

**Parameters:** directory

- the new working directory
**Returns:** this process builder

- redirectInput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectInput​(
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
source)
```

Sets this process builder's standard input source.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method obtain their standard input from this source.

If the source is

Redirect.PIPE

(the initial value), then the standard input of a
subprocess can be written to using the output stream
returned by

Process.getOutputStream()

.
If the source is set to any other value, then

Process.getOutputStream()

will return a

null output stream

.

**Parameters:** source

- the new standard input source
**Returns:** this process builder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the redirect does not correspond to a valid source
of data, that is, has type

WRITE

or

APPEND
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectOutput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectOutput​(
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
destination)
```

Sets this process builder's standard output destination.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method send their standard output to this destination.

If the destination is

Redirect.PIPE

(the initial value), then the standard output of a subprocess
can be read using the input stream returned by

Process.getInputStream()

.
If the destination is set to any other value, then

Process.getInputStream()

will return a

null input stream

.

**Parameters:** destination

- the new standard output destination
**Returns:** this process builder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the redirect does not correspond to a valid
destination of data, that is, has type

READ
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectError

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectError​(
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
destination)
```

Sets this process builder's standard error destination.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method send their standard error to this destination.

If the destination is

Redirect.PIPE

(the initial value), then the error output of a subprocess
can be read using the input stream returned by

Process.getErrorStream()

.
If the destination is set to any other value, then

Process.getErrorStream()

will return a

null input stream

.

If the

redirectErrorStream

attribute has been set

true

, then the redirection set
by this method has no effect.

**Parameters:** destination

- the new standard error destination
**Returns:** this process builder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the redirect does not correspond to a valid
destination of data, that is, has type

READ
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectInput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectInput​(
File
file)
```

Sets this process builder's standard input source to a file.

This is a convenience method. An invocation of the form

redirectInput(file)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

redirectInput

(Redirect.from(file))

.

**Parameters:** file

- the new standard input source
**Returns:** this process builder
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectOutput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectOutput​(
File
file)

**Since:** 1.7

- redirectError

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectError​(
File
file)
```

Sets this process builder's standard error destination to a file.

This is a convenience method. An invocation of the form

redirectError(file)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

redirectError

(Redirect.to(file))

.

**Parameters:** file

- the new standard error destination
**Returns:** this process builder
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectInput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
redirectInput()
```

Returns this process builder's standard input source.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method obtain their standard input from this source.
The initial value is

Redirect.PIPE

.

**Returns:** this process builder's standard input source
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectOutput

```java
public
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
redirectOutput()
```

Returns this process builder's standard output destination.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method redirect their standard output to this destination.
The initial value is

Redirect.PIPE

.

**Returns:** this process builder's standard output destination
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectError

```java
public
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
redirectError()
```

Returns this process builder's standard error destination.

Subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method redirect their standard error to this destination.
The initial value is

Redirect.PIPE

.

**Returns:** this process builder's standard error destination
**Since:** 1.7

- inheritIO

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
inheritIO()
```

Sets the source and destination for subprocess standard I/O
to be the same as those of the current Java process.

This is a convenience method. An invocation of the form

```java
pb.inheritIO()
```

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

```java
pb.redirectInput(Redirect.INHERIT)
.redirectOutput(Redirect.INHERIT)
.redirectError(Redirect.INHERIT)
```

This gives behavior equivalent to most operating system
command interpreters, or the standard C library function

system()

.

**Returns:** this process builder
**Since:** 1.7

- redirectErrorStream

```java
public boolean redirectErrorStream()
```

Tells whether this process builder merges standard error and
standard output.

If this property is

true

, then any error output
generated by subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will be merged with the standard
output, so that both can be read using the

Process.getInputStream()

method. This makes it easier
to correlate error messages with the corresponding output.
The initial value is

false

.

**Returns:** this process builder's

redirectErrorStream

property

- redirectErrorStream

```java
public
ProcessBuilder
redirectErrorStream​(boolean redirectErrorStream)
```

Sets this process builder's

redirectErrorStream

property.

If this property is

true

, then any error output
generated by subprocesses subsequently started by this object's

start()

method will be merged with the standard
output, so that both can be read using the

Process.getInputStream()

method. This makes it easier
to correlate error messages with the corresponding output.
The initial value is

false

.

**Parameters:** redirectErrorStream

- the new property value
**Returns:** this process builder

- start

```java
public
Process
start()
throws
IOException
```

Starts a new process using the attributes of this process builder.

The new process will
invoke the command and arguments given by

command()

,
in a working directory as given by

directory()

,
with a process environment as given by

environment()

.

This method checks that the command is a valid operating
system command. Which commands are valid is system-dependent,
but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of
non-null strings.

A minimal set of system dependent environment variables may
be required to start a process on some operating systems.
As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable
settings beyond those in the process builder's

environment()

.

If there is a security manager, its

checkExec

method is called with the first component of this object's

command

array as its argument. This may result in
a

SecurityException

being thrown.

Starting an operating system process is highly system-dependent.
Among the many things that can go wrong are:

- The operating system program file was not found.

Access to the program file was denied.

The working directory does not exist.

Invalid character in command argument, such as NUL.

In such cases an exception will be thrown. The exact nature
of the exception is system-dependent, but it will always be a
subclass of

IOException

.

If the operating system does not support the creation of
processes, an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

Subsequent modifications to this process builder will not
affect the returned

Process

.

**Returns:** a new

Process

object for managing the subprocess
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if an element of the command list is null
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the command is an empty list (has size

0

)
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and

- its

checkExec

method doesn't allow creation of the subprocess, or

the standard input to the subprocess was

redirected from a file

and the security manager's

checkRead

method
denies read access to the file, or

the standard output or standard error of the
subprocess was

redirected to a file

and the security manager's

checkWrite

method
denies write access to the file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the operating system does not support the creation of processes.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
**See Also:** Runtime.exec(String[], String[], java.io.File)

- startPipeline

```java
public static
List
<
Process
> startPipeline​(
List
<
ProcessBuilder
> builders)
throws
IOException
```

Starts a Process for each ProcessBuilder, creating a pipeline of
processes linked by their standard output and standard input streams.
The attributes of each ProcessBuilder are used to start the respective
process except that as each process is started, its standard output
is directed to the standard input of the next. The redirects for standard
input of the first process and standard output of the last process are
initialized using the redirect settings of the respective ProcessBuilder.
All other

ProcessBuilder

redirects should be

Redirect.PIPE

.

All input and output streams between the intermediate processes are
not accessible.
The

standard input

of all processes
except the first process are

null output streams

The

standard output

of all processes
except the last process are

null input streams

.

The

redirectErrorStream()

of each ProcessBuilder applies to the
respective process. If set to

true

, the error stream is written
to the same stream as standard output.

If starting any of the processes throws an Exception, all processes
are forcibly destroyed.

The

startPipeline

method performs the same checks on
each ProcessBuilder as does the

start()

method. The new process
will invoke the command and arguments given by

command()

,
in a working directory as given by

directory()

,
with a process environment as given by

environment()

.

This method checks that the command is a valid operating
system command. Which commands are valid is system-dependent,
but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of
non-null strings.

A minimal set of system dependent environment variables may
be required to start a process on some operating systems.
As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable
settings beyond those in the process builder's

environment()

.

If there is a security manager, its

checkExec

method is called with the first component of this object's

command

array as its argument. This may result in
a

If the operating system does not support the creation of
processes, an

will be thrown.

Subsequent modifications to this process builder will not
affect the returned

Process

.

long count = r.lines().count();
}
```
**Parameters:** builders

- a List of ProcessBuilders
**Returns:** a

List<Process>

es started from the corresponding
ProcessBuilder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

the map is implemented in such a way that environment variables
which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified
native representation in the subprocess.

The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
general contract of the

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)

and

Object.hashCode()

methods.

The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.

If a security manager exists, its

checkPermission

method
is called with a

RuntimePermission

permission.
This may result in a

SecurityException

When passing information to a Java subprocess,

system properties

are generally preferred over environment variables.

The behavior of the returned map is system-dependent. A
system may not allow modifications to environment variables or
may forbid certain variable names or values. For this reason,
attempts to modify the map may fail with

UnsupportedOperationException

or

IllegalArgumentException

if the modification is not permitted by the operating system.

startPipeline

```java

<
Process
> startPipeline​(
List

throws
IOException
```

Starts a Process for each ProcessBuilder, creating a pipeline of
processes linked by their standard output and standard input streams.
The attributes of each ProcessBuilder are used to start the respective
process except that as each process is started, its standard output
is directed to the standard input of the next. The redirects for standard
input of the first process and standard output of the last process are
initialized using the redirect settings of the respective ProcessBuilder.
All other

ProcessBuilder

redirects should be

Redirect.PIPE

.

All input and output streams between the intermediate processes are
not accessible.
The

standard input

of all processes
except the first process are

null output streams

The

standard output

of all processes
except the last process are

null input streams

.

The

redirectErrorStream()

of each ProcessBuilder applies to the
respective process. If set to

true

, the error stream is written
to the same stream as standard output.

If starting any of the processes throws an Exception, all processes
are forcibly destroyed.

The

startPipeline

method performs the same checks on
each ProcessBuilder as does the

start()

method. The new process
will invoke the command and arguments given by

command()

,
in a working directory as given by

directory()

,
with a process environment as given by

environment()

.

This method checks that the command is a valid operating
system command. Which commands are valid is system-dependent,
but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of
non-null strings.

A minimal set of system dependent environment variables may
be required to start a process on some operating systems.
As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable
settings beyond those in the process builder's

environment()

.

If there is a security manager, its

checkExec

method is called with the first component of this object's

command

array as its argument. This may result in
a

SecurityException

being thrown.

Starting an operating system process is highly system-dependent.
Among the many things that can go wrong are:

- The operating system program file was not found.

Access to the program file was denied.

The working directory does not exist.

Invalid character in command argument, such as NUL.

In such cases an exception will be thrown. The exact nature
of the exception is system-dependent, but it will always be a
subclass of

IOException

.

If the operating system does not support the creation of
processes, an

UnsupportedOperationException

will be thrown.

Subsequent modifications to this process builder will not
affect the returned

Process

.

**API Note:** For example to count the unique imports for all the files in a file hierarchy
on a Unix compatible platform:

```java
String directory = "/home/duke/src";
ProcessBuilder[] builders = {
new ProcessBuilder("find", directory, "-type", "f"),
new ProcessBuilder("xargs", "grep", "-h", "^import "),
new ProcessBuilder("awk", "{print $2;}"),
new ProcessBuilder("sort", "-u")};
List<Process> processes = ProcessBuilder.startPipeline(
Arrays.asList(builders));
Process last = processes.get(processes.size()-1);
try (InputStream is = last.getInputStream();
Reader isr = new InputStreamReader(is);
BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(isr)) {
long count = r.lines().count();
}
```
**Parameters:** builders

- a List of ProcessBuilders
**Returns:** a

List<Process>

es started from the corresponding
ProcessBuilder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- any of the redirects except the
standard input of the first builder and the standard output of
the last builder are not

ProcessBuilder.Redirect.PIPE

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if an element of the command list is null or
if an element of the ProcessBuilder list is null or
the builders argument is null
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if the command is an empty list (has size

0

)
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and

- its

checkExec

method doesn't allow creation of the subprocess, or

the standard input to the subprocess was

redirected from a file

and the security manager's

checkRead

method
denies read access to the file, or

the standard output or standard error of the
subprocess was

redirected to a file

and the security manager's

checkWrite

method
denies write access to the file
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If the operating system does not support the creation of processes
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs
