# Class X509CertSelector

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\cert\X509CertSelector.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
X509CertSelector

extends
Object

implements
CertSelector
```

A

CertSelector

that selects

X509Certificates

that
match all specified criteria. This class is particularly useful when
selecting certificates from a

CertStore

to build a
PKIX-compliant certification path.

When first constructed, an

X509CertSelector

has no criteria
enabled and each of the

get

methods return a default value
(

null

, or

-1

for the

getBasicConstraints

method). Therefore, the

match

method would return

true

for any

X509Certificate

.
Typically, several criteria are enabled (by calling

setIssuer

or

setKeyUsage

, for instance) and then the

X509CertSelector

is passed to

CertStore.getCertificates

or some similar
method.

Several criteria can be enabled (by calling

setIssuer

and

setSerialNumber

,
for example) such that the

match

method
usually uniquely matches a single

X509Certificate

. We say
usually, since it is possible for two issuing CAs to have the same
distinguished name and each issue a certificate with the same serial
number. Other unique combinations include the issuer, subject,
subjectKeyIdentifier and/or the subjectPublicKey criteria.

Please refer to

RFC 5280:
Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile

for
definitions of the X.509 certificate extensions mentioned below.

Concurrent Access

Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
separate objects need not synchronize.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Cloneable

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public X509CertSelector()

Creates an

X509CertSelector

. Initially, no criteria are set
so any

X509Certificate

will match.

---

### Method Details

#### public void setCertificate​(
X509Certificate
cert)

Sets the certificateEquals criterion. The specified

X509Certificate

must be equal to the

X509Certificate

passed to the

match

method.
If

null

, then this check is not applied.

This method is particularly useful when it is necessary to
match a single certificate. Although other criteria can be specified
in conjunction with the certificateEquals criterion, it is usually not
practical or necessary.

**Parameters:**
- cert

- the

X509Certificate

to match (or

null

)

**See Also:**
- getCertificate()

---

#### public void setSerialNumber​(
BigInteger
serial)

Sets the serialNumber criterion. The specified serial number
must match the certificate serial number in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any certificate
serial number will do.

**Parameters:**
- serial

- the certificate serial number to match
(or

null

)

**See Also:**
- getSerialNumber()

---

#### public void setIssuer​(
X500Principal
issuer)

Sets the issuer criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the issuer distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any issuer
distinguished name will do.

**Parameters:**
- issuer

- a distinguished name as X500Principal
(or

null

)

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public void setIssuer​(
String
issuerDN)
throws
IOException

Denigrated

, use

setIssuer(X500Principal)

or

setIssuer(byte[])

instead. This method should not be
relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of
encoding information in the

RFC 2253

String form
of some distinguished names.

Sets the issuer criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the issuer distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any issuer
distinguished name will do.

If

issuerDN

is not

null

, it should contain a
distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

**Parameters:**
- issuerDN

- a distinguished name in RFC 2253 format
(or

null

)

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if a parsing error occurs (incorrect form for DN)

---

#### public void setIssuer​(byte[] issuerDN)
throws
IOException

Sets the issuer criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the issuer distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

is specified,
the issuer criterion is disabled and any issuer distinguished name will
do.

If

issuerDN

is not

null

, it should contain a
single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1
notation for this structure is as follows.

```java
Name ::= CHOICE {
RDNSequence }

RDNSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedName

RelativeDistinguishedName ::=
SET SIZE (1 .. MAX) OF AttributeTypeAndValue

AttributeTypeAndValue ::= SEQUENCE {
type AttributeType,
value AttributeValue }

AttributeType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

AttributeValue ::= ANY DEFINED BY AttributeType
....
DirectoryString ::= CHOICE {
teletexString TeletexString (SIZE (1..MAX)),
printableString PrintableString (SIZE (1..MAX)),
universalString UniversalString (SIZE (1..MAX)),
utf8String UTF8String (SIZE (1.. MAX)),
bmpString BMPString (SIZE (1..MAX)) }
```

Note that the byte array specified here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- issuerDN

- a byte array containing the distinguished name
in ASN.1 DER encoded form (or

null

)

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an encoding error occurs (incorrect form for DN)

---

#### public void setSubject​(
X500Principal
subject)

Sets the subject criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the subject distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any subject
distinguished name will do.

**Parameters:**
- subject

- a distinguished name as X500Principal
(or

null

)

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public void setSubject​(
String
subjectDN)
throws
IOException

Denigrated

, use

setSubject(X500Principal)

or

setSubject(byte[])

instead. This method should not be
relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of
encoding information in the RFC 2253 String form of some distinguished
names.

Sets the subject criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the subject distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any subject
distinguished name will do.

If

subjectDN

is not

null

, it should contain a
distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

**Parameters:**
- subjectDN

- a distinguished name in RFC 2253 format
(or

null

)

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if a parsing error occurs (incorrect form for DN)

---

#### public void setSubject​(byte[] subjectDN)
throws
IOException

Sets the subject criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the subject distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any subject
distinguished name will do.

If

subjectDN

is not

null

, it should contain a
single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. For the ASN.1
notation for this structure, see

setIssuer(byte [] issuerDN)

.

**Parameters:**
- subjectDN

- a byte array containing the distinguished name in
ASN.1 DER format (or

null

)

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an encoding error occurs (incorrect form for DN)

---

#### public void setSubjectKeyIdentifier​(byte[] subjectKeyID)

Sets the subjectKeyIdentifier criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain a SubjectKeyIdentifier
extension for which the contents of the extension
matches the specified criterion value.
If the criterion value is

null

, no
subjectKeyIdentifier check will be done.

If

subjectKeyID

is not

null

, it
should contain a single DER encoded value corresponding to the contents
of the extension value (not including the object identifier,
criticality setting, and encapsulating OCTET STRING)
for a SubjectKeyIdentifier extension.
The ASN.1 notation for this structure follows.

```java
SubjectKeyIdentifier ::= KeyIdentifier

KeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING
```

Since the format of subject key identifiers is not mandated by
any standard, subject key identifiers are not parsed by the

X509CertSelector

. Instead, the values are compared using
a byte-by-byte comparison.

Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- subjectKeyID

- the subject key identifier (or

null

)

**See Also:**
- getSubjectKeyIdentifier()

---

#### public void setAuthorityKeyIdentifier​(byte[] authorityKeyID)

Sets the authorityKeyIdentifier criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain an
AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension for which the contents of the
extension value matches the specified criterion value.
If the criterion value is

null

, no
authorityKeyIdentifier check will be done.

If

authorityKeyID

is not

null

, it
should contain a single DER encoded value corresponding to the contents
of the extension value (not including the object identifier,
criticality setting, and encapsulating OCTET STRING)
for an AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension.
The ASN.1 notation for this structure follows.

```java
AuthorityKeyIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
keyIdentifier [0] KeyIdentifier OPTIONAL,
authorityCertIssuer [1] GeneralNames OPTIONAL,
authorityCertSerialNumber [2] CertificateSerialNumber OPTIONAL }

KeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING
```

Authority key identifiers are not parsed by the

X509CertSelector

. Instead, the values are
compared using a byte-by-byte comparison.

When the

keyIdentifier

field of

AuthorityKeyIdentifier

is populated, the value is
usually taken from the

SubjectKeyIdentifier

extension
in the issuer's certificate. Note, however, that the result of

X509Certificate.getExtensionValue(<SubjectKeyIdentifier Object
Identifier>)

on the issuer's certificate may NOT be used
directly as the input to

setAuthorityKeyIdentifier

.
This is because the SubjectKeyIdentifier contains
only a KeyIdentifier OCTET STRING, and not a SEQUENCE of
KeyIdentifier, GeneralNames, and CertificateSerialNumber.
In order to use the extension value of the issuer certificate's

SubjectKeyIdentifier

extension, it will be necessary to extract the value of the embedded

KeyIdentifier

OCTET STRING, then DER encode this OCTET
STRING inside a SEQUENCE.
For more details on SubjectKeyIdentifier, see

setSubjectKeyIdentifier(byte[] subjectKeyID)

.

Note also that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- authorityKeyID

- the authority key identifier
(or

null

)

**See Also:**
- getAuthorityKeyIdentifier()

---

#### public void setCertificateValid​(
Date
certValid)

Sets the certificateValid criterion. The specified date must fall
within the certificate validity period for the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, no certificateValid
check will be done.

Note that the

Date

supplied here is cloned to protect
against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- certValid

- the

Date

to check (or

null

)

**See Also:**
- getCertificateValid()

---

#### public void setPrivateKeyValid​(
Date
privateKeyValid)

Sets the privateKeyValid criterion. The specified date must fall
within the private key validity period for the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, no privateKeyValid
check will be done.

Note that the

Date

supplied here is cloned to protect
against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- privateKeyValid

- the

Date

to check (or

null

)

**See Also:**
- getPrivateKeyValid()

---

#### public void setSubjectPublicKeyAlgID​(
String
oid)
throws
IOException

Sets the subjectPublicKeyAlgID criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain a subject public key
with the specified algorithm. If

null

, no
subjectPublicKeyAlgID check will be done.

**Parameters:**
- oid

- The object identifier (OID) of the algorithm to check
for (or

null

). An OID is represented by a
set of nonnegative integers separated by periods.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if the OID is invalid, such as
the first component being not 0, 1 or 2 or the second component
being greater than 39.

**See Also:**
- getSubjectPublicKeyAlgID()

---

#### public void setSubjectPublicKey​(
PublicKey
key)

Sets the subjectPublicKey criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain the specified subject public
key. If

null

, no subjectPublicKey check will be done.

**Parameters:**
- key

- the subject public key to check for (or

null

)

---

#### public void setSubjectPublicKey​(byte[] key)
throws
IOException

Sets the subjectPublicKey criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain the specified subject public key. If

null

,
no subjectPublicKey check will be done.

Because this method allows the public key to be specified as a byte
array, it may be used for unknown key types.

If

key

is not

null

, it should contain a
single DER encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure, as defined in X.509.
The ASN.1 notation for this structure is as follows.

```java
SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }

AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }
-- contains a value of the type
-- registered for use with the
-- algorithm object identifier value
```

Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- key

- a byte array containing the subject public key in ASN.1 DER
form (or

null

)

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an encoding error occurs (incorrect form for
subject public key)

**See Also:**
- getSubjectPublicKey()

---

#### public void setKeyUsage​(boolean[] keyUsage)

Sets the keyUsage criterion. The

X509Certificate

must allow the specified keyUsage values. If

null

, no
keyUsage check will be done. Note that an

X509Certificate

that has no keyUsage extension implicitly allows all keyUsage values.

Note that the boolean array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- keyUsage

- a boolean array in the same format as the boolean
array returned by

X509Certificate.getKeyUsage()

.
Or

null

.

**See Also:**
- getKeyUsage()

---

#### public void setExtendedKeyUsage​(
Set
<
String
> keyPurposeSet)
throws
IOException

Sets the extendedKeyUsage criterion. The

X509Certificate

must allow the specified key purposes in its extended key usage
extension. If

keyPurposeSet

is empty or

null

,
no extendedKeyUsage check will be done. Note that an

X509Certificate

that has no extendedKeyUsage extension
implicitly allows all key purposes.

Note that the

Set

is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- keyPurposeSet

- a

Set

of key purpose OIDs in string
format (or

null

). Each OID is represented by a set of
nonnegative integers separated by periods.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if the OID is invalid, such as
the first component being not 0, 1 or 2 or the second component
being greater than 39.

**See Also:**
- getExtendedKeyUsage()

---

#### public void setMatchAllSubjectAltNames​(boolean matchAllNames)

Enables/disables matching all of the subjectAlternativeNames
specified in the

setSubjectAlternativeNames

or

addSubjectAlternativeName

methods. If enabled,
the

X509Certificate

must contain all of the
specified subject alternative names. If disabled, the

X509Certificate

must contain at least one of the
specified subject alternative names.

The matchAllNames flag is

true

by default.

**Parameters:**
- matchAllNames

- if

true

, the flag is enabled;
if

false

, the flag is disabled.

**See Also:**
- getMatchAllSubjectAltNames()

---

#### public void setSubjectAlternativeNames​(
Collection
<
List
<?>> names)
throws
IOException

Sets the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain all or at least one of the
specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of
the matchAllNames flag (see

setMatchAllSubjectAltNames

).

This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call,
the complete set of subject alternative names for the
subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The specified value replaces
the previous value for the subjectAlternativeNames criterion.

The

names

parameter (if not

null

) is a

Collection

with one
entry for each name to be included in the subject alternative name
criterion. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second
entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in
string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).
There can be multiple names of the same type. If

null

is supplied as the value for this argument, no
subjectAlternativeNames check will be performed.

Each subject alternative name in the

Collection

may be specified either as a

String

or as an ASN.1 encoded
byte array. For more details about the formats used, see

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, String name)

and

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)

.

Note:

for distinguished names, specify the byte
array form instead of the String form. See the note in

addSubjectAlternativeName(int, String)

for more information.

Note that the

names

parameter can contain duplicate
names (same name and name type), but they may be removed from the

Collection

of names returned by the

getSubjectAlternativeNames

method.

Note that a deep copy is performed on the

Collection

to
protect against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- names

- a

Collection

of names (or

null

)

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if a parsing error occurs

**See Also:**
- getSubjectAlternativeNames()

---

#### public void addSubjectAlternativeName​(int type,

String
name)
throws
IOException

Adds a name to the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain all or at least one
of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of
the matchAllNames flag (see

setMatchAllSubjectAltNames

).

This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of subject
alternative names.
The specified name is added to any previous value for the
subjectAlternativeNames criterion. If the specified name is a
duplicate, it may be ignored.

The name is provided in string format.

RFC 822

, DNS, and URI
names use the well-established string formats for those types (subject to
the restrictions included in RFC 5280). IPv4 address names are
supplied using dotted quad notation. OID address names are represented
as a series of nonnegative integers separated by periods. And
directory names (distinguished names) are supplied in RFC 2253 format.
No standard string format is defined for otherNames, X.400 names,
EDI party names, IPv6 address names, or any other type of names. They
should be specified using the

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)

method.

Note:

for distinguished names, use

addSubjectAlternativeName(int, byte[])

instead.
This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some
certificates because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253
String form of some distinguished names.

**Parameters:**
- type

- the name type (0-8, as specified in
RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.6)
- name

- the name in string form (not

null

)

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if a parsing error occurs

---

#### public void addSubjectAlternativeName​(int type,
byte[] name)
throws
IOException

Adds a name to the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain all or at least one
of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of
the matchAllNames flag (see

setMatchAllSubjectAltNames

).

This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of subject
alternative names.
The specified name is added to any previous value for the
subjectAlternativeNames criterion. If the specified name is a
duplicate, it may be ignored.

The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain
the DER encoded name, as it would appear in the GeneralName structure
defined in RFC 5280 and X.509. The encoded byte array should only contain
the encoded value of the name, and should not include the tag associated
with the name in the GeneralName structure. The ASN.1 definition of this
structure appears below.

```java
GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
otherName [0] OtherName,
rfc822Name [1] IA5String,
dNSName [2] IA5String,
x400Address [3] ORAddress,
directoryName [4] Name,

registeredID [8] OBJECT IDENTIFIER}
```

Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- type

- the name type (0-8, as listed above)
- name

- a byte array containing the name in ASN.1 DER encoded form

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if a parsing error occurs

---

#### public void setNameConstraints​(byte[] bytes)
throws
IOException

Sets the name constraints criterion. The

X509Certificate

must have subject and subject alternative names that
meet the specified name constraints.

The name constraints are specified as a byte array. This byte array
should contain the DER encoded form of the name constraints, as they
would appear in the NameConstraints structure defined in RFC 5280
and X.509. The ASN.1 definition of this structure appears below.

```java
NameConstraints ::= SEQUENCE {
permittedSubtrees [0] GeneralSubtrees OPTIONAL,
excludedSubtrees [1] GeneralSubtrees OPTIONAL }

GeneralSubtrees ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralSubtree

GeneralSubtree ::= SEQUENCE {
base GeneralName,
minimum [0] BaseDistance DEFAULT 0,
maximum [1] BaseDistance OPTIONAL }

BaseDistance ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)

GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
otherName [0] OtherName,
rfc822Name [1] IA5String,
dNSName [2] IA5String,

directoryName [4] Name,
ediPartyName [5] EDIPartyName,
uniformResourceIdentifier [6] IA5String,
iPAddress [7] OCTET STRING,
registeredID [8] OBJECT IDENTIFIER}
```

Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- bytes

- a byte array containing the ASN.1 DER encoding of
a NameConstraints extension to be used for checking
name constraints. Only the value of the extension is
included, not the OID or criticality flag. Can be

null

,
in which case no name constraints check will be performed.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if a parsing error occurs

**See Also:**
- getNameConstraints()

---

#### public void setBasicConstraints​(int minMaxPathLen)

Sets the basic constraints constraint. If the value is greater than or
equal to zero,

X509Certificates

must include a
basicConstraints extension with
a pathLen of at least this value. If the value is -2, only end-entity
certificates are accepted. If the value is -1, no check is done.

This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
(from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
built, any candidate certificate must have a maxPathLen value greater
than or equal to the number of certificates in the partial path.

**Parameters:**
- minMaxPathLen

- the value for the basic constraints constraint

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the value is less than -2

**See Also:**
- getBasicConstraints()

---

#### public void setPolicy​(
Set
<
String
> certPolicySet)
throws
IOException

Sets the policy constraint. The

X509Certificate

must
include at least one of the specified policies in its certificate
policies extension. If

certPolicySet

is empty, then the

X509Certificate

must include at least some specified policy
in its certificate policies extension. If

certPolicySet

is

null

, no policy check will be performed.

Note that the

Set

is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- certPolicySet

- a

Set

of certificate policy OIDs in
string format (or

null

). Each OID is
represented by a set of nonnegative integers
separated by periods.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if a parsing error occurs on the OID such as
the first component is not 0, 1 or 2 or the second component is
greater than 39.

**See Also:**
- getPolicy()

---

#### public void setPathToNames​(
Collection
<
List
<?>> names)
throws
IOException

Sets the pathToNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must
not include name constraints that would prohibit building a
path to the specified names.

This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call,
the complete set of names which the

X509Certificates

's
name constraints must permit. The specified value replaces
the previous value for the pathToNames criterion.

This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
(from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
built, any candidate certificate must not include name constraints that
would prohibit building a path to any of the names in the partial path.

The

names

parameter (if not

null

) is a

Collection

with one
entry for each name to be included in the pathToNames
criterion. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second
entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in
string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).
There can be multiple names of the same type. If

null

is supplied as the value for this argument, no
pathToNames check will be performed.

Each name in the

Collection

may be specified either as a

String

or as an ASN.1 encoded
byte array. For more details about the formats used, see

addPathToName(int type, String name)

and

addPathToName(int type, byte [] name)

.

Note:

for distinguished names, specify the byte
array form instead of the String form. See the note in

addPathToName(int, String)

for more information.

Note that the

names

parameter can contain duplicate
names (same name and name type), but they may be removed from the

Collection

of names returned by the

getPathToNames

method.

Note that a deep copy is performed on the

Collection

to
protect against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- names

- a

Collection

with one entry per name
(or

null

)

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if a parsing error occurs

**See Also:**
- getPathToNames()

#### public void addPathToName​(int type,

String
name)
throws
IOException

Adds a name to the pathToNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must not include name constraints that would prohibit building a
path to the specified name.

This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of names which
the

X509Certificates

's name constraints must permit.
The specified name is added to any previous value for the
pathToNames criterion. If the name is a duplicate, it may be ignored.

The name is provided in string format. RFC 822, DNS, and URI names
use the well-established string formats for those types (subject to
the restrictions included in RFC 5280). IPv4 address names are
supplied using dotted quad notation. OID address names are represented
as a series of nonnegative integers separated by periods. And
directory names (distinguished names) are supplied in RFC 2253 format.
No standard string format is defined for otherNames, X.400 names,
EDI party names, IPv6 address names, or any other type of names. They
should be specified using the

addPathToName(int type, byte [] name)

method.

Note:

for distinguished names, use

addPathToName(int, byte[])

instead.
This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some
certificates because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253
String form of some distinguished names.

CertSelector

```java
public class
X509CertSelector

extends

CertSelector
```

A

CertSelector

that selects

X509Certificates

that
match all specified criteria. This class is particularly useful when
selecting certificates from a

CertStore

to build a
PKIX-compliant certification path.

When first constructed, an

X509CertSelector

has no criteria
enabled and each of the

get

methods return a default value
(

null

, or

-1

for the

getBasicConstraints

method). Therefore, the

match

method would return

true

for any

X509Certificate

.
Typically, several criteria are enabled (by calling

setIssuer

or

setKeyUsage

, for instance) and then the

X509CertSelector

is passed to

CertStore.getCertificates

or some similar
method.

Several criteria can be enabled (by calling

setIssuer

and

setSerialNumber

,
for example) such that the

match

method
usually uniquely matches a single

X509Certificate

. We say
usually, since it is possible for two issuing CAs to have the same
distinguished name and each issue a certificate with the same serial
number. Other unique combinations include the issuer, subject,
subjectKeyIdentifier and/or the subjectPublicKey criteria.

#### Methods declared in class java.lang. Object

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- X509CertSelector

```java
public X509CertSelector()
```

Creates an

X509CertSelector

. Initially, no criteria are set
so any

X509Certificate

will match.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- setCertificate

```java
public void setCertificate​(
X509Certificate
cert)
```

Sets the certificateEquals criterion. The specified

X509Certificate

must be equal to the

X509Certificate

passed to the

match

method.
If

null

, then this check is not applied.

This method is particularly useful when it is necessary to
match a single certificate. Although other criteria can be specified
in conjunction with the certificateEquals criterion, it is usually not
practical or necessary.

**Parameters:** cert

- the

X509Certificate

to match (or

null

)
**See Also:** getCertificate()

- setSerialNumber

```java
public void setSerialNumber​(
BigInteger
serial)
```

Sets the serialNumber criterion. The specified serial number
must match the certificate serial number in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any certificate
serial number will do.

**Parameters:** serial

- the certificate serial number to match
(or

null

)
**See Also:** getSerialNumber()

- setIssuer

```java
public void setIssuer​(
X500Principal
issuer)
```

Sets the issuer criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the issuer distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any issuer
distinguished name will do.

**Parameters:** issuer

- a distinguished name as X500Principal
(or

null

)
**Since:** 1.5

- setIssuer

```java
public void setIssuer​(
String
issuerDN)
throws
IOException
```

Denigrated

, use

setIssuer(X500Principal)

or

setIssuer(byte[])

instead. This method should not be
relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of
encoding information in the

RFC 2253

String form
of some distinguished names.

Sets the issuer criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the issuer distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any issuer
distinguished name will do.

If

issuerDN

is not

null

, it should contain a
distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

**Parameters:** issuerDN

- a distinguished name in RFC 2253 format
(or

null

)
**Throws:** IOException

- if a parsing error occurs (incorrect form for DN)

- setIssuer

```java
public void setIssuer​(byte[] issuerDN)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the issuer criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the issuer distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

is specified,
the issuer criterion is disabled and any issuer distinguished name will
do.

If

issuerDN

is not

null

, it should contain a
single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1
notation for this structure is as follows.

```java
Name ::= CHOICE {
RDNSequence }

RDNSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedName

RelativeDistinguishedName ::=
SET SIZE (1 .. MAX) OF AttributeTypeAndValue

AttributeTypeAndValue ::= SEQUENCE {
type AttributeType,
value AttributeValue }

AttributeType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

AttributeValue ::= ANY DEFINED BY AttributeType
....
DirectoryString ::= CHOICE {
teletexString TeletexString (SIZE (1..MAX)),
printableString PrintableString (SIZE (1..MAX)),
universalString UniversalString (SIZE (1..MAX)),
utf8String UTF8String (SIZE (1.. MAX)),
bmpString BMPString (SIZE (1..MAX)) }
```

Note that the byte array specified here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** issuerDN

- a byte array containing the distinguished name
in ASN.1 DER encoded form (or

null

)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an encoding error occurs (incorrect form for DN)

- setSubject

```java
public void setSubject​(
X500Principal
subject)
```

Sets the subject criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the subject distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any subject
distinguished name will do.

**Parameters:** subject

- a distinguished name as X500Principal
(or

null

)
**Since:** 1.5

- setSubject

```java
public void setSubject​(
String
subjectDN)
throws
IOException
```

Denigrated

, use

setSubject(X500Principal)

or

setSubject(byte[])

instead. This method should not be
relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of
encoding information in the RFC 2253 String form of some distinguished
names.

Sets the subject criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the subject distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any subject
distinguished name will do.

If

subjectDN

is not

null

, it should contain a
distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

**Parameters:** subjectDN

- a distinguished name in RFC 2253 format
(or

null

)
**Throws:** IOException

- if a parsing error occurs (incorrect form for DN)

- setSubject

```java
public void setSubject​(byte[] subjectDN)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the subject criterion. The specified distinguished name
must match the subject distinguished name in the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, any subject
distinguished name will do.

If

subjectDN

is not

null

, it should contain a
single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. For the ASN.1
notation for this structure, see

setIssuer(byte [] issuerDN)

.

**Parameters:** subjectDN

- a byte array containing the distinguished name in
ASN.1 DER format (or

null

)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an encoding error occurs (incorrect form for DN)

- setSubjectKeyIdentifier

```java
public void setSubjectKeyIdentifier​(byte[] subjectKeyID)
```

Sets the subjectKeyIdentifier criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain a SubjectKeyIdentifier
extension for which the contents of the extension
matches the specified criterion value.
If the criterion value is

null

, no
subjectKeyIdentifier check will be done.

If

subjectKeyID

is not

null

, it
should contain a single DER encoded value corresponding to the contents
of the extension value (not including the object identifier,
criticality setting, and encapsulating OCTET STRING)
for a SubjectKeyIdentifier extension.
The ASN.1 notation for this structure follows.

```java
SubjectKeyIdentifier ::= KeyIdentifier

KeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING
```

Since the format of subject key identifiers is not mandated by
any standard, subject key identifiers are not parsed by the

X509CertSelector

. Instead, the values are compared using
a byte-by-byte comparison.

Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** subjectKeyID

- the subject key identifier (or

null

)
**See Also:** getSubjectKeyIdentifier()

- setAuthorityKeyIdentifier

```java
public void setAuthorityKeyIdentifier​(byte[] authorityKeyID)
```

Sets the authorityKeyIdentifier criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain an
AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension for which the contents of the
extension value matches the specified criterion value.
If the criterion value is

null

, no
authorityKeyIdentifier check will be done.

If

authorityKeyID

is not

null

, it
should contain a single DER encoded value corresponding to the contents
of the extension value (not including the object identifier,
criticality setting, and encapsulating OCTET STRING)
for an AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension.
The ASN.1 notation for this structure follows.

```java
AuthorityKeyIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
keyIdentifier [0] KeyIdentifier OPTIONAL,
authorityCertIssuer [1] GeneralNames OPTIONAL,
authorityCertSerialNumber [2] CertificateSerialNumber OPTIONAL }

KeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING
```

Authority key identifiers are not parsed by the

X509CertSelector

. Instead, the values are
compared using a byte-by-byte comparison.

When the

keyIdentifier

field of

AuthorityKeyIdentifier

is populated, the value is
usually taken from the

SubjectKeyIdentifier

extension
in the issuer's certificate. Note, however, that the result of

X509Certificate.getExtensionValue(<SubjectKeyIdentifier Object
Identifier>)

on the issuer's certificate may NOT be used
directly as the input to

setAuthorityKeyIdentifier

.
This is because the SubjectKeyIdentifier contains
only a KeyIdentifier OCTET STRING, and not a SEQUENCE of
KeyIdentifier, GeneralNames, and CertificateSerialNumber.
In order to use the extension value of the issuer certificate's

SubjectKeyIdentifier

extension, it will be necessary to extract the value of the embedded

KeyIdentifier

OCTET STRING, then DER encode this OCTET
STRING inside a SEQUENCE.
For more details on SubjectKeyIdentifier, see

setSubjectKeyIdentifier(byte[] subjectKeyID)

.

Note also that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** authorityKeyID

- the authority key identifier
(or

null

)
**See Also:** getAuthorityKeyIdentifier()

- setCertificateValid

```java
public void setCertificateValid​(
Date
certValid)
```

Sets the certificateValid criterion. The specified date must fall
within the certificate validity period for the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, no certificateValid
check will be done.

Note that the

Date

supplied here is cloned to protect
against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** certValid

- the

Date

to check (or

null

)
**See Also:** getCertificateValid()

- setPrivateKeyValid

```java
public void setPrivateKeyValid​(
Date
privateKeyValid)
```

Sets the privateKeyValid criterion. The specified date must fall
within the private key validity period for the

X509Certificate

. If

null

, no privateKeyValid
check will be done.

Note that the

Date

supplied here is cloned to protect
against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** privateKeyValid

- the

Date

to check (or

null

)
**See Also:** getPrivateKeyValid()

- setSubjectPublicKeyAlgID

```java
public void setSubjectPublicKeyAlgID​(
String
oid)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the subjectPublicKeyAlgID criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain a subject public key
with the specified algorithm. If

null

, no
subjectPublicKeyAlgID check will be done.

**Parameters:** oid

- The object identifier (OID) of the algorithm to check
for (or

null

). An OID is represented by a
set of nonnegative integers separated by periods.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the OID is invalid, such as
the first component being not 0, 1 or 2 or the second component
being greater than 39.
**See Also:** getSubjectPublicKeyAlgID()

- setSubjectPublicKey

```java
public void setSubjectPublicKey​(
PublicKey
key)
```

Sets the subjectPublicKey criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain the specified subject public
key. If

null

, no subjectPublicKey check will be done.

**Parameters:** key

- the subject public key to check for (or

null

)
**See Also:** getSubjectPublicKey()

- setSubjectPublicKey

```java
public void setSubjectPublicKey​(byte[] key)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the subjectPublicKey criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain the specified subject public key. If

null

,
no subjectPublicKey check will be done.

Because this method allows the public key to be specified as a byte
array, it may be used for unknown key types.

If

key

is not

null

, it should contain a
single DER encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure, as defined in X.509.
The ASN.1 notation for this structure is as follows.

```java
SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }

AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }
-- contains a value of the type
-- registered for use with the
-- algorithm object identifier value
```

Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** key

- a byte array containing the subject public key in ASN.1 DER
form (or

null

)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an encoding error occurs (incorrect form for
subject public key)
**See Also:** getSubjectPublicKey()

- setKeyUsage

```java
public void setKeyUsage​(boolean[] keyUsage)
```

Sets the keyUsage criterion. The

X509Certificate

must allow the specified keyUsage values. If

null

, no
keyUsage check will be done. Note that an

X509Certificate

that has no keyUsage extension implicitly allows all keyUsage values.

Note that the boolean array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** keyUsage

- a boolean array in the same format as the boolean
array returned by

X509Certificate.getKeyUsage()

.
Or

null

.
**See Also:** getKeyUsage()

- setExtendedKeyUsage

```java
public void setExtendedKeyUsage​(
Set
<
String
> keyPurposeSet)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the extendedKeyUsage criterion. The

X509Certificate

must allow the specified key purposes in its extended key usage
extension. If

keyPurposeSet

is empty or

null

,
no extendedKeyUsage check will be done. Note that an

X509Certificate

that has no extendedKeyUsage extension
implicitly allows all key purposes.

Note that the

Set

is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** keyPurposeSet

- a

Set

of key purpose OIDs in string
format (or

null

). Each OID is represented by a set of
nonnegative integers separated by periods.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the OID is invalid, such as
the first component being not 0, 1 or 2 or the second component
being greater than 39.
**See Also:** getExtendedKeyUsage()

- setMatchAllSubjectAltNames

```java
public void setMatchAllSubjectAltNames​(boolean matchAllNames)
```

Enables/disables matching all of the subjectAlternativeNames
specified in the

setSubjectAlternativeNames

or

addSubjectAlternativeName

methods. If enabled,
the

X509Certificate

must contain all of the
specified subject alternative names. If disabled, the

X509Certificate

must contain at least one of the
specified subject alternative names.

The matchAllNames flag is

true

by default.

**Parameters:** matchAllNames

- if

true

, the flag is enabled;
if

false

, the flag is disabled.
**See Also:** getMatchAllSubjectAltNames()

- setSubjectAlternativeNames

```java
public void setSubjectAlternativeNames​(
Collection
<
List
<?>> names)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain all or at least one of the
specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of
the matchAllNames flag (see

setMatchAllSubjectAltNames

).

This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call,
the complete set of subject alternative names for the
subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The specified value replaces
the previous value for the subjectAlternativeNames criterion.

The

names

parameter (if not

null

) is a

Collection

with one
entry for each name to be included in the subject alternative name
criterion. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second
entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in
string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).
There can be multiple names of the same type. If

null

is supplied as the value for this argument, no
subjectAlternativeNames check will be performed.

Each subject alternative name in the

Collection

may be specified either as a

String

or as an ASN.1 encoded
byte array. For more details about the formats used, see

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, String name)

and

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)

.

Note:

for distinguished names, specify the byte
array form instead of the String form. See the note in

addSubjectAlternativeName(int, String)

for more information.

Note that the

names

parameter can contain duplicate
names (same name and name type), but they may be removed from the

Collection

of names returned by the

getSubjectAlternativeNames

method.

Note that a deep copy is performed on the

Collection

to
protect against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** names

- a

Collection

of names (or

null

)
**Throws:** IOException

- if a parsing error occurs
**See Also:** getSubjectAlternativeNames()

- addSubjectAlternativeName

```java
public void addSubjectAlternativeName​(int type,

String
name)
throws
IOException
```

Adds a name to the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain all or at least one
of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of
the matchAllNames flag (see

setMatchAllSubjectAltNames

).

This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of subject
alternative names.
The specified name is added to any previous value for the
subjectAlternativeNames criterion. If the specified name is a
duplicate, it may be ignored.

The name is provided in string format.

RFC 822

, DNS, and URI
names use the well-established string formats for those types (subject to
the restrictions included in RFC 5280). IPv4 address names are
supplied using dotted quad notation. OID address names are represented
as a series of nonnegative integers separated by periods. And
directory names (distinguished names) are supplied in RFC 2253 format.
No standard string format is defined for otherNames, X.400 names,
EDI party names, IPv6 address names, or any other type of names. They
should be specified using the

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)

method.

Note:

for distinguished names, use

addSubjectAlternativeName(int, byte[])

instead.
This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some
certificates because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253
String form of some distinguished names.

**Parameters:** type

- the name type (0-8, as specified in
RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.6)
**Parameters:** name

- the name in string form (not

null

)
**Throws:** IOException

- if a parsing error occurs

- addSubjectAlternativeName

```java
public void addSubjectAlternativeName​(int type,
byte[] name)
throws
IOException
```

Adds a name to the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain all or at least one
of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of
the matchAllNames flag (see

setMatchAllSubjectAltNames

).

This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of subject
alternative names.
The specified name is added to any previous value for the
subjectAlternativeNames criterion. If the specified name is a
duplicate, it may be ignored.

The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain
the DER encoded name, as it would appear in the GeneralName structure
defined in RFC 5280 and X.509. The encoded byte array should only contain
the encoded value of the name, and should not include the tag associated
with the name in the GeneralName structure. The ASN.1 definition of this
structure appears below.

```java
GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
otherName [0] OtherName,
rfc822Name [1] IA5String,
dNSName [2] IA5String,
x400Address [3] ORAddress,
directoryName [4] Name,
ediPartyName [5] EDIPartyName,
uniformResourceIdentifier [6] IA5String,
iPAddress [7] OCTET STRING,
registeredID [8] OBJECT IDENTIFIER}
```

Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** type

- the name type (0-8, as listed above)
**Parameters:** name

- a byte array containing the name in ASN.1 DER encoded form
**Throws:** IOException

- if a parsing error occurs

- setNameConstraints

```java
public void setNameConstraints​(byte[] bytes)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the name constraints criterion. The

X509Certificate

must have subject and subject alternative names that
meet the specified name constraints.

The name constraints are specified as a byte array. This byte array
should contain the DER encoded form of the name constraints, as they
would appear in the NameConstraints structure defined in RFC 5280
and X.509. The ASN.1 definition of this structure appears below.

```java
NameConstraints ::= SEQUENCE {
permittedSubtrees [0] GeneralSubtrees OPTIONAL,
excludedSubtrees [1] GeneralSubtrees OPTIONAL }

GeneralSubtrees ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralSubtree

GeneralSubtree ::= SEQUENCE {
base GeneralName,
minimum [0] BaseDistance DEFAULT 0,
maximum [1] BaseDistance OPTIONAL }

BaseDistance ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)

GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
otherName [0] OtherName,
rfc822Name [1] IA5String,
dNSName [2] IA5String,
x400Address [3] ORAddress,
directoryName [4] Name,
ediPartyName [5] EDIPartyName,
uniformResourceIdentifier [6] IA5String,
iPAddress [7] OCTET STRING,
registeredID [8] OBJECT IDENTIFIER}
```

Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** bytes

- a byte array containing the ASN.1 DER encoding of
a NameConstraints extension to be used for checking
name constraints. Only the value of the extension is
included, not the OID or criticality flag. Can be

null

,
in which case no name constraints check will be performed.
**Throws:** IOException

- if a parsing error occurs
**See Also:** getNameConstraints()

- setBasicConstraints

```java
public void setBasicConstraints​(int minMaxPathLen)
```

Sets the basic constraints constraint. If the value is greater than or
equal to zero,

X509Certificates

must include a
basicConstraints extension with
a pathLen of at least this value. If the value is -2, only end-entity
certificates are accepted. If the value is -1, no check is done.

This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
(from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
built, any candidate certificate must have a maxPathLen value greater
than or equal to the number of certificates in the partial path.

**Parameters:** minMaxPathLen

- the value for the basic constraints constraint
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the value is less than -2
**See Also:** getBasicConstraints()

- setPolicy

```java
public void setPolicy​(
Set
<
String
> certPolicySet)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the policy constraint. The

X509Certificate

must
include at least one of the specified policies in its certificate
policies extension. If

certPolicySet

is empty, then the

X509Certificate

must include at least some specified policy
in its certificate policies extension. If

certPolicySet

is

null

, no policy check will be performed.

Note that the

Set

is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** certPolicySet

- a

Set

of certificate policy OIDs in
string format (or

null

). Each OID is
represented by a set of nonnegative integers
separated by periods.
**Throws:** IOException

- if a parsing error occurs on the OID such as
the first component is not 0, 1 or 2 or the second component is
greater than 39.
**See Also:** getPolicy()

- setPathToNames

```java
public void setPathToNames​(
Collection
<
List
<?>> names)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the pathToNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must
not include name constraints that would prohibit building a
path to the specified names.

This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call,
the complete set of names which the

X509Certificates

's
name constraints must permit. The specified value replaces
the previous value for the pathToNames criterion.

This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
(from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
built, any candidate certificate must not include name constraints that
would prohibit building a path to any of the names in the partial path.

The

names

parameter (if not

null

) is a

Collection

with one
entry for each name to be included in the pathToNames
criterion. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second
entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in
string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).
There can be multiple names of the same type. If

null

is supplied as the value for this argument, no
pathToNames check will be performed.

Each name in the

Collection

may be specified either as a

String

or as an ASN.1 encoded
byte array. For more details about the formats used, see

addPathToName(int type, String name)

and

addPathToName(int type, byte [] name)

.

Note:

for distinguished names, specify the byte
array form instead of the String form. See the note in

addPathToName(int, String)

for more information.

Note that the

names

parameter can contain duplicate
names (same name and name type), but they may be removed from the

Collection

of names returned by the

getPathToNames

method.

Note that a deep copy is performed on the

Collection

to
protect against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** names

- a

Collection

with one entry per name
(or

null

)
**Throws:** IOException

- if a parsing error occurs
**See Also:** getPathToNames()

- addPathToName

```java
public void addPathToName​(int type,

String
name)
throws
IOException
```

Adds a name to the pathToNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must not include name constraints that would prohibit building a
path to the specified name.

This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of names which
the

X509Certificates

's name constraints must permit.
The specified name is added to any previous value for the
pathToNames criterion. If the name is a duplicate, it may be ignored.

The name is provided in string format. RFC 822, DNS, and URI names
use the well-established string formats for those types (subject to
the restrictions included in RFC 5280). IPv4 address names are
supplied using dotted quad notation. OID address names are represented
as a series of nonnegative integers separated by periods. And
directory names (distinguished names) are supplied in RFC 2253 format.
No standard string format is defined for otherNames, X.400 names,
EDI party names, IPv6 address names, or any other type of names. They
should be specified using the

addPathToName(int type, byte [] name)

method.

Note:

for distinguished names, use

addPathToName(int, byte[])

instead.
This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some
certificates because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253
String form of some distinguished names.

**Parameters:** type

- the name type (0-8, as specified in
RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.6)
**Parameters:** name

's name constraints must permit.
The specified name is added to any previous value for the
pathToNames criterion. If the name is a duplicate, it may be ignored.

The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain
the DER encoded name, as it would appear in the GeneralName structure

single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. For the ASN.1
notation for this structure, see

setIssuer(byte [] issuerDN)

.

**Parameters:** subjectDN

- a byte array containing the distinguished name in
ASN.1 DER format (or

null

)
**Throws:** IOException

- if an encoding error occurs (incorrect form for DN)

- setSubjectKeyIdentifier

```java
public void setSubjectKeyIdentifier​(byte[] subjectKeyID)
```

Sets the subjectKeyIdentifier criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain a SubjectKeyIdentifier
extension for which the contents of the extension
matches the specified criterion value.
If the criterion value is

null

, no
subjectKeyIdentifier check will be done.

If

subjectKeyID

is not

null

, it
should contain a single DER encoded value corresponding to the contents
of the extension value (not including the object identifier,
criticality setting, and encapsulating OCTET STRING)
for a SubjectKeyIdentifier extension.
The ASN.1 notation for this structure follows.

```java
SubjectKeyIdentifier ::= KeyIdentifier

KeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING
```

Since the format of subject key identifiers is not mandated by
any standard, subject key identifiers are not parsed by the

X509CertSelector

. Instead, the values are compared using
a byte-by-byte comparison.

Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** subjectKeyID

- the subject key identifier (or

null

)
**See Also:** getSubjectKeyIdentifier()

- setAuthorityKeyIdentifier

```java
public void setAuthorityKeyIdentifier​(byte[] authorityKeyID)
```

X509Certificate

must contain an
AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension for which the contents of the
extension value matches the specified criterion value.
If the criterion value is

null

, no
authorityKeyIdentifier check will be done.

If

authorityKeyID

is not

null

, it
should contain a single DER encoded value corresponding to the contents
of the extension value (not including the object identifier,
criticality setting, and encapsulating OCTET STRING)
for an AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension.
The ASN.1 notation for this structure follows.

```java
AuthorityKeyIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
keyIdentifier [0] KeyIdentifier OPTIONAL,
authorityCertIssuer [1] GeneralNames OPTIONAL,
authorityCertSerialNumber [2] CertificateSerialNumber OPTIONAL }

KeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING
```

Authority key identifiers are not parsed by the

X509CertSelector

. Instead, the values are
compared using a byte-by-byte comparison.

When the

keyIdentifier

field of

AuthorityKeyIdentifier

is populated, the value is
usually taken from the

SubjectKeyIdentifier

extension
in the issuer's certificate. Note, however, that the result of

X509Certificate.getExtensionValue(<SubjectKeyIdentifier Object
Identifier>)

on the issuer's certificate may NOT be used
directly as the input to

setAuthorityKeyIdentifier

.
This is because the SubjectKeyIdentifier contains
only a KeyIdentifier OCTET STRING, and not a SEQUENCE of
KeyIdentifier, GeneralNames, and CertificateSerialNumber.
In order to use the extension value of the issuer certificate's

SubjectKeyIdentifier

extension, it will be necessary to extract the value of the embedded

KeyIdentifier

OCTET STRING, then DER encode this OCTET
STRING inside a SEQUENCE.
For more details on SubjectKeyIdentifier, see

setSubjectKeyIdentifier(byte[] subjectKeyID)

.

Note also that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** authorityKeyID

must contain at least one of the
specified subject alternative names.

The matchAllNames flag is

true

by default.

**Parameters:** matchAllNames

- if

true

, the flag is enabled;
if

IOException
```

Sets the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must contain all or at least one of the
specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of
the matchAllNames flag (see

setMatchAllSubjectAltNames

).

This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call,
the complete set of subject alternative names for the
subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The specified value replaces
the previous value for the subjectAlternativeNames criterion.

The

names

parameter (if not

null

) is a

Collection

with one
entry for each name to be included in the subject alternative name
criterion. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second
entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in
string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).
There can be multiple names of the same type. If

null

is supplied as the value for this argument, no
subjectAlternativeNames check will be performed.

Each subject alternative name in the

Collection

may be specified either as a

String

or as an ASN.1 encoded
byte array. For more details about the formats used, see

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, String name)

and

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)

.

Note:

for distinguished names, specify the byte
array form instead of the String form. See the note in

addSubjectAlternativeName(int, String)

for more information.

Note that the

names

parameter can contain duplicate
names (same name and name type), but they may be removed from the

Collection

of names returned by the

getSubjectAlternativeNames

method.

Note that a deep copy is performed on the

Collection

to
protect against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** names

- a

Collection

of names (or

null

)
**Throws:** IOException

- if a parsing error occurs
**See Also:** getSubjectAlternativeNames()

This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of subject
alternative names.
The specified name is added to any previous value for the
subjectAlternativeNames criterion. If the specified name is a
duplicate, it may be ignored.

The name is provided in string format.

RFC 822

, DNS, and URI
names use the well-established string formats for those types (subject to
the restrictions included in RFC 5280). IPv4 address names are
supplied using dotted quad notation. OID address names are represented
as a series of nonnegative integers separated by periods. And
directory names (distinguished names) are supplied in RFC 2253 format.
No standard string format is defined for otherNames, X.400 names,
EDI party names, IPv6 address names, or any other type of names. They
should be specified using the

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)

method.

Note:

for distinguished names, use

addSubjectAlternativeName(int, byte[])

instead.
This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some
certificates because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253
String form of some distinguished names.

**Parameters:** type

alternative names.
The specified name is added to any previous value for the
subjectAlternativeNames criterion. If the specified name is a
duplicate, it may be ignored.

The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain
the DER encoded name, as it would appear in the GeneralName structure
defined in RFC 5280 and X.509. The encoded byte array should only contain
the encoded value of the name, and should not include the tag associated
with the name in the GeneralName structure. The ASN.1 definition of this
structure appears below.

must include a
basicConstraints extension with
a pathLen of at least this value. If the value is -2, only end-entity
certificates are accepted. If the value is -1, no check is done.

This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
(from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
built, any candidate certificate must have a maxPathLen value greater
than or equal to the number of certificates in the partial path.

**Parameters:** minMaxPathLen

- the value for the basic constraints constraint
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the value is less than -2
**See Also:** getBasicConstraints()

Set
<
String
> certPolicySet)
throws
IOException
```

X509Certificate

must
include at least one of the specified policies in its certificate
policies extension. If

certPolicySet

is empty, then the

X509Certificate

in its certificate policies extension. If

certPolicySet

is

null

, no policy check will be performed.

Note that the

Set

is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** certPolicySet

- a

Set

of certificate policy OIDs in
string format (or

null

). Each OID is
represented by a set of nonnegative integers

's
name constraints must permit. The specified value replaces
the previous value for the pathToNames criterion.

This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
(from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
built, any candidate certificate must not include name constraints that
would prohibit building a path to any of the names in the partial path.

The

names

parameter (if not

null

) is a

Collection

with one
entry for each name to be included in the pathToNames
criterion. Each entry is a

<?>> getSubjectAlternativeNames()
```

Returns a copy of the subjectAlternativeNames criterion.
The

X509Certificate

must contain all or at least one
of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value
of the matchAllNames flag (see

getMatchAllSubjectAltNames

). If the value returned is

null

, no subjectAlternativeNames check will be performed.

If the value returned is not

null

, it is a

Collection

with
one entry for each name to be included in the subject alternative name
criterion. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second
entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in
string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).
There can be multiple names of the same type. Note that the

Collection

returned may contain duplicate names (same name
and name type).

Each subject alternative name in the

Collection

may be specified either as a

String

or as an ASN.1 encoded
byte array. For more details about the formats used, see

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, String name)

and

addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)

.

Note that a deep copy is performed on the

Collection

to
protect against subsequent modifications.

**Returns:** a

Collection

of names (or

null

)
**See Also:** setSubjectAlternativeNames(java.util.Collection<java.util.List<?>>)

- getNameConstraints

```java
public byte[] getNameConstraints()
```

Returns the name constraints criterion. The

X509Certificate

must have subject and subject alternative names that
meet the specified name constraints.

The name constraints are returned as a byte array. This byte array
contains the DER encoded form of the name constraints, as they
would appear in the NameConstraints structure defined in RFC 5280
and X.509. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is supplied in the
documentation for

setNameConstraints(byte [] bytes)

.

Note that the byte array returned is cloned to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Returns:** a byte array containing the ASN.1 DER encoding of
a NameConstraints extension used for checking name constraints.

null

if no name constraints check will be performed.
**See Also:** setNameConstraints(byte[])

- getBasicConstraints

```java
public int getBasicConstraints()
```

Returns the basic constraints constraint. If the value is greater than
or equal to zero, the

X509Certificates

must include a
basicConstraints extension with a pathLen of at least this value.
If the value is -2, only end-entity certificates are accepted. If
the value is -1, no basicConstraints check is done.

**Returns:** the value for the basic constraints constraint
**See Also:** setBasicConstraints(int)

- getPolicy

```java
public
Set
<
String
> getPolicy()
```

Returns the policy criterion. The

X509Certificate

must
include at least one of the specified policies in its certificate policies
extension. If the

Set

returned is empty, then the

X509Certificate

must include at least some specified policy
in its certificate policies extension. If the

Set

returned is

null

, no policy check will be performed.

**Returns:** an immutable

Set

of certificate policy OIDs in
string format (or

null

)
**See Also:** setPolicy(java.util.Set<java.lang.String>)

- getPathToNames

```java
public
Collection
<
List
<?>> getPathToNames()
```

Returns a copy of the pathToNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must not include name constraints that would
prohibit building a path to the specified names. If the value
returned is

null

, no pathToNames check will be performed.

If the value returned is not

null

, it is a

Collection

with one
entry for each name to be included in the pathToNames
criterion. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second
entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in
string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).
There can be multiple names of the same type. Note that the

Collection

returned may contain duplicate names (same
name and name type).

Each name in the

Collection

may be specified either as a

String

or as an ASN.1 encoded
byte array. For more details about the formats used, see

addPathToName(int type, String name)

and

addPathToName(int type, byte [] name)

.

Sets the name constraints criterion. The

X509Certificate

must have subject and subject alternative names that
meet the specified name constraints.

The name constraints are specified as a byte array. This byte array
should contain the DER encoded form of the name constraints, as they
would appear in the NameConstraints structure defined in RFC 5280

setBasicConstraints

```java
public void setBasicConstraints​(int minMaxPathLen)
```

Sets the basic constraints constraint. If the value is greater than or
equal to zero,

X509Certificates

must include a
basicConstraints extension with
a pathLen of at least this value. If the value is -2, only end-entity
certificates are accepted. If the value is -1, no check is done.

This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
(from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
built, any candidate certificate must have a maxPathLen value greater
than or equal to the number of certificates in the partial path.

**Parameters:** minMaxPathLen

- the value for the basic constraints constraint
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the value is less than -2
**See Also:** getBasicConstraints()

setPolicy

```java
public void setPolicy​(
Set
<
String
> certPolicySet)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the policy constraint. The

X509Certificate

must
include at least one of the specified policies in its certificate
policies extension. If

certPolicySet

is empty, then the

X509Certificate

must include at least some specified policy
in its certificate policies extension. If

certPolicySet

is

null

, no policy check will be performed.

Note that the

Set

is cloned to protect against

**Parameters:** certPolicySet

- a

Set

of certificate policy OIDs in
string format (or

null

). Each OID is
represented by a set of nonnegative integers
separated by periods.
**Throws:** IOException

- if a parsing error occurs on the OID such as
the first component is not 0, 1 or 2 or the second component is
greater than 39.

Collection
<
List
<?>> names)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the pathToNames criterion. The

X509Certificate

must
not include name constraints that would prohibit building a
path to the specified names.

This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call,
the complete set of names which the

X509Certificates

's
name constraints must permit. The specified value replaces
the previous value for the pathToNames criterion.

This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
(from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
built, any candidate certificate must not include name constraints that
would prohibit building a path to any of the names in the partial path.

The

names

parameter (if not

null

) is a

Collection

with one
entry for each name to be included in the pathToNames
criterion. Each entry is a

List

whose first entry is an

Integer

(the name type, 0-8) and whose second
entry is a

String

or a byte array (the name, in
string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).
There can be multiple names of the same type. If

null

is supplied as the value for this argument, no
pathToNames check will be performed.

Each name in the

Collection

may be specified either as a

String

or as an ASN.1 encoded
byte array. For more details about the formats used, see

addPathToName(int type, String name)

and

addPathToName(int type, byte [] name)

.

Note:

for distinguished names, specify the byte
array form instead of the String form. See the note in

for more information.

Note that the

names

parameter can contain duplicate
names (same name and name type), but they may be removed from the

Collection

of names returned by the

getPathToNames

method.

Note that a deep copy is performed on the

Collection
