# Class DrbgParameters

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\DrbgParameters.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
DrbgParameters

extends
Object
```

This class specifies the parameters used by a DRBG (Deterministic
Random Bit Generator).

According to

NIST Special Publication 800-90A Revision 1, Recommendation for Random
Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators

(800-90Ar1),

A DRBG is based on a DRBG mechanism as specified in this Recommendation
and includes a source of randomness. A DRBG mechanism uses an algorithm
(i.e., a DRBG algorithm) that produces a sequence of bits from an initial
value that is determined by a seed that is determined from the output of
the randomness source."

The 800-90Ar1 specification allows for a variety of DRBG implementation
choices, such as:

- an entropy source,

a DRBG mechanism (for example, Hash_DRBG),

a DRBG algorithm (for example, SHA-256 for Hash_DRBG and AES-256
for CTR_DRBG. Please note that it is not the algorithm used in

SecureRandom.getInstance(java.lang.String)

, which we will call a

SecureRandom algorithm

below),

optional features, including prediction resistance
and reseeding supports,

highest security strength.

These choices are set in each implementation and are not directly
managed by the

SecureRandom

API. Check your DRBG provider's
documentation to find an appropriate implementation for the situation.

On the other hand, the 800-90Ar1 specification does have some configurable
options, such as:

- required security strength,

if prediction resistance is required,

personalization string and additional input.

A DRBG instance can be instantiated with parameters from an

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

object and other information
(for example, the nonce, which is not managed by this API). This maps
to the

Instantiate_function

defined in NIST SP 800-90Ar1.

A DRBG instance can be reseeded with parameters from a

DrbgParameters.Reseed

object. This maps to the

Reseed_function

defined in NIST SP 800-90Ar1. Calling

SecureRandom.reseed()

is equivalent to calling

SecureRandom.reseed(SecureRandomParameters)

with the effective
instantiated prediction resistance flag (as returned by

SecureRandom.getParameters()

) with no additional input.

A DRBG instance generates data with additional parameters from a

DrbgParameters.NextBytes

object. This maps to the

Generate_function

defined in NIST SP 800-90Ar1. Calling

SecureRandom.nextBytes(byte[])

is equivalent to calling

SecureRandom.nextBytes(byte[], SecureRandomParameters)

with the effective instantiated strength and prediction resistance flag
(as returned by

SecureRandom.getParameters()

) with no
additional input.

A DRBG should be implemented as a subclass of

SecureRandomSpi

.
It is recommended that the implementation contain the 1-arg

constructor

that takes a

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

argument. If implemented
this way, this implementation can be chosen by any

SecureRandom.getInstance()

method. If it is chosen by a

SecureRandom.getInstance()

with a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter, the parameter is passed into this constructor. If it is chosen
by a

SecureRandom.getInstance()

without a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter, the constructor is called with
a

null

argument and the implementation should choose its own
parameters. Its

SecureRandom.getParameters()

must always return a
non-null effective

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

object that reflects
how the DRBG is actually instantiated. A caller can use this information
to determine whether a

SecureRandom

object is a DRBG and what
features it supports. Please note that the returned value does not
necessarily equal to the

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

object passed
into the

SecureRandom.getInstance()

call. For example,
the requested capability can be

DrbgParameters.Capability.NONE

but the effective value can be

DrbgParameters.Capability.RESEED_ONLY

if the implementation supports reseeding. The implementation must implement
the

SecureRandomSpi.engineNextBytes(byte[], SecureRandomParameters)

method which takes a

DrbgParameters.NextBytes

parameter. Unless
the result of

SecureRandom.getParameters()

has its

capability

being

NONE

, it must implement

SecureRandomSpi.engineReseed(SecureRandomParameters)

which takes
a

DrbgParameters.Reseed

parameter.

On the other hand, if a DRBG implementation does not contain a constructor
that has an

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

argument (not recommended),
it can only be chosen by a

SecureRandom.getInstance()

without
a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter, but will not be chosen if
a

getInstance

method with a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter
is called. If implemented this way, its

SecureRandom.getParameters()

must return

null

, and it does not need to implement either

SecureRandomSpi.engineNextBytes(byte[], SecureRandomParameters)

or

SecureRandomSpi.engineReseed(SecureRandomParameters)

.

A DRBG might reseed itself automatically if the seed period is bigger
than the maximum seed life defined by the DRBG mechanism.

A DRBG implementation should support serialization and deserialization
by retaining the configuration and effective parameters, but the internal
state must not be serialized and the deserialized object must be
reinstantiated.

Examples:

```java
SecureRandom drbg;
byte[] buffer = new byte[32];

// Any DRBG is OK
drbg = SecureRandom.getInstance("DRBG");
drbg.nextBytes(buffer);

SecureRandomParameters params = drbg.getParameters();
if (params instanceof DrbgParameters.Instantiation) {
DrbgParameters.Instantiation ins = (DrbgParameters.Instantiation) params;
if (ins.getCapability().supportsReseeding()) {
drbg.reseed();
}
}

// The following call requests a weak DRBG instance. It is only
// guaranteed to support 112 bits of security strength.
drbg = SecureRandom.getInstance("DRBG",
DrbgParameters.instantiation(112, NONE, null));

// Both the next two calls will likely fail, because drbg could be
// instantiated with a smaller strength with no prediction resistance
// support.
drbg.nextBytes(buffer,
DrbgParameters.nextBytes(256, false, "more".getBytes()));
drbg.nextBytes(buffer,
DrbgParameters.nextBytes(112, true, "more".getBytes()));

// The following call requests a strong DRBG instance, with a
// personalization string. If it successfully returns an instance,
// that instance is guaranteed to support 256 bits of security strength
// with prediction resistance available.
drbg = SecureRandom.getInstance("DRBG", DrbgParameters.instantiation(
256, PR_AND_RESEED, "hello".getBytes()));

// Prediction resistance is not requested in this single call,
// but an additional input is used.
drbg.nextBytes(buffer,
DrbgParameters.nextBytes(-1, false, "more".getBytes()));

// Same for this call.
drbg.reseed(DrbgParameters.reseed(false, "extra".getBytes()));
```

**Implementation Requirements:** By convention, a provider should name its primary DRBG implementation
with the

standard

SecureRandom

algorithm name

"DRBG".
**Implementation Note:** The following notes apply to the "DRBG" implementation in the SUN provider
of the JDK reference implementation.

This implementation supports the Hash_DRBG and HMAC_DRBG mechanisms with
DRBG algorithm SHA-224, SHA-512/224, SHA-256, SHA-512/256, SHA-384 and
SHA-512, and CTR_DRBG (both using derivation function and not using
derivation function) with DRBG algorithm AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256.

The mechanism name and DRBG algorithm name are determined by the

security property

securerandom.drbg.config

. The default choice is Hash_DRBG
with SHA-256.

For each combination, the security strength can be requested from 112
up to the highest strength it supports. Both reseeding and prediction
resistance are supported.

Personalization string is supported through the

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

class and additional input is supported
through the

DrbgParameters.NextBytes

and

DrbgParameters.Reseed

classes.

If a DRBG is not instantiated with a

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

object explicitly, this implementation instantiates it with a default
requested strength of 128 bits, no prediction resistance request, and
no personalization string. These default instantiation parameters can also
be customized with the

securerandom.drbg.config

security property.

This implementation reads fresh entropy from the system default entropy
source determined by the security property

securerandom.source

.

Calling

SecureRandom.generateSeed(int)

will directly read
from this system default entropy source.

This implementation has passed all tests included in the 20151104 version of

The DRBG Test Vectors

.

A DRBG might reseed itself automatically if the seed period is bigger
than the maximum seed life defined by the DRBG mechanism.

A DRBG implementation should support serialization and deserialization
by retaining the configuration and effective parameters, but the internal
state must not be serialized and the deserialized object must be
reinstantiated.

Examples:

```java
SecureRandom drbg;
byte[] buffer = new byte[32];

// Any DRBG is OK
drbg = SecureRandom.getInstance("DRBG");
drbg.nextBytes(buffer);

SecureRandomParameters params = drbg.getParameters();
if (params instanceof DrbgParameters.Instantiation) {
DrbgParameters.Instantiation ins = (DrbgParameters.Instantiation) params;
if (ins.getCapability().supportsReseeding()) {
drbg.reseed();
}
}

// The following call requests a weak DRBG instance. It is only
// guaranteed to support 112 bits of security strength.
drbg = SecureRandom.getInstance("DRBG",
DrbgParameters.instantiation(112, NONE, null));

// Both the next two calls will likely fail, because drbg could be
// instantiated with a smaller strength with no prediction resistance
// support.
drbg.nextBytes(buffer,
DrbgParameters.nextBytes(256, false, "more".getBytes()));
drbg.nextBytes(buffer,
DrbgParameters.nextBytes(112, true, "more".getBytes()));

// The following call requests a strong DRBG instance, with a
// personalization string. If it successfully returns an instance,
// that instance is guaranteed to support 256 bits of security strength
// with prediction resistance available.
drbg = SecureRandom.getInstance("DRBG", DrbgParameters.instantiation(
256, PR_AND_RESEED, "hello".getBytes()));

// Prediction resistance is not requested in this single call,
// but an additional input is used.
drbg.nextBytes(buffer,
DrbgParameters.nextBytes(-1, false, "more".getBytes()));

// Same for this call.
drbg.reseed(DrbgParameters.reseed(false, "extra".getBytes()));
```

The 800-90Ar1 specification allows for a variety of DRBG implementation
choices, such as:

- an entropy source,

a DRBG mechanism (for example, Hash_DRBG),

a DRBG algorithm (for example, SHA-256 for Hash_DRBG and AES-256
for CTR_DRBG. Please note that it is not the algorithm used in

SecureRandom.getInstance(java.lang.String)

, which we will call a

SecureRandom algorithm

below),

optional features, including prediction resistance
and reseeding supports,

highest security strength.

These choices are set in each implementation and are not directly
managed by the

SecureRandom

API. Check your DRBG provider's
documentation to find an appropriate implementation for the situation.

On the other hand, the 800-90Ar1 specification does have some configurable
options, such as:

- required security strength,

if prediction resistance is required,

personalization string and additional input.

A DRBG instance can be instantiated with parameters from an

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

object and other information
(for example, the nonce, which is not managed by this API). This maps
to the

Instantiate_function

defined in NIST SP 800-90Ar1.

A DRBG instance can be reseeded with parameters from a

DrbgParameters.Reseed

object. This maps to the

Reseed_function

defined in NIST SP 800-90Ar1. Calling

SecureRandom.reseed()

is equivalent to calling

SecureRandom.reseed(SecureRandomParameters)

with the effective
instantiated prediction resistance flag (as returned by

SecureRandom.getParameters()

) with no additional input.

A DRBG instance generates data with additional parameters from a

DrbgParameters.NextBytes

object. This maps to the

Generate_function

defined in NIST SP 800-90Ar1. Calling

SecureRandom.nextBytes(byte[])

is equivalent to calling

SecureRandom.nextBytes(byte[], SecureRandomParameters)

with the effective instantiated strength and prediction resistance flag
(as returned by

SecureRandom.getParameters()

) with no
additional input.

A DRBG should be implemented as a subclass of

SecureRandomSpi

.
It is recommended that the implementation contain the 1-arg

constructor

that takes a

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

argument. If implemented
this way, this implementation can be chosen by any

SecureRandom.getInstance()

method. If it is chosen by a

SecureRandom.getInstance()

with a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter, the parameter is passed into this constructor. If it is chosen
by a

SecureRandom.getInstance()

without a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter, the constructor is called with
a

null

argument and the implementation should choose its own
parameters. Its

SecureRandom.getParameters()

must always return a
non-null effective

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

object that reflects
how the DRBG is actually instantiated. A caller can use this information
to determine whether a

SecureRandom

object is a DRBG and what
features it supports. Please note that the returned value does not
necessarily equal to the

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

object passed
into the

SecureRandom.getInstance()

call. For example,
the requested capability can be

DrbgParameters.Capability.NONE

but the effective value can be

DrbgParameters.Capability.RESEED_ONLY

if the implementation supports reseeding. The implementation must implement
the

SecureRandomSpi.engineNextBytes(byte[], SecureRandomParameters)

method which takes a

DrbgParameters.NextBytes

parameter. Unless
the result of

SecureRandom.getParameters()

has its

capability

being

NONE

, it must implement

SecureRandomSpi.engineReseed(SecureRandomParameters)

which takes
a

DrbgParameters.Reseed

parameter.

On the other hand, if a DRBG implementation does not contain a constructor
that has an

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

argument (not recommended),
it can only be chosen by a

SecureRandom.getInstance()

without
a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter, but will not be chosen if
a

getInstance

method with a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter
is called. If implemented this way, its

SecureRandom.getParameters()

A DRBG instance generates data with additional parameters from a

DrbgParameters.NextBytes

object. This maps to the

Generate_function

defined in NIST SP 800-90Ar1. Calling

SecureRandom.nextBytes(byte[])

is equivalent to calling

SecureRandom.nextBytes(byte[], SecureRandomParameters)

with the effective instantiated strength and prediction resistance flag
(as returned by

SecureRandom.getParameters()

) with no
additional input.

A DRBG should be implemented as a subclass of

SecureRandomSpi

.
It is recommended that the implementation contain the 1-arg

constructor

that takes a

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

argument. If implemented
this way, this implementation can be chosen by any

SecureRandom.getInstance()

method. If it is chosen by a

SecureRandom.getInstance()

with a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter, the parameter is passed into this constructor. If it is chosen
by a

SecureRandom.getInstance()

without a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter, the constructor is called with
a

null

argument and the implementation should choose its own
parameters. Its

SecureRandom.getParameters()

must always return a
non-null effective

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

object that reflects
how the DRBG is actually instantiated. A caller can use this information
to determine whether a

SecureRandom

object is a DRBG and what
features it supports. Please note that the returned value does not
necessarily equal to the

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

object passed
into the

SecureRandom.getInstance()

call. For example,
the requested capability can be

DrbgParameters.Capability.NONE

but the effective value can be

DrbgParameters.Capability.RESEED_ONLY

if the implementation supports reseeding. The implementation must implement
the

SecureRandomSpi.engineNextBytes(byte[], SecureRandomParameters)

method which takes a

DrbgParameters.NextBytes

parameter. Unless
the result of

SecureRandom.getParameters()

has its

capability

being

NONE

, it must implement

SecureRandomSpi.engineReseed(SecureRandomParameters)

which takes
a

DrbgParameters.Reseed

parameter.

On the other hand, if a DRBG implementation does not contain a constructor
that has an

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

argument (not recommended),
it can only be chosen by a

SecureRandom.getInstance()

without
a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter, but will not be chosen if
a

getInstance

method with a

SecureRandomParameters

parameter
is called. If implemented this way, its

SecureRandom.getParameters()

must return

null

, and it does not need to implement either

SecureRandomSpi.engineNextBytes(byte[], SecureRandomParameters)

or

SecureRandomSpi.engineReseed(SecureRandomParameters)

.

A DRBG might reseed itself automatically if the seed period is bigger
than the maximum seed life defined by the DRBG mechanism.

A DRBG implementation should support serialization and deserialization
by retaining the configuration and effective parameters, but the internal
state must not be serialized and the deserialized object must be
reinstantiated.

Examples:

```java
SecureRandom drbg;
byte[] buffer = new byte[32];

// Any DRBG is OK
drbg = SecureRandom.getInstance("DRBG");
drbg.nextBytes(buffer);

SecureRandomParameters params = drbg.getParameters();
if (params instanceof DrbgParameters.Instantiation) {
DrbgParameters.Instantiation ins = (DrbgParameters.Instantiation) params;
if (ins.getCapability().supportsReseeding()) {
drbg.reseed();
}
}

// The following call requests a weak DRBG instance. It is only
// guaranteed to support 112 bits of security strength.
drbg = SecureRandom.getInstance("DRBG",
DrbgParameters.instantiation(112, NONE, null));

// Both the next two calls will likely fail, because drbg could be
// instantiated with a smaller strength with no prediction resistance
// support.
drbg.nextBytes(buffer,
DrbgParameters.nextBytes(256, false, "more".getBytes()));
drbg.nextBytes(buffer,
DrbgParameters.nextBytes(112, true, "more".getBytes()));

// The following call requests a strong DRBG instance, with a
// personalization string. If it successfully returns an instance,
// that instance is guaranteed to support 256 bits of security strength
// with prediction resistance available.
drbg = SecureRandom.getInstance("DRBG", DrbgParameters.instantiation(
256, PR_AND_RESEED, "hello".getBytes()));

// Prediction resistance is not requested in this single call,
// but an additional input is used.
drbg.nextBytes(buffer,
DrbgParameters.nextBytes(-1, false, "more".getBytes()));

// Same for this call.
drbg.reseed(DrbgParameters.reseed(false, "extra".getBytes()));
```

object that reflects

the requested capability can be

DrbgParameters.Capability.NONE

but the effective value can be

This implementation supports the Hash_DRBG and HMAC_DRBG mechanisms with
DRBG algorithm SHA-224, SHA-512/224, SHA-256, SHA-512/256, SHA-384 and
SHA-512, and CTR_DRBG (both using derivation function and not using
derivation function) with DRBG algorithm AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256.

The mechanism name and DRBG algorithm name are determined by the

security property

securerandom.drbg.config

. The default choice is Hash_DRBG
with SHA-256.

For each combination, the security strength can be requested from 112
up to the highest strength it supports. Both reseeding and prediction
resistance are supported.

Personalization string is supported through the

DrbgParameters.Instantiation

class and additional input is supported
through the

DrbgParameters.NextBytes

and

DrbgParameters.Reseed

classes.

If a DRBG is not instantiated with a

DrbgParameters.Instantiation
