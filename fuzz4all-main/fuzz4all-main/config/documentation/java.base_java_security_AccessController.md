# Class AccessController

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\AccessController.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
AccessController

extends
Object
```

The AccessController class is used for access control operations
and decisions.

More specifically, the AccessController class is used for
three purposes:

- to decide whether an access to a critical system
resource is to be allowed or denied, based on the security policy
currently in effect,

to mark code as being "privileged", thus affecting subsequent
access determinations, and

to obtain a "snapshot" of the current calling context so
access-control decisions from a different context can be made with
respect to the saved context.

The

checkPermission

method
determines whether the access request indicated by a specified
permission should be granted or denied. A sample call appears
below. In this example,

checkPermission

will determine
whether or not to grant "read" access to the file named "testFile" in
the "/temp" directory.

```java
FilePermission perm = new FilePermission("/temp/testFile", "read");
AccessController.checkPermission(perm);
```

If a requested access is allowed,

checkPermission

returns quietly. If denied, an
AccessControlException is
thrown. AccessControlException can also be thrown if the requested
permission is of an incorrect type or contains an invalid value.
Such information is given whenever possible.

Suppose the current thread traversed m callers, in the order of caller 1
to caller 2 to caller m. Then caller m invoked the

checkPermission

method.
The

checkPermission

method determines whether access
is granted or denied based on the following algorithm:

```java
for (int i = m; i > 0; i--) {

if (caller i's domain does not have the permission)
throw AccessControlException

else if (caller i is marked as privileged) {
if (a context was specified in the call to doPrivileged)
context.checkPermission(permission)
if (limited permissions were specified in the call to doPrivileged) {
for (each limited permission) {
if (the limited permission implies the requested permission)
return;
}
} else
return;
}
}

// Next, check the context inherited when the thread was created.
// Whenever a new thread is created, the AccessControlContext at
// that time is stored and associated with the new thread, as the
// "inherited" context.

inheritedContext.checkPermission(permission);
```

A caller can be marked as being "privileged"
(see

doPrivileged

and below).
When making access control decisions, the

checkPermission

method stops checking if it reaches a caller that
was marked as "privileged" via a

doPrivileged

call without a context argument (see below for information about a
context argument). If that caller's domain has the
specified permission and at least one limiting permission argument (if any)
implies the requested permission, no further checking is done and

checkPermission

returns quietly, indicating that the requested access is allowed.
If that domain does not have the specified permission, an exception
is thrown, as usual. If the caller's domain had the specified permission
but it was not implied by any limiting permission arguments given in the call
to

doPrivileged

then the permission checking continues
until there are no more callers or another

doPrivileged

call matches the requested permission and returns normally.

The normal use of the "privileged" feature is as follows. If you
don't need to return a value from within the "privileged" block, do
the following:

```java
somemethod() {
...normal code here...
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Void>() {
public Void run() {
// privileged code goes here, for example:
System.loadLibrary("awt");
return null; // nothing to return
}
});
...normal code here...
}
```

PrivilegedAction is an interface with a single method, named

run

.
The above example shows creation of an implementation
of that interface; a concrete implementation of the

run

method is supplied.
When the call to

doPrivileged

is made, an
instance of the PrivilegedAction implementation is passed
to it. The

doPrivileged

method calls the

run

method from the PrivilegedAction
implementation after enabling privileges, and returns the

run

method's return value as the

doPrivileged

return value (which is
ignored in this example).

If you need to return a value, you can do something like the following:

```java
somemethod() {
...normal code here...
String user = AccessController.doPrivileged(
new PrivilegedAction<String>() {
public String run() {
return System.getProperty("user.name");
}
});
...normal code here...
}
```

If the action performed in your

run

method could
throw a "checked" exception (those listed in the

throws

clause
of a method), then you need to use the

PrivilegedExceptionAction

interface instead of the

PrivilegedAction

interface:

```java
somemethod() throws FileNotFoundException {
...normal code here...
try {
FileInputStream fis = AccessController.doPrivileged(
new PrivilegedExceptionAction<FileInputStream>() {
public FileInputStream run() throws FileNotFoundException {
return new FileInputStream("someFile");
}
});
} catch (PrivilegedActionException e) {
// e.getException() should be an instance of FileNotFoundException,
// as only "checked" exceptions will be "wrapped" in a
// PrivilegedActionException.
throw (FileNotFoundException) e.getException();
}
...normal code here...
}
```

Be *very* careful in your use of the "privileged" construct, and
always remember to make the privileged code section as small as possible.
You can pass

Permission

arguments to further limit the
scope of the "privilege" (see below).

Note that

checkPermission

always performs security checks
within the context of the currently executing thread.
Sometimes a security check that should be made within a given context
will actually need to be done from within a

different

context (for example, from within a worker thread).
The

getContext

method and
AccessControlContext class are provided
for this situation. The

getContext

method takes a "snapshot"
of the current calling context, and places
it in an AccessControlContext object, which it returns. A sample call is
the following:

```java
AccessControlContext acc = AccessController.getContext()
```

AccessControlContext itself has a

checkPermission

method
that makes access decisions based on the context

it

encapsulates,
rather than that of the current execution thread.
Code within a different context can thus call that method on the
previously-saved AccessControlContext object. A sample call is the
following:

```java
acc.checkPermission(permission)
```

There are also times where you don't know a priori which permissions
to check the context against. In these cases you can use the
doPrivileged method that takes a context. You can also limit the scope
of the privileged code by passing additional

Permission

parameters.

```java
somemethod() {
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Object>() {
public Object run() {
// Code goes here. Any permission checks within this
// run method will require that the intersection of the
// caller's protection domain and the snapshot's
// context have the desired permission. If a requested
// permission is not implied by the limiting FilePermission
// argument then checking of the thread continues beyond the
// caller of doPrivileged.
}
}, acc, new FilePermission("/temp/*", read));
...normal code here...
}
```

Passing a limiting

Permission

argument of an instance of

AllPermission

is equivalent to calling the equivalent

doPrivileged

method without limiting

Permission

arguments. Passing a zero length array of

Permission

disables
the code privileges so that checking always continues beyond the caller of
that

doPrivileged

method.

### Additional Sections

#### Class AccessController

java.lang.Object

- java.security.AccessController

java.security.AccessController

```java
public final class
AccessController

extends
Object
```

The AccessController class is used for access control operations
and decisions.

More specifically, the AccessController class is used for
three purposes:

- to decide whether an access to a critical system
resource is to be allowed or denied, based on the security policy
currently in effect,

to mark code as being "privileged", thus affecting subsequent
access determinations, and

to obtain a "snapshot" of the current calling context so
access-control decisions from a different context can be made with
respect to the saved context.

The

checkPermission

method
determines whether the access request indicated by a specified
permission should be granted or denied. A sample call appears
below. In this example,

checkPermission

will determine
whether or not to grant "read" access to the file named "testFile" in
the "/temp" directory.

```java
FilePermission perm = new FilePermission("/temp/testFile", "read");
AccessController.checkPermission(perm);
```

If a requested access is allowed,

checkPermission

returns quietly. If denied, an
AccessControlException is
thrown. AccessControlException can also be thrown if the requested
permission is of an incorrect type or contains an invalid value.
Such information is given whenever possible.

Suppose the current thread traversed m callers, in the order of caller 1
to caller 2 to caller m. Then caller m invoked the

checkPermission

method.
The

checkPermission

method determines whether access
is granted or denied based on the following algorithm:

```java
for (int i = m; i > 0; i--) {

if (caller i's domain does not have the permission)
throw AccessControlException

else if (caller i is marked as privileged) {
if (a context was specified in the call to doPrivileged)
context.checkPermission(permission)
if (limited permissions were specified in the call to doPrivileged) {
for (each limited permission) {
if (the limited permission implies the requested permission)
return;
}
} else
return;
}
}

// Next, check the context inherited when the thread was created.
// Whenever a new thread is created, the AccessControlContext at
// that time is stored and associated with the new thread, as the
// "inherited" context.

inheritedContext.checkPermission(permission);
```

A caller can be marked as being "privileged"
(see

doPrivileged

and below).
When making access control decisions, the

checkPermission

method stops checking if it reaches a caller that
was marked as "privileged" via a

doPrivileged

call without a context argument (see below for information about a
context argument). If that caller's domain has the
specified permission and at least one limiting permission argument (if any)
implies the requested permission, no further checking is done and

checkPermission

returns quietly, indicating that the requested access is allowed.
If that domain does not have the specified permission, an exception
is thrown, as usual. If the caller's domain had the specified permission
but it was not implied by any limiting permission arguments given in the call
to

doPrivileged

then the permission checking continues
until there are no more callers or another

doPrivileged

call matches the requested permission and returns normally.

The normal use of the "privileged" feature is as follows. If you
don't need to return a value from within the "privileged" block, do
the following:

```java
somemethod() {
...normal code here...
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Void>() {
public Void run() {
// privileged code goes here, for example:
System.loadLibrary("awt");
return null; // nothing to return
}
});
...normal code here...
}
```

PrivilegedAction is an interface with a single method, named

run

.
The above example shows creation of an implementation
of that interface; a concrete implementation of the

run

method is supplied.
When the call to

doPrivileged

is made, an
instance of the PrivilegedAction implementation is passed
to it. The

doPrivileged

method calls the

run

method from the PrivilegedAction
implementation after enabling privileges, and returns the

run

method's return value as the

doPrivileged

return value (which is
ignored in this example).

If you need to return a value, you can do something like the following:

```java
somemethod() {
...normal code here...
String user = AccessController.doPrivileged(
new PrivilegedAction<String>() {
public String run() {
return System.getProperty("user.name");
}
});
...normal code here...
}
```

If the action performed in your

run

method could
throw a "checked" exception (those listed in the

throws

clause
of a method), then you need to use the

PrivilegedExceptionAction

interface instead of the

PrivilegedAction

interface:

```java
somemethod() throws FileNotFoundException {
...normal code here...
try {
FileInputStream fis = AccessController.doPrivileged(
new PrivilegedExceptionAction<FileInputStream>() {
public FileInputStream run() throws FileNotFoundException {
return new FileInputStream("someFile");
}
});
} catch (PrivilegedActionException e) {
// e.getException() should be an instance of FileNotFoundException,
// as only "checked" exceptions will be "wrapped" in a
// PrivilegedActionException.
throw (FileNotFoundException) e.getException();
}
...normal code here...
}
```

Be *very* careful in your use of the "privileged" construct, and
always remember to make the privileged code section as small as possible.
You can pass

Permission

arguments to further limit the
scope of the "privilege" (see below).

Note that

checkPermission

always performs security checks
within the context of the currently executing thread.
Sometimes a security check that should be made within a given context
will actually need to be done from within a

different

context (for example, from within a worker thread).
The

getContext

method and
AccessControlContext class are provided
for this situation. The

getContext

method takes a "snapshot"
of the current calling context, and places
it in an AccessControlContext object, which it returns. A sample call is
the following:

```java
AccessControlContext acc = AccessController.getContext()
```

AccessControlContext itself has a

checkPermission

method
that makes access decisions based on the context

it

encapsulates,
rather than that of the current execution thread.
Code within a different context can thus call that method on the
previously-saved AccessControlContext object. A sample call is the
following:

```java
acc.checkPermission(permission)
```

There are also times where you don't know a priori which permissions
to check the context against. In these cases you can use the
doPrivileged method that takes a context. You can also limit the scope
of the privileged code by passing additional

Permission

parameters.

```java
somemethod() {
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Object>() {
public Object run() {
// Code goes here. Any permission checks within this
// run method will require that the intersection of the
// caller's protection domain and the snapshot's
// context have the desired permission. If a requested
// permission is not implied by the limiting FilePermission
// argument then checking of the thread continues beyond the
// caller of doPrivileged.
}
}, acc, new FilePermission("/temp/*", read));
...normal code here...
}
```

Passing a limiting

Permission

argument of an instance of

AllPermission

is equivalent to calling the equivalent

doPrivileged

method without limiting

Permission

arguments. Passing a zero length array of

Permission

disables
the code privileges so that checking always continues beyond the caller of
that

doPrivileged

method.

**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** AccessControlContext

public final class

AccessController

extends

Object

The AccessController class is used for access control operations
and decisions.

More specifically, the AccessController class is used for
three purposes:

- to decide whether an access to a critical system
resource is to be allowed or denied, based on the security policy
currently in effect,

to mark code as being "privileged", thus affecting subsequent
access determinations, and

to obtain a "snapshot" of the current calling context so
access-control decisions from a different context can be made with
respect to the saved context.

The

checkPermission

method
determines whether the access request indicated by a specified
permission should be granted or denied. A sample call appears
below. In this example,

checkPermission

will determine
whether or not to grant "read" access to the file named "testFile" in
the "/temp" directory.

```java
FilePermission perm = new FilePermission("/temp/testFile", "read");
AccessController.checkPermission(perm);
```

If a requested access is allowed,

checkPermission

returns quietly. If denied, an
AccessControlException is
thrown. AccessControlException can also be thrown if the requested
permission is of an incorrect type or contains an invalid value.
Such information is given whenever possible.

Suppose the current thread traversed m callers, in the order of caller 1
to caller 2 to caller m. Then caller m invoked the

checkPermission

method.
The

checkPermission

method determines whether access
is granted or denied based on the following algorithm:

```java
for (int i = m; i > 0; i--) {

if (caller i's domain does not have the permission)
throw AccessControlException

else if (caller i is marked as privileged) {
if (a context was specified in the call to doPrivileged)
context.checkPermission(permission)
if (limited permissions were specified in the call to doPrivileged) {
for (each limited permission) {
if (the limited permission implies the requested permission)
return;
}
} else
return;
}
}

// Next, check the context inherited when the thread was created.
// Whenever a new thread is created, the AccessControlContext at
// that time is stored and associated with the new thread, as the
// "inherited" context.

inheritedContext.checkPermission(permission);
```

A caller can be marked as being "privileged"
(see

doPrivileged

and below).
When making access control decisions, the

checkPermission

method stops checking if it reaches a caller that
was marked as "privileged" via a

doPrivileged

call without a context argument (see below for information about a
context argument). If that caller's domain has the
specified permission and at least one limiting permission argument (if any)
implies the requested permission, no further checking is done and

checkPermission

returns quietly, indicating that the requested access is allowed.
If that domain does not have the specified permission, an exception
is thrown, as usual. If the caller's domain had the specified permission
but it was not implied by any limiting permission arguments given in the call
to

doPrivileged

then the permission checking continues
until there are no more callers or another

doPrivileged

call matches the requested permission and returns normally.

The normal use of the "privileged" feature is as follows. If you
don't need to return a value from within the "privileged" block, do
the following:

```java
somemethod() {
...normal code here...
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Void>() {
public Void run() {
// privileged code goes here, for example:
System.loadLibrary("awt");
return null; // nothing to return
}
});
...normal code here...
}
```

PrivilegedAction is an interface with a single method, named

run

.
The above example shows creation of an implementation
of that interface; a concrete implementation of the

run

method is supplied.
When the call to

doPrivileged

is made, an
instance of the PrivilegedAction implementation is passed
to it. The

doPrivileged

method calls the

run

method from the PrivilegedAction
implementation after enabling privileges, and returns the

run

method's return value as the

doPrivileged

return value (which is
ignored in this example).

If you need to return a value, you can do something like the following:

```java
somemethod() {
...normal code here...
String user = AccessController.doPrivileged(
new PrivilegedAction<String>() {
public String run() {
return System.getProperty("user.name");
}
});
...normal code here...
}
```

If the action performed in your

run

method could
throw a "checked" exception (those listed in the

throws

clause
of a method), then you need to use the

PrivilegedExceptionAction

interface instead of the

PrivilegedAction

interface:

```java
somemethod() throws FileNotFoundException {
...normal code here...
try {
FileInputStream fis = AccessController.doPrivileged(
new PrivilegedExceptionAction<FileInputStream>() {
public FileInputStream run() throws FileNotFoundException {
return new FileInputStream("someFile");
}
});
} catch (PrivilegedActionException e) {
// e.getException() should be an instance of FileNotFoundException,
// as only "checked" exceptions will be "wrapped" in a
// PrivilegedActionException.
throw (FileNotFoundException) e.getException();
}
...normal code here...
}
```

Be *very* careful in your use of the "privileged" construct, and
always remember to make the privileged code section as small as possible.
You can pass

Permission

arguments to further limit the
scope of the "privilege" (see below).

Note that

checkPermission

always performs security checks
within the context of the currently executing thread.
Sometimes a security check that should be made within a given context
will actually need to be done from within a

different

context (for example, from within a worker thread).
The

getContext

method and
AccessControlContext class are provided
for this situation. The

getContext

method takes a "snapshot"
of the current calling context, and places
it in an AccessControlContext object, which it returns. A sample call is
the following:

```java
AccessControlContext acc = AccessController.getContext()
```

AccessControlContext itself has a

checkPermission

method
that makes access decisions based on the context

it

encapsulates,
rather than that of the current execution thread.
Code within a different context can thus call that method on the
previously-saved AccessControlContext object. A sample call is the
following:

```java
acc.checkPermission(permission)
```

There are also times where you don't know a priori which permissions
to check the context against. In these cases you can use the
doPrivileged method that takes a context. You can also limit the scope
of the privileged code by passing additional

Permission

parameters.

```java
somemethod() {
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Object>() {
public Object run() {
// Code goes here. Any permission checks within this
// run method will require that the intersection of the
// caller's protection domain and the snapshot's
// context have the desired permission. If a requested
// permission is not implied by the limiting FilePermission
// argument then checking of the thread continues beyond the
// caller of doPrivileged.
}
}, acc, new FilePermission("/temp/*", read));
...normal code here...
}
```

Passing a limiting

Permission

argument of an instance of

AllPermission

is equivalent to calling the equivalent

doPrivileged

method without limiting

Permission

arguments. Passing a zero length array of

Permission

disables
the code privileges so that checking always continues beyond the caller of
that

doPrivileged

method.

}
}

// Next, check the context inherited when the thread was created.
// Whenever a new thread is created, the AccessControlContext at
// that time is stored and associated with the new thread, as the
// "inherited" context.

inheritedContext.checkPermission(permission);

A caller can be marked as being "privileged"
(see

doPrivileged

and below).
When making access control decisions, the

checkPermission

method stops checking if it reaches a caller that
was marked as "privileged" via a

doPrivileged

call without a context argument (see below for information about a
context argument). If that caller's domain has the
specified permission and at least one limiting permission argument (if any)
implies the requested permission, no further checking is done and

checkPermission

returns quietly, indicating that the requested access is allowed.
If that domain does not have the specified permission, an exception
is thrown, as usual. If the caller's domain had the specified permission
but it was not implied by any limiting permission arguments given in the call
to

doPrivileged

then the permission checking continues
until there are no more callers or another

doPrivileged

call matches the requested permission and returns normally.

The normal use of the "privileged" feature is as follows. If you
don't need to return a value from within the "privileged" block, do
the following:

```java
somemethod() {
...normal code here...
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Void>() {
public Void run() {
// privileged code goes here, for example:
System.loadLibrary("awt");
return null; // nothing to return
}
});
...normal code here...
}
```

PrivilegedAction is an interface with a single method, named

run

.
The above example shows creation of an implementation
of that interface; a concrete implementation of the

run

method is supplied.
When the call to

doPrivileged

is made, an
instance of the PrivilegedAction implementation is passed
to it. The

doPrivileged

method calls the

run

method from the PrivilegedAction
implementation after enabling privileges, and returns the

run

method's return value as the

doPrivileged

return value (which is
ignored in this example).

If you need to return a value, you can do something like the following:

```java
somemethod() {
...normal code here...
String user = AccessController.doPrivileged(
new PrivilegedAction<String>() {
public String run() {
return System.getProperty("user.name");
}
});
...normal code here...
}
```

If the action performed in your

run

method could
throw a "checked" exception (those listed in the

throws

clause
of a method), then you need to use the

PrivilegedExceptionAction

interface instead of the

PrivilegedAction

interface:

```java
somemethod() throws FileNotFoundException {
...normal code here...
try {
FileInputStream fis = AccessController.doPrivileged(
new PrivilegedExceptionAction<FileInputStream>() {
public FileInputStream run() throws FileNotFoundException {
return new FileInputStream("someFile");
}
});
} catch (PrivilegedActionException e) {
// e.getException() should be an instance of FileNotFoundException,
// as only "checked" exceptions will be "wrapped" in a
// PrivilegedActionException.
throw (FileNotFoundException) e.getException();
}
...normal code here...
}
```

Be *very* careful in your use of the "privileged" construct, and
always remember to make the privileged code section as small as possible.
You can pass

Permission

arguments to further limit the
scope of the "privilege" (see below).

Note that

checkPermission

always performs security checks
within the context of the currently executing thread.
Sometimes a security check that should be made within a given context
will actually need to be done from within a

different

context (for example, from within a worker thread).
The

getContext

method and
AccessControlContext class are provided
for this situation. The

getContext

method takes a "snapshot"
of the current calling context, and places
it in an AccessControlContext object, which it returns. A sample call is
the following:

```java
AccessControlContext acc = AccessController.getContext()
```

AccessControlContext itself has a

checkPermission

method
that makes access decisions based on the context

it

encapsulates,
rather than that of the current execution thread.
Code within a different context can thus call that method on the
previously-saved AccessControlContext object. A sample call is the
following:

```java
acc.checkPermission(permission)
```

There are also times where you don't know a priori which permissions
to check the context against. In these cases you can use the
doPrivileged method that takes a context. You can also limit the scope
of the privileged code by passing additional

Permission

parameters.

```java
somemethod() {
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Object>() {
public Object run() {
// Code goes here. Any permission checks within this
// run method will require that the intersection of the
// caller's protection domain and the snapshot's
// context have the desired permission. If a requested
// permission is not implied by the limiting FilePermission
// argument then checking of the thread continues beyond the
// caller of doPrivileged.
}
}, acc, new FilePermission("/temp/*", read));
...normal code here...
}
```

Passing a limiting

Permission

argument of an instance of

AllPermission

is equivalent to calling the equivalent

doPrivileged

method without limiting

Permission

arguments. Passing a zero length array of

Permission

disables
the code privileges so that checking always continues beyond the caller of
that

doPrivileged

method.

The normal use of the "privileged" feature is as follows. If you
don't need to return a value from within the "privileged" block, do
the following:

```java
somemethod() {
...normal code here...
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Void>() {
public Void run() {

System.loadLibrary("awt");
return null; // nothing to return
}
});

If a security manager is installed and the specified

AccessControlContext

was not created by system code and the
caller's

ProtectionDomain

has not been granted the
"createAccessControlContext"

SecurityPermission

, then the action is performed
with no permissions.

**Type Parameters:** T

- the type of the value returned by the
PrivilegedExceptionAction's

run

method.
**Parameters:** action

- the action to be performed.
**Parameters:** context

- an

access control context

representing the restriction to be applied to the
caller's domain's privileges before performing
the specified action. If the context is

null

,
then no additional restriction is applied.
**Parameters:** perms

- the

Permission

arguments which limit the
scope of the caller's privileges. The number of arguments
is variable.
**Returns:** the value returned by the action's

run

method.
**Throws:** PrivilegedActionException

- if the specified action's

run

method threw a

checked

exception
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if action or perms or any element of
perms is

null

throws

PrivilegedActionException

Performs the specified

PrivilegedExceptionAction

with
privileges enabled and restricted by the specified

AccessControlContext

and with a privilege scope limited by
specified

Permission

arguments.

The action is performed with the intersection of the permissions
possessed by the caller's protection domain, and those possessed
by the domains represented by the specified

AccessControlContext

.

If the action's

run

method throws an (unchecked) exception,
it will propagate through this method.

getContext

```java
public static
AccessControlContext
getContext()
```

This method takes a "snapshot" of the current calling context, which
includes the current Thread's inherited AccessControlContext and any
limited privilege scope, and places it in an AccessControlContext object.
This context may then be checked at a later point, possibly in another thread.

**Returns:** the AccessControlContext based on the current context.

checkPermission

```java
public static void checkPermission​(
Permission
perm)
throws
AccessControlException
```

Determines whether the access request indicated by the
specified permission should be allowed or denied, based on
the current AccessControlContext and security policy.
This method quietly returns if the access request
is permitted, or throws an AccessControlException otherwise. The
getPermission method of the AccessControlException returns the

perm

Permission object instance.

**Parameters:** perm

- the requested permission.
**Throws:** AccessControlException

- if the specified permission
is not permitted, based on the current security policy.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified permission
is

null

and is checked based on the
security policy currently in effect.
