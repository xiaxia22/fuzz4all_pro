#### public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Returns:**
- an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

Shape

.

**See Also:**
- Shape.getBounds()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean contains​(double x,
double y)

Tests if the specified coordinates are inside the boundary of the

Shape

, as described by the

definition of insideness

.

**Parameters:**
- x

- the specified X coordinate to be tested
- y

- the specified Y coordinate to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified coordinates are inside
the

Shape

boundary;

false

otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean intersects​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified rectangular area.
The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Parameters:**
- x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- w

- the width of the specified rectangular area
- h

- the height of the specified rectangular area

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

and
the interior of the rectangular area intersect, or are
both highly likely to intersect and intersection calculations
would be too expensive to perform;

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- Area

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public boolean contains​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains
the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
the rectangular area must lie within the

Shape

for the
entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the

Shape

.

The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the rectangular area are
prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the rectangular area.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Parameters:**
- x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- w

- the width of the specified rectangular area
- h

- the height of the specified rectangular area

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the specified rectangular area;

false

otherwise or, if the

Shape

contains the rectangular area and the

intersects

method returns

true

and the containment calculations would be too expensive to
perform.

Rectangle2D
src1,

Rectangle2D
src2,

Rectangle2D
dest)

Intersects the pair of specified source

Rectangle2D

objects and puts the result into the specified destination

Rectangle2D

object. One of the source rectangles
can also be the destination to avoid creating a third Rectangle2D
object, but in this case the original points of this source
rectangle will be overwritten by this method.

- the first of a pair of

Rectangle2D

objects to be intersected with each other
- src2

- the second of a pair of

Rectangle2D

objects to be intersected with each other

Rectangle2D

object representing the
union of this

Rectangle2D

with the specified

Rectangle2D

.

**Parameters:**
- r

- the

Rectangle2D

this

Rectangle2D

**Returns:**
- the smallest

Rectangle2D

containing both
the specified

Rectangle2D

---

#### public static void union​(
Rectangle2D
src1,

Rectangle2D
src2,

Rectangle2D
dest)

Unions the pair of source

Rectangle2D

objects
and puts the result into the specified destination

Rectangle2D

object. One of the source rectangles
can also be the destination to avoid creating a third Rectangle2D
object, but in this case the original points of this source
rectangle will be overwritten by this method.

**Parameters:**
- src1

- the first of a pair of

Rectangle2D

objects to be combined with each other
- src2

- the second of a pair of

Rectangle2D

objects to be combined with each other
- dest

- the

Rectangle2D

- 1.2

---

#### public void add​(double newx,
double newy)

Adds a point, specified by the double precision arguments

newx

and

newy

, to this

Rectangle2D

. The resulting

Rectangle2D

is the smallest

Rectangle2D

that
contains both the original

Rectangle2D

and the
specified point.

After adding a point, a call to

contains

with the
added point as an argument does not necessarily return

true

. The

contains

method does not
return

true

for points on the right or bottom
edges of a rectangle. Therefore, if the added point falls on
the left or bottom edge of the enlarged rectangle,

contains

returns

false

for that point.

**Parameters:**
- newx

- the X coordinate of the new point
- newy

- the Y coordinate of the new point

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public void add​(
Point2D
pt)

Adds the

Point2D

object

pt

to this

Rectangle2D

.
The resulting

Rectangle2D

is the smallest

Rectangle2D

that contains both the original

Rectangle2D

and the specified

Point2D

.

After adding a point, a call to

contains

with the
added point as an argument does not necessarily return

true

. The

contains

method does not return

true

for points on the right
or bottom edges of a rectangle. Therefore, if the added point falls
on the left or bottom edge of the enlarged rectangle,

contains

returns

false

for that point.

**Parameters:**
- pt

- the new

Point2D

to add to this

Rectangle2D

.

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### public void add​(
Rectangle2D
r)

- getBounds2D

```java
public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()
```

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Returns:** an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

Shape

.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Shape.getBounds()

- contains

```java
public boolean contains​(double x,
double y)
```

Tests if the specified coordinates are inside the boundary of the

Shape

, as described by the

definition of insideness

.

**Parameters:** x

- the specified X coordinate to be tested
**Parameters:** y

- the specified Y coordinate to be tested
**Returns:** true

if the specified coordinates are inside
the

Shape

boundary;

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.2

- intersects

```java
public boolean intersects​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)
```

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified rectangular area.
The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Parameters:** x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** w

- the width of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** h

- the height of the specified rectangular area
**Returns:** true

if the interior of the

Shape

and
the interior of the rectangular area intersect, or are
both highly likely to intersect and intersection calculations
would be too expensive to perform;

false

otherwise.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Area

- contains

```java
public boolean contains​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)
```

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains
the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
the rectangular area must lie within the

Shape

for the
entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the

Shape

.

The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the rectangular area are
prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the rectangular area.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Parameters:** x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** w

- the width of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** h

- the height of the specified rectangular area
**Returns:** true

if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the specified rectangular area;

false

otherwise or, if the

Shape

contains the rectangular area and the

intersects

method returns

true

and the containment calculations would be too expensive to
perform.

src1,

Rectangle2D
src2,

Rectangle2D
dest)
```

Intersects the pair of specified source

Rectangle2D

objects and puts the result into the specified destination

Rectangle2D

object. One of the source rectangles
can also be the destination to avoid creating a third Rectangle2D
object, but in this case the original points of this source
rectangle will be overwritten by this method.

**Parameters:** src1

- the first of a pair of

Rectangle2D

objects to be intersected with each other
**Parameters:** src2

- the second of a pair of

Rectangle2D

**Returns:** the smallest

Rectangle2D

containing both
the specified

Rectangle2D

and this

Rectangle2D

.

- union

```java
public static void union​(
Rectangle2D
src1,

Rectangle2D
src2,

Rectangle2D
dest)
```

Unions the pair of source

Rectangle2D

objects
and puts the result into the specified destination

Rectangle2D

object. One of the source rectangles
can also be the destination to avoid creating a third Rectangle2D
object, but in this case the original points of this source
rectangle will be overwritten by this method.

**Parameters:** src1

- the first of a pair of

Rectangle2D

objects to be combined with each other
**Parameters:** src2

- the second of a pair of

Rectangle2D

objects to be combined with each other
**Parameters:** dest

- the

Rectangle2D

that holds the
results of the union of

src1

and

**Since:** 1.2

- add

```java
public void add​(double newx,
double newy)
```

Adds a point, specified by the double precision arguments

newx

and

newy

, to this

Rectangle2D

. The resulting

Rectangle2D

is the smallest

Rectangle2D

that
contains both the original

Rectangle2D

and the
specified point.

After adding a point, a call to

contains

with the
added point as an argument does not necessarily return

true

. The

contains

method does not
return

true

for points on the right or bottom
edges of a rectangle. Therefore, if the added point falls on
the left or bottom edge of the enlarged rectangle,

contains

returns

false

for that point.

**Parameters:** newx

- the X coordinate of the new point
**Parameters:** newy

- the Y coordinate of the new point
**Since:** 1.2

- add

```java
public void add​(
Point2D
pt)
```

Point2D

object

pt

to this

Rectangle2D

.
The resulting

Rectangle2D

is the smallest

Rectangle2D

that contains both the original

Rectangle2D

and the specified

Point2D

.

After adding a point, a call to

contains

with the
added point as an argument does not necessarily return

true

. The

contains

method does not return

true

for points on the right
or bottom edges of a rectangle. Therefore, if the added point falls
on the left or bottom edge of the enlarged rectangle,

contains

returns

false

for that point.

**Parameters:** pt

- the new

Point2D

to add to this

Rectangle2D

.
**Since:** 1.2

- add

```java
public void add​(
Rectangle2D
r)
```

```java
public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()
```

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

- intersects

```java
public boolean intersects​(double x,
double y,

```

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified rectangular area.
The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Parameters:** x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area

- contains

```java
public boolean contains​(double x,
double y,
double w,

```

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains
the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
the rectangular area must lie within the

Shape

for the
entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the

Shape

.

The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the rectangular area are
prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the rectangular area.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise

**Parameters:** y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** w

- the width of the specified rectangular area
**Parameters:** h

- the height of the specified rectangular area
**Returns:** true
