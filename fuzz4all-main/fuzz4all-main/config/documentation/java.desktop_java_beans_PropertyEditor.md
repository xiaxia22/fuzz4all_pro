# Interface PropertyEditor

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\beans\PropertyEditor.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
PropertyEditor
```

A PropertyEditor class provides support for GUIs that want to
allow users to edit a property value of a given type.

PropertyEditor supports a variety of different kinds of ways of
displaying and updating property values. Most PropertyEditors will
only need to support a subset of the different options available in
this API.

Simple PropertyEditors may only support the getAsText and setAsText
methods and need not support (say) paintValue or getCustomEditor. More
complex types may be unable to support getAsText and setAsText but will
instead support paintValue and getCustomEditor.

Every propertyEditor must support one or more of the three simple
display styles. Thus it can either (1) support isPaintable or (2)
both return a non-null String[] from getTags() and return a non-null
value from getAsText or (3) simply return a non-null String from
getAsText().

Every property editor must support a call on setValue when the argument
object is of the type for which this is the corresponding propertyEditor.
In addition, each property editor must either support a custom editor,
or support setAsText.

Each PropertyEditor should have a null constructor.

### Method Details

#### void setValue​(
Object
value)

Set (or change) the object that is to be edited. Primitive types such
as "int" must be wrapped as the corresponding object type such as
"java.lang.Integer".

**Parameters:**
- value

- The new target object to be edited. Note that this
object should not be modified by the PropertyEditor, rather
the PropertyEditor should create a new object to hold any
modified value.

---

#### Object
getValue()

Gets the property value.

**Returns:**
- The value of the property. Primitive types such as "int" will
be wrapped as the corresponding object type such as "java.lang.Integer".

---

#### boolean isPaintable()

Determines whether this property editor is paintable.

**Returns:**
- True if the class will honor the paintValue method.

---

#### void paintValue​(
Graphics
gfx,

Rectangle
box)

Paint a representation of the value into a given area of screen
real estate. Note that the propertyEditor is responsible for doing
its own clipping so that it fits into the given rectangle.

If the PropertyEditor doesn't honor paint requests (see isPaintable)
this method should be a silent noop.

The given Graphics object will have the default font, color, etc of
the parent container. The PropertyEditor may change graphics attributes
such as font and color and doesn't need to restore the old values.

**Parameters:**
- gfx

- Graphics object to paint into.
- box

- Rectangle within graphics object into which we should paint.

---

#### String
getJavaInitializationString()

Returns a fragment of Java code that can be used to set a property
to match the editors current state. This method is intended
for use when generating Java code to reflect changes made through the
property editor.

The code fragment should be context free and must be a legal Java
expression as specified by the JLS.

Specifically, if the expression represents a computation then all
classes and static members should be fully qualified. This rule
applies to constructors, static methods and non primitive arguments.

Caution should be used when evaluating the expression as it may throw
exceptions. In particular, code generators must ensure that generated
code will compile in the presence of an expression that can throw
checked exceptions.

Example results are:

- Primitive expresssion:

2

Class constructor:

new java.awt.Color(127,127,34)

Static field:

java.awt.Color.orange

Static method:

javax.swing.Box.createRigidArea(new
java.awt.Dimension(0, 5))

**Returns:**
- a fragment of Java code representing an initializer for the
current value. It should not contain a semi-colon
('

;

') to end the expression.

---

#### String
getAsText()

Gets the property value as text.

**Returns:**
- The property value as a human editable string.

Returns null if the value can't be expressed as an editable string.

If a non-null value is returned, then the PropertyEditor should
be prepared to parse that string back in setAsText().

---

#### void setAsText​(
String
text)
throws
IllegalArgumentException

Set the property value by parsing a given String. May raise
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if either the String is
badly formatted or if this kind of property can't be expressed
as text.

**Parameters:**
- text

- The string to be parsed.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

---

#### String
[] getTags()

If the property value must be one of a set of known tagged values,
then this method should return an array of the tags. This can
be used to represent (for example) enum values. If a PropertyEditor
supports tags, then it should support the use of setAsText with
a tag value as a way of setting the value and the use of getAsText
to identify the current value.

**Returns:**
- The tag values for this property. May be null if this
property cannot be represented as a tagged value.

---

#### Component
getCustomEditor()

A PropertyEditor may choose to make available a full custom Component
that edits its property value. It is the responsibility of the
PropertyEditor to hook itself up to its editor Component itself and
to report property value changes by firing a PropertyChange event.

The higher-level code that calls getCustomEditor may either embed
the Component in some larger property sheet, or it may put it in
its own individual dialog, or ...

**Returns:**
- A java.awt.Component that will allow a human to directly
edit the current property value. May be null if this is
not supported.

---

#### boolean supportsCustomEditor()

Determines whether this property editor supports a custom editor.

**Returns:**
- True if the propertyEditor can provide a custom editor.

---

#### void addPropertyChangeListener​(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)

Adds a listener for the value change.
When the property editor changes its value
it should fire a

PropertyChangeEvent

on all registered

PropertyChangeListener

s,
specifying the

null

value for the property name
and itself as the source.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- the

PropertyChangeListener

to add

---

#### void removePropertyChangeListener​(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)

Removes a listener for the value change.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- the

PropertyChangeListener

to remove

java.awt.Color.orange

Static method:

javax.swing.Box.createRigidArea(new
java.awt.Dimension(0, 5))

The code fragment should be context free and must be a legal Java
expression as specified by the JLS.

Specifically, if the expression represents a computation then all
classes and static members should be fully qualified. This rule
applies to constructors, static methods and non primitive arguments.

Caution should be used when evaluating the expression as it may throw
exceptions. In particular, code generators must ensure that generated
code will compile in the presence of an expression that can throw
checked exceptions.

Example results are:

- Primitive expresssion:

getAsText

```java
String
getAsText()
```

Gets the property value as text.

**Returns:** The property value as a human editable string.

Returns null if the value can't be expressed as an editable string.

If a non-null value is returned, then the PropertyEditor should
be prepared to parse that string back in setAsText().

---

#### getAsText

String

getAsText()

Gets the property value as text.

Returns null if the value can't be expressed as an editable string.

If a non-null value is returned, then the PropertyEditor should
be prepared to parse that string back in setAsText().

If a non-null value is returned, then the PropertyEditor should
be prepared to parse that string back in setAsText().

setAsText

```java
void setAsText​(
String
text)
throws
IllegalArgumentException
```

Set the property value by parsing a given String. May raise
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if either the String is
badly formatted or if this kind of property can't be expressed
as text.

**Parameters:** text

- The string to be parsed.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

---

#### setAsText

void setAsText​(

String

text)
throws

IllegalArgumentException

Set the property value by parsing a given String. May raise
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if either the String is
badly formatted or if this kind of property can't be expressed
as text.

getTags

```java
String
[] getTags()
```

If the property value must be one of a set of known tagged values,
then this method should return an array of the tags. This can
be used to represent (for example) enum values. If a PropertyEditor
supports tags, then it should support the use of setAsText with
a tag value as a way of setting the value and the use of getAsText
to identify the current value.

**Returns:** The tag values for this property. May be null if this
property cannot be represented as a tagged value.

#### getTags

String

[] getTags()

If the property value must be one of a set of known tagged values,
then this method should return an array of the tags. This can
be used to represent (for example) enum values. If a PropertyEditor
supports tags, then it should support the use of setAsText with
a tag value as a way of setting the value and the use of getAsText
to identify the current value.

getCustomEditor

```java
Component
getCustomEditor()
```

A PropertyEditor may choose to make available a full custom Component
that edits its property value. It is the responsibility of the
PropertyEditor to hook itself up to its editor Component itself and
to report property value changes by firing a PropertyChange event.

The higher-level code that calls getCustomEditor may either embed
the Component in some larger property sheet, or it may put it in
its own individual dialog, or ...

**Returns:** A java.awt.Component that will allow a human to directly
edit the current property value. May be null if this is
not supported.

addPropertyChangeListener

```java
void addPropertyChangeListener​(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)
```

Adds a listener for the value change.
When the property editor changes its value
it should fire a

PropertyChangeEvent

on all registered

PropertyChangeListener

s,
specifying the

null

value for the property name
and itself as the source.

**Parameters:** listener

- the

PropertyChangeListener

to add
