# Class Scanner

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Scanner.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
Scanner

extends
Object

implements
Iterator
<
String
>,
Closeable
```

A simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and strings using
regular expressions.

A

Scanner

breaks its input into tokens using a
delimiter pattern, which by default matches whitespace. The resulting
tokens may then be converted into values of different types using the
various

next

methods.

For example, this code allows a user to read a number from

System.in

:

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int i = sc.nextInt();
```

As another example, this code allows

long

types to be
assigned from entries in a file

myNumbers

:

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File("myNumbers"));
while (sc.hasNextLong()) {
long aLong = sc.nextLong();
}
```

The scanner can also use delimiters other than whitespace. This
example reads several items in from a string:

```java
String input = "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish";
Scanner s = new Scanner(input).useDelimiter("\\s*fish\\s*");
System.out.println(s.nextInt());
System.out.println(s.nextInt());
System.out.println(s.next());
System.out.println(s.next());
s.close();
```

prints the following output:

```java
1
2
red
blue
```

The same output can be generated with this code, which uses a regular
expression to parse all four tokens at once:

```java
String input = "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish";
Scanner s = new Scanner(input);
s.findInLine("(\\d+) fish (\\d+) fish (\\w+) fish (\\w+)");
MatchResult result = s.match();
for (int i=1; i<=result.groupCount(); i++)
System.out.println(result.group(i));
s.close();
```

The

default whitespace delimiter

used
by a scanner is as recognized by

Character.isWhitespace()

. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the scanner's delimiter to the default
whitespace delimiter regardless of whether it was previously changed.

A scanning operation may block waiting for input.

The

next()

and

hasNext()

methods and their
companion methods (such as

nextInt()

and

hasNextInt()

) first skip any input that matches the delimiter
pattern, and then attempt to return the next token. Both

hasNext()

and

next()

methods may block waiting for further input. Whether a

hasNext()

method blocks has no connection to whether or not its
associated

next()

method will block. The

tokens()

method
may also block waiting for input.

The

findInLine()

,

findWithinHorizon()

,

skip()

, and

findAll()

methods operate independently of the delimiter pattern. These methods will
attempt to match the specified pattern with no regard to delimiters in the
input and thus can be used in special circumstances where delimiters are
not relevant. These methods may block waiting for more input.

When a scanner throws an

InputMismatchException

, the scanner
will not pass the token that caused the exception, so that it may be
retrieved or skipped via some other method.

Depending upon the type of delimiting pattern, empty tokens may be
returned. For example, the pattern

"\\s+"

will return no empty
tokens since it matches multiple instances of the delimiter. The delimiting
pattern

"\\s"

could return empty tokens since it only passes one
space at a time.

A scanner can read text from any object which implements the

Readable

interface. If an invocation of the underlying
readable's

read()

method throws an

IOException

then the scanner assumes that the end of the input
has been reached. The most recent

IOException

thrown by the
underlying readable can be retrieved via the

ioException()

method.

When a

Scanner

is closed, it will close its input source
if the source implements the

Closeable

interface.

A

Scanner

is not safe for multithreaded use without
external synchronization.

Unless otherwise mentioned, passing a

null

parameter into
any method of a

Scanner

will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

A scanner will default to interpreting numbers as decimal unless a
different radix has been set by using the

useRadix(int)

method. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the scanner's radix to

10

regardless of whether it was previously changed.

Localized numbers

An instance of this class is capable of scanning numbers in the standard
formats as well as in the formats of the scanner's locale. A scanner's

initial locale

is the value returned by the

Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category.FORMAT)

method; it may be changed via the

useLocale()

method. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the
scanner's locale to the initial locale regardless of whether it was
previously changed.

The localized formats are defined in terms of the following parameters,
which for a particular locale are taken from that locale's

DecimalFormat

object,

df

, and its and

DecimalFormatSymbols

object,

dfs

.

Number syntax

The strings that can be parsed as numbers by an instance of this class
are specified in terms of the following regular-expression grammar, where
Rmax is the highest digit in the radix being used (for example, Rmax is 9 in base 10).

Whitespace is not significant in the above regular expressions.

by this scanner. This method throws

IllegalStateException

if no match has been performed, or if the last match was
not successful.

The various

next

methods of

Scanner

make a match result available if they complete without throwing an
exception. For instance, after an invocation of the

nextInt()

method that returned an int, this method returns a

MatchResult

**Parameters:**
- pattern

- the pattern to scan for

**Returns:**
- the next token

**Throws:**
- NoSuchElementException

- if no more tokens are available
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public boolean hasNextLine()

Returns true if there is another line in the input of this scanner.
This method may block while waiting for input. The scanner does not
advance past any input.

**Returns:**
- true if and only if this scanner has another line of input

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public
String
nextLine()

Advances this scanner past the current line and returns the input
that was skipped.

This method returns the rest of the current line, excluding any line
separator at the end. The position is set to the beginning of the next
line.

Since this method continues to search through the input looking
for a line separator, it may buffer all of the input searching for
the line to skip if no line separators are present.

**Returns:**
- the line that was skipped

**Throws:**
- NoSuchElementException

- if no line was found
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public
String
findInLine​(
String
pattern)

Attempts to find the next occurrence of a pattern constructed from the
specified string, ignoring delimiters.

An invocation of this method of the form

findInLine(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

findInLine(Pattern.compile(pattern))

.

**Parameters:**
- pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to search for

**Returns:**
- the text that matched the specified pattern

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public
String
findInLine​(
Pattern
pattern)

Attempts to find the next occurrence of the specified pattern ignoring
delimiters. If the pattern is found before the next line separator, the
scanner advances past the input that matched and returns the string that
matched the pattern.
If no such pattern is detected in the input up to the next line
separator, then

null

is returned and the scanner's
position is unchanged. This method may block waiting for input that
matches the pattern.

Since this method continues to search through the input looking
for the specified pattern, it may buffer all of the input searching for
the desired token if no line separators are present.

**Parameters:**
- pattern

- the pattern to scan for

**Returns:**
- the text that matched the specified pattern

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public
String
findWithinHorizon​(
String
pattern,
int horizon)

Attempts to find the next occurrence of a pattern constructed from the
specified string, ignoring delimiters.

An invocation of this method of the form

findWithinHorizon(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as
the invocation

findWithinHorizon(Pattern.compile(pattern), horizon)

.

**Parameters:**
- pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to search for
- horizon

- the search horizon

**Returns:**
- the text that matched the specified pattern

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
- IllegalArgumentException

- if horizon is negative

---

#### public
String
findWithinHorizon​(
Pattern
pattern,
int horizon)

Attempts to find the next occurrence of the specified pattern.

This method searches through the input up to the specified
search horizon, ignoring delimiters. If the pattern is found the
scanner advances past the input that matched and returns the string
that matched the pattern. If no such pattern is detected then the
null is returned and the scanner's position remains unchanged. This
method may block waiting for input that matches the pattern.

A scanner will never search more than

horizon

code
points beyond its current position. Note that a match may be clipped
by the horizon; that is, an arbitrary match result may have been
different if the horizon had been larger. The scanner treats the
horizon as a transparent, non-anchoring bound (see

Matcher.useTransparentBounds(boolean)

and

Matcher.useAnchoringBounds(boolean)

).

If horizon is

0

, then the horizon is ignored and
this method continues to search through the input looking for the
specified pattern without bound. In this case it may buffer all of
the input searching for the pattern.

If horizon is negative, then an IllegalArgumentException is
thrown.

**Parameters:**
- pattern

- the pattern to scan for
- horizon

- the search horizon

**Returns:**
- the text that matched the specified pattern

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
- IllegalArgumentException

- if horizon is negative

---

#### public
Scanner
skip​(
Pattern
pattern)

Skips input that matches the specified pattern, ignoring delimiters.
This method will skip input if an anchored match of the specified
pattern succeeds.

If a match to the specified pattern is not found at the
current position, then no input is skipped and a

NoSuchElementException

is thrown.

Since this method seeks to match the specified pattern starting at
the scanner's current position, patterns that can match a lot of
input (".*", for example) may cause the scanner to buffer a large
amount of input.

Note that it is possible to skip something without risking a

NoSuchElementException

by using a pattern that can
match nothing, e.g.,

sc.skip("[ \t]*")

.

**Parameters:**
- pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to skip over

**Returns:**
- this scanner

**Throws:**
- NoSuchElementException

- if the specified pattern is not found
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public
Scanner
skip​(
String
pattern)

Skips input that matches a pattern constructed from the specified
string.

An invocation of this method of the form

skip(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

skip(Pattern.compile(pattern))

.

**Parameters:**
- pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to skip over

**Returns:**
- this scanner

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public boolean hasNextBoolean()

Returns true if the next token in this scanner's input can be
interpreted as a boolean value using a case insensitive pattern
created from the string "true|false". The scanner does not
advance past the input that matched.

**Returns:**
- true if and only if this scanner's next token is a valid
boolean value

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public boolean nextBoolean()

Scans the next token of the input into a boolean value and returns
that value. This method will throw

InputMismatchException

if the next token cannot be translated into a valid boolean value.
If the match is successful, the scanner advances past the input that
matched.

**Returns:**
- the boolean scanned from the input

**Throws:**
- InputMismatchException

- if the next token is not a valid boolean
- NoSuchElementException

- if input is exhausted
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public boolean hasNextByte()

Returns true if the next token in this scanner's input can be
interpreted as a byte value in the default radix using the

nextByte()

method. The scanner does not advance past any input.

**Returns:**
- true if and only if this scanner's next token is a valid
byte value

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public boolean hasNextByte​(int radix)

Returns true if the next token in this scanner's input can be
interpreted as a byte value in the specified radix using the

nextByte()

method. The scanner does not advance past any input.

If the radix is less than

---

#### public byte nextByte()

Scans the next token of the input as a

byte

.

An invocation of this method of the form

nextByte()

behaves in exactly the same way as the
invocation

nextByte(radix)

, where

radix

is the default radix of this scanner.

**Returns:**
- the

byte

scanned from the input

**Throws:**
- InputMismatchException

- if the next token does not match the

Integer

regular expression, or is out of range
- NoSuchElementException

- if input is exhausted
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

---

#### public byte nextByte​(int radix)

Scans the next token of the input as a

byte

.
This method will throw

InputMismatchException

if the next token cannot be translated into a valid byte value as
described below. If the translation is successful, the scanner advances
past the input that matched.

If the next token matches the

Integer

regular expression defined
above then the token is converted into a

byte

value as if by
removing all locale specific prefixes, group separators, and locale
specific suffixes, then mapping non-ASCII digits into ASCII
digits via

Character.digit

, prepending a
negative sign (-) if the locale specific negative prefixes and suffixes
were present, and passing the resulting string to

Byte.parseByte

with the
specified radix.

If the radix is less than

Character.MIN_RADIX

or greater than

Character.MAX_RADIX

, then an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

**Parameters:**
- radix

- the radix used to interpret the token as a byte value

#### public
Stream
<
String
> tokens()

Returns a stream of delimiter-separated tokens from this scanner. The
stream contains the same tokens that would be returned, starting from
this scanner's current state, by calling the

next()

method
repeatedly until the

hasNext()

method returns false.

The resulting stream is sequential and ordered. All stream elements are
non-null.

Scanning starts upon initiation of the terminal stream operation, using the
current state of this scanner. Subsequent calls to any methods on this scanner
other than

close()

and

ioException()

may return undefined results
or may cause undefined effects on the returned stream. The returned stream's source

Spliterator

is

fail-fast

and will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if any such calls are detected
during stream pipeline execution.

After stream pipeline execution completes, this scanner is left in an indeterminate
state and cannot be reused.

If this scanner contains a resource that must be released, this scanner
should be closed, either by calling its

close()

method, or by
closing the returned stream. Closing the stream will close the underlying scanner.

IllegalStateException

is thrown if the scanner has been closed when this
method is called, or if this scanner is closed during stream pipeline execution.

This method might block waiting for more input.

**Returns:**
- a sequential stream of token strings

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- For example, the following code will create a list of
comma-delimited tokens from a string:

```java
List<String> result = new Scanner("abc,def,,ghi")
.useDelimiter(",")
.tokens()
.collect(Collectors.toList());
```

The resulting list would contain

"abc"

,

"def"

,
the empty string, and

"ghi"

.

---

#### public
Stream
<
MatchResult
> findAll​(
Pattern
pattern)

Returns a stream of match results from this scanner. The stream
contains the same results in the same order that would be returned by
calling

findWithinHorizon(pattern, 0)

and then

match()

successively as long as

findWithinHorizon()

finds matches.

The resulting stream is sequential and ordered. All stream elements are
non-null.

Scanning starts upon initiation of the terminal stream operation, using the
current state of this scanner. Subsequent calls to any methods on this scanner
other than

close()

and

ioException()

may return undefined results
or may cause undefined effects on the returned stream. The returned stream's source

Spliterator

is

fail-fast

and will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if any such calls are detected
during stream pipeline execution.

After stream pipeline execution completes, this scanner is left in an indeterminate
state and cannot be reused.

If this scanner contains a resource that must be released, this scanner
should be closed, either by calling its

close()

method, or by
closing the returned stream. Closing the stream will close the underlying scanner.

IllegalStateException

is thrown if the scanner has been closed when this
method is called, or if this scanner is closed during stream pipeline execution.

As with the

findWithinHorizon()

methods, this method
might block waiting for additional input, and it might buffer an unbounded amount of
input searching for a match.

**Parameters:**
- pattern

- the pattern to be matched

**Returns:**
- a sequential stream of match results

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if pattern is null
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- For example, the following code will read a file and return a list
of all sequences of characters consisting of seven or more Latin capital
letters:

```java
try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(Path.of("input.txt"))) {
Pattern pat = Pattern.compile("[A-Z]{7,}");
List<String> capWords = sc.findAll(pat)
.map(MatchResult::group)
.collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

---

#### public
Stream
<
MatchResult
> findAll​(
String
patString)

Returns a stream of match results that match the provided pattern string.
The effect is equivalent to the following code:

```java
scanner.findAll(Pattern.compile(patString))
```

**Parameters:**
- patString

- the pattern string

**Returns:**
- a sequential stream of match results

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if patString is null
- IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
- PatternSyntaxException

- if the regular expression's syntax is invalid

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Closeable

,

AutoCloseable

,

Iterator

<

String

>

```java
public final class
Scanner

extends
Object

implements
Iterator
<
String
>,
Closeable
```

A simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and strings using
regular expressions.

A

Scanner

breaks its input into tokens using a
delimiter pattern, which by default matches whitespace. The resulting
tokens may then be converted into values of different types using the
various

next

methods.

For example, this code allows a user to read a number from

System.in

:

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int i = sc.nextInt();
```

As another example, this code allows

long

types to be
assigned from entries in a file

myNumbers

:

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File("myNumbers"));
while (sc.hasNextLong()) {
long aLong = sc.nextLong();
}
```

The scanner can also use delimiters other than whitespace. This
example reads several items in from a string:

```java
String input = "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish";
Scanner s = new Scanner(input).useDelimiter("\\s*fish\\s*");
System.out.println(s.nextInt());
System.out.println(s.nextInt());
System.out.println(s.next());
System.out.println(s.next());
s.close();
```

prints the following output:

```java
1
2
red
blue
```

The same output can be generated with this code, which uses a regular
expression to parse all four tokens at once:

```java
String input = "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish";
Scanner s = new Scanner(input);
s.findInLine("(\\d+) fish (\\d+) fish (\\w+) fish (\\w+)");
MatchResult result = s.match();
for (int i=1; i<=result.groupCount(); i++)
System.out.println(result.group(i));
s.close();
```

The

default whitespace delimiter

used
by a scanner is as recognized by

Character.isWhitespace()

. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the scanner's delimiter to the default
whitespace delimiter regardless of whether it was previously changed.

A scanning operation may block waiting for input.

The

next()

and

hasNext()

methods and their
companion methods (such as

nextInt()

and

hasNextInt()

) first skip any input that matches the delimiter
pattern, and then attempt to return the next token. Both

hasNext()

and

next()

methods may block waiting for further input. Whether a

hasNext()

method blocks has no connection to whether or not its
associated

next()

method will block. The

tokens()

method
may also block waiting for input.

The

findInLine()

,

findWithinHorizon()

,

skip()

, and

findAll()

methods operate independently of the delimiter pattern. These methods will
attempt to match the specified pattern with no regard to delimiters in the
input and thus can be used in special circumstances where delimiters are
not relevant. These methods may block waiting for more input.

When a scanner throws an

InputMismatchException

, the scanner
will not pass the token that caused the exception, so that it may be
retrieved or skipped via some other method.

Depending upon the type of delimiting pattern, empty tokens may be
returned. For example, the pattern

"\\s+"

will return no empty
tokens since it matches multiple instances of the delimiter. The delimiting
pattern

"\\s"

could return empty tokens since it only passes one
space at a time.

A scanner can read text from any object which implements the

Readable

interface. If an invocation of the underlying
readable's

read()

method throws an

IOException

then the scanner assumes that the end of the input
has been reached. The most recent

IOException

thrown by the
underlying readable can be retrieved via the

ioException()

method.

When a

Scanner

is closed, it will close its input source
if the source implements the

Closeable

interface.

A

Scanner

is not safe for multithreaded use without
external synchronization.

Unless otherwise mentioned, passing a

null

parameter into
any method of a

Scanner

will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

A scanner will default to interpreting numbers as decimal unless a
different radix has been set by using the

useRadix(int)

method. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the scanner's radix to

10

regardless of whether it was previously changed.

Localized numbers

An instance of this class is capable of scanning numbers in the standard
formats as well as in the formats of the scanner's locale. A scanner's

initial locale

is the value returned by the

Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category.FORMAT)

method; it may be changed via the

useLocale()

method. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the
scanner's locale to the initial locale regardless of whether it was
previously changed.

The localized formats are defined in terms of the following parameters,
which for a particular locale are taken from that locale's

DecimalFormat

object,

df

, and its and

DecimalFormatSymbols

object,

dfs

.

Number syntax

The strings that can be parsed as numbers by an instance of this class
are specified in terms of the following regular-expression grammar, where
Rmax is the highest digit in the radix being used (for example, Rmax is 9 in base 10).

Whitespace is not significant in the above regular expressions.

System.out.println(s.next());
System.out.println(s.next());
s.close();
```

prints the following output:

```java
1
2
red
blue
```

The same output can be generated with this code, which uses a regular
expression to parse all four tokens at once:

```java
String input = "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish";
Scanner s = new Scanner(input);
s.findInLine("(\\d+) fish (\\d+) fish (\\w+) fish (\\w+)");
MatchResult result = s.match();
for (int i=1; i<=result.groupCount(); i++)
System.out.println(result.group(i));
s.close();

which for a particular locale are taken from that locale's

DecimalFormat

Number syntax

The strings that can be parsed as numbers by an instance of this class
are specified in terms of the following regular-expression grammar, where
Rmax is the highest digit in the radix being used (for example, Rmax is 9 in base 10).

Whitespace is not significant in the above regular expressions.

A

Scanner

breaks its input into tokens using a
delimiter pattern, which by default matches whitespace. The resulting
tokens may then be converted into values of different types using the
various

next

methods.

For example, this code allows a user to read a number from

System.in

:

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int i = sc.nextInt();
```

As another example, this code allows

long

types to be
assigned from entries in a file

myNumbers

:

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File("myNumbers"));
while (sc.hasNextLong()) {
long aLong = sc.nextLong();
}
```

The scanner can also use delimiters other than whitespace. This
example reads several items in from a string:

```java
String input = "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish";
Scanner s = new Scanner(input).useDelimiter("\\s*fish\\s*");
System.out.println(s.nextInt());
System.out.println(s.nextInt());
System.out.println(s.next());
System.out.println(s.next());
s.close();
```

prints the following output:

```java
1
2
red
blue
```

The same output can be generated with this code, which uses a regular
expression to parse all four tokens at once:

```java
String input = "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish";
Scanner s = new Scanner(input);
s.findInLine("(\\d+) fish (\\d+) fish (\\w+) fish (\\w+)");
MatchResult result = s.match();
for (int i=1; i<=result.groupCount(); i++)
System.out.println(result.group(i));
s.close();
```

The

default whitespace delimiter

used
by a scanner is as recognized by

Character.isWhitespace()

. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the scanner's delimiter to the default
whitespace delimiter regardless of whether it was previously changed.

A scanning operation may block waiting for input.

The

next()

and

hasNext()

methods and their
companion methods (such as

nextInt()

and

hasNextInt()

) first skip any input that matches the delimiter
pattern, and then attempt to return the next token. Both

hasNext()

and

next()

methods may block waiting for further input. Whether a

hasNext()

method blocks has no connection to whether or not its
associated

next()

method will block. The

tokens()

method
may also block waiting for input.

The

findInLine()

,

findWithinHorizon()

,

skip()

, and

findAll()

methods operate independently of the delimiter pattern. These methods will
attempt to match the specified pattern with no regard to delimiters in the
input and thus can be used in special circumstances where delimiters are
not relevant. These methods may block waiting for more input.

When a scanner throws an

InputMismatchException

, the scanner
will not pass the token that caused the exception, so that it may be
retrieved or skipped via some other method.

Depending upon the type of delimiting pattern, empty tokens may be
returned. For example, the pattern

"\\s+"

will return no empty
tokens since it matches multiple instances of the delimiter. The delimiting
pattern

"\\s"

could return empty tokens since it only passes one
space at a time.

A scanner can read text from any object which implements the

Readable

interface. If an invocation of the underlying
readable's

read()

method throws an

IOException

then the scanner assumes that the end of the input
has been reached. The most recent

IOException

thrown by the
underlying readable can be retrieved via the

ioException()

method.

When a

Scanner

is closed, it will close its input source
if the source implements the

Closeable

interface.

A

Scanner

is not safe for multithreaded use without
external synchronization.

Unless otherwise mentioned, passing a

null

parameter into
any method of a

Scanner

will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

A scanner will default to interpreting numbers as decimal unless a
different radix has been set by using the

useRadix(int)

method. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the scanner's radix to

10

regardless of whether it was previously changed.

Localized numbers

An instance of this class is capable of scanning numbers in the standard
formats as well as in the formats of the scanner's locale. A scanner's

initial locale

is the value returned by the

Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category.FORMAT)

method; it may be changed via the

useLocale()

method. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the
scanner's locale to the initial locale regardless of whether it was
previously changed.

The localized formats are defined in terms of the following parameters,
which for a particular locale are taken from that locale's

A scanner can read text from any object which implements the

Readable

interface. If an invocation of the underlying
readable's

read()

method throws an

IOException

then the scanner assumes that the end of the input
has been reached. The most recent

IOException

thrown by the
underlying readable can be retrieved via the

ioException()

method.

When a

Scanner

is closed, it will close its input source
if the source implements the

Closeable

interface.

A

Scanner

is not safe for multithreaded use without
external synchronization.

Unless otherwise mentioned, passing a

null

parameter into
any method of a

Scanner

will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

A scanner will default to interpreting numbers as decimal unless a
different radix has been set by using the

useRadix(int)

method. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the scanner's radix to

10

regardless of whether it was previously changed.

Localized numbers

An instance of this class is capable of scanning numbers in the standard
formats as well as in the formats of the scanner's locale. A scanner's

initial locale

is the value returned by the

Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category.FORMAT)

method; it may be changed via the

useLocale()

method. The

reset()

method will reset the value of the
scanner's locale to the initial locale regardless of whether it was
previously changed.

The localized formats are defined in terms of the following parameters,
which for a particular locale are taken from that locale's

DecimalFormat

object,

df

, and its and

DecimalFormatSymbols

object,

dfs

.

Number syntax

The strings that can be parsed as numbers by an instance of this class
are specified in terms of the following regular-expression grammar, where
Rmax is the highest digit in the radix being used (for example, Rmax is 9 in base 10).

Whitespace is not significant in the above regular expressions.

A scanning operation may block waiting for input.

The

next()

and

hasNext()

methods and their
companion methods (such as

nextInt()

and

hasNextInt()

) first skip any input that matches the delimiter
pattern, and then attempt to return the next token. Both

hasNext()

and

next()

methods may block waiting for further input. Whether a

hasNext()

method blocks has no connection to whether or not its
associated

next()

method will block. The

tokens()

method
may also block waiting for input.

The

findInLine()

,

findWithinHorizon()

,

skip()

, and

findAll()

methods operate independently of the delimiter pattern. These methods will
attempt to match the specified pattern with no regard to delimiters in the
input and thus can be used in special circumstances where delimiters are
not relevant. These methods may block waiting for more input.

When a scanner throws an

InputMismatchException

, the scanner
will not pass the token that caused the exception, so that it may be
retrieved or skipped via some other method.

Depending upon the type of delimiting pattern, empty tokens may be
returned. For example, the pattern

"\\s+"

will return no empty
tokens since it matches multiple instances of the delimiter. The delimiting
pattern

"\\s"

could return empty tokens since it only passes one
space at a time.

A scanner can read text from any object which implements the

Readable

interface. If an invocation of the underlying
readable's

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- close

```java
public void close()
```

Closes this scanner.

If this scanner has not yet been closed then if its underlying

readable

also implements the

Closeable

interface then the readable's

close

method
will be invoked. If this scanner is already closed then invoking this
method will have no effect.

Attempting to perform search operations after a scanner has
been closed will result in an

IllegalStateException

.

**Specified by:** close

in interface

AutoCloseable
**Specified by:** close

in interface

Closeable

- ioException

```java
public
IOException
ioException()
```

Returns the

IOException

last thrown by this

Scanner

's underlying

Readable

. This method
returns

null

if no such exception exists.

**Returns:** the last exception thrown by this scanner's readable

- delimiter

```java
public
Pattern
delimiter()
```

Returns the

Pattern

this

Scanner

is currently
using to match delimiters.

**Returns:** this scanner's delimiting pattern.

- useDelimiter

```java
public
Scanner
useDelimiter​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Sets this scanner's delimiting pattern to the specified pattern.

**Parameters:** pattern

- A delimiting pattern
**Returns:** this scanner

- useDelimiter

```java
public
Scanner
useDelimiter​(
String
pattern)
```

Sets this scanner's delimiting pattern to a pattern constructed from
the specified

String

.

An invocation of this method of the form

useDelimiter(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as the
invocation

useDelimiter(Pattern.compile(pattern))

.

Invoking the

reset()

method will set the scanner's delimiter
to the

default

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- A string specifying a delimiting pattern
**Returns:** this scanner

- locale

```java
public
Locale
locale()
```

Returns this scanner's locale.

A scanner's locale affects many elements of its default
primitive matching regular expressions; see

localized numbers

above.

**Returns:** this scanner's locale

- useLocale

```java
public
Scanner
useLocale​(
Locale
locale)
```

Sets this scanner's locale to the specified locale.

A scanner's locale affects many elements of its default
primitive matching regular expressions; see

localized numbers

above.

Invoking the

reset()

method will set the scanner's locale to
the

initial locale

.

**Parameters:** locale

- A string specifying the locale to use
**Returns:** this scanner

- radix

```java
public int radix()
```

Returns this scanner's default radix.

A scanner's radix affects elements of its default
number matching regular expressions; see

localized numbers

above.

**Returns:** the default radix of this scanner

- useRadix

```java
public
Scanner
useRadix​(int radix)
```

Sets this scanner's default radix to the specified radix.

A scanner's radix affects elements of its default
number matching regular expressions; see

localized numbers

above.

If the radix is less than

Character.MIN_RADIX

or greater than

Character.MAX_RADIX

, then an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

Invoking the

reset()

method will set the scanner's radix to

10

.

**Parameters:** radix

- The radix to use when scanning numbers
**Returns:** this scanner
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if radix is out of range

- match

```java
public
MatchResult
match()
```

Returns the match result of the last scanning operation performed
by this scanner. This method throws

IllegalStateException

if no match has been performed, or if the last match was
not successful.

The various

next

methods of

Scanner

make a match result available if they complete without throwing an
exception. For instance, after an invocation of the

nextInt()

method that returned an int, this method returns a

MatchResult

for the search of the

Integer

regular expression
defined above. Similarly the

findInLine()

,

findWithinHorizon()

, and

skip()

methods will make a match available if they succeed.

**Returns:** a match result for the last match operation
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If no match result is available

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the string representation of this

Scanner

. The
string representation of a

Scanner

contains information

- hasNext

```java
public boolean hasNext​(
String
pattern)
```

Returns true if the next token matches the pattern constructed from the
specified string. The scanner does not advance past any input.

An invocation of this method of the form

hasNext(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

hasNext(Pattern.compile(pattern))

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to scan
**Returns:** true if and only if this scanner has another token matching
the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- next

```java
public
String
next​(
String
pattern)
```

Returns the next token if it matches the pattern constructed from the
specified string. If the match is successful, the scanner advances
past the input that matched the pattern.

An invocation of this method of the form

next(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

next(Pattern.compile(pattern))

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to scan
**Returns:** the next token
**Throws:** NoSuchElementException

- if no such tokens are available
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- hasNext

```java
public boolean hasNext​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Returns true if the next complete token matches the specified pattern.
A complete token is prefixed and postfixed by input that matches
the delimiter pattern. This method may block while waiting for input.
The scanner does not advance past any input.

**Parameters:** pattern

- the pattern to scan for
**Returns:** true if and only if this scanner has another token matching
the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- next

```java
public
String
next​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Returns the next token if it matches the specified pattern. This
method may block while waiting for input to scan, even if a previous
invocation of

hasNext(Pattern)

returned

true

.
If the match is successful, the scanner advances past the input that
matched the pattern.

**Parameters:** pattern

- the pattern to scan for
**Returns:** the next token
**Throws:** NoSuchElementException

- if no more tokens are available
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- hasNextLine

```java
public boolean hasNextLine()
```

Returns true if there is another line in the input of this scanner.
This method may block while waiting for input. The scanner does not
advance past any input.

**Returns:** true if and only if this scanner has another line of input
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- nextLine

```java
public
String
nextLine()
```

Advances this scanner past the current line and returns the input
that was skipped.

This method returns the rest of the current line, excluding any line
separator at the end. The position is set to the beginning of the next
line.

Since this method continues to search through the input looking
for a line separator, it may buffer all of the input searching for
the line to skip if no line separators are present.

**Returns:** the line that was skipped
**Throws:** NoSuchElementException

- if no line was found
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- findInLine

```java
public
String
findInLine​(
String
pattern)
```

Attempts to find the next occurrence of a pattern constructed from the
specified string, ignoring delimiters.

An invocation of this method of the form

findInLine(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

findInLine(Pattern.compile(pattern))

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to search for
**Returns:** the text that matched the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- findInLine

```java
public
String
findInLine​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Attempts to find the next occurrence of the specified pattern ignoring
delimiters. If the pattern is found before the next line separator, the
scanner advances past the input that matched and returns the string that
matched the pattern.
If no such pattern is detected in the input up to the next line
separator, then

null

is returned and the scanner's
position is unchanged. This method may block waiting for input that
matches the pattern.

Since this method continues to search through the input looking
for the specified pattern, it may buffer all of the input searching for
the desired token if no line separators are present.

**Parameters:** pattern

- the pattern to scan for
**Returns:** the text that matched the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- findWithinHorizon

```java
public
String
findWithinHorizon​(
String
pattern,
int horizon)
```

Attempts to find the next occurrence of a pattern constructed from the
specified string, ignoring delimiters.

An invocation of this method of the form

findWithinHorizon(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as
the invocation

findWithinHorizon(Pattern.compile(pattern), horizon)

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to search for
**Parameters:** horizon

- the search horizon
**Returns:** the text that matched the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if horizon is negative

- findWithinHorizon

```java
public
String
findWithinHorizon​(
Pattern
pattern,
int horizon)
```

Attempts to find the next occurrence of the specified pattern.

This method searches through the input up to the specified
search horizon, ignoring delimiters. If the pattern is found the
scanner advances past the input that matched and returns the string
that matched the pattern. If no such pattern is detected then the
null is returned and the scanner's position remains unchanged. This
method may block waiting for input that matches the pattern.

A scanner will never search more than

horizon

code
points beyond its current position. Note that a match may be clipped
by the horizon; that is, an arbitrary match result may have been
different if the horizon had been larger. The scanner treats the
horizon as a transparent, non-anchoring bound (see

Matcher.useTransparentBounds(boolean)

and

Matcher.useAnchoringBounds(boolean)

).

If horizon is

0

, then the horizon is ignored and
this method continues to search through the input looking for the
specified pattern without bound. In this case it may buffer all of
the input searching for the pattern.

If horizon is negative, then an IllegalArgumentException is
thrown.

**Parameters:** pattern

- the pattern to scan for
**Parameters:** horizon

- the search horizon
**Returns:** the text that matched the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if horizon is negative

- skip

```java
public
Scanner
skip​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Skips input that matches the specified pattern, ignoring delimiters.
This method will skip input if an anchored match of the specified
pattern succeeds.

If a match to the specified pattern is not found at the
current position, then no input is skipped and a

NoSuchElementException

is thrown.

Since this method seeks to match the specified pattern starting at
the scanner's current position, patterns that can match a lot of
input (".*", for example) may cause the scanner to buffer a large
amount of input.

Note that it is possible to skip something without risking a

NoSuchElementException

by using a pattern that can
match nothing, e.g.,

sc.skip("[ \t]*")

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to skip over
**Returns:** this scanner
**Throws:** NoSuchElementException

- if the specified pattern is not found

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to skip over
**Returns:** this scanner
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- hasNextBoolean

```java
public boolean hasNextBoolean()

The resulting stream is sequential and ordered. All stream elements are
non-null.

Scanning starts upon initiation of the terminal stream operation, using the
current state of this scanner. Subsequent calls to any methods on this scanner
other than

close()

and

ioException()

may return undefined results
or may cause undefined effects on the returned stream. The returned stream's source

Spliterator

is

fail-fast

and will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if any such calls are detected
during stream pipeline execution.

After stream pipeline execution completes, this scanner is left in an indeterminate
state and cannot be reused.

If this scanner contains a resource that must be released, this scanner
should be closed, either by calling its

close()

method, or by
closing the returned stream. Closing the stream will close the underlying scanner.

IllegalStateException

is thrown if the scanner has been closed when this
method is called, or if this scanner is closed during stream pipeline execution.

This method might block waiting for more input.

**API Note:** For example, the following code will create a list of
comma-delimited tokens from a string:

```java
List<String> result = new Scanner("abc,def,,ghi")
.useDelimiter(",")
.tokens()
.collect(Collectors.toList());
```

The resulting list would contain

"abc"

,

"def"

,
the empty string, and

"ghi"

.
**Returns:** a sequential stream of token strings
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**Since:** 9

- findAll

```java
public
Stream
<
MatchResult
> findAll​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Returns a stream of match results from this scanner. The stream
contains the same results in the same order that would be returned by
calling

findWithinHorizon(pattern, 0)

and then

match()

successively as long as

findWithinHorizon()

finds matches.

The resulting stream is sequential and ordered. All stream elements are
non-null.

Scanning starts upon initiation of the terminal stream operation, using the
current state of this scanner. Subsequent calls to any methods on this scanner
other than

close()

and

ioException()

may return undefined results
or may cause undefined effects on the returned stream. The returned stream's source

Spliterator

is

fail-fast

and will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if any such calls are detected
during stream pipeline execution.

After stream pipeline execution completes, this scanner is left in an indeterminate
state and cannot be reused.

If this scanner contains a resource that must be released, this scanner
should be closed, either by calling its

close()

method, or by
closing the returned stream. Closing the stream will close the underlying scanner.

IllegalStateException

is thrown if the scanner has been closed when this
method is called, or if this scanner is closed during stream pipeline execution.

As with the

findWithinHorizon()

methods, this method
might block waiting for additional input, and it might buffer an unbounded amount of
input searching for a match.

**API Note:** For example, the following code will read a file and return a list
of all sequences of characters consisting of seven or more Latin capital
letters:

```java
try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(Path.of("input.txt"))) {
Pattern pat = Pattern.compile("[A-Z]{7,}");
List<String> capWords = sc.findAll(pat)
.map(MatchResult::group)
.collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```
**Parameters:** pattern

- the pattern to be matched
**Returns:** a sequential stream of match results
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if pattern is null
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**Since:** 9

- findAll

```java
public
Stream
<
MatchResult
> findAll​(
String
patString)
```

Returns a stream of match results that match the provided pattern string.
The effect is equivalent to the following code:

```java
scanner.findAll(Pattern.compile(patString))
```

**Parameters:** patString

- the pattern string
**Returns:** a sequential stream of match results
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if patString is null
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**Throws:** PatternSyntaxException

- if the regular expression's syntax is invalid
**Since:** 9

```java
public
MatchResult
match()
```

Returns the match result of the last scanning operation performed
by this scanner. This method throws

IllegalStateException

if no match has been performed, or if the last match was
not successful.

The various

next

methods of

Scanner

make a match result available if they complete without throwing an
exception. For instance, after an invocation of the

nextInt()

method that returned an int, this method returns a

MatchResult

for the search of the

Integer

regular expression
defined above. Similarly the

findInLine()

,

findWithinHorizon()

, and

skip()

methods will make a match available if they succeed.

**Returns:** a match result for the last match operation
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If no match result is available

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns the string representation of this

**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**See Also:** Iterator

- next

```java
public
String
next()
```

Finds and returns the next complete token from this scanner.
A complete token is preceded and followed by input that matches
the delimiter pattern. This method may block while waiting for input
to scan, even if a previous invocation of

hasNext()

returned

true

.

**Specified by:** next

in interface

Iterator

<

String

>
**Returns:** the next token
**Throws:** NoSuchElementException

- if no more tokens are available
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**See Also:** Iterator

- remove

```java
public void remove()
```

The remove operation is not supported by this implementation of

Iterator

.

**Specified by:** remove

in interface

**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this method is invoked.
**See Also:** Iterator

- hasNext

```java
public boolean hasNext​(
String
pattern)
```

Returns true if the next token matches the pattern constructed from the
specified string. The scanner does not advance past any input.

An invocation of this method of the form

hasNext(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

hasNext(Pattern.compile(pattern))

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to scan
**Returns:** true if and only if this scanner has another token matching
the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- next

```java
public
String
next​(
String
pattern)
```

Returns the next token if it matches the pattern constructed from the
specified string. If the match is successful, the scanner advances
past the input that matched the pattern.

An invocation of this method of the form

next(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

next(Pattern.compile(pattern))

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to scan
**Returns:** the next token
**Throws:** NoSuchElementException

- if no such tokens are available
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- hasNext

```java
public boolean hasNext​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Returns true if the next complete token matches the specified pattern.
A complete token is prefixed and postfixed by input that matches
the delimiter pattern. This method may block while waiting for input.
The scanner does not advance past any input.

**Parameters:** pattern

- the pattern to scan for
**Returns:** true if and only if this scanner has another token matching
the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- next

```java
public
String
next​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Returns the next token if it matches the specified pattern. This
method may block while waiting for input to scan, even if a previous
invocation of

hasNext(Pattern)

returned

true

.
If the match is successful, the scanner advances past the input that
matched the pattern.

**Parameters:** pattern

- the pattern to scan for
**Returns:** the next token
**Throws:** NoSuchElementException

- if no more tokens are available
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- hasNextLine

```java
public boolean hasNextLine()
```

Returns true if there is another line in the input of this scanner.
This method may block while waiting for input. The scanner does not
advance past any input.

**Returns:** true if and only if this scanner has another line of input
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- nextLine

```java
public
String
nextLine()
```

Advances this scanner past the current line and returns the input
that was skipped.

This method returns the rest of the current line, excluding any line
separator at the end. The position is set to the beginning of the next
line.

Since this method continues to search through the input looking
for a line separator, it may buffer all of the input searching for
the line to skip if no line separators are present.

**Returns:** the line that was skipped
**Throws:** NoSuchElementException

- if no line was found
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- findInLine

```java
public
String
findInLine​(
String
pattern)
```

Attempts to find the next occurrence of a pattern constructed from the
specified string, ignoring delimiters.

An invocation of this method of the form

findInLine(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

findInLine(Pattern.compile(pattern))

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to search for
**Returns:** the text that matched the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- findInLine

```java
public
String
findInLine​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Attempts to find the next occurrence of the specified pattern ignoring
delimiters. If the pattern is found before the next line separator, the
scanner advances past the input that matched and returns the string that
matched the pattern.
If no such pattern is detected in the input up to the next line
separator, then

null

is returned and the scanner's
position is unchanged. This method may block waiting for input that
matches the pattern.

Since this method continues to search through the input looking
for the specified pattern, it may buffer all of the input searching for
the desired token if no line separators are present.

**Parameters:** pattern

- the pattern to scan for
**Returns:** the text that matched the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed

- findWithinHorizon

```java
public
String
findWithinHorizon​(
String
pattern,
int horizon)
```

Attempts to find the next occurrence of a pattern constructed from the
specified string, ignoring delimiters.

An invocation of this method of the form

findWithinHorizon(pattern)

behaves in exactly the same way as
the invocation

findWithinHorizon(Pattern.compile(pattern), horizon)

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to search for
**Parameters:** horizon

- the search horizon
**Returns:** the text that matched the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if horizon is negative

- findWithinHorizon

```java
public
String
findWithinHorizon​(
Pattern
pattern,
int horizon)
```

Attempts to find the next occurrence of the specified pattern.

This method searches through the input up to the specified
search horizon, ignoring delimiters. If the pattern is found the
scanner advances past the input that matched and returns the string
that matched the pattern. If no such pattern is detected then the
null is returned and the scanner's position remains unchanged. This
method may block waiting for input that matches the pattern.

A scanner will never search more than

horizon

code
points beyond its current position. Note that a match may be clipped
by the horizon; that is, an arbitrary match result may have been
different if the horizon had been larger. The scanner treats the
horizon as a transparent, non-anchoring bound (see

Matcher.useTransparentBounds(boolean)

and

Matcher.useAnchoringBounds(boolean)

).

If horizon is

0

, then the horizon is ignored and
this method continues to search through the input looking for the
specified pattern without bound. In this case it may buffer all of
the input searching for the pattern.

If horizon is negative, then an IllegalArgumentException is
thrown.

**Parameters:** pattern

- the pattern to scan for
**Parameters:** horizon

- the search horizon
**Returns:** the text that matched the specified pattern
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if horizon is negative

- skip

```java
public
Scanner
skip​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Skips input that matches the specified pattern, ignoring delimiters.
This method will skip input if an anchored match of the specified
pattern succeeds.

If a match to the specified pattern is not found at the
current position, then no input is skipped and a

NoSuchElementException

is thrown.

Since this method seeks to match the specified pattern starting at
the scanner's current position, patterns that can match a lot of
input (".*", for example) may cause the scanner to buffer a large
amount of input.

Note that it is possible to skip something without risking a

NoSuchElementException

by using a pattern that can
match nothing, e.g.,

sc.skip("[ \t]*")

.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a string specifying the pattern to skip over
**Returns:** this scanner
**Throws:** NoSuchElementException

- if the specified pattern is not found

```

Resets this scanner.

Resetting a scanner discards all of its explicit state
information which may have been changed by invocations of

useDelimiter()

,

useLocale()

, or

useRadix()

.

An invocation of this method of the form

scanner.reset()

behaves in exactly the same way as the
invocation

```java
scanner.useDelimiter("\\p{javaWhitespace}+")
.useLocale(Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category.FORMAT))
.useRadix(10);
```

**Returns:** this scanner
**Since:** 1.6

- tokens

```java
public
Stream
<
String
> tokens()
```

Returns a stream of delimiter-separated tokens from this scanner. The
stream contains the same tokens that would be returned, starting from
this scanner's current state, by calling the

next()

method
repeatedly until the

hasNext()

method returns false.

The resulting stream is sequential and ordered. All stream elements are
non-null.

Scanning starts upon initiation of the terminal stream operation, using the
current state of this scanner. Subsequent calls to any methods on this scanner
other than

close()

and

ioException()

may return undefined results
or may cause undefined effects on the returned stream. The returned stream's source

Spliterator

is

fail-fast

and will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if any such calls are detected
during stream pipeline execution.

After stream pipeline execution completes, this scanner is left in an indeterminate
state and cannot be reused.

If this scanner contains a resource that must be released, this scanner
should be closed, either by calling its

close()

method, or by
closing the returned stream. Closing the stream will close the underlying scanner.

IllegalStateException

is thrown if the scanner has been closed when this
method is called, or if this scanner is closed during stream pipeline execution.

This method might block waiting for more input.

**API Note:** For example, the following code will create a list of
comma-delimited tokens from a string:

```java
List<String> result = new Scanner("abc,def,,ghi")
.useDelimiter(",")
.tokens()
.collect(Collectors.toList());
```

The resulting list would contain

"abc"

,

"def"

,
the empty string, and

"ghi"

.
**Returns:** a sequential stream of token strings
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**Since:** 9

- findAll

```java
public
Stream
<
MatchResult
> findAll​(
Pattern
pattern)
```

Returns a stream of match results from this scanner. The stream
contains the same results in the same order that would be returned by
calling

findWithinHorizon(pattern, 0)

and then

match()

successively as long as

findWithinHorizon()

finds matches.

The resulting stream is sequential and ordered. All stream elements are
non-null.

Scanning starts upon initiation of the terminal stream operation, using the
current state of this scanner. Subsequent calls to any methods on this scanner
other than

close()

and

ioException()

may return undefined results
or may cause undefined effects on the returned stream. The returned stream's source

Spliterator

is

fail-fast

and will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if any such calls are detected
during stream pipeline execution.

After stream pipeline execution completes, this scanner is left in an indeterminate
state and cannot be reused.

If this scanner contains a resource that must be released, this scanner
should be closed, either by calling its

close()

method, or by
closing the returned stream. Closing the stream will close the underlying scanner.

IllegalStateException

is thrown if the scanner has been closed when this
method is called, or if this scanner is closed during stream pipeline execution.

As with the

findWithinHorizon()

methods, this method
might block waiting for additional input, and it might buffer an unbounded amount of
input searching for a match.

**API Note:** For example, the following code will read a file and return a list
of all sequences of characters consisting of seven or more Latin capital
letters:

```java
try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(Path.of("input.txt"))) {
Pattern pat = Pattern.compile("[A-Z]{7,}");
List<String> capWords = sc.findAll(pat)
.map(MatchResult::group)
.collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```
**Parameters:** pattern

- the pattern to be matched
**Returns:** a sequential stream of match results
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if pattern is null
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**Since:** 9

- findAll

```java
public
Stream
<
MatchResult
> findAll​(
String
patString)
```

Returns a stream of match results that match the provided pattern string.
The effect is equivalent to the following code:

```java
scanner.findAll(Pattern.compile(patString))
```

**Parameters:** patString

- the pattern string
**Returns:** a sequential stream of match results
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if patString is null
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if this scanner is closed
**Throws:** PatternSyntaxException

- if the regular expression's syntax is invalid

tokens

```java
public
Stream
<
String
> tokens()
```

Returns a stream of delimiter-separated tokens from this scanner. The
stream contains the same tokens that would be returned, starting from
this scanner's current state, by calling the

next()

method
repeatedly until the

hasNext()

method returns false.

The resulting stream is sequential and ordered. All stream elements are
non-null.

Scanning starts upon initiation of the terminal stream operation, using the
current state of this scanner. Subsequent calls to any methods on this scanner
other than

close()

and

ioException()

may return undefined results
or may cause undefined effects on the returned stream. The returned stream's source

Spliterator

is

fail-fast

and will, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if any such calls are detected
during stream pipeline execution.

After stream pipeline execution completes, this scanner is left in an indeterminate
state and cannot be reused.

If this scanner contains a resource that must be released, this scanner
should be closed, either by calling its

close()

method, or by
closing the returned stream. Closing the stream will close the underlying scanner.

IllegalStateException

is thrown if the scanner has been closed when this
method is called, or if this scanner is closed during stream pipeline execution.

This method might block waiting for more input.

**API Note:** For example, the following code will create a list of
comma-delimited tokens from a string:

```java
List<String> result = new Scanner("abc,def,,ghi")
.useDelimiter(",")
.tokens()
.collect(Collectors.toList());
```

The resulting list would contain

"abc"

,

"def"

,
the empty string, and

"ghi"

.
