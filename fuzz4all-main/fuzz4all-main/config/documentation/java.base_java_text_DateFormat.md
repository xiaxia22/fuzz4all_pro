# Class DateFormat

**Source:** `java.base\java\text\DateFormat.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
DateFormat

extends
Format
```

DateFormat

is an abstract class for date/time formatting subclasses which
formats and parses dates or time in a language-independent manner.
The date/time formatting subclass, such as

SimpleDateFormat

, allows for
formatting (i.e., date → text), parsing (text → date), and
normalization. The date is represented as a

Date

object or
as the milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.

DateFormat

provides many class methods for obtaining default date/time
formatters based on the default or a given locale and a number of formatting
styles. The formatting styles include

FULL

,

LONG

,

MEDIUM

, and

SHORT

. More
detail and examples of using these styles are provided in the method
descriptions.

DateFormat

helps you to format and parse dates for any locale.
Your code can be completely independent of the locale conventions for
months, days of the week, or even the calendar format: lunar vs. solar.

To format a date for the current Locale, use one of the
static factory methods:

```java
myString = DateFormat.getDateInstance().format(myDate);
```

If you are formatting multiple dates, it is
more efficient to get the format and use it multiple times so that
the system doesn't have to fetch the information about the local
language and country conventions multiple times.

```java
DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance();
for (int i = 0; i < myDate.length; ++i) {
output.println(df.format(myDate[i]) + "; ");
}
```

To format a date for a different Locale, specify it in the
call to

getDateInstance()

.

```java
DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG, Locale.FRANCE);
```

If the specified locale contains "ca" (calendar), "rg" (region override),
and/or "tz" (timezone)

Unicode
extensions

, the calendar, the country and/or the time zone for formatting
are overridden. If both "ca" and "rg" are specified, the calendar from the "ca"
extension supersedes the implicit one from the "rg" extension.

You can use a DateFormat to parse also.

```java
myDate = df.parse(myString);
```

Use

getDateInstance

to get the normal date format for that country.
There are other static factory methods available.
Use

getTimeInstance

to get the time format for that country.
Use

getDateTimeInstance

to get a date and time format. You can pass in
different options to these factory methods to control the length of the
result; from

SHORT

to

MEDIUM

to

LONG

to

FULL

. The exact result depends
on the locale, but generally:

- SHORT

is completely numeric, such as

12.13.52

or

3:30pm

MEDIUM

is longer, such as

Jan 12, 1952

LONG

is longer, such as

January 12, 1952

or

3:30:32pm

FULL

is pretty completely specified, such as

Tuesday, April 12, 1952 AD or 3:30:42pm PST

.

You can also set the time zone on the format if you wish.
If you want even more control over the format or parsing,
(or want to give your users more control),
you can try casting the

DateFormat

you get from the factory methods
to a

SimpleDateFormat

. This will work for the majority
of countries; just remember to put it in a

try

block in case you
encounter an unusual one.

You can also use forms of the parse and format methods with

ParsePosition

and

FieldPosition

to
allow you to

- progressively parse through pieces of a string.

align any particular field, or find out where it is for selection
on the screen.

Synchronization

Date formats are not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

---

#### public final
String
format​(
Date
date)

Formats a

Date

into a date-time string.

**Parameters:**
- date

- the time value to be formatted into a date-time string.

**Returns:**
- the formatted date-time string.

---

#### public
Date
parse​(
String
source)
throws
ParseException

Parses text from the beginning of the given string to produce a date.
The method may not use the entire text of the given string.

See the

parse(String, ParsePosition)

method for more information
on date parsing.

**Parameters:**
- source

- A

String

whose beginning should be parsed.

**Returns:**
- A

Date

parsed from the string.

**Throws:**
- ParseException

- if the beginning of the specified string
cannot be parsed.

---

#### public abstract
Date
parse​(
String
source,

ParsePosition
pos)

Parse a date/time string according to the given parse position. For
example, a time text

"07/10/96 4:5 PM, PDT"

will be parsed into a

Date

that is equivalent to

Date(837039900000L)

.

By default, parsing is lenient: If the input is not in the form used
by this object's format method but can still be parsed as a date, then
the parse succeeds. Clients may insist on strict adherence to the
format by calling

setLenient(false)

.

This parsing operation uses the

calendar

to produce
a

Date

. As a result, the

calendar

's date-time
fields and the

TimeZone

value may have been
overwritten, depending on subclass implementations. Any

TimeZone

value that has previously been set by a call to

setTimeZone

may need
to be restored for further operations.

**Parameters:**
- source

- The date/time string to be parsed
- pos

- On input, the position at which to start parsing; on
output, the position at which parsing terminated, or the
start position if the parse failed.

**Returns:**
- A

Date

, or

null

if the input could not be parsed

---

#### public
Object
parseObject​(
String
source,

ParsePosition
pos)

Parses text from a string to produce a

Date

.

The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by

pos

.
If parsing succeeds, then the index of

pos

is updated
to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
date is returned. The updated

pos

can be used to
indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
If an error occurs, then the index of

pos

is not
changed, the error index of

pos

is set to the index of
the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

See the

parse(String, ParsePosition)

method for more information
on date parsing.

**Specified by:**
- parseObject

in class

Format

**Parameters:**
- source

- A

String

, part of which should be parsed.
- pos

- A

ParsePosition

object with index and error
index information as described above.

**Returns:**
- A

Date

parsed from the string. In case of
error, returns null.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

source

or

pos

is null.

DateFormat

is an abstract class for date/time formatting subclasses which
formats and parses dates or time in a language-independent manner.
The date/time formatting subclass, such as

SimpleDateFormat

, allows for
formatting (i.e., date → text), parsing (text → date), and
normalization. The date is represented as a

Date

object or
as the milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.

DateFormat

provides many class methods for obtaining default date/time
formatters based on the default or a given locale and a number of formatting
styles. The formatting styles include

FULL

,

LONG

,

MEDIUM

, and

SHORT

. More
detail and examples of using these styles are provided in the method
descriptions.

DateFormat

helps you to format and parse dates for any locale.
Your code can be completely independent of the locale conventions for
months, days of the week, or even the calendar format: lunar vs. solar.

To format a date for the current Locale, use one of the
static factory methods:

```java
myString = DateFormat.getDateInstance().format(myDate);
```

If you are formatting multiple dates, it is
more efficient to get the format and use it multiple times so that
the system doesn't have to fetch the information about the local
language and country conventions multiple times.

```java
DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance();
for (int i = 0; i < myDate.length; ++i) {
output.println(df.format(myDate[i]) + "; ");
}
```

To format a date for a different Locale, specify it in the
call to

getDateInstance()

.

```java
DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG, Locale.FRANCE);
```

If the specified locale contains "ca" (calendar), "rg" (region override),
and/or "tz" (timezone)

Unicode
extensions

, the calendar, the country and/or the time zone for formatting
are overridden. If both "ca" and "rg" are specified, the calendar from the "ca"
extension supersedes the implicit one from the "rg" extension.

You can use a DateFormat to parse also.

```java
myDate = df.parse(myString);
```

Use

getDateInstance

to get the normal date format for that country.
There are other static factory methods available.
Use

getTimeInstance

to get the time format for that country.
Use

getDateTimeInstance

to get a date and time format. You can pass in
different options to these factory methods to control the length of the
result; from

SHORT

to

MEDIUM

to

LONG

to

FULL

. The exact result depends
on the locale, but generally:

- SHORT

is completely numeric, such as

12.13.52

or

3:30pm

MEDIUM

is longer, such as

Jan 12, 1952

LONG

is longer, such as

January 12, 1952

or

3:30:32pm

FULL

is pretty completely specified, such as

Tuesday, April 12, 1952 AD or 3:30:42pm PST

.

You can also set the time zone on the format if you wish.
If you want even more control over the format or parsing,
(or want to give your users more control),
you can try casting the

DateFormat

you get from the factory methods
to a

SimpleDateFormat

. This will work for the majority
of countries; just remember to put it in a

try

block in case you
encounter an unusual one.

You can also use forms of the parse and format methods with

ParsePosition

and

FieldPosition

to
allow you to

- progressively parse through pieces of a string.

align any particular field, or find out where it is for selection
on the screen.

Synchronization

Date formats are not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

**Implementation Requirements:** - The

format(Date, StringBuffer, FieldPosition)

and

parse(String, ParsePosition)

methods may throw

NullPointerException

, if any of their parameter is

null

.
The subclass may provide its own implementation and specification about

NullPointerException

.
- The

setCalendar(Calendar)

,

setNumberFormat(NumberFormat)

and

setTimeZone(TimeZone)

methods
do not throw

NullPointerException

when their parameter is

null

, but any subsequent operations on the same instance may throw

NullPointerException

.
- The

getCalendar()

,

getNumberFormat()

and

getTimeZone()

methods may return

null

, if the respective
values of this instance is set to

null

through the corresponding
setter methods. For Example:

getTimeZone()

may return

null

,
if the

TimeZone

value of this instance is set as

setTimeZone(null)

.

is an abstract class for date/time formatting subclasses which
formats and parses dates or time in a language-independent manner.
The date/time formatting subclass, such as

SimpleDateFormat

, allows for
formatting (i.e., date → text), parsing (text → date), and
normalization. The date is represented as a

Date

object or
as the milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.

DateFormat

provides many class methods for obtaining default date/time
formatters based on the default or a given locale and a number of formatting
styles. The formatting styles include

FULL

,

LONG

,

MEDIUM

, and

SHORT

. More
detail and examples of using these styles are provided in the method
descriptions.

DateFormat

helps you to format and parse dates for any locale.
Your code can be completely independent of the locale conventions for
months, days of the week, or even the calendar format: lunar vs. solar.

To format a date for the current Locale, use one of the
static factory methods:

```java
myString = DateFormat.getDateInstance().format(myDate);
```

If you are formatting multiple dates, it is
more efficient to get the format and use it multiple times so that
the system doesn't have to fetch the information about the local
language and country conventions multiple times.

```java
DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance();
for (int i = 0; i < myDate.length; ++i) {
output.println(df.format(myDate[i]) + "; ");
}
```

To format a date for a different Locale, specify it in the
call to

getDateInstance()

.

```java
DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG, Locale.FRANCE);
```

If the specified locale contains "ca" (calendar), "rg" (region override),
and/or "tz" (timezone)

Unicode
extensions

, the calendar, the country and/or the time zone for formatting
are overridden. If both "ca" and "rg" are specified, the calendar from the "ca"
extension supersedes the implicit one from the "rg" extension.

You can use a DateFormat to parse also.

```java
myDate = df.parse(myString);
```

Use

getDateInstance

to get the normal date format for that country.
There are other static factory methods available.
Use

getTimeInstance

to get the time format for that country.
Use

getDateTimeInstance

to get a date and time format. You can pass in
different options to these factory methods to control the length of the
result; from

SHORT

to

MEDIUM

to

LONG

to

FULL

. The exact result depends
on the locale, but generally:

- SHORT

is completely numeric, such as

12.13.52

or

3:30pm

MEDIUM

is longer, such as

Jan 12, 1952

LONG

is longer, such as

January 12, 1952

or

3:30:32pm

FULL

is pretty completely specified, such as

Tuesday, April 12, 1952 AD or 3:30:42pm PST

.

You can also set the time zone on the format if you wish.
If you want even more control over the format or parsing,
(or want to give your users more control),
you can try casting the

DateFormat

you get from the factory methods
to a

SimpleDateFormat

. This will work for the majority
of countries; just remember to put it in a

try

block in case you
encounter an unusual one.

You can also use forms of the parse and format methods with

ParsePosition

and

FieldPosition

to
allow you to

- progressively parse through pieces of a string.

align any particular field, or find out where it is for selection
on the screen.

Synchronization

Date formats are not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

```java
public final
StringBuffer
format​(
Object
obj,

StringBuffer
toAppendTo,

FieldPosition
fieldPosition)
```

Formats the given

Object

into a date-time string. The formatted
string is appended to the given

StringBuffer

.

**Specified by:** format

in class

Format
**Parameters:** obj

- Must be a

Date

or a

Number

representing a
millisecond offset from the

Epoch

.
**Parameters:** toAppendTo

- The string buffer for the returning date-time string.
**Parameters:** fieldPosition

- keeps track on the position of the field within
the returned string. For example, given a date-time text

"1996.07.10 AD at 15:08:56 PDT"

, if the given

fieldPosition

is

YEAR_FIELD

, the begin index and end index of

fieldPosition

will be set to 0 and 4, respectively.
Notice that if the same date-time field appears more than once in a
pattern, the

fieldPosition

will be set for the first occurrence
of that date-time field. For instance, formatting a

Date

to the
date-time string

"1 PM PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)"

using the
pattern

"h a z (zzzz)"

and the alignment field

TIMEZONE_FIELD

, the begin index and end index of

fieldPosition

will be set to 5 and 8, respectively, for the
first occurrence of the timezone pattern character

'z'

.
**Returns:** the string buffer passed in as

toAppendTo

,
with formatted text appended.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

Format

cannot format
the given

obj

.
**See Also:** Format

- format

```java
public abstract
StringBuffer
format​(
Date
date,

StringBuffer
toAppendTo,

FieldPosition
fieldPosition)
```

Formats a

Date

into a date-time string. The formatted
string is appended to the given

StringBuffer

.

**Parameters:** date

- a Date to be formatted into a date-time string.
**Parameters:** toAppendTo

- the string buffer for the returning date-time string.
**Parameters:** fieldPosition

- keeps track on the position of the field within
the returned string. For example, given a date-time text

"1996.07.10 AD at 15:08:56 PDT"

, if the given

fieldPosition

is

YEAR_FIELD

, the begin index and end index of

fieldPosition

will be set to 0 and 4, respectively.
Notice that if the same date-time field appears more than once in a
pattern, the

fieldPosition

will be set for the first occurrence
of that date-time field. For instance, formatting a

Date

to the
date-time string

"1 PM PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)"

using the
pattern

"h a z (zzzz)"

and the alignment field

TIMEZONE_FIELD

, the begin index and end index of

fieldPosition

will be set to 5 and 8, respectively, for the
first occurrence of the timezone pattern character

'z'

.
**Returns:** the string buffer passed in as

toAppendTo

, with formatted
text appended.

- format

```java
public final
String
format​(
Date
date)
```

Formats a

Date

into a date-time string.

**Parameters:** date

- the time value to be formatted into a date-time string.
**Returns:** the formatted date-time string.

- parse

```java
public
Date
parse​(
String
source)
throws
ParseException
```

Parses text from the beginning of the given string to produce a date.
The method may not use the entire text of the given string.

See the

parse(String, ParsePosition)

method for more information
on date parsing.

**Parameters:** source

- A

String

whose beginning should be parsed.
**Returns:** A

Date

parsed from the string.
**Throws:** ParseException

- if the beginning of the specified string
cannot be parsed.

- parse

```java
public abstract
Date
parse​(
String
source,

ParsePosition
pos)
```

Parse a date/time string according to the given parse position. For
example, a time text

"07/10/96 4:5 PM, PDT"

will be parsed into a

Date

that is equivalent to

Date(837039900000L)

.

By default, parsing is lenient: If the input is not in the form used
by this object's format method but can still be parsed as a date, then
the parse succeeds. Clients may insist on strict adherence to the
format by calling

setLenient(false)

.

This parsing operation uses the

calendar

to produce
a

Date

. As a result, the

calendar

's date-time
fields and the

TimeZone

value may have been
overwritten, depending on subclass implementations. Any

TimeZone

value that has previously been set by a call to

setTimeZone

may need
to be restored for further operations.

**Parameters:** source

- The date/time string to be parsed
**Parameters:** pos

- On input, the position at which to start parsing; on
output, the position at which parsing terminated, or the
start position if the parse failed.
**Returns:** A

Date

, or

null

if the input could not be parsed

- parseObject

```java
public
Object
parseObject​(
String
source,

ParsePosition
pos)
```

Parses text from a string to produce a

Date

.

The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by

pos

.
If parsing succeeds, then the index of

pos

is updated
to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
date is returned. The updated

pos

can be used to
indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
If an error occurs, then the index of

pos

is not
changed, the error index of

pos

is set to the index of
the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

See the

parse(String, ParsePosition)

method for more information
on date parsing.

**Specified by:** parseObject

in class

Format
**Parameters:** source

- A

String

, part of which should be parsed.
**Parameters:** pos

- A

ParsePosition

object with index and error
index information as described above.
**Returns:** A

Date

parsed from the string. In case of
error, returns null.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

source

or

pos

is null.

, if the given

fieldPosition

is

YEAR_FIELD

, the begin index and end index of

fieldPosition

will be set to 0 and 4, respectively.
Notice that if the same date-time field appears more than once in a
pattern, the

fieldPosition

will be set for the first occurrence
of that date-time field. For instance, formatting a

Date

to the
date-time string

"1 PM PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)"

using the
pattern

"h a z (zzzz)"

and the alignment field

TIMEZONE_FIELD

, the begin index and end index of

fieldPosition

will be set to 5 and 8, respectively, for the
first occurrence of the timezone pattern character

'z'

.

into a date-time string. The formatted
string is appended to the given

StringBuffer

.

**Parameters:** date

- a Date to be formatted into a date-time string.
**Parameters:** toAppendTo

- the string buffer for the returning date-time string.
**Parameters:** fieldPosition

- keeps track on the position of the field within
the returned string. For example, given a date-time text

"1996.07.10 AD at 15:08:56 PDT"

, if the given

fieldPosition

is

YEAR_FIELD

, the begin index and end index of

'z'

.
**Returns:** the string buffer passed in as

toAppendTo

, with formatted
text appended.

- format

```java
public final
String
format​(
Date
date)
```

Formats a

Date

into a date-time string.

**Parameters:** date

- the time value to be formatted into a date-time string.
**Returns:** the formatted date-time string.

- parse

```java
public
Date
parse​(
String
source)
throws
ParseException
```

Parses text from the beginning of the given string to produce a date.
The method may not use the entire text of the given string.

See the

parse(String, ParsePosition)

method for more information
on date parsing.

**Parameters:** source

- A

String

whose beginning should be parsed.
**Returns:** A

Date

parsed from the string.
**Throws:** ParseException

- if the beginning of the specified string
cannot be parsed.

- parse

```java
public abstract
Date
parse​(
String
source,

ParsePosition
pos)
```

Parse a date/time string according to the given parse position. For
example, a time text

"07/10/96 4:5 PM, PDT"

will be parsed into a

Date

that is equivalent to

Date(837039900000L)

.

By default, parsing is lenient: If the input is not in the form used
by this object's format method but can still be parsed as a date, then
the parse succeeds. Clients may insist on strict adherence to the
format by calling

setLenient(false)

.

This parsing operation uses the

calendar

to produce
a

Date

. As a result, the

calendar

's date-time
fields and the

TimeZone

value may have been
overwritten, depending on subclass implementations. Any

TimeZone

value that has previously been set by a call to

setTimeZone

may need
to be restored for further operations.

**Parameters:** source

- The date/time string to be parsed
**Parameters:** pos

- On input, the position at which to start parsing; on
output, the position at which parsing terminated, or the
start position if the parse failed.
**Returns:** A

Date

, or

null

if the input could not be parsed

- parseObject

```java
public
Object
parseObject​(
String
source,

ParsePosition
pos)
```

Parses text from a string to produce a

Date

.

The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by

pos

.
If parsing succeeds, then the index of

pos

is updated
to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
date is returned. The updated

pos

can be used to
indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
If an error occurs, then the index of

pos

is not
changed, the error index of

pos

is set to the index of
the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

See the

parse(String, ParsePosition)

method for more information
on date parsing.

**Specified by:** parseObject

in class

Format
**Parameters:** source

- A

String

, part of which should be parsed.
**Parameters:** pos

- A

ParsePosition

object with index and error
index information as described above.
**Returns:** A

Date

parsed from the string. In case of
error, returns null.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

source

or

pos

is null.

- getTimeInstance

```java
public static final
DateFormat
getTimeInstance()
```

Gets the time formatter with the default formatting style
for the default

FORMAT

locale.

This is equivalent to calling

getTimeInstance(DEFAULT,
Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category.FORMAT))

.

**Returns:** a time formatter.
**See Also:** Locale.getDefault(java.util.Locale.Category)

,

Locale.Category.FORMAT

- getTimeInstance

```java
public static final
DateFormat
getTimeInstance​(int style)
```

Gets the time formatter with the given formatting style

"07/10/96 4:5 PM, PDT"

will be parsed into a

Date

that is equivalent to

Date(837039900000L)

.

By default, parsing is lenient: If the input is not in the form used
by this object's format method but can still be parsed as a date, then
the parse succeeds. Clients may insist on strict adherence to the
format by calling

setLenient(false)

.

This parsing operation uses the

calendar

to produce
a

Date

. As a result, the

calendar

's date-time
fields and the

TimeZone

value may have been
overwritten, depending on subclass implementations. Any

TimeZone

value that has previously been set by a call to

setTimeZone

may need
to be restored for further operations.

**Parameters:** source

- The date/time string to be parsed
**Parameters:** pos

- On input, the position at which to start parsing; on
output, the position at which parsing terminated, or the
start position if the parse failed.
