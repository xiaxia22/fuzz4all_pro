# Class DecimalFormat

**Source:** `java.base\java\text\DecimalFormat.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
DecimalFormat

extends
NumberFormat
```

DecimalFormat

is a concrete subclass of

NumberFormat

that formats decimal numbers. It has a variety of
features designed to make it possible to parse and format numbers in any
locale, including support for Western, Arabic, and Indic digits. It also
supports different kinds of numbers, including integers (123), fixed-point
numbers (123.4), scientific notation (1.23E4), percentages (12%), and
currency amounts ($123). All of these can be localized.

To obtain a

NumberFormat

for a specific locale, including the
default locale, call one of

NumberFormat

's factory methods, such
as

getInstance()

. In general, do not call the

DecimalFormat

constructors directly, since the

NumberFormat

factory methods may return subclasses other than

DecimalFormat

. If you need to customize the format object, do
something like this:

```java
NumberFormat f = NumberFormat.getInstance(loc);
if (f instanceof DecimalFormat) {
((DecimalFormat) f).setDecimalSeparatorAlwaysShown(true);
}
```

A

DecimalFormat

comprises a

pattern

and a set of

symbols

. The pattern may be set directly using

applyPattern()

, or indirectly using the API methods. The
symbols are stored in a

DecimalFormatSymbols

object. When using
the

NumberFormat

factory methods, the pattern and symbols are
read from localized

ResourceBundle

s.

Patterns

patterns have the following syntax:

A

DecimalFormat

pattern contains a positive and negative
subpattern, for example,

"#,##0.00;(#,##0.00)"

. Each
subpattern has a prefix, numeric part, and suffix. The negative subpattern
is optional; if absent, then the positive subpattern prefixed with the
localized minus sign (

'-'

in most locales) is used as the
negative subpattern. That is,

"0.00"

alone is equivalent to

"0.00;-0.00"

. If there is an explicit negative subpattern, it
serves only to specify the negative prefix and suffix; the number of digits,
minimal digits, and other characteristics are all the same as the positive
pattern. That means that

"#,##0.0#;(#)"

produces precisely
the same behavior as

"#,##0.0#;(#,##0.0#)"

.

The prefixes, suffixes, and various symbols used for infinity, digits,
thousands separators, decimal separators, etc. may be set to arbitrary
values, and they will appear properly during formatting. However, care must
be taken that the symbols and strings do not conflict, or parsing will be
unreliable. For example, either the positive and negative prefixes or the
suffixes must be distinct for

DecimalFormat.parse()

to be able
to distinguish positive from negative values. (If they are identical, then

DecimalFormat

will behave as if no negative subpattern was
specified.) Another example is that the decimal separator and thousands
separator should be distinct characters, or parsing will be impossible.

The grouping separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some
countries it separates ten-thousands. The grouping size is a constant number
of digits between the grouping characters, such as 3 for 100,000,000 or 4 for
1,0000,0000. If you supply a pattern with multiple grouping characters, the
interval between the last one and the end of the integer is the one that is
used. So

"#,##,###,####"

==

"######,####"

==

"##,####,####"

.

Special Pattern Characters

Many characters in a pattern are taken literally; they are matched during
parsing and output unchanged during formatting. Special characters, on the
other hand, stand for other characters, strings, or classes of characters.
They must be quoted, unless noted otherwise, if they are to appear in the
prefix or suffix as literals.

The characters listed here are used in non-localized patterns. Localized
patterns use the corresponding characters taken from this formatter's

DecimalFormatSymbols

object instead, and these characters lose
their special status. Two exceptions are the currency sign and quote, which
are not localized.

is used instead of the decimal separator.

'

Prefix or suffix

No

Used to quote special characters in a prefix or suffix,
for example,

"'#'#"

formats 123 to

"#123"

. To create a single quote
itself, use two in a row:

"# o''clock"

.

Scientific Notation

Numbers in scientific notation are expressed as the product of a mantissa
and a power of ten, for example, 1234 can be expressed as 1.234 x 10^3. The
mantissa is often in the range 1.0 ≤ x < 10.0, but it need not
be.

DecimalFormat

can be instructed to format and parse scientific
notation

only via a pattern

; there is currently no factory method
that creates a scientific notation format. In a pattern, the exponent
character immediately followed by one or more digit characters indicates
scientific notation. Example:

"0.###E0"

formats the number
1234 as

"1.234E3"

.

- The number of digit characters after the exponent character gives the
minimum exponent digit count. There is no maximum. Negative exponents are
formatted using the localized minus sign,

not

the prefix and suffix
from the pattern. This allows patterns such as

"0.###E0 m/s"

.

The minimum and maximum number of integer digits are interpreted
together:

- If the maximum number of integer digits is greater than their minimum number
and greater than 1, it forces the exponent to be a multiple of the maximum
number of integer digits, and the minimum number of integer digits to be
interpreted as 1. The most common use of this is to generate

engineering notation

, in which the exponent is a multiple of three,
e.g.,

"##0.#####E0"

. Using this pattern, the number 12345
formats to

"12.345E3"

, and 123456 formats to

"123.456E3"

.

Otherwise, the minimum number of integer digits is achieved by adjusting the
exponent. Example: 0.00123 formatted with

"00.###E0"

yields

"12.3E-4"

.

The number of significant digits in the mantissa is the sum of the

minimum integer

and

maximum fraction

digits, and is
unaffected by the maximum integer digits. For example, 12345 formatted with

"##0.##E0"

is

"12.3E3"

. To show all digits, set
the significant digits count to zero. The number of significant digits
does not affect parsing.

Exponential patterns may not contain grouping separators.

Rounding

DecimalFormat

provides rounding modes defined in

RoundingMode

for formatting. By default, it uses

RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN

.

Digits

For formatting,

DecimalFormat

uses the ten consecutive
characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object as digits. For parsing, these
digits as well as all Unicode decimal digits, as defined by

Character.digit

, are recognized.

Special Values

NaN

is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character

\uFFFD

. This string is determined by the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object. This is the only value for which
the prefixes and suffixes are not used.

Infinity is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character

\u221E

, with the positive or negative prefixes and suffixes
applied. The infinity string is determined by the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object.

Negative zero (

"-0"

) parses to

- BigDecimal(0)

if

isParseBigDecimal()

is
true,

Long(0)

if

isParseBigDecimal()

is false
and

isParseIntegerOnly()

is true,

Double(-0.0)

if both

isParseBigDecimal()

and

isParseIntegerOnly()

are false.

Synchronization

Decimal formats are generally not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

Example

```java
<strong>// Print out a number using the localized number, integer, currency,
// and percent format for each locale</strong>
Locale[] locales = NumberFormat.getAvailableLocales();
double myNumber = -1234.56;
NumberFormat form;
for (int j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
System.out.println("FORMAT");
for (int i = 0; i < locales.length; ++i) {
if (locales[i].getCountry().length() == 0) {
continue; // Skip language-only locales
}
System.out.print(locales[i].getDisplayName());
switch (j) {
case 0:
form = NumberFormat.getInstance(locales[i]); break;
case 1:
form = NumberFormat.getIntegerInstance(locales[i]); break;
case 2:
form = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(locales[i]); break;
default:
form = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(locales[i]); break;
}
if (form instanceof DecimalFormat) {
System.out.print(": " + ((DecimalFormat) form).toPattern());
}
System.out.print(" -> " + form.format(myNumber));
try {
System.out.println(" -> " + form.parse(form.format(myNumber)));
} catch (ParseException e) {}
}
}
```

---

#### public
Number
parse​(
String
text,

ParsePosition
pos)

Parses text from a string to produce a

Number

.

The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by

pos

.
If parsing succeeds, then the index of

pos

is updated
to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
number is returned. The updated

pos

can be used to
indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
If an error occurs, then the index of

pos

is not
changed, the error index of

pos

is set to the index of
the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

The subclass returned depends on the value of

isParseBigDecimal()

as well as on the string being parsed.

- If

isParseBigDecimal()

is false (the default),
most integer values are returned as

Long

objects, no matter how they are written:

"17"

and

"17.000"

both parse to

Long(17)

.
Values that cannot fit into a

Long

are returned as

Double

s. This includes values with a fractional part,
infinite values,

NaN

, and the value -0.0.

DecimalFormat

does

not

decide whether to
return a

Double

or a

Long

based on the
presence of a decimal separator in the source string. Doing so
would prevent integers that overflow the mantissa of a double,
such as

"-9,223,372,036,854,775,808.00"

, from being
parsed accurately.

Callers may use the

Number

methods

doubleValue

,

longValue

, etc., to obtain
the type they want.

If

isParseBigDecimal()

is true, values are returned
as

BigDecimal

objects. The values are the ones
constructed by

BigDecimal(String)

for corresponding strings in locale-independent format. The
special cases negative and positive infinity and NaN are returned
as

Double

instances holding the values of the
corresponding

Double

constants.

DecimalFormat

parses all Unicode characters that represent
decimal digits, as defined by

Character.digit()

. In
addition,

DecimalFormat

also recognizes as digits the ten
consecutive characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in
the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object.

**Specified by:**
- parse

in class

NumberFormat

**Parameters:**
- text

- the string to be parsed
- pos

- A

ParsePosition

object with index and error
index information as described above.

**Returns:**
- the parsed value, or

null

if the parse fails

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

text

or

pos

is null.

#### public void applyPattern​(
String
pattern)

Apply the given pattern to this Format object. A pattern is a
short-hand specification for the various formatting properties.

This means a minimum of 2 integer digits, 1 fraction digit, and
a maximum of 2 fraction digits.

Example:

"#,#00.0#;(#,#00.0#)"

for negatives in
parentheses.

In negative patterns, the minimum and maximum counts are ignored;
these are presumed to be set in the positive pattern.

- NullPointerException

- if

pattern

is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the given pattern is invalid.

---

#### public void applyLocalizedPattern​(

DecimalFormat

is a concrete subclass of

NumberFormat

that formats decimal numbers. It has a variety of
features designed to make it possible to parse and format numbers in any
locale, including support for Western, Arabic, and Indic digits. It also
supports different kinds of numbers, including integers (123), fixed-point
numbers (123.4), scientific notation (1.23E4), percentages (12%), and
currency amounts ($123). All of these can be localized.

To obtain a

NumberFormat

for a specific locale, including the
default locale, call one of

NumberFormat

's factory methods, such
as

getInstance()

. In general, do not call the

DecimalFormat

constructors directly, since the

NumberFormat

factory methods may return subclasses other than

DecimalFormat

. If you need to customize the format object, do
something like this:

```java
NumberFormat f = NumberFormat.getInstance(loc);
if (f instanceof DecimalFormat) {
((DecimalFormat) f).setDecimalSeparatorAlwaysShown(true);
}
```

A

DecimalFormat

comprises a

pattern

and a set of

symbols

. The pattern may be set directly using

applyPattern()

, or indirectly using the API methods. The
symbols are stored in a

DecimalFormatSymbols

object. When using
the

NumberFormat

factory methods, the pattern and symbols are
read from localized

ResourceBundle

s.

A

DecimalFormat

pattern contains a positive and negative
subpattern, for example,

"#,##0.00;(#,##0.00)"

. Each
subpattern has a prefix, numeric part, and suffix. The negative subpattern
is optional; if absent, then the positive subpattern prefixed with the
localized minus sign (

'-'

in most locales) is used as the
negative subpattern. That is,

"0.00"

alone is equivalent to

"0.00;-0.00"

. If there is an explicit negative subpattern, it
serves only to specify the negative prefix and suffix; the number of digits,
minimal digits, and other characteristics are all the same as the positive
pattern. That means that

"#,##0.0#;(#)"

produces precisely
the same behavior as

"#,##0.0#;(#,##0.0#)"

.

The prefixes, suffixes, and various symbols used for infinity, digits,
thousands separators, decimal separators, etc. may be set to arbitrary
values, and they will appear properly during formatting. However, care must
be taken that the symbols and strings do not conflict, or parsing will be
unreliable. For example, either the positive and negative prefixes or the
suffixes must be distinct for

DecimalFormat.parse()

to be able
to distinguish positive from negative values. (If they are identical, then

DecimalFormat

will behave as if no negative subpattern was
specified.) Another example is that the decimal separator and thousands
separator should be distinct characters, or parsing will be impossible.

The grouping separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some
countries it separates ten-thousands. The grouping size is a constant number
of digits between the grouping characters, such as 3 for 100,000,000 or 4 for
1,0000,0000. If you supply a pattern with multiple grouping characters, the
interval between the last one and the end of the integer is the one that is
used. So

"#,##,###,####"

==

"######,####"

==

"##,####,####"

.

Special Pattern Characters

Many characters in a pattern are taken literally; they are matched during
parsing and output unchanged during formatting. Special characters, on the
other hand, stand for other characters, strings, or classes of characters.
They must be quoted, unless noted otherwise, if they are to appear in the
prefix or suffix as literals.

The characters listed here are used in non-localized patterns. Localized
patterns use the corresponding characters taken from this formatter's

DecimalFormatSymbols

object instead, and these characters lose
their special status. Two exceptions are the currency sign and quote, which
are not localized.

'

Prefix or suffix

No

Used to quote special characters in a prefix or suffix,
for example,

"'#'#"

formats 123 to

"#123"

. To create a single quote
itself, use two in a row:

"# o''clock"

.

Scientific Notation

Numbers in scientific notation are expressed as the product of a mantissa
and a power of ten, for example, 1234 can be expressed as 1.234 x 10^3. The
mantissa is often in the range 1.0 ≤ x < 10.0, but it need not
be.

DecimalFormat

can be instructed to format and parse scientific
notation

only via a pattern

; there is currently no factory method
that creates a scientific notation format. In a pattern, the exponent
character immediately followed by one or more digit characters indicates
scientific notation. Example:

"0.###E0"

formats the number
1234 as

"1.234E3"

.

- The number of digit characters after the exponent character gives the
minimum exponent digit count. There is no maximum. Negative exponents are
formatted using the localized minus sign,

not

the prefix and suffix
from the pattern. This allows patterns such as

"0.###E0 m/s"

.

The minimum and maximum number of integer digits are interpreted
together:

- If the maximum number of integer digits is greater than their minimum number
and greater than 1, it forces the exponent to be a multiple of the maximum
number of integer digits, and the minimum number of integer digits to be
interpreted as 1. The most common use of this is to generate

engineering notation

, in which the exponent is a multiple of three,
e.g.,

"##0.#####E0"

. Using this pattern, the number 12345
formats to

"12.345E3"

, and 123456 formats to

"123.456E3"

.

Otherwise, the minimum number of integer digits is achieved by adjusting the
exponent. Example: 0.00123 formatted with

"00.###E0"

yields

"12.3E-4"

.

The number of significant digits in the mantissa is the sum of the

minimum integer

and

maximum fraction

digits, and is
unaffected by the maximum integer digits. For example, 12345 formatted with

"##0.##E0"

is

"12.3E3"

. To show all digits, set
the significant digits count to zero. The number of significant digits
does not affect parsing.

Exponential patterns may not contain grouping separators.

Rounding

DecimalFormat

provides rounding modes defined in

RoundingMode

for formatting. By default, it uses

RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN

.

Digits

For formatting,

DecimalFormat

uses the ten consecutive
characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object as digits. For parsing, these
digits as well as all Unicode decimal digits, as defined by

Character.digit

, are recognized.

Special Values

NaN

is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character

\uFFFD

. This string is determined by the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object. This is the only value for which
the prefixes and suffixes are not used.

Infinity is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character

\u221E

, with the positive or negative prefixes and suffixes
applied. The infinity string is determined by the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object.

Negative zero (

"-0"

) parses to

- BigDecimal(0)

if

isParseBigDecimal()

is
true,

Long(0)

if

isParseBigDecimal()

is false
and

isParseIntegerOnly()

is true,

Double(-0.0)

if both

isParseBigDecimal()

and

isParseIntegerOnly()

are false.

Synchronization

Decimal formats are generally not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

Example

```java
<strong>// Print out a number using the localized number, integer, currency,
// and percent format for each locale</strong>
Locale[] locales = NumberFormat.getAvailableLocales();
double myNumber = -1234.56;
NumberFormat form;
for (int j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
System.out.println("FORMAT");
for (int i = 0; i < locales.length; ++i) {
if (locales[i].getCountry().length() == 0) {
continue; // Skip language-only locales
}
System.out.print(locales[i].getDisplayName());
switch (j) {
case 0:
form = NumberFormat.getInstance(locales[i]); break;
case 1:
form = NumberFormat.getIntegerInstance(locales[i]); break;
case 2:
form = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(locales[i]); break;
default:
form = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(locales[i]); break;
}
if (form instanceof DecimalFormat) {
System.out.print(": " + ((DecimalFormat) form).toPattern());
}
System.out.print(" -> " + form.format(myNumber));
try {
System.out.println(" -> " + form.parse(form.format(myNumber)));
} catch (ParseException e) {}
}
}
```

A

DecimalFormat

pattern contains a positive and negative
subpattern, for example,

"#,##0.00;(#,##0.00)"

. Each
subpattern has a prefix, numeric part, and suffix. The negative subpattern
is optional; if absent, then the positive subpattern prefixed with the
localized minus sign (

'-'

in most locales) is used as the
negative subpattern. That is,

"0.00"

alone is equivalent to

"0.00;-0.00"

. If there is an explicit negative subpattern, it
serves only to specify the negative prefix and suffix; the number of digits,
minimal digits, and other characteristics are all the same as the positive
pattern. That means that

"#,##0.0#;(#)"

produces precisely
the same behavior as

"#,##0.0#;(#,##0.0#)"

.

The prefixes, suffixes, and various symbols used for infinity, digits,
thousands separators, decimal separators, etc. may be set to arbitrary
values, and they will appear properly during formatting. However, care must
be taken that the symbols and strings do not conflict, or parsing will be
unreliable. For example, either the positive and negative prefixes or the
suffixes must be distinct for

DecimalFormat.parse()

to be able
to distinguish positive from negative values. (If they are identical, then

DecimalFormat

will behave as if no negative subpattern was
specified.) Another example is that the decimal separator and thousands
separator should be distinct characters, or parsing will be impossible.

The grouping separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some
countries it separates ten-thousands. The grouping size is a constant number
of digits between the grouping characters, such as 3 for 100,000,000 or 4 for
1,0000,0000. If you supply a pattern with multiple grouping characters, the
interval between the last one and the end of the integer is the one that is
used. So

"#,##,###,####"

==

"######,####"

==

"##,####,####"

.

Special Pattern Characters

Many characters in a pattern are taken literally; they are matched during
parsing and output unchanged during formatting. Special characters, on the
other hand, stand for other characters, strings, or classes of characters.
They must be quoted, unless noted otherwise, if they are to appear in the
prefix or suffix as literals.

The characters listed here are used in non-localized patterns. Localized
patterns use the corresponding characters taken from this formatter's

DecimalFormatSymbols

object instead, and these characters lose
their special status. Two exceptions are the currency sign and quote, which
are not localized.

'

Prefix or suffix

No

Used to quote special characters in a prefix or suffix,
for example,

"'#'#"

formats 123 to

"#123"

. To create a single quote
itself, use two in a row:

"# o''clock"

.

Scientific Notation

Numbers in scientific notation are expressed as the product of a mantissa
and a power of ten, for example, 1234 can be expressed as 1.234 x 10^3. The
mantissa is often in the range 1.0 ≤ x < 10.0, but it need not
be.

DecimalFormat

can be instructed to format and parse scientific
notation

only via a pattern

; there is currently no factory method
that creates a scientific notation format. In a pattern, the exponent
character immediately followed by one or more digit characters indicates
scientific notation. Example:

"0.###E0"

formats the number
1234 as

"1.234E3"

.

- The number of digit characters after the exponent character gives the
minimum exponent digit count. There is no maximum. Negative exponents are
formatted using the localized minus sign,

not

the prefix and suffix
from the pattern. This allows patterns such as

"0.###E0 m/s"

.

The minimum and maximum number of integer digits are interpreted
together:

- If the maximum number of integer digits is greater than their minimum number
and greater than 1, it forces the exponent to be a multiple of the maximum
number of integer digits, and the minimum number of integer digits to be
interpreted as 1. The most common use of this is to generate

engineering notation

, in which the exponent is a multiple of three,
e.g.,

"##0.#####E0"

. Using this pattern, the number 12345
formats to

"12.345E3"

, and 123456 formats to

"123.456E3"

.

Otherwise, the minimum number of integer digits is achieved by adjusting the
exponent. Example: 0.00123 formatted with

"00.###E0"

yields

"12.3E-4"

.

The number of significant digits in the mantissa is the sum of the

minimum integer

and

maximum fraction

digits, and is
unaffected by the maximum integer digits. For example, 12345 formatted with

"##0.##E0"

is

"12.3E3"

. To show all digits, set
the significant digits count to zero. The number of significant digits
does not affect parsing.

Exponential patterns may not contain grouping separators.

Rounding

DecimalFormat

provides rounding modes defined in

RoundingMode

for formatting. By default, it uses

RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN

.

Digits

For formatting,

DecimalFormat

uses the ten consecutive
characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object as digits. For parsing, these
digits as well as all Unicode decimal digits, as defined by

Character.digit

, are recognized.

Special Values

NaN

is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character

\uFFFD

. This string is determined by the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object. This is the only value for which
the prefixes and suffixes are not used.

Infinity is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character

\u221E

, with the positive or negative prefixes and suffixes
applied. The infinity string is determined by the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object.

Negative zero (

"-0"

) parses to

- BigDecimal(0)

if

isParseBigDecimal()

is
true,

Long(0)

if

isParseBigDecimal()

is false
and

isParseIntegerOnly()

is true,

Double(-0.0)

if both

isParseBigDecimal()

and

isParseIntegerOnly()

are false.

Synchronization

Decimal formats are generally not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

Example

```java
<strong>// Print out a number using the localized number, integer, currency,
// and percent format for each locale</strong>
Locale[] locales = NumberFormat.getAvailableLocales();
double myNumber = -1234.56;
NumberFormat form;
for (int j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
System.out.println("FORMAT");
for (int i = 0; i < locales.length; ++i) {
if (locales[i].getCountry().length() == 0) {
continue; // Skip language-only locales
}
System.out.print(locales[i].getDisplayName());
switch (j) {
case 0:
form = NumberFormat.getInstance(locales[i]); break;
case 1:
form = NumberFormat.getIntegerInstance(locales[i]); break;
case 2:
form = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(locales[i]); break;
default:
form = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(locales[i]); break;
}
if (form instanceof DecimalFormat) {
System.out.print(": " + ((DecimalFormat) form).toPattern());
}
System.out.print(" -> " + form.format(myNumber));
try {
System.out.println(" -> " + form.parse(form.format(myNumber)));
} catch (ParseException e) {}
}
}
```

NumberFormat f = NumberFormat.getInstance(loc);
if (f instanceof DecimalFormat) {
((DecimalFormat) f).setDecimalSeparatorAlwaysShown(true);
}

A

DecimalFormat

comprises a

pattern

and a set of

symbols

. The pattern may be set directly using

applyPattern()

, or indirectly using the API methods. The
symbols are stored in a

DecimalFormatSymbols

object. When using
the

NumberFormat

factory methods, the pattern and symbols are
read from localized

ResourceBundle

s.

The grouping separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some
countries it separates ten-thousands. The grouping size is a constant number
of digits between the grouping characters, such as 3 for 100,000,000 or 4 for
1,0000,0000. If you supply a pattern with multiple grouping characters, the
interval between the last one and the end of the integer is the one that is
used. So

"#,##,###,####"

==

"######,####"

==

"##,####,####"

.

Special Pattern Characters

Many characters in a pattern are taken literally; they are matched during
parsing and output unchanged during formatting. Special characters, on the
other hand, stand for other characters, strings, or classes of characters.
They must be quoted, unless noted otherwise, if they are to appear in the
prefix or suffix as literals.

The characters listed here are used in non-localized patterns. Localized
patterns use the corresponding characters taken from this formatter's

DecimalFormatSymbols

object instead, and these characters lose
their special status. Two exceptions are the currency sign and quote, which
are not localized.

'

Prefix or suffix

No

Used to quote special characters in a prefix or suffix,
for example,

"'#'#"

formats 123 to

"#123"

. To create a single quote
itself, use two in a row:

"# o''clock"

.

Scientific Notation

Numbers in scientific notation are expressed as the product of a mantissa
and a power of ten, for example, 1234 can be expressed as 1.234 x 10^3. The
mantissa is often in the range 1.0 ≤ x < 10.0, but it need not
be.

DecimalFormat

can be instructed to format and parse scientific
notation

only via a pattern

; there is currently no factory method
that creates a scientific notation format. In a pattern, the exponent
character immediately followed by one or more digit characters indicates
scientific notation. Example:

"0.###E0"

formats the number
1234 as

"1.234E3"

.

- The number of digit characters after the exponent character gives the
minimum exponent digit count. There is no maximum. Negative exponents are
formatted using the localized minus sign,

not

the prefix and suffix
from the pattern. This allows patterns such as

"0.###E0 m/s"

.

The minimum and maximum number of integer digits are interpreted
together:

- If the maximum number of integer digits is greater than their minimum number
and greater than 1, it forces the exponent to be a multiple of the maximum
number of integer digits, and the minimum number of integer digits to be
interpreted as 1. The most common use of this is to generate

engineering notation

, in which the exponent is a multiple of three,
e.g.,

"##0.#####E0"

. Using this pattern, the number 12345
formats to

"12.345E3"

, and 123456 formats to

"123.456E3"

.

Otherwise, the minimum number of integer digits is achieved by adjusting the
exponent. Example: 0.00123 formatted with

"00.###E0"

yields

"12.3E-4"

.

The number of significant digits in the mantissa is the sum of the

minimum integer

and

maximum fraction

digits, and is
unaffected by the maximum integer digits. For example, 12345 formatted with

"##0.##E0"

is

"12.3E3"

. To show all digits, set
the significant digits count to zero. The number of significant digits
does not affect parsing.

Exponential patterns may not contain grouping separators.

Rounding

DecimalFormat

provides rounding modes defined in

RoundingMode

for formatting. By default, it uses

RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN

.

Digits

For formatting,

DecimalFormat

uses the ten consecutive
characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object as digits. For parsing, these
digits as well as all Unicode decimal digits, as defined by

Character.digit

, are recognized.

Special Values

NaN

is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character

\uFFFD

. This string is determined by the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object. This is the only value for which
the prefixes and suffixes are not used.

Infinity is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character

\u221E

, with the positive or negative prefixes and suffixes
applied. The infinity string is determined by the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object.

Negative zero (

"-0"

) parses to

- BigDecimal(0)

if

isParseBigDecimal()

is
true,

Long(0)

if

isParseBigDecimal()

is false
and

isParseIntegerOnly()

is true,

Double(-0.0)

if both

isParseBigDecimal()

and

isParseIntegerOnly()

are false.

Synchronization

Decimal formats are generally not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

Example

```java
<strong>// Print out a number using the localized number, integer, currency,
// and percent format for each locale</strong>
Locale[] locales = NumberFormat.getAvailableLocales();
double myNumber = -1234.56;
NumberFormat form;
for (int j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
System.out.println("FORMAT");
for (int i = 0; i < locales.length; ++i) {
if (locales[i].getCountry().length() == 0) {
continue; // Skip language-only locales
}
System.out.print(locales[i].getDisplayName());
switch (j) {
case 0:
form = NumberFormat.getInstance(locales[i]); break;
case 1:
form = NumberFormat.getIntegerInstance(locales[i]); break;
case 2:
form = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(locales[i]); break;
default:
form = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(locales[i]); break;
}
if (form instanceof DecimalFormat) {
System.out.print(": " + ((DecimalFormat) form).toPattern());
}
System.out.print(" -> " + form.format(myNumber));
try {
System.out.println(" -> " + form.parse(form.format(myNumber)));
} catch (ParseException e) {}
}
}
```

provides rounding modes defined in

RoundingMode

for formatting. By default, it uses

RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN

.

Digits

For formatting,

DecimalFormat

uses the ten consecutive
characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object as digits. For parsing, these
digits as well as all Unicode decimal digits, as defined by

Character.digit

, are recognized.

Special Values

NaN

is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character

\uFFFD

. This string is determined by the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object. This is the only value for which
the prefixes and suffixes are not used.

Infinity is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character

\u221E

, with the positive or negative prefixes and suffixes
applied. The infinity string is determined by the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object.

Negative zero (

"-0"

) parses to

- BigDecimal(0)

if

isParseBigDecimal()

is
true,

Long(0)

if

isParseBigDecimal()

is false
and

isParseIntegerOnly()

is true,

Double(-0.0)

if both

isParseBigDecimal()

and

isParseIntegerOnly()

are false.

Synchronization

Decimal formats are generally not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

Example

```java
<strong>// Print out a number using the localized number, integer, currency,
// and percent format for each locale</strong>
Locale[] locales = NumberFormat.getAvailableLocales();
double myNumber = -1234.56;
NumberFormat form;
for (int j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
System.out.println("FORMAT");
for (int i = 0; i < locales.length; ++i) {
if (locales[i].getCountry().length() == 0) {
continue; // Skip language-only locales
}
System.out.print(locales[i].getDisplayName());
switch (j) {
case 0:
form = NumberFormat.getInstance(locales[i]); break;
case 1:
form = NumberFormat.getIntegerInstance(locales[i]); break;
case 2:
form = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(locales[i]); break;
default:
form = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(locales[i]); break;
}
if (form instanceof DecimalFormat) {
System.out.print(": " + ((DecimalFormat) form).toPattern());
}
System.out.print(" -> " + form.format(myNumber));
try {
System.out.println(" -> " + form.parse(form.format(myNumber)));
} catch (ParseException e) {}
}
}
```

The number of digit characters after the exponent character gives the
minimum exponent digit count. There is no maximum. Negative exponents are
formatted using the localized minus sign,

not

the prefix and suffix
from the pattern. This allows patterns such as

"0.###E0 m/s"

.

The minimum and maximum number of integer digits are interpreted
together:

- If the maximum number of integer digits is greater than their minimum number
and greater than 1, it forces the exponent to be a multiple of the maximum
number of integer digits, and the minimum number of integer digits to be
interpreted as 1. The most common use of this is to generate

engineering notation

, in which the exponent is a multiple of three,
e.g.,

"##0.#####E0"

. Using this pattern, the number 12345
formats to

"12.345E3"

, and 123456 formats to

"123.456E3"

.

Otherwise, the minimum number of integer digits is achieved by adjusting the
exponent. Example: 0.00123 formatted with

"00.###E0"

yields

"12.3E-4"

.

The number of significant digits in the mantissa is the sum of the

minimum integer

and

maximum fraction

digits, and is
unaffected by the maximum integer digits. For example, 12345 formatted with

"##0.##E0"

is

"12.3E3"

. To show all digits, set
the significant digits count to zero. The number of significant digits
does not affect parsing.

Exponential patterns may not contain grouping separators.

If the maximum number of integer digits is greater than their minimum number
and greater than 1, it forces the exponent to be a multiple of the maximum
number of integer digits, and the minimum number of integer digits to be
interpreted as 1. The most common use of this is to generate

engineering notation

, in which the exponent is a multiple of three,
e.g.,

"##0.#####E0"

. Using this pattern, the number 12345
formats to

"12.345E3"

, and 123456 formats to

"123.456E3"

.

Otherwise, the minimum number of integer digits is achieved by adjusting the
exponent. Example: 0.00123 formatted with

"00.###E0"

yields

"12.3E-4"

.

\u221E

, with the positive or negative prefixes and suffixes

AttributedCharacterIterator

.
You can use the returned

AttributedCharacterIterator

to build the resulting String, as well as to determine information
about the resulting String.

Each attribute key of the AttributedCharacterIterator will be of type

NumberFormat.Field

, with the attribute value being the
same as the attribute key.

**Overrides:** formatToCharacterIterator

in class

- parse

```java
public
Number
parse​(
String
text,

ParsePosition
pos)
```

Parses text from a string to produce a

Number

.

The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by

pos

.
If parsing succeeds, then the index of

pos

is updated
to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
number is returned. The updated

pos

can be used to
indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
If an error occurs, then the index of

pos

is not
changed, the error index of

pos

is set to the index of
the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

The subclass returned depends on the value of

isParseBigDecimal()

as well as on the string being parsed.

- If

isParseBigDecimal()

is false (the default),
most integer values are returned as

Long

objects, no matter how they are written:

"17"

and

"17.000"

both parse to

Long(17)

.
Values that cannot fit into a

Long

are returned as

Double

s. This includes values with a fractional part,
infinite values,

NaN

, and the value -0.0.

DecimalFormat

does

not

decide whether to
return a

Double

or a

Long

based on the
presence of a decimal separator in the source string. Doing so
would prevent integers that overflow the mantissa of a double,
such as

"-9,223,372,036,854,775,808.00"

, from being
parsed accurately.

Callers may use the

Number

methods

doubleValue

,

longValue

, etc., to obtain
the type they want.

If

isParseBigDecimal()

is true, values are returned
as

BigDecimal

objects. The values are the ones
constructed by

BigDecimal(String)

for corresponding strings in locale-independent format. The
special cases negative and positive infinity and NaN are returned
as

Double

instances holding the values of the
corresponding

Double

constants.

DecimalFormat

parses all Unicode characters that represent
decimal digits, as defined by

Character.digit()

. In
addition,

DecimalFormat

also recognizes as digits the ten
consecutive characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in
the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object.

**Specified by:** parse

in class

NumberFormat
**Parameters:** text

- the string to be parsed
**Parameters:** pos

- A

ParsePosition

object with index and error
index information as described above.
**Returns:** the parsed value, or

null

if the parse fails
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

text

or

pos

is null.

- parse

```java
public
Number
parse​(
String
text,

ParsePosition
pos)
```

Parses text from a string to produce a

Number

.

The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by

pos

.
If parsing succeeds, then the index of

pos

is updated
to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
number is returned. The updated

pos

can be used to
indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
If an error occurs, then the index of

pos

is not
changed, the error index of

pos

is set to the index of
the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

The subclass returned depends on the value of

isParseBigDecimal()

as well as on the string being parsed.

- If

isParseBigDecimal()

is false (the default),
most integer values are returned as

Long

objects, no matter how they are written:

"17"

and

"17.000"

both parse to

Long(17)

.
Values that cannot fit into a

Long

are returned as

Double

s. This includes values with a fractional part,
infinite values,

NaN

, and the value -0.0.

DecimalFormat

does

not

decide whether to
return a

Double

or a

Long

based on the
presence of a decimal separator in the source string. Doing so
would prevent integers that overflow the mantissa of a double,
such as

"-9,223,372,036,854,775,808.00"

, from being
parsed accurately.

Callers may use the

Number

methods

doubleValue

,

longValue

, etc., to obtain
the type they want.

If

isParseBigDecimal()

is true, values are returned
as

BigDecimal

objects. The values are the ones
constructed by

BigDecimal(String)

for corresponding strings in locale-independent format. The
special cases negative and positive infinity and NaN are returned
as

Double

instances holding the values of the
corresponding

Double

constants.

DecimalFormat

parses all Unicode characters that represent
decimal digits, as defined by

Character.digit()

. In
addition,

DecimalFormat

also recognizes as digits the ten
consecutive characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in
the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object.

**Specified by:** parse

in class

NumberFormat
**Parameters:** text

- the string to be parsed
**Parameters:** pos

- A

ParsePosition

object with index and error
index information as described above.
**Returns:** the parsed value, or

null

if the parse fails

parse

```java
public
Number
parse​(
String
text,

ParsePosition
pos)
```

Parses text from a string to produce a

Number

.

The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by

pos

.
If parsing succeeds, then the index of

pos

is updated
to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
number is returned. The updated

pos

can be used to
indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
If an error occurs, then the index of

pos

is not
changed, the error index of

pos

is set to the index of
the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

The subclass returned depends on the value of

isParseBigDecimal()

as well as on the string being parsed.

- If

isParseBigDecimal()

is false (the default),
most integer values are returned as

Long

objects, no matter how they are written:

"17"

and

"17.000"

both parse to

Long(17)

.
Values that cannot fit into a

Long

are returned as

Double

s. This includes values with a fractional part,
infinite values,

NaN

, and the value -0.0.

DecimalFormat

does

not

decide whether to
return a

Double

or a

Long

based on the
presence of a decimal separator in the source string. Doing so
would prevent integers that overflow the mantissa of a double,
such as

"-9,223,372,036,854,775,808.00"

, from being
parsed accurately.

Callers may use the

Number

methods

doubleValue

,

longValue

, etc., to obtain
the type they want.

If

isParseBigDecimal()

is true, values are returned
as

BigDecimal

objects. The values are the ones
constructed by

BigDecimal(String)

for corresponding strings in locale-independent format. The
special cases negative and positive infinity and NaN are returned
as

Double

instances holding the values of the
corresponding

Double

constants.

DecimalFormat

parses all Unicode characters that represent
decimal digits, as defined by

Character.digit()

. In
addition,

DecimalFormat

also recognizes as digits the ten
consecutive characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in
the

DecimalFormatSymbols

object.

**Specified by:** parse

in class

NumberFormat
**Parameters:** text

- the string to be parsed
**Parameters:** pos

- A

ParsePosition

object with index and error
index information as described above.
**Returns:** the parsed value, or

null

if the parse fails
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

text

or

pos

is null.

applyPattern

```java
public void applyPattern​(
String
pattern)
```

Apply the given pattern to this Format object. A pattern is a
short-hand specification for the various formatting properties.
These properties can also be changed individually through the
various setter methods.

There is no limit to integer digits set
by this routine, since that is the typical end-user desire;
use setMaximumInteger if you want to set a real value.
For negative numbers, use a second pattern, separated by a semicolon

Example

"#,#00.0#"

→ 1,234.56

This means a minimum of 2 integer digits, 1 fraction digit, and
a maximum of 2 fraction digits.

Example:

"#,#00.0#;(#,#00.0#)"

for negatives in
parentheses.

In negative patterns, the minimum and maximum counts are ignored;
these are presumed to be set in the positive pattern.

**Parameters:** pattern

- a new pattern
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

short-hand specification for the various formatting properties.
These properties can also be changed individually through the
various setter methods.

There is no limit to integer digits set
by this routine, since that is the typical end-user desire;
use setMaximumInteger if you want to set a real value.
For negative numbers, use a second pattern, separated by a semicolon

Example

"#,#00.0#"

→ 1,234.56

This means a minimum of 2 integer digits, 1 fraction digit, and
a maximum of 2 fraction digits.

Example:

"#,#00.0#;(#,#00.0#)"

for negatives in
parentheses.

In negative patterns, the minimum and maximum counts are ignored;
these are presumed to be set in the positive pattern.
