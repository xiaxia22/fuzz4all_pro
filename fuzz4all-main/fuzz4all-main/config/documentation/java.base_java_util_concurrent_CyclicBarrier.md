# Class CyclicBarrier

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\concurrent\CyclicBarrier.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
CyclicBarrier

extends
Object
```

A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for
each other to reach a common barrier point. CyclicBarriers are
useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads that
must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called

cyclic

because it can be re-used after the waiting threads
are released.

A

CyclicBarrier

supports an optional

Runnable

command
that is run once per barrier point, after the last thread in the party
arrives, but before any threads are released.
This

barrier action

is useful
for updating shared-state before any of the parties continue.

Sample usage:

Here is an example of using a barrier in a
parallel decomposition design:

```java
class Solver {
final int N;
final float[][] data;
final CyclicBarrier barrier;

class Worker implements Runnable {
int myRow;
Worker(int row) { myRow = row; }
public void run() {
while (!done()) {
processRow(myRow);

try {
barrier.await();
} catch (InterruptedException ex) {
return;
} catch (BrokenBarrierException ex) {
return;
}
}
}
}

public Solver(float[][] matrix) {
data = matrix;
N = matrix.length;
Runnable barrierAction = () -> mergeRows(...);
barrier = new CyclicBarrier(N, barrierAction);

List<Thread> threads = new ArrayList<>(N);
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
Thread thread = new Thread(new Worker(i));
threads.add(thread);
thread.start();
}

// wait until done
for (Thread thread : threads)
thread.join();
}
}
```

Here, each worker thread processes a row of the matrix then waits at the
barrier until all rows have been processed. When all rows are processed
the supplied

Runnable

barrier action is executed and merges the
rows. If the merger
determines that a solution has been found then

done()

will return

true

and each worker will terminate.

If the barrier action does not rely on the parties being suspended when
it is executed, then any of the threads in the party could execute that
action when it is released. To facilitate this, each invocation of

await()

returns the arrival index of that thread at the barrier.
You can then choose which thread should execute the barrier action, for
example:

```java
if (barrier.await() == 0) {
// log the completion of this iteration
}
```

The

CyclicBarrier

uses an all-or-none breakage model
for failed synchronization attempts: If a thread leaves a barrier
point prematurely because of interruption, failure, or timeout, all
other threads waiting at that barrier point will also leave
abnormally via

BrokenBarrierException

(or

InterruptedException

if they too were interrupted at about
the same time).

Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling

await()

happen-before

actions that are part of the barrier action, which in turn

happen-before

actions following a successful return from the
corresponding

await()

in other threads.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public CyclicBarrier​(int parties,

Runnable
barrierAction)

Creates a new

CyclicBarrier

that will trip when the
given number of parties (threads) are waiting upon it, and which
will execute the given barrier action when the barrier is tripped,
performed by the last thread entering the barrier.

**Parameters:**
- parties

- the number of threads that must invoke

await()

before the barrier is tripped
- barrierAction

- the command to execute when the barrier is
tripped, or

null

if there is no action

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

parties

is less than 1

---

#### public CyclicBarrier​(int parties)

Creates a new

CyclicBarrier

that will trip when the
given number of parties (threads) are waiting upon it, and
does not perform a predefined action when the barrier is tripped.

**Parameters:**
- parties

- the number of threads that must invoke

await()

before the barrier is tripped

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

parties

is less than 1

---

### Method Details

#### public int getParties()

Returns the number of parties required to trip this barrier.

**Returns:**
- the number of parties required to trip this barrier

---

#### public int await()
throws
InterruptedException
,

BrokenBarrierException

Waits until all

parties

have invoked

await

on this barrier.

If the current thread is not the last to arrive then it is
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of the following things happens:

- The last thread arrives; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread; or

Some other thread

interrupts

one of the other waiting threads; or

Some other thread times out while waiting for barrier; or

Some other thread invokes

reset()

on this barrier.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

If the barrier is

reset()

while any thread is waiting,
or if the barrier

is broken

when

await

is invoked, or while any thread is waiting, then

BrokenBarrierException

is thrown.

If any thread is

interrupted

while waiting,
then all other waiting threads will throw

BrokenBarrierException

and the barrier is placed in the broken
state.

If the current thread is the last thread to arrive, and a
non-null barrier action was supplied in the constructor, then the
current thread runs the action before allowing the other threads to
continue.
If an exception occurs during the barrier action then that exception
will be propagated in the current thread and the barrier is placed in
the broken state.

**Returns:**
- the arrival index of the current thread, where index

getParties() - 1

indicates the first
to arrive and zero indicates the last to arrive

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if the current thread was interrupted
while waiting
- BrokenBarrierException

- if

another

thread was
interrupted or timed out while the current thread was
waiting, or the barrier was reset, or the barrier was
broken when

await

was called, or the barrier
action (if present) failed due to an exception

---

#### public int await​(long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException
,

BrokenBarrierException
,

TimeoutException

Waits until all

parties

have invoked

await

on this barrier, or the specified waiting time elapses.

If the current thread is not the last to arrive then it is
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of the following things happens:

- The last thread arrives; or

The specified timeout elapses; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread; or

Some other thread

interrupts

one of the other waiting threads; or

Some other thread times out while waiting for barrier; or

Some other thread invokes

reset()

on this barrier.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

If the specified waiting time elapses then

TimeoutException

is thrown. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the
method will not wait at all.

If the barrier is

reset()

while any thread is waiting,
or if the barrier

is broken

when

await

is invoked, or while any thread is waiting, then

BrokenBarrierException

is thrown.

If any thread is

interrupted

while
waiting, then all other waiting threads will throw

BrokenBarrierException

and the barrier is placed in the broken
state.

If the current thread is the last thread to arrive, and a
non-null barrier action was supplied in the constructor, then the
current thread runs the action before allowing the other threads to
continue.
If an exception occurs during the barrier action then that exception
will be propagated in the current thread and the barrier is placed in
the broken state.

**Parameters:**
- timeout

- the time to wait for the barrier
- unit

- the time unit of the timeout parameter

**Returns:**
- the arrival index of the current thread, where index

getParties() - 1

indicates the first
to arrive and zero indicates the last to arrive

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if the current thread was interrupted
while waiting
- TimeoutException

- if the specified timeout elapses.
In this case the barrier will be broken.
- BrokenBarrierException

- if

another

thread was
interrupted or timed out while the current thread was
waiting, or the barrier was reset, or the barrier was broken
when

await

was called, or the barrier action (if
present) failed due to an exception

---

#### public boolean isBroken()

Queries if this barrier is in a broken state.

**Returns:**
- true

if one or more parties broke out of this
barrier due to interruption or timeout since
construction or the last reset, or a barrier action
failed due to an exception;

false

otherwise.

---

#### public void reset()

Resets the barrier to its initial state. If any parties are
currently waiting at the barrier, they will return with a

BrokenBarrierException

. Note that resets

after

a breakage has occurred for other reasons can be complicated to
carry out; threads need to re-synchronize in some other way,
and choose one to perform the reset. It may be preferable to
instead create a new barrier for subsequent use.

---

#### public int getNumberWaiting()

Returns the number of parties currently waiting at the barrier.
This method is primarily useful for debugging and assertions.

**Returns:**
- the number of parties currently blocked in

await()

Waits until all

parties

have invoked

await

on this barrier, or the specified waiting time elapses.

If the current thread is not the last to arrive then it is
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of the following things happens:

- The last thread arrives; or

The specified timeout elapses; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the current thread; or

Some other thread

interrupts

one of the other waiting threads; or

Some other thread times out while waiting for barrier; or

Some other thread invokes

reset()

on this barrier.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while waiting

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

If the specified waiting time elapses then

TimeoutException

is thrown. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the
method will not wait at all.

If the barrier is

- isBroken

```java
public boolean isBroken()
```

Queries if this barrier is in a broken state.

**Returns:** true

if one or more parties broke out of this
barrier due to interruption or timeout since
construction or the last reset, or a barrier action
failed due to an exception;

false

otherwise.

- reset

```java
public void reset()
```

Resets the barrier to its initial state. If any parties are
currently waiting at the barrier, they will return with a

BrokenBarrierException

. Note that resets

after

a breakage has occurred for other reasons can be complicated to
carry out; threads need to re-synchronize in some other way,
and choose one to perform the reset. It may be preferable to
instead create a new barrier for subsequent use.
