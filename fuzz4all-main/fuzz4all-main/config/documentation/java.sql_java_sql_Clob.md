# Interface Clob

**Source:** `java.sql\java\sql\Clob.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Clob
```

The mapping in the Java™ programming language
for the SQL

CLOB

type.
An SQL

CLOB

is a built-in type
that stores a Character Large Object as a column value in a row of
a database table.
By default drivers implement a

Clob

object using an SQL

locator(CLOB)

, which means that a

Clob

object
contains a logical pointer to the SQL

CLOB

data rather than
the data itself. A

Clob

object is valid for the duration
of the transaction in which it was created.

The

Clob

interface provides methods for getting the
length of an SQL

CLOB

(Character Large Object) value,
for materializing a

CLOB

value on the client, and for
searching for a substring or

CLOB

object within a

CLOB

value.
Methods in the interfaces

ResultSet

,

CallableStatement

, and

PreparedStatement

, such as

getClob

and

setClob

allow a programmer to
access an SQL

CLOB

value. In addition, this interface
has methods for updating a

CLOB

value.

All methods on the

Clob

interface must be
fully implemented if the JDBC driver supports the data type.

. If the end of the

Clob

value is reached
while writing characters to the stream, then the length of the

value will be increased to accommodate the extra characters.

If the value specified for

pos

is greater than the length+1 of the

CLOB

value then the
behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw an

SQLException

while other drivers may support this
operation.

setCharacterStream

```java
Writer
setCharacterStream​(long pos)
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves a stream to be used to write a stream of Unicode characters
to the

CLOB

value that this

Clob

object
represents, at position

pos

. Characters written to the stream
will overwrite the existing characters
in the

Clob

object starting at the position

pos

. If the end of the

Clob

value is reached
while writing characters to the stream, then the length of the

Clob

value will be increased to accommodate the extra characters.

Note:

If the value specified for

pos

is greater than the length+1 of the

CLOB

value then the
behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw an

SQLException

while other drivers may support this
operation.

**Parameters:** pos

- the position at which to start writing to the

CLOB

value; The first position is 1
**Returns:** a stream to which Unicode encoded characters can be written
**Throws:** SQLException

- if there is an error accessing the

CLOB

value or if pos is less than 1
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver
does not support this method
**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** getCharacterStream()

#### setCharacterStream

Writer

setCharacterStream​(long pos)
throws

SQLException

Retrieves a stream to be used to write a stream of Unicode characters
to the

CLOB

value that this

Clob

object
represents, at position

pos

. Characters written to the stream
will overwrite the existing characters
in the

Clob

object starting at the position

pos

. If the end of the

Clob

value is reached
while writing characters to the stream, then the length of the

Clob

value will be increased to accommodate the extra characters.

Note:

If the value specified for

pos

is greater than the length+1 of the

CLOB

value then the
behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw an

SQLException

pos

is greater than the length+1 of the

CLOB

value then the

truncate

```java
void truncate​(long len)
throws
SQLException
```

Truncates the

CLOB

value that this

Clob

designates to have a length of

len

characters.

Note:

If the value specified for

pos

is greater than the length+1 of the

CLOB

value then the
behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw an

SQLException

while other drivers may support this
operation.

**Parameters:** len

- the length, in characters, to which the

CLOB

value
should be truncated
**Throws:** SQLException

- if there is an error accessing the

CLOB

value or if len is less than 0
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver
does not support this method
**Since:** 1.4

#### truncate

void truncate​(long len)
throws

SQLException

Truncates the

CLOB

value that this

Clob

designates to have a length of

len

characters.

Note:

If the value specified for

pos

is greater than the length+1 of the

CLOB

value then the
behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw an

SQLException

operation.

free

```java
void free()
throws
SQLException
```

This method releases the resources that the

Clob

object
holds. The object is invalid once the

free

method
is called.

After

free

has been called, any attempt to invoke a
method other than

free

will result in a

SQLException

being thrown. If

free

is called multiple times, the subsequent
calls to

free

are treated as a no-op.

**Throws:** SQLException

- if an error occurs releasing
the Clob's resources
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

- if the JDBC driver
does not support this method
**Since:** 1.6

getCharacterStream

```java
Reader
getCharacterStream​(long pos,
long length)
throws
SQLException
```

Returns a

Reader

object that contains
a partial

Clob

value, starting with the character
specified by pos, which is length characters in length.

**Parameters:** pos

- the offset to the first character of the partial value to
be retrieved. The first character in the Clob is at position 1.
**Parameters:** length

- the length in characters of the partial value to be retrieved.
**Returns:** Reader

through which
the partial

Clob

value can be read.
**Throws:** SQLException

- if pos is less than 1;
or if pos is greater than the number of characters
in the

Clob

;
or if pos + length is greater than the number of
characters in the

Clob
**Throws:** SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
