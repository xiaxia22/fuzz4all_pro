# Class NamingException

**Source:** `java.naming\javax\naming\NamingException.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
NamingException

extends
Exception
```

This is the superclass of all exceptions thrown by
operations in the Context and DirContext interfaces.
The nature of the failure is described by the name of the subclass.
This exception captures the information pinpointing where the operation
failed, such as where resolution last proceeded to.

- Resolved Name. Portion of name that has been resolved.

Resolved Object. Object to which resolution of name proceeded.

Remaining Name. Portion of name that has not been resolved.

Explanation. Detail explaining why name resolution failed.

Root Exception. The exception that caused this naming exception
to be thrown.

null is an acceptable value for any of these fields. When null,
it means that no such information has been recorded for that field.

A NamingException instance is not synchronized against concurrent
multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
a single NamingException instance should lock the object.

This exception has been retrofitted to conform to
the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism. The

root exception

(or

root cause

) is the same object as the

cause

returned by the

Throwable.getCause()

method.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Serializable

detail message for this exception.

**See Also:**
- Throwable.getMessage()

---

#### public void setResolvedName​(
Name
name)

Sets the resolved name field of this exception.

name

is a composite name. If the intent is to set
this field using a compound name or string, you must
"stringify" the compound name, and create a composite
name with a single component using the string. You can then
invoke this method using the resulting composite name.

A copy of

name

is made and stored.
Subsequent changes to

name

do not
affect the copy in this NamingException and vice versa.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The possibly null name to set resolved name to.
If null, it sets the resolved name field to null.

**See Also:**
- getResolvedName()

---

#### public void setRemainingName​(
Name
name)

Sets the remaining name field of this exception.

name

is a composite name. If the intent is to set
this field using a compound name or string, you must
"stringify" the compound name, and create a composite
name with a single component using the string. You can then
invoke this method using the resulting composite name.

A copy of

name

is made and stored.
Subsequent changes to

name

do not
affect the copy in this NamingException and vice versa.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The possibly null name to set remaining name to.
If null, it sets the remaining name field to null.

**See Also:**
- getRemainingName()

,

appendRemainingName(javax.naming.Name)

,

appendRemainingComponent(java.lang.String)

---

#### public void setResolvedObj​(
Object
obj)

Sets the resolved object field of this exception.

**Parameters:**
- obj

- The possibly null object to set resolved object to.
If null, the resolved object field is set to null.

**See Also:**
- getResolvedObj()

---

#### public void appendRemainingComponent​(
String
name)

Add name as the last component in remaining name.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The component to add.
If name is null, this method does not do anything.

**See Also:**
- setRemainingName(javax.naming.Name)

,

getRemainingName()

,

appendRemainingName(javax.naming.Name)

---

#### public void appendRemainingName​(
Name
name)

Add components from 'name' as the last components in
remaining name.

name

is a composite name. If the intent is to append
a compound name, you should "stringify" the compound name
then invoke the overloaded form that accepts a String parameter.

Subsequent changes to

name

do not
affect the remaining name field in this NamingException and vice versa.

**Parameters:**
- name

- The possibly null name containing ordered components to add.
If name is null, this method does not do anything.

**See Also:**

#### public
Throwable
getRootCause()

Retrieves the root cause of this NamingException, if any.
The root cause of a naming exception is used when the service provider
wants to indicate to the caller a non-naming related exception
but at the same time wants to use the NamingException structure
to indicate how far the naming operation proceeded.

This method predates the general-purpose exception chaining facility.
The

getCause()

method is now the preferred means of obtaining
this information.

**Returns:**
- The possibly null exception that caused this naming
exception. If null, it means no root cause has been
set for this naming exception.

**See Also:**
- setRootCause(java.lang.Throwable)

,

rootException

,

getCause()

---

#### public void setRootCause​(
Throwable
e)

Records the root cause of this NamingException.
If

is

this

, this method does not do anything.

This method predates the general-purpose exception chaining facility.
The

initCause(Throwable)

method is now the preferred means
of recording this information.

**Parameters:**
- e

- The possibly null exception that caused the naming
operation to fail. If null, it means this naming
exception has no root cause.

**See Also:**
- getRootCause()

,

rootException

,

initCause(java.lang.Throwable)

---

#### public
Throwable
getCause()

Returns the cause of this exception. The cause is the
throwable that caused this naming exception to be thrown.
Returns

null

if the cause is nonexistent or
unknown.

**Overrides:**
- getCause

in class

Throwable

- the cause of this exception, or

null

if the
cause is nonexistent or unknown.

**See Also:**
- initCause(Throwable)

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public
Throwable
initCause​(
Throwable
cause)

Initializes the cause of this exception to the specified value.
The cause is the throwable that caused this naming exception to be
thrown.

This method may be called at most once.

**Overrides:**
- initCause

in class

Throwable

**Parameters:**
- cause

- the cause, which is saved for later retrieval by
the

getCause()

method. A

null

value
indicates that the cause is nonexistent or unknown.

**Returns:**
- a reference to this

NamingException

instance.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

cause

is this
exception. (A throwable cannot be its own cause.)
- IllegalStateException

- if this method has already
been called on this exception.

**See Also:**
- getCause()

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public
String
toString()

Generates the string representation of this exception.
The string representation consists of this exception's class name,
its detailed message, and if it has a root cause, the string
representation of the root cause exception, followed by
the remaining name (if it is not null).
This string is used for debugging and not meant to be interpreted
programmatically.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Throwable

**Returns:**
- The non-null string containing the string representation
of this exception.

---

#### public
String
toString​(boolean detail)

Generates the string representation in more detail.
