# Class LocateRegistry

**Source:** `java.rmi\java\rmi\registry\LocateRegistry.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
LocateRegistry

extends
Object
```

LocateRegistry

is used to obtain a reference to a bootstrap
remote object registry on a particular host (including the local host), or
to create a remote object registry that accepts calls on a specific port.

Note that a

getRegistry

call does not actually make a
connection to the remote host. It simply creates a local reference to
the remote registry and will succeed even if no registry is running on
the remote host. Therefore, a subsequent method invocation to a remote
registry returned as a result of this method may fail.

**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** Registry
