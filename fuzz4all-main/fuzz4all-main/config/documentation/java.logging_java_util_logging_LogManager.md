# Class LogManager

**Source:** `java.logging\java\util\logging\LogManager.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
LogManager

extends
Object
```

There is a single global LogManager object that is used to
maintain a set of shared state about Loggers and log services.

This LogManager object:

- Manages a hierarchical namespace of Logger objects. All
named Loggers are stored in this namespace.

Manages a set of logging control properties. These are
simple key-value pairs that can be used by Handlers and
other logging objects to configure themselves.

The global LogManager object can be retrieved using LogManager.getLogManager().
The LogManager object is created during class initialization and
cannot subsequently be changed.

At startup the LogManager class is located using the
java.util.logging.manager system property.

LogManager Configuration

A LogManager initializes the logging configuration via
the

readConfiguration()

method during LogManager initialization.
By default, LogManager default configuration is used.
The logging configuration read by LogManager must be in the

properties file

format.

The LogManager defines two optional system properties that allow control over
the initial configuration, as specified in the

readConfiguration()

method:

- "java.util.logging.config.class"

"java.util.logging.config.file"

These two system properties may be specified on the command line to the "java"
command, or as system property definitions passed to JNI_CreateJavaVM.

The

properties

for loggers and Handlers will have
names starting with the dot-separated name for the handler or logger.

The global logging properties may include:

- A property "handlers". This defines a whitespace or comma separated
list of class names for handler classes to load and register as
handlers on the root Logger (the Logger named ""). Each class
name must be for a Handler class which has a default constructor.
Note that these Handlers may be created lazily, when they are
first used.

A property "<logger>.handlers". This defines a whitespace or
comma separated list of class names for handlers classes to
load and register as handlers to the specified logger. Each class
name must be for a Handler class which has a default constructor.
Note that these Handlers may be created lazily, when they are
first used.

A property "<logger>.handlers.ensureCloseOnReset". This defines a
a boolean value. If "<logger>.handlers" is not defined or is empty,
this property is ignored. Otherwise it defaults to

true

. When the
value is

true

, the handlers associated with the logger are guaranteed
to be closed on

reset()

and shutdown. This can be turned off
by explicitly setting "<logger>.handlers.ensureCloseOnReset=false" in
the configuration. Note that turning this property off causes the risk of
introducing a resource leak, as the logger may get garbage collected before

reset()

is called, thus preventing its handlers from being closed
on

reset()

. In that case it is the responsibility of the application
to ensure that the handlers are closed before the logger is garbage
collected.

A property "<logger>.useParentHandlers". This defines a boolean
value. By default every logger calls its parent in addition to
handling the logging message itself, this often result in messages
being handled by the root logger as well. When setting this property
to false a Handler needs to be configured for this logger otherwise
no logging messages are delivered.

A property "config". This property is intended to allow
arbitrary configuration code to be run. The property defines a
whitespace or comma separated list of class names. A new instance will be
created for each named class. The default constructor of each class
may execute arbitrary code to update the logging configuration, such as
setting logger levels, adding handlers, adding filters, etc.

Note that all classes loaded during LogManager configuration are
first searched on the system class path before any user class path.
That includes the LogManager class, any config classes, and any
handler classes.

Loggers are organized into a naming hierarchy based on their
dot separated names. Thus "a.b.c" is a child of "a.b", but
"a.b1" and a.b2" are peers.

All properties whose names end with ".level" are assumed to define
log levels for Loggers. Thus "foo.level" defines a log level for
the logger called "foo" and (recursively) for any of its children
in the naming hierarchy. Log Levels are applied in the order they
are defined in the properties file. Thus level settings for child
nodes in the tree should come after settings for their parents.
The property name ".level" can be used to set the level for the
root of the tree.

All methods on the LogManager object are multi-thread safe.

### Field Details

#### public static final
String
LOGGING_MXBEAN_NAME

String representation of the

ObjectName

for the management interface
for the logging facility.

**See Also:**
- PlatformLoggingMXBean

,

Constant Field Values

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

### Constructor Details

#### protected LogManager()

Protected constructor. This is protected so that container applications
(such as J2EE containers) can subclass the object. It is non-public as
it is intended that there only be one LogManager object, whose value is
retrieved by calling LogManager.getLogManager.

---

### Method Details

#### public static
LogManager
getLogManager()

Returns the global LogManager object.

**Returns:**
- the global LogManager object

---

#### public boolean addLogger​(
Logger
logger)

Add a named logger. This does nothing and returns false if a logger
with the same name is already registered.

The Logger factory methods call this method to register each
newly created Logger.

The application should retain its own reference to the Logger
object to avoid it being garbage collected. The LogManager
may only retain a weak reference.

**Parameters:**
- logger

- the new logger.

**Returns:**
- true if the argument logger was registered successfully,
false if a logger of that name already exists.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the logger name is null.

---

#### public
Logger
getLogger​(
String
name)

Method to find a named logger.

Note that since untrusted code may create loggers with
arbitrary names this method should not be relied on to
find Loggers for security sensitive logging.
It is also important to note that the Logger associated with the
String

name

may be garbage collected at any time if there
is no strong reference to the Logger. The caller of this method
must check the return value for null in order to properly handle
the case where the Logger has been garbage collected.

**Parameters:**
- name

- name of the logger

**Returns:**
- matching logger or null if none is found

---

#### public
Enumeration
<
String
> getLoggerNames()

Get an enumeration of known logger names.

Note: Loggers may be added dynamically as new classes are loaded.
This method only reports on the loggers that are currently registered.
It is also important to note that this method only returns the name
of a Logger, not a strong reference to the Logger itself.
The returned String does nothing to prevent the Logger from being
garbage collected. In particular, if the returned name is passed
to

LogManager.getLogger()

, then the caller must check the
return value from

LogManager.getLogger()

for null to properly
handle the case where the Logger has been garbage collected in the
time since its name was returned by this method.

**Returns:**
- enumeration of logger name strings

---

#### public void readConfiguration()
throws
IOException
,

SecurityException

Reads and initializes the logging configuration.

If the "java.util.logging.config.class" system property is set, then the
property value is treated as a class name. The given class will be
loaded, an object will be instantiated, and that object's constructor
is responsible for reading in the initial configuration. (That object
may use other system properties to control its configuration.) The
alternate configuration class can use

readConfiguration(InputStream)

to define properties in the LogManager.

If "java.util.logging.config.class" system property is

not

set,
then this method will read the initial configuration from a properties
file and calls the

readConfiguration(InputStream)

method to initialize
the configuration. The "java.util.logging.config.file" system property can be used
to specify the properties file that will be read as the initial configuration;
if not set, then the LogManager default configuration is used.
The default configuration is typically loaded from the
properties file "

conf/logging.properties

" in the Java installation
directory.

Any

registered configuration
listener

will be invoked after the properties are read.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
- IOException

- if there are IO problems reading the configuration.

**API Note:**
- This

readConfiguration

method should only be used for
initializing the configuration during LogManager initialization or
used with the "java.util.logging.config.class" property.
When this method is called after loggers have been created, and
the "java.util.logging.config.class" system property is not set, all
existing loggers will be

reset

. Then any
existing loggers that have a level property specified in the new
configuration stream will be

set

to the specified log level.

To properly update the logging configuration, use the

updateConfiguration(java.util.function.Function)

or

updateConfiguration(java.io.InputStream, java.util.function.Function)

methods instead.

---

#### public void reset()
throws
SecurityException

Reset the logging configuration.

For all named loggers, the reset operation removes and closes
all Handlers and (except for the root logger) sets the level
to

null

. The root logger's level is set to

Level.INFO

.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

**API Note:**
- Calling this method also clears the LogManager

properties

. The

updateConfiguration(Function)

or

updateConfiguration(InputStream, Function)

method can be used to
properly update to a new configuration.

---

#### public void readConfiguration​(
InputStream
ins)
throws
IOException
,

SecurityException

Reads and initializes the logging configuration from the given input stream.

Any

registered configuration
listener

will be invoked after the properties are read.

**Parameters:**
- ins

- stream to read properties from

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
- IOException

- if there are problems reading from the stream,
or the given stream is not in the

properties file

format.

**API Note:**
- This

readConfiguration

method should only be used for
initializing the configuration during LogManager initialization or
used with the "java.util.logging.config.class" property.
When this method is called after loggers have been created, all
existing loggers will be

reset

. Then any
existing loggers that have a level property specified in the
given input stream will be

set

to the specified log level.

To properly update the logging configuration, use the

updateConfiguration(java.util.function.Function)

or

updateConfiguration(java.io.InputStream, java.util.function.Function)

method instead.

---

#### public void updateConfiguration​(
Function
<
String
,​
BiFunction
<
String
,​
String
,​
String
>> mapper)
throws
IOException

Updates the logging configuration.

If the "java.util.logging.config.file" system property is set,
then the property value specifies the properties file to be read
as the new configuration. Otherwise, the LogManager default
configuration is used.

The default configuration is typically loaded from the
properties file "

conf/logging.properties

" in the
Java installation directory.

This method reads the new configuration and calls the

updateConfiguration(ins, mapper)

method to
update the configuration.

**Parameters:**
- mapper

- a functional interface that takes a configuration
key

k

and returns a function

f(o,n)

whose returned
value will be applied to the resulting configuration. The
function

f

may return

null

to indicate that the property

k

will not be added to the resulting configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

then

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

is
assumed.

For each

k

, the mapped function

f

will
be invoked with the value associated with

k

in the old
configuration (i.e

o

) and the value associated with

k

in the new configuration (i.e.

n

).

A

null

value for

o

or

n

indicates that no
value was present for

k

in the corresponding configuration.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control"), or
does not have the permissions required to set up the
configuration (e.g. open file specified for FileHandlers
etc...)
- NullPointerException

- if

mapper

returns a

null

function when invoked.
- IOException

- if there are problems reading from the
logging configuration file.

**See Also:**
- updateConfiguration(java.io.InputStream, java.util.function.Function)

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- This method updates the logging configuration from reading
a properties file and ignores the "java.util.logging.config.class"
system property. The "java.util.logging.config.class" property is
only used by the

readConfiguration()

method to load a custom
configuration class as an initial configuration.

#### public void updateConfiguration​(
InputStream
ins,

Function
<
String
,​
BiFunction
<
String
,​
String
,​
String
>> mapper)
throws
IOException

Updates the logging configuration.

For each configuration key in the

existing configuration

and
the given input stream configuration, the given

mapper

function
is invoked to map from the configuration key to a function,

f(o,n)

, that takes the old value and new value and returns
the resulting value to be applied in the resulting configuration,
as specified in the table below.

Let

k

be a configuration key in the old or new configuration,

o

be the old value (i.e. the value associated
with

k

in the old configuration),

n

be the
new value (i.e. the value associated with

k

in the new
configuration), and

f

be the function returned
by

mapper.apply(

k

)

: then

v = f(o,n)

is the
resulting value. If

v

is not

null

, then a property

k

with value

v

will be added to the resulting configuration.
Otherwise, it will be omitted.

A

null

value may be passed to function

f

to indicate that the corresponding configuration has no
configuration key

k

.
The function

f

may return

null

to indicate that
there will be no value associated with

k

in the resulting
configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

, then

v

will be set to

n

.

LogManager

properties

are
updated with the resulting value in the resulting configuration.

The registered

configuration
listeners

will be invoked after the configuration is successfully updated.

Updating configuration properties

Property

Resulting Behavior

<logger>.level

- If the resulting configuration defines a level for a logger and
if the resulting level is different than the level specified in the
the old configuration, or not specified in
the old configuration, then if the logger exists or if children for
that logger exist, the level for that logger will be updated,
and the change propagated to any existing logger children.
This may cause the logger to be created, if necessary.
- If the old configuration defined a level for a logger, and the
resulting configuration doesn't, then this change will not be
propagated to existing loggers, if any.
To completely replace a configuration - the caller should therefore
call

reset

to empty the current configuration,
before calling

updateConfiguration

.

<logger>.useParentHandlers

- If either the resulting or the old value for the useParentHandlers
property is not null, then if the logger exists or if children for
that logger exist, that logger will be updated to the resulting
value.
The value of the useParentHandlers property is the value specified
in the configuration; if not specified, the default is true.

<logger>.handlers

- If the resulting configuration defines a list of handlers for a
logger, and if the resulting list is different than the list
specified in the old configuration for that logger (that could be
empty), then if the logger exists or its children exist, the
handlers associated with that logger are closed and removed and
the new handlers will be created per the resulting configuration
and added to that logger, creating that logger if necessary.
- If the old configuration defined some handlers for a logger, and
the resulting configuration doesn't, if that logger exists,
its handlers will be removed and closed.
- Changing the list of handlers on an existing logger will cause all
its previous handlers to be removed and closed, regardless of whether
they had been created from the configuration or programmatically.
The old handlers will be replaced by new handlers, if any.

<handler-name>.*

- Properties configured/changed on handler classes will only affect
newly created handlers. If a node is configured with the same list
of handlers in the old and the resulting configuration, then these
handlers will remain unchanged.

config

and any other property

- The resulting value for these property will be stored in the
LogManager properties, but

updateConfiguration

will not parse
or process their values.

Example mapper functions:

- Replace all logging properties with the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

:

this is equivalent to passing a null

mapper

parameter.
- Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the
new value if

k

exists in the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n == null ? o : n)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(oldc); result.putAll(newc)

.
- Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the old
value if

k

exists in the old configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> o == null ? n : o)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(newc); result.putAll(oldc)

.
- Replace all properties with the new configuration except the handler
property to configure Logger's handler that is not root logger:

```java
(k) -> k.endsWith(".handlers")

? ((o, n) -> (o == null ? n : o))

: ((o, n) -> n)
```

To completely reinitialize a configuration, an application can first call

reset

to fully remove the old configuration, followed by

updateConfiguration

to initialize the new configuration.

**Parameters:**
- ins

- a stream to read properties from
- mapper

- a functional interface that takes a configuration
key

k

and returns a function

f(o,n)

whose returned
value will be applied to the resulting configuration. The
function

f

may return

null

to indicate that the property

k

will not be added to the resulting configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

then

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

is
assumed.

For each

k

, the mapped function

f

will
be invoked with the value associated with

k

in the old
configuration (i.e

o

) and the value associated with

k

in the new configuration (i.e.

n

).

A

null

value for

o

or

n

indicates that no
value was present for

k

in the corresponding configuration.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control"), or
does not have the permissions required to set up the
configuration (e.g. open files specified for FileHandlers)
- NullPointerException

- if

ins

is null or if

mapper

returns a null function when invoked.
- IOException

- if there are problems reading from the stream,
or the given stream is not in the

properties file

format.

#### public
String
getProperty​(
String
name)

Get the value of a logging property.
The method returns null if the property is not found.

**Parameters:**
- name

- property name

**Returns:**
- property value

---

#### public void checkAccess()
throws
SecurityException

Check that the current context is trusted to modify the logging
configuration. This requires LoggingPermission("control").

If the check fails we throw a SecurityException, otherwise
we return normally.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

---

#### @Deprecated
(
since
="9")
public static

getLoggingMXBean()

Returns

LoggingMXBean

for managing loggers.

**Returns:**
- a

LoggingMXBean

object.

- PlatformLoggingMXBean

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### public
LogManager
addConfigurationListener​(
Runnable
listener)

Adds a configuration listener to be invoked each time the logging
configuration is read.
If the listener is already registered the method does nothing.

The listener is invoked with privileges that are restricted by the
calling context of this method.
The order in which the listeners are invoked is unspecified.

It is recommended that listeners do not throw errors or exceptions.

If a listener terminates with an uncaught error or exception then
the first exception will be propagated to the caller of

readConfiguration()

(or

readConfiguration(java.io.InputStream)

)
after all listeners have been invoked.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- A configuration listener that will be invoked after the
configuration changed.

**Returns:**
- This LogManager.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if the
caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
- NullPointerException

- if the listener is null.

**Since:**
- 9

**Implementation Note:**
- If more than one listener terminates with an uncaught error or
exception, an implementation may record the additional errors or
exceptions as

suppressed exceptions

.

---

#### public void removeConfigurationListener​(
Runnable
listener)

Removes a previously registered configuration listener.

Returns silently if the listener is not found.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- the configuration listener to remove.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the listener is null.
- SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if the
caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

public class

LogManager

extends

Object

There is a single global LogManager object that is used to
maintain a set of shared state about Loggers and log services.

This LogManager object:

- Manages a hierarchical namespace of Logger objects. All
named Loggers are stored in this namespace.

Manages a set of logging control properties. These are
simple key-value pairs that can be used by Handlers and
other logging objects to configure themselves.

The global LogManager object can be retrieved using LogManager.getLogManager().
The LogManager object is created during class initialization and
cannot subsequently be changed.

At startup the LogManager class is located using the
java.util.logging.manager system property.

LogManager Configuration

A LogManager initializes the logging configuration via
the

readConfiguration()

method during LogManager initialization.
By default, LogManager default configuration is used.
The logging configuration read by LogManager must be in the

properties file

format.

The LogManager defines two optional system properties that allow control over
the initial configuration, as specified in the

readConfiguration()

method:

- "java.util.logging.config.class"

"java.util.logging.config.file"

These two system properties may be specified on the command line to the "java"
command, or as system property definitions passed to JNI_CreateJavaVM.

The

properties

for loggers and Handlers will have
names starting with the dot-separated name for the handler or logger.

The global logging properties may include:

- A property "handlers". This defines a whitespace or comma separated
list of class names for handler classes to load and register as
handlers on the root Logger (the Logger named ""). Each class
name must be for a Handler class which has a default constructor.
Note that these Handlers may be created lazily, when they are
first used.

A property "<logger>.handlers". This defines a whitespace or
comma separated list of class names for handlers classes to
load and register as handlers to the specified logger. Each class
name must be for a Handler class which has a default constructor.
Note that these Handlers may be created lazily, when they are
first used.

A property "<logger>.handlers.ensureCloseOnReset". This defines a
a boolean value. If "<logger>.handlers" is not defined or is empty,
this property is ignored. Otherwise it defaults to

true

. When the
value is

true

, the handlers associated with the logger are guaranteed
to be closed on

reset()

and shutdown. This can be turned off
by explicitly setting "<logger>.handlers.ensureCloseOnReset=false" in
the configuration. Note that turning this property off causes the risk of
introducing a resource leak, as the logger may get garbage collected before

reset()

is called, thus preventing its handlers from being closed
on

reset()

. In that case it is the responsibility of the application
to ensure that the handlers are closed before the logger is garbage
collected.

A property "<logger>.useParentHandlers". This defines a boolean
value. By default every logger calls its parent in addition to
handling the logging message itself, this often result in messages
being handled by the root logger as well. When setting this property
to false a Handler needs to be configured for this logger otherwise
no logging messages are delivered.

A property "config". This property is intended to allow
arbitrary configuration code to be run. The property defines a
whitespace or comma separated list of class names. A new instance will be
created for each named class. The default constructor of each class
may execute arbitrary code to update the logging configuration, such as
setting logger levels, adding handlers, adding filters, etc.

Note that all classes loaded during LogManager configuration are
first searched on the system class path before any user class path.
That includes the LogManager class, any config classes, and any
handler classes.

Loggers are organized into a naming hierarchy based on their
dot separated names. Thus "a.b.c" is a child of "a.b", but
"a.b1" and a.b2" are peers.

All properties whose names end with ".level" are assumed to define
log levels for Loggers. Thus "foo.level" defines a log level for
the logger called "foo" and (recursively) for any of its children
in the naming hierarchy. Log Levels are applied in the order they
are defined in the properties file. Thus level settings for child
nodes in the tree should come after settings for their parents.
The property name ".level" can be used to set the level for the
root of the tree.

All methods on the LogManager object are multi-thread safe.

This LogManager object:

- Manages a hierarchical namespace of Logger objects. All
named Loggers are stored in this namespace.

Manages a set of logging control properties. These are
simple key-value pairs that can be used by Handlers and
other logging objects to configure themselves.

The global LogManager object can be retrieved using LogManager.getLogManager().
The LogManager object is created during class initialization and
cannot subsequently be changed.

At startup the LogManager class is located using the
java.util.logging.manager system property.

LogManager Configuration

A LogManager initializes the logging configuration via
the

readConfiguration()

method during LogManager initialization.
By default, LogManager default configuration is used.
The logging configuration read by LogManager must be in the

properties file

format.

The LogManager defines two optional system properties that allow control over
the initial configuration, as specified in the

readConfiguration()

method:

- "java.util.logging.config.class"

"java.util.logging.config.file"

These two system properties may be specified on the command line to the "java"
command, or as system property definitions passed to JNI_CreateJavaVM.

The

properties

for loggers and Handlers will have
names starting with the dot-separated name for the handler or logger.

The global logging properties may include:

- A property "handlers". This defines a whitespace or comma separated
list of class names for handler classes to load and register as
handlers on the root Logger (the Logger named ""). Each class
name must be for a Handler class which has a default constructor.
Note that these Handlers may be created lazily, when they are
first used.

A property "<logger>.handlers". This defines a whitespace or
comma separated list of class names for handlers classes to
load and register as handlers to the specified logger. Each class
name must be for a Handler class which has a default constructor.
Note that these Handlers may be created lazily, when they are
first used.

A property "<logger>.handlers.ensureCloseOnReset". This defines a
a boolean value. If "<logger>.handlers" is not defined or is empty,
this property is ignored. Otherwise it defaults to

true

. When the
value is

true

, the handlers associated with the logger are guaranteed
to be closed on

reset()

and shutdown. This can be turned off
by explicitly setting "<logger>.handlers.ensureCloseOnReset=false" in
the configuration. Note that turning this property off causes the risk of
introducing a resource leak, as the logger may get garbage collected before

reset()

is called, thus preventing its handlers from being closed
on

reset()

. In that case it is the responsibility of the application
to ensure that the handlers are closed before the logger is garbage
collected.

A property "<logger>.useParentHandlers". This defines a boolean
value. By default every logger calls its parent in addition to
handling the logging message itself, this often result in messages
being handled by the root logger as well. When setting this property
to false a Handler needs to be configured for this logger otherwise
no logging messages are delivered.

A property "config". This property is intended to allow
arbitrary configuration code to be run. The property defines a
whitespace or comma separated list of class names. A new instance will be
created for each named class. The default constructor of each class
may execute arbitrary code to update the logging configuration, such as
setting logger levels, adding handlers, adding filters, etc.

Note that all classes loaded during LogManager configuration are
first searched on the system class path before any user class path.
That includes the LogManager class, any config classes, and any
handler classes.

Loggers are organized into a naming hierarchy based on their
dot separated names. Thus "a.b.c" is a child of "a.b", but
"a.b1" and a.b2" are peers.

All properties whose names end with ".level" are assumed to define
log levels for Loggers. Thus "foo.level" defines a log level for
the logger called "foo" and (recursively) for any of its children
in the naming hierarchy. Log Levels are applied in the order they
are defined in the properties file. Thus level settings for child
nodes in the tree should come after settings for their parents.
The property name ".level" can be used to set the level for the
root of the tree.

All methods on the LogManager object are multi-thread safe.

Manages a hierarchical namespace of Logger objects. All
named Loggers are stored in this namespace.

A property "<logger>.handlers". This defines a whitespace or

load and register as handlers to the specified logger. Each class
name must be for a Handler class which has a default constructor.
Note that these Handlers may be created lazily, when they are
first used.

A property "<logger>.handlers.ensureCloseOnReset". This defines a
a boolean value. If "<logger>.handlers" is not defined or is empty,
this property is ignored. Otherwise it defaults to

. When the
value is

#### Methods declared in class java.lang. Object

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- LOGGING_MXBEAN_NAME

```java
public static final
String
LOGGING_MXBEAN_NAME
```

String representation of the

ObjectName

for the management interface
for the logging facility.

**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** PlatformLoggingMXBean

,

Constant Field Values

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- LogManager

```java
protected LogManager()
```

Protected constructor. This is protected so that container applications
(such as J2EE containers) can subclass the object. It is non-public as
it is intended that there only be one LogManager object, whose value is
retrieved by calling LogManager.getLogManager.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getLogManager

```java
public static
LogManager
getLogManager()
```

Returns the global LogManager object.

**Returns:** the global LogManager object

- addLogger

```java
public boolean addLogger​(
Logger
logger)
```

Add a named logger. This does nothing and returns false if a logger
with the same name is already registered.

The Logger factory methods call this method to register each
newly created Logger.

The application should retain its own reference to the Logger
object to avoid it being garbage collected. The LogManager
may only retain a weak reference.

**Parameters:** logger

- the new logger.
**Returns:** true if the argument logger was registered successfully,
false if a logger of that name already exists.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the logger name is null.

- getLogger

```java
public
Logger
getLogger​(
String
name)
```

Method to find a named logger.

Note that since untrusted code may create loggers with
arbitrary names this method should not be relied on to
find Loggers for security sensitive logging.
It is also important to note that the Logger associated with the
String

name

may be garbage collected at any time if there
is no strong reference to the Logger. The caller of this method
must check the return value for null in order to properly handle
the case where the Logger has been garbage collected.

**Parameters:** name

- name of the logger
**Returns:** matching logger or null if none is found

- getLoggerNames

```java
public
Enumeration
<
String
> getLoggerNames()
```

Get an enumeration of known logger names.

Note: Loggers may be added dynamically as new classes are loaded.
This method only reports on the loggers that are currently registered.
It is also important to note that this method only returns the name
of a Logger, not a strong reference to the Logger itself.
The returned String does nothing to prevent the Logger from being
garbage collected. In particular, if the returned name is passed
to

LogManager.getLogger()

, then the caller must check the
return value from

LogManager.getLogger()

for null to properly
handle the case where the Logger has been garbage collected in the
time since its name was returned by this method.

**Returns:** enumeration of logger name strings

- readConfiguration

```java
public void readConfiguration()
throws
IOException
,

SecurityException
```

Reads and initializes the logging configuration.

If the "java.util.logging.config.class" system property is set, then the
property value is treated as a class name. The given class will be
loaded, an object will be instantiated, and that object's constructor
is responsible for reading in the initial configuration. (That object
may use other system properties to control its configuration.) The
alternate configuration class can use

readConfiguration(InputStream)

to define properties in the LogManager.

If "java.util.logging.config.class" system property is

not

set,
then this method will read the initial configuration from a properties
file and calls the

readConfiguration(InputStream)

method to initialize
the configuration. The "java.util.logging.config.file" system property can be used
to specify the properties file that will be read as the initial configuration;
if not set, then the LogManager default configuration is used.
The default configuration is typically loaded from the
properties file "

conf/logging.properties

" in the Java installation
directory.

Any

registered configuration
listener

will be invoked after the properties are read.

**API Note:** This

readConfiguration

method should only be used for
initializing the configuration during LogManager initialization or
used with the "java.util.logging.config.class" property.
When this method is called after loggers have been created, and
the "java.util.logging.config.class" system property is not set, all
existing loggers will be

reset

. Then any
existing loggers that have a level property specified in the new
configuration stream will be

set

to the specified log level.

To properly update the logging configuration, use the

updateConfiguration(java.util.function.Function)

or

updateConfiguration(java.io.InputStream, java.util.function.Function)

methods instead.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
**Throws:** IOException

- if there are IO problems reading the configuration.

- reset

```java
public void reset()
throws
SecurityException
```

Reset the logging configuration.

For all named loggers, the reset operation removes and closes
all Handlers and (except for the root logger) sets the level
to

null

. The root logger's level is set to

Level.INFO

.

**API Note:** Calling this method also clears the LogManager

properties

. The

updateConfiguration(Function)

or

updateConfiguration(InputStream, Function)

method can be used to
properly update to a new configuration.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

- readConfiguration

```java
public void readConfiguration​(
InputStream
ins)
throws
IOException
,

SecurityException
```

Reads and initializes the logging configuration from the given input stream.

Any

registered configuration
listener

will be invoked after the properties are read.

**API Note:** This

readConfiguration

method should only be used for
initializing the configuration during LogManager initialization or
used with the "java.util.logging.config.class" property.
When this method is called after loggers have been created, all
existing loggers will be

reset

. Then any
existing loggers that have a level property specified in the
given input stream will be

set

to the specified log level.

To properly update the logging configuration, use the

updateConfiguration(java.util.function.Function)

or

updateConfiguration(java.io.InputStream, java.util.function.Function)

method instead.
**Parameters:** ins

- stream to read properties from
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
**Throws:** IOException

- if there are problems reading from the stream,
or the given stream is not in the

properties file

format.

- updateConfiguration

```java
public void updateConfiguration​(
Function
<
String
,​
BiFunction
<
String
,​
String
,​
String
>> mapper)
throws
IOException
```

Updates the logging configuration.

If the "java.util.logging.config.file" system property is set,
then the property value specifies the properties file to be read
as the new configuration. Otherwise, the LogManager default
configuration is used.

The default configuration is typically loaded from the
properties file "

conf/logging.properties

" in the
Java installation directory.

This method reads the new configuration and calls the

updateConfiguration(ins, mapper)

method to
update the configuration.

**API Note:** This method updates the logging configuration from reading
a properties file and ignores the "java.util.logging.config.class"
system property. The "java.util.logging.config.class" property is
only used by the

readConfiguration()

method to load a custom
configuration class as an initial configuration.
**Parameters:** mapper

- a functional interface that takes a configuration
key

k

and returns a function

f(o,n)

whose returned
value will be applied to the resulting configuration. The
function

f

may return

null

to indicate that the property

k

will not be added to the resulting configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

then

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

is
assumed.

For each

k

, the mapped function

f

will
be invoked with the value associated with

k

in the old
configuration (i.e

o

) and the value associated with

k

in the new configuration (i.e.

n

).

A

null

value for

o

or

n

indicates that no
value was present for

k

in the corresponding configuration.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control"), or
does not have the permissions required to set up the
configuration (e.g. open file specified for FileHandlers
etc...)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

mapper

returns a

null

function when invoked.
**Throws:** IOException

- if there are problems reading from the
logging configuration file.
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** updateConfiguration(java.io.InputStream, java.util.function.Function)

- updateConfiguration

```java
public void updateConfiguration​(
InputStream
ins,

Function
<
String
,​
BiFunction
<
String
,​
String
,​
String
>> mapper)
throws
IOException
```

Updates the logging configuration.

For each configuration key in the

existing configuration

and
the given input stream configuration, the given

mapper

function
is invoked to map from the configuration key to a function,

f(o,n)

, that takes the old value and new value and returns
the resulting value to be applied in the resulting configuration,
as specified in the table below.

Let

k

be a configuration key in the old or new configuration,

o

be the old value (i.e. the value associated
with

k

in the old configuration),

n

be the
new value (i.e. the value associated with

k

in the new
configuration), and

f

be the function returned
by

mapper.apply(

k

)

: then

v = f(o,n)

is the
resulting value. If

v

is not

null

, then a property

k

with value

v

will be added to the resulting configuration.
Otherwise, it will be omitted.

A

null

value may be passed to function

f

to indicate that the corresponding configuration has no
configuration key

k

.
The function

f

may return

null

to indicate that
there will be no value associated with

k

in the resulting
configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

, then

v

will be set to

n

.

LogManager

properties

are
updated with the resulting value in the resulting configuration.

The registered

configuration
listeners

will be invoked after the configuration is successfully updated.

Updating configuration properties

Property

Resulting Behavior

<logger>.level

- If the resulting configuration defines a level for a logger and
if the resulting level is different than the level specified in the
the old configuration, or not specified in
the old configuration, then if the logger exists or if children for
that logger exist, the level for that logger will be updated,
and the change propagated to any existing logger children.
This may cause the logger to be created, if necessary.
- If the old configuration defined a level for a logger, and the
resulting configuration doesn't, then this change will not be
propagated to existing loggers, if any.
To completely replace a configuration - the caller should therefore
call

reset

to empty the current configuration,
before calling

updateConfiguration

.

<logger>.useParentHandlers

- If either the resulting or the old value for the useParentHandlers
property is not null, then if the logger exists or if children for
that logger exist, that logger will be updated to the resulting
value.
The value of the useParentHandlers property is the value specified
in the configuration; if not specified, the default is true.

<logger>.handlers

- If the resulting configuration defines a list of handlers for a
logger, and if the resulting list is different than the list
specified in the old configuration for that logger (that could be
empty), then if the logger exists or its children exist, the
handlers associated with that logger are closed and removed and
the new handlers will be created per the resulting configuration
and added to that logger, creating that logger if necessary.
- If the old configuration defined some handlers for a logger, and
the resulting configuration doesn't, if that logger exists,
its handlers will be removed and closed.
- Changing the list of handlers on an existing logger will cause all
its previous handlers to be removed and closed, regardless of whether
they had been created from the configuration or programmatically.
The old handlers will be replaced by new handlers, if any.

<handler-name>.*

- Properties configured/changed on handler classes will only affect
newly created handlers. If a node is configured with the same list
of handlers in the old and the resulting configuration, then these
handlers will remain unchanged.

config

and any other property

- The resulting value for these property will be stored in the
LogManager properties, but

updateConfiguration

will not parse
or process their values.

Example mapper functions:

- Replace all logging properties with the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

:

this is equivalent to passing a null

mapper

parameter.
- Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the
new value if

k

exists in the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n == null ? o : n)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(oldc); result.putAll(newc)

.
- Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the old
value if

k

exists in the old configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> o == null ? n : o)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(newc); result.putAll(oldc)

.
- Replace all properties with the new configuration except the handler
property to configure Logger's handler that is not root logger:

```java
(k) -> k.endsWith(".handlers")

? ((o, n) -> (o == null ? n : o))

: ((o, n) -> n)
```

To completely reinitialize a configuration, an application can first call

reset

to fully remove the old configuration, followed by

updateConfiguration

to initialize the new configuration.

**Parameters:** ins

- a stream to read properties from
**Parameters:** mapper

- a functional interface that takes a configuration
key

k

and returns a function

f(o,n)

whose returned
value will be applied to the resulting configuration. The
function

f

may return

null

to indicate that the property

k

will not be added to the resulting configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

then

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

is
assumed.

For each

k

, the mapped function

f

will
be invoked with the value associated with

k

in the old
configuration (i.e

o

) and the value associated with

k

in the new configuration (i.e.

n

).

A

null

value for

o

or

n

indicates that no
value was present for

k

in the corresponding configuration.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control"), or
does not have the permissions required to set up the
configuration (e.g. open files specified for FileHandlers)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

ins

is null or if

mapper

returns a null function when invoked.
**Throws:** IOException

- if there are problems reading from the stream,
or the given stream is not in the

properties file

format.
**Since:** 9

- getProperty

```java
public
String
getProperty​(
String
name)
```

Get the value of a logging property.
The method returns null if the property is not found.

**Parameters:** name

- property name
**Returns:** property value

- checkAccess

```java
public void checkAccess()
throws
SecurityException
```

Check that the current context is trusted to modify the logging
configuration. This requires LoggingPermission("control").

If the check fails we throw a SecurityException, otherwise
we return normally.

**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

- getLoggingMXBean

```java
@Deprecated
(

```

Deprecated.

java.util.logging.LoggingMXBean

is deprecated and
replaced with

java.lang.management.PlatformLoggingMXBean

. Use

ManagementFactory.getPlatformMXBean

(PlatformLoggingMXBean.class)
instead.

Returns

LoggingMXBean

for managing loggers.

**Returns:** a

LoggingMXBean

object.
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** PlatformLoggingMXBean

- addConfigurationListener

```java
public
LogManager
addConfigurationListener​(
Runnable
listener)
```

Adds a configuration listener to be invoked each time the logging
configuration is read.
If the listener is already registered the method does nothing.

The listener is invoked with privileges that are restricted by the
calling context of this method.
The order in which the listeners are invoked is unspecified.

It is recommended that listeners do not throw errors or exceptions.

If a listener terminates with an uncaught error or exception then
the first exception will be propagated to the caller of

readConfiguration()

(or

readConfiguration(java.io.InputStream)

)
after all listeners have been invoked.

**Implementation Note:** If more than one listener terminates with an uncaught error or
exception, an implementation may record the additional errors or
exceptions as

suppressed exceptions

.
**Parameters:** listener

- A configuration listener that will be invoked after the
configuration changed.
**Returns:** This LogManager.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if the
caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the listener is null.
**Since:** 9

- removeConfigurationListener

```java
public void removeConfigurationListener​(
Runnable
listener)
```

Removes a previously registered configuration listener.

Returns silently if the listener is not found.

**Parameters:** listener

- the configuration listener to remove.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the listener is null.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if the
caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

Reset the logging configuration.

For all named loggers, the reset operation removes and closes
all Handlers and (except for the root logger) sets the level
to

null

. The root logger's level is set to

Level.INFO

.

**API Note:** Calling this method also clears the LogManager

```

Updates the logging configuration.

If the "java.util.logging.config.file" system property is set,
then the property value specifies the properties file to be read
as the new configuration. Otherwise, the LogManager default
configuration is used.

The default configuration is typically loaded from the
properties file "

conf/logging.properties

" in the
Java installation directory.

This method reads the new configuration and calls the

updateConfiguration(ins, mapper)

method to
update the configuration.

**API Note:** This method updates the logging configuration from reading
a properties file and ignores the "java.util.logging.config.class"
system property. The "java.util.logging.config.class" property is
only used by the

readConfiguration()

method to load a custom
configuration class as an initial configuration.
**Parameters:** mapper

- a functional interface that takes a configuration
key

k

and returns a function

f(o,n)

whose returned
value will be applied to the resulting configuration. The
function

f

may return

null

to indicate that the property

k

will not be added to the resulting configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

then

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

is
assumed.

For each

k

, the mapped function

f

will
be invoked with the value associated with

k

in the old
configuration (i.e

o

) and the value associated with

k

in the new configuration (i.e.

n

).

A

null

value for

o

or

n

indicates that no
value was present for

k

in the corresponding configuration.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control"), or
does not have the permissions required to set up the
configuration (e.g. open file specified for FileHandlers
etc...)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

mapper

returns a

null

function when invoked.
**Throws:** IOException

- if there are problems reading from the
logging configuration file.

is invoked to map from the configuration key to a function,

f(o,n)

, that takes the old value and new value and returns
the resulting value to be applied in the resulting configuration,
as specified in the table below.

Let

k

be a configuration key in the old or new configuration,

o

be the old value (i.e. the value associated
with

k

in the old configuration),

n

be the
new value (i.e. the value associated with

k

in the new
configuration), and

f

be the function returned
by

mapper.apply(

k

)

: then

v = f(o,n)

is the
resulting value. If

v

is not

null

, then a property

k

with value

v

will be added to the resulting configuration.
Otherwise, it will be omitted.

A

null

value may be passed to function

f

to indicate that the corresponding configuration has no
configuration key

k

.
The function

f

may return

null

to indicate that
there will be no value associated with

k

in the resulting
configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

, then

v

will be set to

n

.

LogManager

properties

are
updated with the resulting value in the resulting configuration.

The registered

configuration
listeners

will be invoked after the configuration is successfully updated.

Updating configuration properties

Property

Resulting Behavior

<logger>.level

- If the resulting configuration defines a level for a logger and
if the resulting level is different than the level specified in the
the old configuration, or not specified in
the old configuration, then if the logger exists or if children for
that logger exist, the level for that logger will be updated,
and the change propagated to any existing logger children.
This may cause the logger to be created, if necessary.
- If the old configuration defined a level for a logger, and the
resulting configuration doesn't, then this change will not be
propagated to existing loggers, if any.
To completely replace a configuration - the caller should therefore
call

reset

to empty the current configuration,
before calling

updateConfiguration

.

<logger>.useParentHandlers

- If either the resulting or the old value for the useParentHandlers
property is not null, then if the logger exists or if children for
that logger exist, that logger will be updated to the resulting
value.
The value of the useParentHandlers property is the value specified
in the configuration; if not specified, the default is true.

<logger>.handlers

- If the resulting configuration defines a list of handlers for a
logger, and if the resulting list is different than the list
specified in the old configuration for that logger (that could be
empty), then if the logger exists or its children exist, the
handlers associated with that logger are closed and removed and
the new handlers will be created per the resulting configuration
and added to that logger, creating that logger if necessary.
- If the old configuration defined some handlers for a logger, and
the resulting configuration doesn't, if that logger exists,
its handlers will be removed and closed.
- Changing the list of handlers on an existing logger will cause all
its previous handlers to be removed and closed, regardless of whether
they had been created from the configuration or programmatically.
The old handlers will be replaced by new handlers, if any.

<handler-name>.*

- Properties configured/changed on handler classes will only affect
newly created handlers. If a node is configured with the same list
of handlers in the old and the resulting configuration, then these
handlers will remain unchanged.

config

and any other property

- The resulting value for these property will be stored in the
LogManager properties, but

updateConfiguration

will not parse
or process their values.

Example mapper functions:

- Replace all logging properties with the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

:

this is equivalent to passing a null

mapper

parameter.
- Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the
new value if

k

exists in the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n == null ? o : n)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(oldc); result.putAll(newc)

.
- Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the old
value if

k

exists in the old configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> o == null ? n : o)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(newc); result.putAll(oldc)

.
- Replace all properties with the new configuration except the handler
property to configure Logger's handler that is not root logger:

```java
(k) -> k.endsWith(".handlers")

? ((o, n) -> (o == null ? n : o))

: ((o, n) -> n)
```

To completely reinitialize a configuration, an application can first call

reset

to fully remove the old configuration, followed by

updateConfiguration

to initialize the new configuration.

**Parameters:** ins

- a stream to read properties from
**Parameters:** mapper

- a functional interface that takes a configuration
key

k

and returns a function

f(o,n)

whose returned
value will be applied to the resulting configuration. The
function

f

may return

null

to indicate that the property

k

will not be added to the resulting configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

then

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

is
assumed.

For each

k

, the mapped function

f

will
be invoked with the value associated with

k

in the old
configuration (i.e

o

) and the value associated with

k

in the new configuration (i.e.

n

).

A

null

value for

o

or

n

indicates that no
value was present for

k

in the corresponding configuration.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control"), or
does not have the permissions required to set up the
configuration (e.g. open files specified for FileHandlers)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

ins

is null or if

mapper

returns a null function when invoked.
**Throws:** IOException

- if there are problems reading from the stream,
or the given stream is not in the

properties file

format.
**Since:** 9

- getProperty

```java
public
String
getProperty​(
String
name)
```

Get the value of a logging property.
The method returns null if the property is not found.

**Parameters:** name

- property name
**Returns:** property value

- checkAccess

```java
public void checkAccess()
throws
SecurityException
```

Check that the current context is trusted to modify the logging
configuration. This requires LoggingPermission("control").

If the check fails we throw a SecurityException, otherwise
we return normally.

**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

- getLoggingMXBean

```java
@Deprecated
(
since
="9")
public static
LoggingMXBean
getLoggingMXBean()
```

Deprecated.

java.util.logging.LoggingMXBean

is deprecated and
replaced with

java.lang.management.PlatformLoggingMXBean

. Use

ManagementFactory.getPlatformMXBean

(PlatformLoggingMXBean.class)
instead.

Returns

LoggingMXBean

for managing loggers.

**Returns:** a

LoggingMXBean

object.
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** PlatformLoggingMXBean

- addConfigurationListener

```java
public
LogManager
addConfigurationListener​(
Runnable
listener)
```

Adds a configuration listener to be invoked each time the logging
configuration is read.
If the listener is already registered the method does nothing.

The listener is invoked with privileges that are restricted by the
calling context of this method.
The order in which the listeners are invoked is unspecified.

It is recommended that listeners do not throw errors or exceptions.

If a listener terminates with an uncaught error or exception then
the first exception will be propagated to the caller of

readConfiguration()

(or

readConfiguration(java.io.InputStream)

)
after all listeners have been invoked.

**Implementation Note:** If more than one listener terminates with an uncaught error or
exception, an implementation may record the additional errors or
exceptions as

suppressed exceptions

.
**Parameters:** listener

- A configuration listener that will be invoked after the
configuration changed.
**Returns:** This LogManager.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if the
caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the listener is null.
**Since:** 9

- removeConfigurationListener

```java
public void removeConfigurationListener​(
Runnable
listener)
```

Removes a previously registered configuration listener.

Returns silently if the listener is not found.

**Parameters:** listener

- the configuration listener to remove.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the listener is null.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if the
caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

```

Add a named logger. This does nothing and returns false if a logger
with the same name is already registered.

The Logger factory methods call this method to register each
newly created Logger.

The application should retain its own reference to the Logger
object to avoid it being garbage collected. The LogManager
may only retain a weak reference.

**Parameters:** logger

- the new logger.
**Returns:** true if the argument logger was registered successfully,
false if a logger of that name already exists.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the logger name is null.

Method to find a named logger.

Note that since untrusted code may create loggers with
arbitrary names this method should not be relied on to
find Loggers for security sensitive logging.
It is also important to note that the Logger associated with the
String

name

may be garbage collected at any time if there
is no strong reference to the Logger. The caller of this method
must check the return value for null in order to properly handle
the case where the Logger has been garbage collected.

readConfiguration

```java
public void readConfiguration()
throws
IOException
,

SecurityException
```

Reads and initializes the logging configuration.

If the "java.util.logging.config.class" system property is set, then the
property value is treated as a class name. The given class will be
loaded, an object will be instantiated, and that object's constructor
is responsible for reading in the initial configuration. (That object
may use other system properties to control its configuration.) The
alternate configuration class can use

readConfiguration(InputStream)

to define properties in the LogManager.

If "java.util.logging.config.class" system property is

not

set,
then this method will read the initial configuration from a properties
file and calls the

readConfiguration(InputStream)

method to initialize
the configuration. The "java.util.logging.config.file" system property can be used
to specify the properties file that will be read as the initial configuration;
if not set, then the LogManager default configuration is used.
The default configuration is typically loaded from the
properties file "

conf/logging.properties

" in the Java installation
directory.

Any

registered configuration
listener

will be invoked after the properties are read.

**API Note:** This

readConfiguration

method should only be used for
initializing the configuration during LogManager initialization or
used with the "java.util.logging.config.class" property.
When this method is called after loggers have been created, and
the "java.util.logging.config.class" system property is not set, all
existing loggers will be

reset

. Then any
existing loggers that have a level property specified in the new
configuration stream will be

set

to the specified log level.

To properly update the logging configuration, use the

updateConfiguration(java.util.function.Function)

or

updateConfiguration(java.io.InputStream, java.util.function.Function)

methods instead.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

Updates the logging configuration.

For each configuration key in the

existing configuration

and
the given input stream configuration, the given

mapper

function
is invoked to map from the configuration key to a function,

f(o,n)

, that takes the old value and new value and returns
the resulting value to be applied in the resulting configuration,
as specified in the table below.

Let

k

be a configuration key in the old or new configuration,

n

be the
new value (i.e. the value associated with

Updating configuration properties

Property

Resulting Behavior

<logger>.level

- If the resulting configuration defines a level for a logger and
if the resulting level is different than the level specified in the
the old configuration, or not specified in
the old configuration, then if the logger exists or if children for
that logger exist, the level for that logger will be updated,
and the change propagated to any existing logger children.
This may cause the logger to be created, if necessary.
- If the old configuration defined a level for a logger, and the
resulting configuration doesn't, then this change will not be
propagated to existing loggers, if any.
To completely replace a configuration - the caller should therefore
call

reset

to empty the current configuration,
before calling

updateConfiguration

.

<logger>.useParentHandlers

- If either the resulting or the old value for the useParentHandlers
property is not null, then if the logger exists or if children for
that logger exist, that logger will be updated to the resulting
value.
The value of the useParentHandlers property is the value specified
in the configuration; if not specified, the default is true.

<logger>.handlers

- If the resulting configuration defines a list of handlers for a
logger, and if the resulting list is different than the list
specified in the old configuration for that logger (that could be
empty), then if the logger exists or its children exist, the
handlers associated with that logger are closed and removed and
the new handlers will be created per the resulting configuration
and added to that logger, creating that logger if necessary.
- If the old configuration defined some handlers for a logger, and
the resulting configuration doesn't, if that logger exists,
its handlers will be removed and closed.
- Changing the list of handlers on an existing logger will cause all
its previous handlers to be removed and closed, regardless of whether
they had been created from the configuration or programmatically.
The old handlers will be replaced by new handlers, if any.

<handler-name>.*

- Properties configured/changed on handler classes will only affect
newly created handlers. If a node is configured with the same list
of handlers in the old and the resulting configuration, then these
handlers will remain unchanged.

config

and any other property

- The resulting value for these property will be stored in the
LogManager properties, but

updateConfiguration

will not parse
or process their values.

Example mapper functions:

- Replace all logging properties with the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

:

this is equivalent to passing a null

mapper

parameter.
- Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the
new value if

k

exists in the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n == null ? o : n)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(oldc); result.putAll(newc)

.
- Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the old
value if

k

exists in the old configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> o == null ? n : o)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(newc); result.putAll(oldc)

- Replace all properties with the new configuration except the handler
property to configure Logger's handler that is not root logger:

To completely reinitialize a configuration, an application can first call

reset

to fully remove the old configuration, followed by

updateConfiguration

to initialize the new configuration.

**Parameters:** ins

- a stream to read properties from
**Parameters:** mapper

- a functional interface that takes a configuration
key

k

and returns a function

f(o,n)

whose returned
value will be applied to the resulting configuration. The
function

f

may return

null

to indicate that the property

k

will not be added to the resulting configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

then

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

is
assumed.

For each

k

, the mapped function

f

will
be invoked with the value associated with

k

in the old
configuration (i.e

o

) and the value associated with

k

in the new configuration (i.e.

n

).

A

null

value for

o

or

n

indicates that no
value was present for

k

in the corresponding configuration.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control"), or
does not have the permissions required to set up the
configuration (e.g. open files specified for FileHandlers)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

ins

is null or if

mapper

returns a null function when invoked.
**Throws:** IOException

- if there are problems reading from the stream,
or the given stream is not in the

properties file

format.

Updates the logging configuration.

For each configuration key in the

existing configuration

and
the given input stream configuration, the given

mapper

function
is invoked to map from the configuration key to a function,

f(o,n)

, that takes the old value and new value and returns
the resulting value to be applied in the resulting configuration,
as specified in the table below.

Let

k

be a configuration key in the old or new configuration,

o

be the old value (i.e. the value associated
with

k

in the old configuration),

n

be the
new value (i.e. the value associated with

k

in the new
configuration), and

f

be the function returned
by

mapper.apply(

k

)

: then

v = f(o,n)

is the
resulting value. If

v

is not

null

, then a property

k

with value

v

will be added to the resulting configuration.
Otherwise, it will be omitted.

A

null

value may be passed to function

f

to indicate that the corresponding configuration has no
configuration key

k

.
The function

f

may return

null

to indicate that
there will be no value associated with

k

in the resulting
configuration.

If

mapper

is

null

, then

v

will be set to

n

.

LogManager

properties

are
updated with the resulting value in the resulting configuration.

The registered

configuration

will be invoked after the configuration is successfully updated.

Property

Resulting Behavior

<logger>.level

- If the resulting configuration defines a level for a logger and
if the resulting level is different than the level specified in the
the old configuration, or not specified in
the old configuration, then if the logger exists or if children for
that logger exist, the level for that logger will be updated,
and the change propagated to any existing logger children.
This may cause the logger to be created, if necessary.
- If the old configuration defined a level for a logger, and the
resulting configuration doesn't, then this change will not be
propagated to existing loggers, if any.
To completely replace a configuration - the caller should therefore
call

reset

to empty the current configuration,
before calling

updateConfiguration

.

<logger>.useParentHandlers

- If either the resulting or the old value for the useParentHandlers
property is not null, then if the logger exists or if children for
that logger exist, that logger will be updated to the resulting
value.
The value of the useParentHandlers property is the value specified
in the configuration; if not specified, the default is true.

<logger>.handlers

- If the resulting configuration defines a list of handlers for a
logger, and if the resulting list is different than the list
specified in the old configuration for that logger (that could be
empty), then if the logger exists or its children exist, the
handlers associated with that logger are closed and removed and
the new handlers will be created per the resulting configuration
and added to that logger, creating that logger if necessary.
- If the old configuration defined some handlers for a logger, and
the resulting configuration doesn't, if that logger exists,
its handlers will be removed and closed.
- Changing the list of handlers on an existing logger will cause all
its previous handlers to be removed and closed, regardless of whether
they had been created from the configuration or programmatically.
The old handlers will be replaced by new handlers, if any.

<handler-name>.*

- Properties configured/changed on handler classes will only affect
newly created handlers. If a node is configured with the same list
of handlers in the old and the resulting configuration, then these
handlers will remain unchanged.

- The resulting value for these property will be stored in the
LogManager properties, but

updateConfiguration

Example mapper functions:

- Replace all logging properties with the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

:

this is equivalent to passing a null

mapper

parameter.
- Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the
new value if

k

exists in the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n == null ? o : n)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(oldc); result.putAll(newc)

.
- Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the old
value if

k

exists in the old configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> o == null ? n : o)

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n)

:

this is equivalent to passing a null

mapper

parameter.

Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the
new value if

k

exists in the new configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> n == null ? o : n)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(oldc); result.putAll(newc)

.

Merge the new configuration and old configuration and use the old
value if

k

exists in the old configuration:

(k) -> ((o, n) -> o == null ? n : o)

:

as if merging two collections as follows:

result.putAll(newc); result.putAll(oldc)

.

Replace all properties with the new configuration except the handler
property to configure Logger's handler that is not root logger:

```java
(k) -> k.endsWith(".handlers")

? ((o, n) -> (o == null ? n : o))

: ((o, n) -> n)
```

(k) -> k.endsWith(".handlers")

? ((o, n) -> (o == null ? n : o))

: ((o, n) -> n)

To completely reinitialize a configuration, an application can first call

reset

to fully remove the old configuration, followed by

updateConfiguration

to initialize the new configuration.

getProperty

```java
public
String
getProperty​(
String
name)
```

Get the value of a logging property.
The method returns null if the property is not found.

**Parameters:** name

- property name
**Returns:** property value

---

#### getProperty

public

String

getProperty​(

String

name)

Get the value of a logging property.
The method returns null if the property is not found.

checkAccess

```java
public void checkAccess()
throws
SecurityException
```

Check that the current context is trusted to modify the logging
configuration. This requires LoggingPermission("control").

If the check fails we throw a SecurityException, otherwise
we return normally.

**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if
the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

#### checkAccess

public void checkAccess()
throws

SecurityException

Check that the current context is trusted to modify the logging
configuration. This requires LoggingPermission("control").

If the check fails we throw a SecurityException, otherwise
we return normally.

java.util.logging.LoggingMXBean

is deprecated and
replaced with

java.lang.management.PlatformLoggingMXBean

. Use

ManagementFactory.getPlatformMXBean

(PlatformLoggingMXBean.class)
instead.

Returns

LoggingMXBean

for managing loggers.

**Returns:** a

LoggingMXBean

object.
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** PlatformLoggingMXBean

addConfigurationListener

```java
public
LogManager
addConfigurationListener​(
Runnable
listener)
```

Adds a configuration listener to be invoked each time the logging
configuration is read.
If the listener is already registered the method does nothing.

The listener is invoked with privileges that are restricted by the
calling context of this method.
The order in which the listeners are invoked is unspecified.

It is recommended that listeners do not throw errors or exceptions.

If a listener terminates with an uncaught error or exception then
the first exception will be propagated to the caller of

readConfiguration()

(or

readConfiguration(java.io.InputStream)

)
after all listeners have been invoked.

**Implementation Note:** If more than one listener terminates with an uncaught error or
exception, an implementation may record the additional errors or
exceptions as

suppressed exceptions

.
**Parameters:** listener

- A configuration listener that will be invoked after the
configuration changed.
**Returns:** This LogManager.
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and if the
caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the listener is null.
**Since:** 9
