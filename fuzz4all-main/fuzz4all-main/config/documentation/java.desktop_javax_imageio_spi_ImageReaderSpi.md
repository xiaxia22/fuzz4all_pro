# Class ImageReaderSpi

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\imageio\spi\ImageReaderSpi.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
ImageReaderSpi

extends
ImageReaderWriterSpi
```

The service provider interface (SPI) for

ImageReader

s.
For more information on service provider classes, see the class comment
for the

IIORegistry

class.

Each

ImageReaderSpi

provides several types of information
about the

ImageReader

class with which it is associated.

The name of the vendor who defined the SPI class and a
brief description of the class are available via the

getVendorName

,

getDescription

,
and

getVersion

methods.
These methods may be internationalized to provide locale-specific
output. These methods are intended mainly to provide short,
human-readable information that might be used to organize a pop-up
menu or other list.

Lists of format names, file suffixes, and MIME types associated
with the service may be obtained by means of the

getFormatNames

,

getFileSuffixes

, and

getMIMETypes

methods. These methods may be used to
identify candidate

ImageReader

s for decoding a
particular file or stream based on manual format selection, file
naming, or MIME associations (for example, when accessing a file
over HTTP or as an email attachment).

A more reliable way to determine which

ImageReader

s
are likely to be able to parse a particular data stream is provided
by the

canDecodeInput

method. This methods allows the
service provider to inspect the actual stream contents.

Finally, an instance of the

ImageReader

class
associated with this service provider may be obtained by calling
the

createReaderInstance

method. Any heavyweight
initialization, such as the loading of native libraries or creation
of large tables, should be deferred at least until the first
invocation of this method.

### Method Details

#### public
Class
<?>[] getInputTypes()

Returns an array of

Class

objects indicating what
types of objects may be used as arguments to the reader's

setInput

method.

For most readers, which only accept input from an

ImageInputStream

, a single-element array
containing

ImageInputStream.class

should be
returned.

**Returns:**
- a non-

null

array of

Class

objects of length at least 1.

---

#### public abstract boolean canDecodeInput​(
Object
source)
throws
IOException

Returns

true

if the supplied source object appears
to be of the format supported by this reader. Returning

true

from this method does not guarantee that
reading will succeed, only that there appears to be a
reasonable chance of success based on a brief inspection of the
stream contents. If the source is an

ImageInputStream

, implementations will commonly
check the first several bytes of the stream for a "magic
number" associated with the format. Once actual reading has
commenced, the reader may still indicate failure at any time
prior to the completion of decoding.

It is important that the state of the object not be
disturbed in order that other

ImageReaderSpi

s can
properly determine whether they are able to decode the object.
In particular, if the source is an

ImageInputStream

, a

mark

/

reset

pair should be used to
preserve the stream position.

Formats such as "raw," which can potentially attempt
to read nearly any stream, should return

false

in order to avoid being invoked in preference to a closer
match.

If

source

is not an instance of one of the
classes returned by

getInputTypes

, the method
should simply return

false

.

**Parameters:**
- source

- the object (typically an

ImageInputStream

) to be decoded.

**Returns:**
- true

if it is likely that this stream can
be decoded.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

source

is

null

.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while reading the
stream.

---

#### public
ImageReader
createReaderInstance()
throws
IOException

Returns an instance of the

ImageReader

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state
as if its

reset

method had been called.

The default implementation simply returns

createReaderInstance(null)

.

**Returns:**
- an

ImageReader

instance.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an error occurs during loading,
or initialization of the reader class, or during instantiation
or initialization of the reader object.

---

#### public abstract
ImageReader
createReaderInstance​(
Object
extension)
throws
IOException

Returns an instance of the

ImageReader

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state
as if its

reset

method had been called.

An

Object

may be supplied to the plug-in at
construction time. The nature of the object is entirely
plug-in specific.

Typically, a plug-in will implement this method using code
such as

return new MyImageReader(this)

.

**Parameters:**
- extension

- a plug-in specific extension object, which may
be

null

.

**Returns:**
- an

ImageReader

instance.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if the attempt to instantiate
the reader fails.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the

ImageReader

's constructor throws an

IllegalArgumentException

to indicate that the
extension object is unsuitable.

---

#### public boolean isOwnReader​(
ImageReader
reader)

Returns

true

if the

ImageReader

object
passed in is an instance of the

ImageReader

associated with this service provider.

The default implementation compares the fully-qualified
class name of the

reader

argument with the class
name passed into the constructor. This method may be overridden
if more sophisticated checking is required.

**Parameters:**
- reader

- an

ImageReader

instance.

**Returns:**
- true

if

reader

is recognized.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

reader

is

null

.

---

#### public
String
[] getImageWriterSpiNames()

Returns an array of

String

s containing the fully
qualified names of all the

ImageWriterSpi

classes
that can understand the internal metadata representation used
by the

ImageReader

associated with this service
provider, or

null

if there are no such

ImageWriter

s specified. If a
non-

null

value is returned, it must have non-zero
length.

The first item in the array must be the name of the service
provider for the "preferred" writer, as it will be used to
instantiate the

ImageWriter

returned by

ImageIO.getImageWriter(ImageReader)

.

This mechanism may be used to obtain

ImageWriters

that will understand the internal
structure of non-pixel meta-data (see

IIOTreeInfo

) generated by an

ImageReader

. By obtaining this data from the

ImageReader

and passing it on to one of the

ImageWriters

obtained with this method, a client
program can read an image, modify it in some way, and write it
back out while preserving all meta-data, without having to
understand anything about the internal structure of the
meta-data, or even about the image format.

**Returns:**
- an array of

String

s of length at least 1
containing names of

ImageWriterSpi

, or

null

.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getInputTypes

```java
public
Class
<?>[] getInputTypes()
```

Returns an array of

Class

objects indicating what
types of objects may be used as arguments to the reader's

setInput

method.

For most readers, which only accept input from an

ImageInputStream

, a single-element array
containing

ImageInputStream.class

should be
returned.

**Returns:** a non-

null

array of

Class

objects of length at least 1.

- canDecodeInput

```java
public abstract boolean canDecodeInput​(
Object
source)
throws
IOException
```

Returns

true

if the supplied source object appears
to be of the format supported by this reader. Returning

true

from this method does not guarantee that
reading will succeed, only that there appears to be a
reasonable chance of success based on a brief inspection of the
stream contents. If the source is an

ImageInputStream

, implementations will commonly
check the first several bytes of the stream for a "magic
number" associated with the format. Once actual reading has
commenced, the reader may still indicate failure at any time
prior to the completion of decoding.

It is important that the state of the object not be
disturbed in order that other

ImageReaderSpi

s can
properly determine whether they are able to decode the object.
In particular, if the source is an

ImageInputStream

, a

mark

/

reset

pair should be used to
preserve the stream position.

Formats such as "raw," which can potentially attempt
to read nearly any stream, should return

false

in order to avoid being invoked in preference to a closer
match.

If

source

is not an instance of one of the
classes returned by

getInputTypes

, the method
should simply return

false

.

**Parameters:** source

- the object (typically an

ImageInputStream

) to be decoded.
**Returns:** true

if it is likely that this stream can
be decoded.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

source

is

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while reading the
stream.

- createReaderInstance

```java
public
ImageReader
createReaderInstance()
throws
IOException
```

Returns an instance of the

ImageReader

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state
as if its

reset

method had been called.

The default implementation simply returns

createReaderInstance(null)

.

**Returns:** an

ImageReader

instance.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during loading,
or initialization of the reader class, or during instantiation
or initialization of the reader object.

- createReaderInstance

```java
public abstract
ImageReader
createReaderInstance​(
Object
extension)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an instance of the

ImageReader

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state
as if its

reset

method had been called.

An

Object

may be supplied to the plug-in at
construction time. The nature of the object is entirely
plug-in specific.

Typically, a plug-in will implement this method using code
such as

return new MyImageReader(this)

.

**Parameters:** extension

- a plug-in specific extension object, which may
be

null

.
**Returns:** an

ImageReader

instance.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the attempt to instantiate
the reader fails.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

ImageReader

's constructor throws an

IllegalArgumentException

to indicate that the
extension object is unsuitable.

- isOwnReader

```java
public boolean isOwnReader​(
ImageReader
reader)
```

Returns

true

if the

ImageReader

object
passed in is an instance of the

ImageReader

associated with this service provider.

The default implementation compares the fully-qualified
class name of the

reader

argument with the class
name passed into the constructor. This method may be overridden
if more sophisticated checking is required.

**Parameters:** reader

- an

ImageReader

instance.
**Returns:** true

if

reader

is recognized.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

reader

is

null

.

- getImageWriterSpiNames

```java
public
String
[] getImageWriterSpiNames()
```

Returns an array of

String

s containing the fully
qualified names of all the

ImageWriterSpi

classes
that can understand the internal metadata representation used
by the

ImageReader

associated with this service
provider, or

null

if there are no such

ImageWriter

s specified. If a
non-

null

value is returned, it must have non-zero
length.

The first item in the array must be the name of the service
provider for the "preferred" writer, as it will be used to
instantiate the

ImageWriter

returned by

ImageIO.getImageWriter(ImageReader)

.

This mechanism may be used to obtain

ImageWriters

that will understand the internal
structure of non-pixel meta-data (see

IIOTreeInfo

) generated by an

ImageReader

. By obtaining this data from the

ImageReader

and passing it on to one of the

ImageWriters

obtained with this method, a client
program can read an image, modify it in some way, and write it
back out while preserving all meta-data, without having to
understand anything about the internal structure of the
meta-data, or even about the image format.

**Returns:** an array of

String

s of length at least 1
containing names of

ImageWriterSpi

, or

null

.

Method Detail

- getInputTypes

```java
public
Class
<?>[] getInputTypes()
```

Returns an array of

Class

objects indicating what
types of objects may be used as arguments to the reader's

setInput

method.

For most readers, which only accept input from an

ImageInputStream

, a single-element array
containing

ImageInputStream.class

should be
returned.

**Returns:** a non-

null

array of

Class

objects of length at least 1.

- canDecodeInput

```java
public abstract boolean canDecodeInput​(
Object
source)
throws
IOException
```

Returns

true

if the supplied source object appears
to be of the format supported by this reader. Returning

true

from this method does not guarantee that
reading will succeed, only that there appears to be a
reasonable chance of success based on a brief inspection of the
stream contents. If the source is an

ImageInputStream

, implementations will commonly
check the first several bytes of the stream for a "magic
number" associated with the format. Once actual reading has
commenced, the reader may still indicate failure at any time
prior to the completion of decoding.

It is important that the state of the object not be
disturbed in order that other

ImageReaderSpi

s can
properly determine whether they are able to decode the object.
In particular, if the source is an

ImageInputStream

, a

mark

/

reset

pair should be used to
preserve the stream position.

Formats such as "raw," which can potentially attempt
to read nearly any stream, should return

false

in order to avoid being invoked in preference to a closer
match.

If

source

is not an instance of one of the
classes returned by

getInputTypes

, the method
should simply return

false

.

**Parameters:** source

- the object (typically an

ImageInputStream

) to be decoded.
**Returns:** true

if it is likely that this stream can
be decoded.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

source

is

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while reading the
stream.

- createReaderInstance

```java
public
ImageReader
createReaderInstance()
throws
IOException
```

Returns an instance of the

ImageReader

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state
as if its

reset

method had been called.

The default implementation simply returns

createReaderInstance(null)

.

**Returns:** an

ImageReader

instance.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an error occurs during loading,
or initialization of the reader class, or during instantiation
or initialization of the reader object.

- createReaderInstance

```java
public abstract
ImageReader
createReaderInstance​(
Object
extension)
throws
IOException
```

Returns an instance of the

ImageReader

implementation associated with this service provider.
The returned object will initially be in an initial state
as if its

reset

method had been called.

An

Object

may be supplied to the plug-in at
construction time. The nature of the object is entirely
plug-in specific.

Typically, a plug-in will implement this method using code
such as

return new MyImageReader(this)

.

**Parameters:** extension

- a plug-in specific extension object, which may
be

null

.
**Returns:** an

ImageReader

instance.
**Throws:** IOException

- if the attempt to instantiate
the reader fails.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the

ImageReader

's constructor throws an

IllegalArgumentException

to indicate that the
extension object is unsuitable.

- isOwnReader

public boolean isOwnReader​(
ImageReader
reader)
```

Returns

true

if the

ImageReader

object
passed in is an instance of the

ImageReader

associated with this service provider.

The default implementation compares the fully-qualified
class name of the

reader

argument with the class
name passed into the constructor. This method may be overridden
if more sophisticated checking is required.

**Parameters:** reader

- an

ImageReader

instance.
**Returns:** true

if

reader

is recognized.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

reader

is

null

.

- getImageWriterSpiNames

```java
public
String
[] getImageWriterSpiNames()
```

Returns an array of

String

s containing the fully
qualified names of all the

ImageWriterSpi

classes
that can understand the internal metadata representation used
by the

ImageReader

associated with this service
provider, or

null

if there are no such

ImageWriter

s specified. If a
non-

null

value is returned, it must have non-zero
length.

The first item in the array must be the name of the service
provider for the "preferred" writer, as it will be used to
instantiate the

ImageWriter

returned by

ImageIO.getImageWriter(ImageReader)

.

This mechanism may be used to obtain

ImageWriters

that will understand the internal
structure of non-pixel meta-data (see

IIOTreeInfo

) generated by an

ImageReader

. By obtaining this data from the

ImageReader

and passing it on to one of the

ImageWriters

obtained with this method, a client
program can read an image, modify it in some way, and write it
back out while preserving all meta-data, without having to
understand anything about the internal structure of the
meta-data, or even about the image format.

**Returns:** an array of

String

s of length at least 1
containing names of

ImageWriterSpi

, or

null

.
**See Also:** ImageIO.getImageWriter(ImageReader)

#### Method Detail

getInputTypes

```java
public
Class
<?>[] getInputTypes()
```

Returns an array of

Class

objects indicating what
types of objects may be used as arguments to the reader's

setInput

method.

For most readers, which only accept input from an

ImageInputStream

, a single-element array
containing

ImageInputStream.class

should be
returned.

**Returns:** a non-

null

array of

Class

objects of length at least 1.

canDecodeInput

```java
public abstract boolean canDecodeInput​(
Object
source)
throws
IOException
```

Returns

true

if the supplied source object appears
to be of the format supported by this reader. Returning

true

from this method does not guarantee that
reading will succeed, only that there appears to be a
reasonable chance of success based on a brief inspection of the
stream contents. If the source is an

ImageInputStream

, implementations will commonly
check the first several bytes of the stream for a "magic
number" associated with the format. Once actual reading has
commenced, the reader may still indicate failure at any time
prior to the completion of decoding.

It is important that the state of the object not be
disturbed in order that other

ImageReaderSpi

s can
properly determine whether they are able to decode the object.
In particular, if the source is an

ImageInputStream

, a

mark

/

reset

pair should be used to
preserve the stream position.

Formats such as "raw," which can potentially attempt
to read nearly any stream, should return

false

in order to avoid being invoked in preference to a closer
match.

If

source

is not an instance of one of the
classes returned by

getInputTypes

, the method
should simply return

false

.

**Parameters:** source

- the object (typically an

ImageInputStream

) to be decoded.
**Returns:** true

if it is likely that this stream can
be decoded.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

source

is

null

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs while reading the
stream.
