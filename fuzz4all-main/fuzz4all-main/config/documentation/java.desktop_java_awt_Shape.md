### Class Description

```java
public interface
Shape
```

The

Shape

interface provides definitions for objects
that represent some form of geometric shape. The

Shape

is described by a

PathIterator

object, which can express the
outline of the

Shape

as well as a rule for determining
how the outline divides the 2D plane into interior and exterior
points. Each

Shape

object provides callbacks to get the
bounding box of the geometry, determine whether points or
rectangles lie partly or entirely within the interior
of the

Shape

, and retrieve a

PathIterator

object that describes the trajectory path of the

Shape

outline.

Definition of insideness:

A point is considered to lie inside a

Shape

if and only if:

- it lies completely
inside the

Shape

boundary

or

it lies exactly on the

Shape

boundary

and

the
space immediately adjacent to the
point in the increasing

X

direction is
entirely inside the boundary

or

it lies exactly on a horizontal boundary segment

and

the
space immediately adjacent to the point in the
increasing

Y

direction is inside the boundary.

The

contains

and

intersects

methods
consider the interior of a

Shape

to be the area it
encloses as if it were filled. This means that these methods
consider
unclosed shapes to be implicitly closed for the purpose of
determining if a shape contains or intersects a rectangle or if a
shape contains a point.

### Method Details

#### Rectangle
getBounds()

Returns an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses the

Shape

. Note that there is no guarantee that the
returned

Rectangle

is the smallest bounding box that
encloses the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies entirely within the indicated

Rectangle

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a
tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
representation.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then
it must be inside the returned

Rectangle

bounds object
according to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(x,y)

requires

bounds.contains(x,y)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(x,y)

does not imply

shape.contains(x,y)

**Returns:**
- an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses
the

Shape

.

**See Also:**
- getBounds2D()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Returns:**
- an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

Shape

.

**See Also:**
- getBounds()

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### boolean contains​(double x,
double y)

Tests if the specified coordinates are inside the boundary of the

Shape

, as described by the

definition of insideness

.

**Parameters:**
- x

- the specified X coordinate to be tested
- y

- the specified Y coordinate to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified coordinates are inside
the

Shape

boundary;

false

otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### boolean contains​(
Point2D
p)

Tests if a specified

Point2D

is inside the boundary
of the

Shape

, as described by the

definition of insideness

.

**Parameters:**
- p

- the specified

Point2D

to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified

Point2D

is
inside the boundary of the

Shape

;

false

otherwise.

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### boolean intersects​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified rectangular area.
The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Parameters:**
- x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- w

- the width of the specified rectangular area
- h

- the height of the specified rectangular area

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

and
the interior of the rectangular area intersect, or are
both highly likely to intersect and intersection calculations
would be too expensive to perform;

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- Area

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### boolean intersects​(
Rectangle2D
r)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

intersects the
interior of a specified

Rectangle2D

.
The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the

Rectangle2D

and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the

Rectangle2D

does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Parameters:**
- r

- the specified

Rectangle2D

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

and
the interior of the specified

Rectangle2D

intersect, or are both highly likely to intersect and intersection
calculations would be too expensive to perform;

false

otherwise.

**See Also:**
- intersects(double, double, double, double)

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### boolean contains​(double x,
double y,
double w,
double h)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains
the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
the rectangular area must lie within the

Shape

for the
entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the

Shape

.

The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the rectangular area are
prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the rectangular area.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Parameters:**
- x

- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- y

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the specified rectangular area
- w

- the width of the specified rectangular area
- h

- the height of the specified rectangular area

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the specified rectangular area;

false

otherwise or, if the

Shape

contains the rectangular area and the

intersects

method returns

true

and the containment calculations would be too expensive to
perform.

**See Also:**
- Area

,

intersects(double, double, double, double)

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### boolean contains​(
Rectangle2D
r)

Tests if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the
specified

Rectangle2D

.
The

Shape.contains()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

false

when:

- the

intersect

method returns

true

and

the calculations to determine whether or not the

Shape

entirely contains the

Rectangle2D

are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

false

even though the

Shape

contains
the

Rectangle2D

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate geometric computations than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Parameters:**
- r

- The specified

Rectangle2D

**Returns:**
- true

if the interior of the

Shape

entirely contains the

Rectangle2D

;

false

otherwise or, if the

Shape

contains the

Rectangle2D

and the

intersects

method returns

true

and the containment calculations would be too expensive to
perform.

**See Also:**
- contains(double, double, double, double)

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at)

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the

Shape

boundary and provides access to the geometry of the

Shape

outline. If an optional

AffineTransform

is specified, the coordinates returned in the iteration are
transformed accordingly.

Each call to this method returns a fresh

PathIterator

object that traverses the geometry of the

Shape

object
independently from any other

PathIterator

objects in use
at the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

Shape

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

**Parameters:**
- at

- an optional

AffineTransform

to be applied to the
coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or

null

if untransformed coordinates are desired

**Returns:**
- a new

PathIterator

object, which independently
traverses the geometry of the

Shape

.

**Since:**
- 1.2

---

#### PathIterator
getPathIterator​(
AffineTransform
at,
double flatness)

Returns an iterator object that iterates along the

Shape

boundary and provides access to a flattened view of the

Shape

outline geometry.

Only SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, and SEG_CLOSE point types are
returned by the iterator.

If an optional

AffineTransform

is specified,
the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed
accordingly.

The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled
by the

flatness

parameter, which specifies the
maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed
curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments.
Note that a limit on the accuracy of the flattened path might be
silently imposed, causing very small flattening parameters to be
treated as larger values. This limit, if there is one, is
defined by the particular implementation that is used.

Each call to this method returns a fresh

PathIterator

object that traverses the

Shape

object geometry
independently from any other

PathIterator

objects in use at
the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

Shape

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

**Parameters:**
- at

- an optional

AffineTransform

to be applied to the
coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or

null

if untransformed coordinates are desired
- flatness

- the maximum distance that the line segments used to
approximate the curved segments are allowed to deviate
from any point on the original curve

**Returns:**
- a new

PathIterator

that independently traverses
a flattened view of the geometry of the

Shape

.

**Since:**
- 1.2

The rectangular area is considered to intersect the

Shape

if any point is contained in both the interior of the

Shape

and the specified rectangular area.

The

Shape.intersects()

method allows a

Shape

implementation to conservatively return

true

when:

- there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the

Shape

intersect, but

the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
are prohibitively expensive.

This means that for some

Shapes

this method might
return

true

even though the rectangular area does not
intersect the

Shape

.
The

Area

class performs
more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most

Shape

objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
answer is required.

**Parameters:** x

outline. If an optional

AffineTransform

is specified, the coordinates returned in the iteration are
transformed accordingly.

Each call to this method returns a fresh

at the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

**Parameters:** at

- an optional

AffineTransform

Only SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, and SEG_CLOSE point types are
returned by the iterator.

If an optional

is specified,
the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed
accordingly.

The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled
by the

flatness

parameter, which specifies the
maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed
curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments.
Note that a limit on the accuracy of the flattened path might be
silently imposed, causing very small flattening parameters to be
treated as larger values. This limit, if there is one, is
defined by the particular implementation that is used.

Method Detail

- getBounds

```java
Rectangle
getBounds()
```

Returns an integer

Rectangle

that completely encloses the

Shape

. Note that there is no guarantee that the
returned

Rectangle

is the smallest bounding box that
encloses the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies entirely within the indicated

Rectangle

. The
returned

Rectangle

might also fail to completely
enclose the

Shape

if the

Shape

overflows
the limited range of the integer data type. The

getBounds2D

method generally returns a
tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
representation.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then
it must be inside the returned

Rectangle

bounds object
according to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(x,y)

requires

bounds.contains(x,y)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(x,y)

does not imply

shape.contains(x,y)

**Returns:** an integer

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

object
independently from any other

PathIterator

objects in use
at the same time.

It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
implementing the

Shape

interface isolate iterations
that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
object's geometry during such iterations.

**Parameters:** at
