### Class Description

```java
public class
Krb5LoginModule

extends
Object

implements
LoginModule
```

This

LoginModule

authenticates users using
Kerberos protocols.

The configuration entry for

Krb5LoginModule

has
several options that control the authentication process and
additions to the

Subject

's private credential
set. Irrespective of these options, the

Subject

's
principal set and private credentials set are updated only when

commit

is called.
When

commit

is called, the

KerberosPrincipal

is added to the

Subject

's principal set (unless the

principal

is specified as "*"). If

isInitiator

is true, the

KerberosTicket

is
added to the

Subject

's private credentials.

If the configuration entry for

KerberosLoginModule

has the option

storeKey

set to true, then

KerberosKey

or

KeyTab

will also be added to the
subject's private credentials.

KerberosKey

, the principal's
key(s) will be derived from user's password, and

KeyTab

is
the keytab used when

useKeyTab

is set to true. The

KeyTab

object is restricted to be used by the specified
principal unless the principal value is "*".

This

LoginModule

recognizes the

doNotPrompt

option. If set to true the user will not be prompted for the password.

The user can specify the location of the ticket cache by using
the option

ticketCache

in the configuration entry.

The user can specify the keytab location by using
the option

keyTab

in the configuration entry.

The principal name can be specified in the configuration entry
by using the option

principal

. The principal name
can either be a simple user name, a service name such as

host/mission.eng.sun.com

, or "*". The principal can also
be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

.
This property is checked during login. If this property is not set, then
the principal name from the configuration is used. In the
case where the principal property is not set and the principal
entry also does not exist, the user is prompted for the name.
When this property of entry is set, and

useTicketCache

is set to true, only TGT belonging to this principal is used.

The following is a list of configuration options supported
for

Krb5LoginModule

:

**refreshKrb5Config :** Set this to true, if you want the configuration
to be refreshed before the

login

method is called.
**useTicketCache :** Set this to true, if you want the
TGT to be obtained from the ticket cache. Set this option
to false if you do not want this module to use the ticket cache.
(Default is False).
This module will search for the ticket
cache in the following locations: On Solaris and Linux
it will look for the ticket cache in /tmp/krb5cc_

uid

where the uid is numeric user identifier. If the ticket cache is
not available in the above location, or if we are on a
Windows platform, it will look for the cache as
{user.home}{file.separator}krb5cc_{user.name}.
You can override the ticket cache location by using

ticketCache

.
For Windows, if a ticket cannot be retrieved from the file ticket cache,
it will use Local Security Authority (LSA) API to get the TGT.

ticketCache

:

Set this to the name of the ticket
cache that contains user's TGT.
If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be set to true; Otherwise a configuration error will
be returned.

renewTGT

:

Set this to true, if you want to renew the TGT when it's more than
half-way expired (the time until expiration is less than the time
since start time). If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be
set to true; otherwise a configuration error will be returned.

doNotPrompt

:

Set this to true if you do not want to be
prompted for the password
if credentials can not be obtained from the cache, the keytab,
or through shared state.(Default is false)
If set to true, credential must be obtained through cache, keytab,
or shared state. Otherwise, authentication will fail.

useKeyTab

:

Set this to true if you
want the module to get the principal's key from the
the keytab.(default value is False)
If

keytab

is not set then
the module will locate the keytab from the
Kerberos configuration file.
If it is not specified in the Kerberos configuration file
then it will look for the file

{user.home}{file.separator}

krb5.keytab.

keyTab

:

Set this to the file name of the
keytab to get principal's secret key.

storeKey

:

Set this to true to if you want the keytab or the
principal's key to be stored in the Subject's private credentials.
For

isInitiator

being false, if

principal

is "*", the

KeyTab

stored can be used by anyone, otherwise,
it's restricted to be used by the specified principal only.

principal

:

The name of the principal that should
be used. The principal can be a simple username such as
"

testuser

" or a service name such as
"

host/testhost.eng.sun.com

". You can use the

principal

option to set the principal when there are
credentials for multiple principals in the

keyTab

or when you want a specific ticket cache only.
The principal can also be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

. In addition, if this
system property is defined, then it will be used. If this property
is not set, then the principal name from the configuration will be
used.
The principal name can be set to "*" when

isInitiator

is false.
In this case, the acceptor is not bound to a single principal. It can
act as any principal an initiator requests if keys for that principal
can be found. When

isInitiator

is true, the principal name
cannot be set to "*".

isInitiator

:

Set this to true, if initiator. Set this to false, if acceptor only.
(Default is true).
Note: Do not set this value to false for initiators.

This

LoginModule

also recognizes the following additional

Configuration

options that enable you to share username and passwords across different
authentication modules:

**useFirstPass :** if, true, this LoginModule retrieves the
username and password from the module's shared state,
using "javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. The retrieved values are used for authentication.
If authentication fails, no attempt for a retry
is made, and the failure is reported back to the
calling application.
**tryFirstPass :** if, true, this LoginModule retrieves the
the username and password from the module's shared
state using "javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. The retrieved values are used for
authentication.
If authentication fails, the module uses the
CallbackHandler to retrieve a new username
and password, and another attempt to authenticate
is made. If the authentication fails,
the failure is reported back to the calling application
**storePass :** if, true, this LoginModule stores the username and
password obtained from the CallbackHandler in the
modules shared state, using
"javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. This is not performed if existing values already
exist for the username and password in the shared
state, or if authentication fails.
**clearPass :** if, true, this LoginModule clears the
username and password stored in the module's shared
state after both phases of authentication
(login and commit) have completed.

If the principal system property or key is already provided, the value of
"javax.security.auth.login.name" in the shared state is ignored.

When multiple mechanisms to retrieve a ticket or key is provided, the
preference order is:

- ticket cache

keytab

shared state

user prompt

Note that if any step fails, it will fallback to the next step.
There's only one exception, if the shared state step fails and

useFirstPass = true

, no user prompt is made.

Examples of some configuration values for Krb5LoginModule in
JAAS config file and the results are:

```java
doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since none of

useTicketCache,
useKeyTab, useFirstPass

and

tryFirstPass

is set and the user can not be prompted for the password.

```java
ticketCache = <filename>
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is not set to true and the ticketCache is set. A configuration error
will occur.

```java
renewTGT = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is
not set to true and renewTGT is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
storeKey = true useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

storeKey

is set to
true but the key can not be obtained either by prompting the user or from
the keytab, or from the shared state. A configuration error will occur.

```java
keyTab = <filename> doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since useKeyTab is not set to true and
the keyTab is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
debug = true
```

Prompt the user for the principal name and the password.
Use the authentication exchange to get TGT from the KDC and
populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT.
Output debug messages.

```java
useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Check the default cache for TGT and populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT. If the TGT is not available,
do not prompt the user, instead fail the authentication.

```java
principal = <name> useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Get the TGT from the default cache for the principal and populate the
Subject's principal and private creds set. If ticket cache is
not available or does not contain the principal's TGT
authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <keytab filename>
principal = <principal name>
doNotPrompt = true
```

Search the cache for the principal's TGT. If it is not available
use the key in the keytab to perform authentication exchange with the
KDC and acquire the TGT.
The Subject will be populated with the principal and the TGT.
If the key is not available or valid then authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true ticketCache = <filename>
```

The TGT will be obtained from the cache specified.
The Kerberos principal name used will be the principal name in
the Ticket cache. If the TGT is not available in the
ticket cache the user will be prompted for the principal name
and the password. The TGT will be obtained using the authentication
exchange with the KDC.
The Subject will be populated with the TGT.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab=<keytab filename> principal = <principal name> storeKey = true
```

The key for the principal will be retrieved from the keytab.
If the key is not available in the keytab the user will be prompted
for the principal's password. The Subject will be populated
with the principal's key either from the keytab or derived from the
password entered.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true doNotPrompt = false
```

The user will be prompted for the service principal name.
If the principal's
longterm key is available in the keytab , it will be added to the
Subject's private credentials. An authentication exchange will be
attempted with the principal name and the key from the Keytab.
If successful the TGT will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set. Otherwise the authentication will fail.

```java
isInitiator = false useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true principal = *
```

The acceptor will be an unbound acceptor and it can act as any principal
as long that principal has keys in the keytab.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <file name>
storeKey = true
principal = <principal name>
```

The client's TGT will be retrieved from the ticket cache and added to the

Subject

's private credentials. If the TGT is not available
in the ticket cache, or the TGT's client name does not match the principal
name, Java will use a secret key to obtain the TGT using the authentication
exchange and added to the Subject's private credentials.
This secret key will be first retrieved from the keytab. If the key
is not available, the user will be prompted for the password. In either
case, the key derived from the password will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set.

```java
isInitiator = false
```

Configured to act as acceptor only, credentials are not acquired
via AS exchange. For acceptors only, set this value to false.
For initiators, do not set this value to false.

```java
isInitiator = true
```

Configured to act as initiator, credentials are acquired
via AS exchange. For initiators, set this value to true, or leave this
option unset, in which case default value (true) will be used.

This is an illegal combination since none of

useTicketCache,
useKeyTab, useFirstPass

and

tryFirstPass

is set and the user can not be prompted for the password.

```java
ticketCache = <filename>
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is not set to true and the ticketCache is set. A configuration error
will occur.

```java
renewTGT = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is
not set to true and renewTGT is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
storeKey = true useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

storeKey

is set to
true but the key can not be obtained either by prompting the user or from

The Subject will be populated with the principal and the TGT.
If the key is not available or valid then authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true ticketCache = <filename>
```

The TGT will be obtained from the cache specified.
The Kerberos principal name used will be the principal name in
the Ticket cache. If the TGT is not available in the
ticket cache the user will be prompted for the principal name
and the password. The TGT will be obtained using the authentication
exchange with the KDC.
The Subject will be populated with the TGT.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab=<keytab filename> principal = <principal name> storeKey = true
```

The key for the principal will be retrieved from the keytab.
If the key is not available in the keytab the user will be prompted
for the principal's password. The Subject will be populated
with the principal's key either from the keytab or derived from the
password entered.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true doNotPrompt = false
```

The user will be prompted for the service principal name.
If the principal's
longterm key is available in the keytab , it will be added to the
Subject's private credentials. An authentication exchange will be
attempted with the principal name and the key from the Keytab.
If successful the TGT will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set. Otherwise the authentication will fail.

```java
isInitiator = false useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true principal = *
```

The acceptor will be an unbound acceptor and it can act as any principal
as long that principal has keys in the keytab.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <file name>
storeKey = true
principal = <principal name>
```

The client's TGT will be retrieved from the ticket cache and added to the

Subject

's private credentials. If the TGT is not available
in the ticket cache, or the TGT's client name does not match the principal
name, Java will use a secret key to obtain the TGT using the authentication
exchange and added to the Subject's private credentials.
This secret key will be first retrieved from the keytab. If the key
is not available, the user will be prompted for the password. In either
case, the key derived from the password will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set.

```java
isInitiator = false
```

Configured to act as acceptor only, credentials are not acquired
via AS exchange. For acceptors only, set this value to false.
For initiators, do not set this value to false.

```java
isInitiator = true
```

Configured to act as initiator, credentials are acquired
via AS exchange. For initiators, set this value to true, or leave this
option unset, in which case default value (true) will be used.

is true, the

KerberosTicket

is
added to the

Subject

's private credentials.

If the configuration entry for

KerberosLoginModule

has the option

storeKey

set to true, then

KerberosKey

or

KeyTab

will also be added to the
subject's private credentials.

KerberosKey

, the principal's
key(s) will be derived from user's password, and

KeyTab

is
the keytab used when

useKeyTab

is set to true. The

KeyTab

object is restricted to be used by the specified
principal unless the principal value is "*".

This

LoginModule

recognizes the

doNotPrompt

option. If set to true the user will not be prompted for the password.

The user can specify the location of the ticket cache by using
the option

ticketCache

in the configuration entry.

The user can specify the keytab location by using
the option

keyTab

in the configuration entry.

The principal name can be specified in the configuration entry
by using the option

principal

. The principal name
can either be a simple user name, a service name such as

host/mission.eng.sun.com

, or "*". The principal can also
be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

.
This property is checked during login. If this property is not set, then
the principal name from the configuration is used. In the
case where the principal property is not set and the principal
entry also does not exist, the user is prompted for the name.
When this property of entry is set, and

useTicketCache

is set to true, only TGT belonging to this principal is used.

The following is a list of configuration options supported
for

Krb5LoginModule

:

**refreshKrb5Config :** Set this to true, if you want the configuration
to be refreshed before the

login

method is called.
**useTicketCache :** Set this to true, if you want the
TGT to be obtained from the ticket cache. Set this option
to false if you do not want this module to use the ticket cache.
(Default is False).
This module will search for the ticket
cache in the following locations: On Solaris and Linux
it will look for the ticket cache in /tmp/krb5cc_

uid

where the uid is numeric user identifier. If the ticket cache is
not available in the above location, or if we are on a
Windows platform, it will look for the cache as
{user.home}{file.separator}krb5cc_{user.name}.
You can override the ticket cache location by using

ticketCache

.
For Windows, if a ticket cannot be retrieved from the file ticket cache,
it will use Local Security Authority (LSA) API to get the TGT.

ticketCache

:

Set this to the name of the ticket
cache that contains user's TGT.
If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be set to true; Otherwise a configuration error will
be returned.

renewTGT

:

Set this to true, if you want to renew the TGT when it's more than
half-way expired (the time until expiration is less than the time
since start time). If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be
set to true; otherwise a configuration error will be returned.

doNotPrompt

:

Set this to true if you do not want to be
prompted for the password
if credentials can not be obtained from the cache, the keytab,
or through shared state.(Default is false)
If set to true, credential must be obtained through cache, keytab,
or shared state. Otherwise, authentication will fail.

useKeyTab

:

Set this to true if you
want the module to get the principal's key from the
the keytab.(default value is False)
If

keytab

is not set then
the module will locate the keytab from the
Kerberos configuration file.
If it is not specified in the Kerberos configuration file
then it will look for the file

{user.home}{file.separator}

krb5.keytab.

keyTab

:

Set this to the file name of the
keytab to get principal's secret key.

storeKey

:

Set this to true to if you want the keytab or the
principal's key to be stored in the Subject's private credentials.
For

isInitiator

being false, if

principal

is "*", the

KeyTab

stored can be used by anyone, otherwise,
it's restricted to be used by the specified principal only.

principal

:

The name of the principal that should
be used. The principal can be a simple username such as
"

testuser

" or a service name such as
"

host/testhost.eng.sun.com

". You can use the

principal

option to set the principal when there are
credentials for multiple principals in the

keyTab

or when you want a specific ticket cache only.
The principal can also be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

. In addition, if this
system property is defined, then it will be used. If this property
is not set, then the principal name from the configuration will be
used.
The principal name can be set to "*" when

isInitiator

is false.
In this case, the acceptor is not bound to a single principal. It can
act as any principal an initiator requests if keys for that principal
can be found. When

isInitiator

is true, the principal name
cannot be set to "*".

isInitiator

:

Set this to true, if initiator. Set this to false, if acceptor only.
(Default is true).
Note: Do not set this value to false for initiators.

This

LoginModule

also recognizes the following additional

Configuration

options that enable you to share username and passwords across different
authentication modules:

**useFirstPass :** if, true, this LoginModule retrieves the
username and password from the module's shared state,
using "javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. The retrieved values are used for authentication.
If authentication fails, no attempt for a retry
is made, and the failure is reported back to the
calling application.
**tryFirstPass :** if, true, this LoginModule retrieves the
the username and password from the module's shared
state using "javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. The retrieved values are used for
authentication.
If authentication fails, the module uses the
CallbackHandler to retrieve a new username
and password, and another attempt to authenticate
is made. If the authentication fails,
the failure is reported back to the calling application
**storePass :** if, true, this LoginModule stores the username and
password obtained from the CallbackHandler in the
modules shared state, using
"javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. This is not performed if existing values already
exist for the username and password in the shared
state, or if authentication fails.
**clearPass :** if, true, this LoginModule clears the
username and password stored in the module's shared
state after both phases of authentication
(login and commit) have completed.

If the principal system property or key is already provided, the value of
"javax.security.auth.login.name" in the shared state is ignored.

When multiple mechanisms to retrieve a ticket or key is provided, the
preference order is:

- ticket cache

keytab

shared state

user prompt

Note that if any step fails, it will fallback to the next step.
There's only one exception, if the shared state step fails and

useFirstPass = true

, no user prompt is made.

Examples of some configuration values for Krb5LoginModule in
JAAS config file and the results are:

```java
doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since none of

useTicketCache,
useKeyTab, useFirstPass

and

tryFirstPass

is set and the user can not be prompted for the password.

```java
ticketCache = <filename>
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is not set to true and the ticketCache is set. A configuration error
will occur.

```java
renewTGT = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is
not set to true and renewTGT is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
storeKey = true useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

storeKey

is set to
true but the key can not be obtained either by prompting the user or from
the keytab, or from the shared state. A configuration error will occur.

```java
keyTab = <filename> doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since useKeyTab is not set to true and
the keyTab is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
debug = true
```

Prompt the user for the principal name and the password.
Use the authentication exchange to get TGT from the KDC and
populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT.
Output debug messages.

```java
useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Check the default cache for TGT and populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT. If the TGT is not available,
do not prompt the user, instead fail the authentication.

```java
principal = <name> useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Get the TGT from the default cache for the principal and populate the
Subject's principal and private creds set. If ticket cache is
not available or does not contain the principal's TGT
authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <keytab filename>
principal = <principal name>
doNotPrompt = true
```

Search the cache for the principal's TGT. If it is not available
use the key in the keytab to perform authentication exchange with the
KDC and acquire the TGT.
The Subject will be populated with the principal and the TGT.
If the key is not available or valid then authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true ticketCache = <filename>
```

The TGT will be obtained from the cache specified.
The Kerberos principal name used will be the principal name in
the Ticket cache. If the TGT is not available in the
ticket cache the user will be prompted for the principal name
and the password. The TGT will be obtained using the authentication
exchange with the KDC.
The Subject will be populated with the TGT.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab=<keytab filename> principal = <principal name> storeKey = true
```

The key for the principal will be retrieved from the keytab.
If the key is not available in the keytab the user will be prompted
for the principal's password. The Subject will be populated
with the principal's key either from the keytab or derived from the
password entered.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true doNotPrompt = false
```

The user will be prompted for the service principal name.
If the principal's
longterm key is available in the keytab , it will be added to the
Subject's private credentials. An authentication exchange will be
attempted with the principal name and the key from the Keytab.
If successful the TGT will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set. Otherwise the authentication will fail.

```java
isInitiator = false useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true principal = *
```

The acceptor will be an unbound acceptor and it can act as any principal
as long that principal has keys in the keytab.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <file name>
storeKey = true
principal = <principal name>
```

The client's TGT will be retrieved from the ticket cache and added to the

Subject

's private credentials. If the TGT is not available
in the ticket cache, or the TGT's client name does not match the principal
name, Java will use a secret key to obtain the TGT using the authentication
exchange and added to the Subject's private credentials.
This secret key will be first retrieved from the keytab. If the key
is not available, the user will be prompted for the password. In either
case, the key derived from the password will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set.

```java
isInitiator = false
```

Configured to act as acceptor only, credentials are not acquired
via AS exchange. For acceptors only, set this value to false.
For initiators, do not set this value to false.

```java
isInitiator = true
```

Configured to act as initiator, credentials are acquired
via AS exchange. For initiators, set this value to true, or leave this
option unset, in which case default value (true) will be used.

The configuration entry for

Krb5LoginModule

has
several options that control the authentication process and
additions to the

Subject

's private credential
set. Irrespective of these options, the

Subject

's
principal set and private credentials set are updated only when

commit

is called.
When

commit

is called, the

KerberosPrincipal

is added to the

Subject

's principal set (unless the

principal

is specified as "*"). If

isInitiator

is true, the

KerberosTicket

is
added to the

Subject

's private credentials.

If the configuration entry for

KerberosLoginModule

has the option

storeKey

set to true, then

KerberosKey

or

KeyTab

will also be added to the
subject's private credentials.

KerberosKey

, the principal's
key(s) will be derived from user's password, and

KeyTab

is
the keytab used when

useKeyTab

is set to true. The

KeyTab

object is restricted to be used by the specified
principal unless the principal value is "*".

This

LoginModule

recognizes the

doNotPrompt

option. If set to true the user will not be prompted for the password.

The user can specify the location of the ticket cache by using
the option

ticketCache

in the configuration entry.

The user can specify the keytab location by using
the option

keyTab

in the configuration entry.

The principal name can be specified in the configuration entry
by using the option

principal

. The principal name
can either be a simple user name, a service name such as

host/mission.eng.sun.com

, or "*". The principal can also
be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

.
This property is checked during login. If this property is not set, then
the principal name from the configuration is used. In the
case where the principal property is not set and the principal
entry also does not exist, the user is prompted for the name.
When this property of entry is set, and

useTicketCache

is set to true, only TGT belonging to this principal is used.

The following is a list of configuration options supported
for

Krb5LoginModule

:

**refreshKrb5Config :** Set this to true, if you want the configuration
to be refreshed before the

login

method is called.
**useTicketCache :** Set this to true, if you want the
TGT to be obtained from the ticket cache. Set this option
to false if you do not want this module to use the ticket cache.
(Default is False).
This module will search for the ticket
cache in the following locations: On Solaris and Linux
it will look for the ticket cache in /tmp/krb5cc_

uid

where the uid is numeric user identifier. If the ticket cache is
not available in the above location, or if we are on a
Windows platform, it will look for the cache as
{user.home}{file.separator}krb5cc_{user.name}.
You can override the ticket cache location by using

ticketCache

.
For Windows, if a ticket cannot be retrieved from the file ticket cache,
it will use Local Security Authority (LSA) API to get the TGT.

ticketCache

:

Set this to the name of the ticket
cache that contains user's TGT.
If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be set to true; Otherwise a configuration error will
be returned.

renewTGT

:

Set this to true, if you want to renew the TGT when it's more than
half-way expired (the time until expiration is less than the time
since start time). If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be
set to true; otherwise a configuration error will be returned.

doNotPrompt

:

Set this to true if you do not want to be
prompted for the password
if credentials can not be obtained from the cache, the keytab,
or through shared state.(Default is false)
If set to true, credential must be obtained through cache, keytab,
or shared state. Otherwise, authentication will fail.

useKeyTab

:

Set this to true if you
want the module to get the principal's key from the
the keytab.(default value is False)
If

keytab

is not set then
the module will locate the keytab from the
Kerberos configuration file.
If it is not specified in the Kerberos configuration file
then it will look for the file

{user.home}{file.separator}

krb5.keytab.

keyTab

:

Set this to the file name of the
keytab to get principal's secret key.

storeKey

:

Set this to true to if you want the keytab or the
principal's key to be stored in the Subject's private credentials.
For

isInitiator

being false, if

principal

is "*", the

KeyTab

stored can be used by anyone, otherwise,
it's restricted to be used by the specified principal only.

principal

:

The name of the principal that should
be used. The principal can be a simple username such as
"

testuser

" or a service name such as
"

host/testhost.eng.sun.com

principal

option to set the principal when there are
credentials for multiple principals in the

keyTab

or when you want a specific ticket cache only.
The principal can also be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

. In addition, if this
system property is defined, then it will be used. If this property
is not set, then the principal name from the configuration will be
used.
The principal name can be set to "*" when

isInitiator

is false.
In this case, the acceptor is not bound to a single principal. It can
act as any principal an initiator requests if keys for that principal
can be found. When

isInitiator

is true, the principal name
cannot be set to "*".

isInitiator

:

Set this to true, if initiator. Set this to false, if acceptor only.
(Default is true).
Note: Do not set this value to false for initiators.

Examples of some configuration values for Krb5LoginModule in
JAAS config file and the results are:

```java
doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since none of

useTicketCache,
useKeyTab, useFirstPass

and

tryFirstPass

is set and the user can not be prompted for the password.

```java
ticketCache = <filename>
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is not set to true and the ticketCache is set. A configuration error
will occur.

```java
renewTGT = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is
not set to true and renewTGT is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
storeKey = true useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

storeKey

is set to
true but the key can not be obtained either by prompting the user or from
the keytab, or from the shared state. A configuration error will occur.

```java
keyTab = <filename> doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since useKeyTab is not set to true and
the keyTab is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
debug = true
```

Prompt the user for the principal name and the password.
Use the authentication exchange to get TGT from the KDC and
populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT.
Output debug messages.

```java
useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Check the default cache for TGT and populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT. If the TGT is not available,
do not prompt the user, instead fail the authentication.

```java
principal = <name> useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Get the TGT from the default cache for the principal and populate the
Subject's principal and private creds set. If ticket cache is
not available or does not contain the principal's TGT
authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <keytab filename>
principal = <principal name>
doNotPrompt = true
```

Search the cache for the principal's TGT. If it is not available
use the key in the keytab to perform authentication exchange with the
KDC and acquire the TGT.
The Subject will be populated with the principal and the TGT.
If the key is not available or valid then authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true ticketCache = <filename>
```

The TGT will be obtained from the cache specified.
The Kerberos principal name used will be the principal name in
the Ticket cache. If the TGT is not available in the
ticket cache the user will be prompted for the principal name
and the password. The TGT will be obtained using the authentication
exchange with the KDC.
The Subject will be populated with the TGT.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab=<keytab filename> principal = <principal name> storeKey = true
```

The key for the principal will be retrieved from the keytab.
If the key is not available in the keytab the user will be prompted
for the principal's password. The Subject will be populated
with the principal's key either from the keytab or derived from the
password entered.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true doNotPrompt = false
```

The user will be prompted for the service principal name.
If the principal's
longterm key is available in the keytab , it will be added to the
Subject's private credentials. An authentication exchange will be
attempted with the principal name and the key from the Keytab.
If successful the TGT will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set. Otherwise the authentication will fail.

```java
isInitiator = false useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true principal = *
```

The acceptor will be an unbound acceptor and it can act as any principal
as long that principal has keys in the keytab.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <file name>
storeKey = true
principal = <principal name>
```

The client's TGT will be retrieved from the ticket cache and added to the

Subject

's private credentials. If the TGT is not available
in the ticket cache, or the TGT's client name does not match the principal
name, Java will use a secret key to obtain the TGT using the authentication
exchange and added to the Subject's private credentials.
This secret key will be first retrieved from the keytab. If the key
is not available, the user will be prompted for the password. In either
case, the key derived from the password will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set.

```java
isInitiator = false
```

Configured to act as acceptor only, credentials are not acquired
via AS exchange. For acceptors only, set this value to false.
For initiators, do not set this value to false.

```java
isInitiator = true
```

Configured to act as initiator, credentials are acquired
via AS exchange. For initiators, set this value to true, or leave this
option unset, in which case default value (true) will be used.

If the configuration entry for

KerberosLoginModule

has the option

storeKey

set to true, then

KerberosKey

or

KeyTab

will also be added to the
subject's private credentials.

KerberosKey

, the principal's
key(s) will be derived from user's password, and

KeyTab

is
the keytab used when

useKeyTab

is set to true. The

KeyTab

object is restricted to be used by the specified
principal unless the principal value is "*".

This

LoginModule

recognizes the

doNotPrompt

option. If set to true the user will not be prompted for the password.

The user can specify the location of the ticket cache by using
the option

ticketCache

in the configuration entry.

The user can specify the keytab location by using
the option

keyTab

in the configuration entry.

The principal name can be specified in the configuration entry
by using the option

principal

. The principal name
can either be a simple user name, a service name such as

host/mission.eng.sun.com

, or "*". The principal can also
be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

.
This property is checked during login. If this property is not set, then
the principal name from the configuration is used. In the
case where the principal property is not set and the principal
entry also does not exist, the user is prompted for the name.
When this property of entry is set, and

useTicketCache

is set to true, only TGT belonging to this principal is used.

The following is a list of configuration options supported
for

Krb5LoginModule

:

**refreshKrb5Config :** Set this to true, if you want the configuration

login

method is called.
**useTicketCache :** Set this to true, if you want the
TGT to be obtained from the ticket cache. Set this option
to false if you do not want this module to use the ticket cache.
(Default is False).
This module will search for the ticket
cache in the following locations: On Solaris and Linux
it will look for the ticket cache in /tmp/krb5cc_

uid

where the uid is numeric user identifier. If the ticket cache is
not available in the above location, or if we are on a
Windows platform, it will look for the cache as

You can override the ticket cache location by using

ticketCache

.
For Windows, if a ticket cannot be retrieved from the file ticket cache,
it will use Local Security Authority (LSA) API to get the TGT.

ticketCache

:

Set this to the name of the ticket
cache that contains user's TGT.
If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be set to true; Otherwise a configuration error will
be returned.

renewTGT

:

Set this to true, if you want to renew the TGT when it's more than
half-way expired (the time until expiration is less than the time
since start time). If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be
set to true; otherwise a configuration error will be returned.

doNotPrompt

:

Set this to true if you do not want to be

If set to true, credential must be obtained through cache, keytab,
or shared state. Otherwise, authentication will fail.

useKeyTab

:

Set this to true if you
want the module to get the principal's key from the
the keytab.(default value is False)
If

keytab

is not set then
the module will locate the keytab from the
Kerberos configuration file.
If it is not specified in the Kerberos configuration file
then it will look for the file

{user.home}{file.separator}

krb5.keytab.

keyTab

:

Set this to the file name of the
keytab to get principal's secret key.

storeKey

:

Set this to true to if you want the keytab or the
principal's key to be stored in the Subject's private credentials.
For

isInitiator

being false, if

principal

is "*", the

KeyTab

stored can be used by anyone, otherwise,
it's restricted to be used by the specified principal only.

principal

:

The name of the principal that should
be used. The principal can be a simple username such as
"

testuser

" or a service name such as
"

host/testhost.eng.sun.com

". You can use the

principal

option to set the principal when there are
credentials for multiple principals in the

keyTab

or when you want a specific ticket cache only.
The principal can also be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

. In addition, if this
system property is defined, then it will be used. If this property
is not set, then the principal name from the configuration will be
used.
The principal name can be set to "*" when

isInitiator

is false.
In this case, the acceptor is not bound to a single principal. It can
act as any principal an initiator requests if keys for that principal
can be found. When

is true, the principal name
cannot be set to "*".

isInitiator

:

Set this to true, if initiator. Set this to false, if acceptor only.
(Default is true).
Note: Do not set this value to false for initiators.

This

LoginModule

also recognizes the following additional

Configuration

options that enable you to share username and passwords across different
authentication modules:

**useFirstPass :** if, true, this LoginModule retrieves the
username and password from the module's shared state,
using "javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. The retrieved values are used for authentication.
If authentication fails, no attempt for a retry
is made, and the failure is reported back to the
calling application.
**tryFirstPass :** if, true, this LoginModule retrieves the
the username and password from the module's shared
state using "javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. The retrieved values are used for
authentication.
If authentication fails, the module uses the
CallbackHandler to retrieve a new username
and password, and another attempt to authenticate
is made. If the authentication fails,
the failure is reported back to the calling application
**storePass :** if, true, this LoginModule stores the username and
password obtained from the CallbackHandler in the
modules shared state, using
"javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. This is not performed if existing values already
exist for the username and password in the shared
state, or if authentication fails.
**clearPass :** if, true, this LoginModule clears the
username and password stored in the module's shared
state after both phases of authentication
(login and commit) have completed.

If the principal system property or key is already provided, the value of
"javax.security.auth.login.name" in the shared state is ignored.

When multiple mechanisms to retrieve a ticket or key is provided, the
preference order is:

- ticket cache

keytab

shared state

user prompt

Note that if any step fails, it will fallback to the next step.
There's only one exception, if the shared state step fails and

useFirstPass = true

, no user prompt is made.

Examples of some configuration values for Krb5LoginModule in
JAAS config file and the results are:

```java
doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since none of

useTicketCache,
useKeyTab, useFirstPass

and

tryFirstPass

is set and the user can not be prompted for the password.

```java
ticketCache = <filename>
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is not set to true and the ticketCache is set. A configuration error
will occur.

```java
renewTGT = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is
not set to true and renewTGT is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
storeKey = true useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

storeKey

is set to
true but the key can not be obtained either by prompting the user or from
the keytab, or from the shared state. A configuration error will occur.

```java
keyTab = <filename> doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since useKeyTab is not set to true and
the keyTab is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
debug = true
```

Prompt the user for the principal name and the password.
Use the authentication exchange to get TGT from the KDC and
populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT.
Output debug messages.

```java
useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Check the default cache for TGT and populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT. If the TGT is not available,
do not prompt the user, instead fail the authentication.

```java
principal = <name> useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Get the TGT from the default cache for the principal and populate the
Subject's principal and private creds set. If ticket cache is
not available or does not contain the principal's TGT
authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <keytab filename>
principal = <principal name>
doNotPrompt = true
```

Search the cache for the principal's TGT. If it is not available
use the key in the keytab to perform authentication exchange with the
KDC and acquire the TGT.
The Subject will be populated with the principal and the TGT.
If the key is not available or valid then authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true ticketCache = <filename>
```

The TGT will be obtained from the cache specified.
The Kerberos principal name used will be the principal name in
the Ticket cache. If the TGT is not available in the
ticket cache the user will be prompted for the principal name
and the password. The TGT will be obtained using the authentication
exchange with the KDC.
The Subject will be populated with the TGT.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab=<keytab filename> principal = <principal name> storeKey = true
```

The key for the principal will be retrieved from the keytab.
If the key is not available in the keytab the user will be prompted
for the principal's password. The Subject will be populated
with the principal's key either from the keytab or derived from the
password entered.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true doNotPrompt = false
```

The user will be prompted for the service principal name.
If the principal's
longterm key is available in the keytab , it will be added to the
Subject's private credentials. An authentication exchange will be
attempted with the principal name and the key from the Keytab.
If successful the TGT will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set. Otherwise the authentication will fail.

```java
isInitiator = false useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true principal = *
```

The acceptor will be an unbound acceptor and it can act as any principal
as long that principal has keys in the keytab.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <file name>
storeKey = true
principal = <principal name>
```

The client's TGT will be retrieved from the ticket cache and added to the

Subject

's private credentials. If the TGT is not available
in the ticket cache, or the TGT's client name does not match the principal
name, Java will use a secret key to obtain the TGT using the authentication
exchange and added to the Subject's private credentials.
This secret key will be first retrieved from the keytab. If the key
is not available, the user will be prompted for the password. In either
case, the key derived from the password will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set.

```java
isInitiator = false
```

Configured to act as acceptor only, credentials are not acquired
via AS exchange. For acceptors only, set this value to false.
For initiators, do not set this value to false.

```java
isInitiator = true
```

Configured to act as initiator, credentials are acquired
via AS exchange. For initiators, set this value to true, or leave this
option unset, in which case default value (true) will be used.

This

LoginModule

recognizes the

doNotPrompt

option. If set to true the user will not be prompted for the password.

The user can specify the location of the ticket cache by using
the option

ticketCache

in the configuration entry.

The user can specify the keytab location by using
the option

keyTab

in the configuration entry.

The principal name can be specified in the configuration entry
by using the option

principal

. The principal name
can either be a simple user name, a service name such as

host/mission.eng.sun.com

, or "*". The principal can also
be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

.
This property is checked during login. If this property is not set, then
the principal name from the configuration is used. In the
case where the principal property is not set and the principal
entry also does not exist, the user is prompted for the name.
When this property of entry is set, and

useTicketCache

is set to true, only TGT belonging to this principal is used.

The following is a list of configuration options supported
for

Krb5LoginModule

:

**refreshKrb5Config :** Set this to true, if you want the configuration
to be refreshed before the

login

method is called.
**useTicketCache :** Set this to true, if you want the
TGT to be obtained from the ticket cache. Set this option
to false if you do not want this module to use the ticket cache.
(Default is False).
This module will search for the ticket
cache in the following locations: On Solaris and Linux
it will look for the ticket cache in /tmp/krb5cc_

uid

where the uid is numeric user identifier. If the ticket cache is
not available in the above location, or if we are on a
Windows platform, it will look for the cache as
{user.home}{file.separator}krb5cc_{user.name}.
You can override the ticket cache location by using

ticketCache

.
For Windows, if a ticket cannot be retrieved from the file ticket cache,
it will use Local Security Authority (LSA) API to get the TGT.

ticketCache

:

Set this to the name of the ticket
cache that contains user's TGT.
If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be set to true; Otherwise a configuration error will
be returned.

renewTGT

:

Set this to true, if you want to renew the TGT when it's more than
half-way expired (the time until expiration is less than the time
since start time). If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be
set to true; otherwise a configuration error will be returned.

doNotPrompt

:

Set this to true if you do not want to be
prompted for the password
if credentials can not be obtained from the cache, the keytab,
or through shared state.(Default is false)
If set to true, credential must be obtained through cache, keytab,
or shared state. Otherwise, authentication will fail.

useKeyTab

:

Set this to true if you
want the module to get the principal's key from the
the keytab.(default value is False)
If

keytab

is not set then
the module will locate the keytab from the
Kerberos configuration file.
If it is not specified in the Kerberos configuration file
then it will look for the file

{user.home}{file.separator}

krb5.keytab.

keyTab

:

Set this to the file name of the
keytab to get principal's secret key.

storeKey

:

Set this to true to if you want the keytab or the
principal's key to be stored in the Subject's private credentials.
For

isInitiator

being false, if

principal

is "*", the

KeyTab

stored can be used by anyone, otherwise,
it's restricted to be used by the specified principal only.

principal

:

The name of the principal that should
be used. The principal can be a simple username such as
"

testuser

" or a service name such as
"

host/testhost.eng.sun.com

". You can use the

principal

option to set the principal when there are
credentials for multiple principals in the

keyTab

or when you want a specific ticket cache only.
The principal can also be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

. In addition, if this
system property is defined, then it will be used. If this property
is not set, then the principal name from the configuration will be
used.
The principal name can be set to "*" when

isInitiator

is false.
In this case, the acceptor is not bound to a single principal. It can
act as any principal an initiator requests if keys for that principal
can be found. When

isInitiator

is true, the principal name
cannot be set to "*".

isInitiator

:

Set this to true, if initiator. Set this to false, if acceptor only.
(Default is true).
Note: Do not set this value to false for initiators.

Subject's private credentials set.

```java
isInitiator = false
```

Configured to act as acceptor only, credentials are not acquired
via AS exchange. For acceptors only, set this value to false.
For initiators, do not set this value to false.

```java
isInitiator = true
```

Configured to act as initiator, credentials are acquired
via AS exchange. For initiators, set this value to true, or leave this
option unset, in which case default value (true) will be used.

The user can specify the keytab location by using
the option

keyTab

in the configuration entry.

The principal name can be specified in the configuration entry
by using the option

principal

. The principal name
can either be a simple user name, a service name such as

host/mission.eng.sun.com

, or "*". The principal can also
be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

.
This property is checked during login. If this property is not set, then
the principal name from the configuration is used. In the
case where the principal property is not set and the principal
entry also does not exist, the user is prompted for the name.
When this property of entry is set, and

useTicketCache

is set to true, only TGT belonging to this principal is used.

The following is a list of configuration options supported
for

Krb5LoginModule

:

**refreshKrb5Config :** Set this to true, if you want the configuration
to be refreshed before the

login

method is called.
**useTicketCache :** Set this to true, if you want the
TGT to be obtained from the ticket cache. Set this option
to false if you do not want this module to use the ticket cache.
(Default is False).
This module will search for the ticket
cache in the following locations: On Solaris and Linux
it will look for the ticket cache in /tmp/krb5cc_

uid

where the uid is numeric user identifier. If the ticket cache is
not available in the above location, or if we are on a
Windows platform, it will look for the cache as
{user.home}{file.separator}krb5cc_{user.name}.
You can override the ticket cache location by using

ticketCache

.
For Windows, if a ticket cannot be retrieved from the file ticket cache,
it will use Local Security Authority (LSA) API to get the TGT.

ticketCache

:

Set this to the name of the ticket
cache that contains user's TGT.
If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be set to true; Otherwise a configuration error will
be returned.

renewTGT

:

Set this to true, if you want to renew the TGT when it's more than
half-way expired (the time until expiration is less than the time
since start time). If this is set,

useTicketCache

must also be
set to true; otherwise a configuration error will be returned.

doNotPrompt

:

Set this to true if you do not want to be
prompted for the password
if credentials can not be obtained from the cache, the keytab,
or through shared state.(Default is false)
If set to true, credential must be obtained through cache, keytab,
or shared state. Otherwise, authentication will fail.

useKeyTab

:

Set this to true if you
want the module to get the principal's key from the
the keytab.(default value is False)
If

keytab

is not set then
the module will locate the keytab from the
Kerberos configuration file.
If it is not specified in the Kerberos configuration file
then it will look for the file

{user.home}{file.separator}

krb5.keytab.

keyTab

:

Set this to the file name of the
keytab to get principal's secret key.

storeKey

:

Set this to true to if you want the keytab or the
principal's key to be stored in the Subject's private credentials.
For

isInitiator

being false, if

principal

is "*", the

KeyTab

stored can be used by anyone, otherwise,
it's restricted to be used by the specified principal only.

principal

:

The name of the principal that should
be used. The principal can be a simple username such as
"

testuser

" or a service name such as
"

host/testhost.eng.sun.com

". You can use the

principal

option to set the principal when there are
credentials for multiple principals in the

keyTab

or when you want a specific ticket cache only.
The principal can also be set using the system property

sun.security.krb5.principal

. In addition, if this
system property is defined, then it will be used. If this property
is not set, then the principal name from the configuration will be
used.
The principal name can be set to "*" when

isInitiator

is false.
In this case, the acceptor is not bound to a single principal. It can
act as any principal an initiator requests if keys for that principal
can be found. When

isInitiator

is true, the principal name
cannot be set to "*".

isInitiator

:

Set this to true, if initiator. Set this to false, if acceptor only.
(Default is true).
Note: Do not set this value to false for initiators.

This

LoginModule

also recognizes the following additional

Configuration

options that enable you to share username and passwords across different
authentication modules:

**useFirstPass :** if, true, this LoginModule retrieves the
username and password from the module's shared state,
using "javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. The retrieved values are used for authentication.
If authentication fails, no attempt for a retry
is made, and the failure is reported back to the
calling application.
**tryFirstPass :** if, true, this LoginModule retrieves the
the username and password from the module's shared
state using "javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. The retrieved values are used for
authentication.
If authentication fails, the module uses the
CallbackHandler to retrieve a new username
and password, and another attempt to authenticate
is made. If the authentication fails,
the failure is reported back to the calling application
**storePass :** if, true, this LoginModule stores the username and
password obtained from the CallbackHandler in the
modules shared state, using
"javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. This is not performed if existing values already
exist for the username and password in the shared
state, or if authentication fails.
**clearPass :** if, true, this LoginModule clears the
username and password stored in the module's shared
state after both phases of authentication
(login and commit) have completed.

If the principal system property or key is already provided, the value of
"javax.security.auth.login.name" in the shared state is ignored.

When multiple mechanisms to retrieve a ticket or key is provided, the
preference order is:

- ticket cache

keytab

shared state

user prompt

Note that if any step fails, it will fallback to the next step.
There's only one exception, if the shared state step fails and

useFirstPass = true

, no user prompt is made.

Examples of some configuration values for Krb5LoginModule in
JAAS config file and the results are:

```java
doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since none of

useTicketCache,
useKeyTab, useFirstPass

and

tryFirstPass

is set and the user can not be prompted for the password.

```java
ticketCache = <filename>
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is not set to true and the ticketCache is set. A configuration error
will occur.

```java
renewTGT = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

useTicketCache

is
not set to true and renewTGT is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
storeKey = true useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since

storeKey

is set to
true but the key can not be obtained either by prompting the user or from
the keytab, or from the shared state. A configuration error will occur.

```java
keyTab = <filename> doNotPrompt = true
```

This is an illegal combination since useKeyTab is not set to true and
the keyTab is set. A configuration error will occur.

```java
debug = true
```

Prompt the user for the principal name and the password.
Use the authentication exchange to get TGT from the KDC and
populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT.
Output debug messages.

```java
useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Check the default cache for TGT and populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT. If the TGT is not available,
do not prompt the user, instead fail the authentication.

```java
principal = <name> useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Get the TGT from the default cache for the principal and populate the
Subject's principal and private creds set. If ticket cache is
not available or does not contain the principal's TGT
authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <keytab filename>
principal = <principal name>
doNotPrompt = true
```

Search the cache for the principal's TGT. If it is not available
use the key in the keytab to perform authentication exchange with the
KDC and acquire the TGT.
The Subject will be populated with the principal and the TGT.
If the key is not available or valid then authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true ticketCache = <filename>
```

The TGT will be obtained from the cache specified.
The Kerberos principal name used will be the principal name in
the Ticket cache. If the TGT is not available in the
ticket cache the user will be prompted for the principal name
and the password. The TGT will be obtained using the authentication
exchange with the KDC.
The Subject will be populated with the TGT.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab=<keytab filename> principal = <principal name> storeKey = true
```

The key for the principal will be retrieved from the keytab.
If the key is not available in the keytab the user will be prompted
for the principal's password. The Subject will be populated
with the principal's key either from the keytab or derived from the
password entered.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true doNotPrompt = false
```

The user will be prompted for the service principal name.
If the principal's
longterm key is available in the keytab , it will be added to the
Subject's private credentials. An authentication exchange will be
attempted with the principal name and the key from the Keytab.
If successful the TGT will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set. Otherwise the authentication will fail.

```java
isInitiator = false useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true principal = *
```

The acceptor will be an unbound acceptor and it can act as any principal
as long that principal has keys in the keytab.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <file name>
storeKey = true
principal = <principal name>
```

The client's TGT will be retrieved from the ticket cache and added to the

Subject

's private credentials. If the TGT is not available
in the ticket cache, or the TGT's client name does not match the principal
name, Java will use a secret key to obtain the TGT using the authentication
exchange and added to the Subject's private credentials.
This secret key will be first retrieved from the keytab. If the key
is not available, the user will be prompted for the password. In either
case, the key derived from the password will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set.

```java
isInitiator = false
```

Configured to act as acceptor only, credentials are not acquired
via AS exchange. For acceptors only, set this value to false.
For initiators, do not set this value to false.

```java
isInitiator = true
```

Configured to act as initiator, credentials are acquired
via AS exchange. For initiators, set this value to true, or leave this
option unset, in which case default value (true) will be used.

The principal name can be specified in the configuration entry
by using the option

principal

. The principal name
can either be a simple user name, a service name such as

host/mission.eng.sun.com

, or "*". The principal can also
be set using the system property

Prompt the user for the principal name and the password.
Use the authentication exchange to get TGT from the KDC and
populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT.
Output debug messages.

```java
useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Check the default cache for TGT and populate the

Subject

with the principal and TGT. If the TGT is not available,
do not prompt the user, instead fail the authentication.

```java
principal = <name> useTicketCache = true doNotPrompt = true
```

Get the TGT from the default cache for the principal and populate the
Subject's principal and private creds set. If ticket cache is
not available or does not contain the principal's TGT
authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <keytab filename>
principal = <principal name>
doNotPrompt = true
```

Search the cache for the principal's TGT. If it is not available
use the key in the keytab to perform authentication exchange with the
KDC and acquire the TGT.
The Subject will be populated with the principal and the TGT.
If the key is not available or valid then authentication will fail.

```java
useTicketCache = true ticketCache = <filename>
```

The TGT will be obtained from the cache specified.
The Kerberos principal name used will be the principal name in
the Ticket cache. If the TGT is not available in the
ticket cache the user will be prompted for the principal name
and the password. The TGT will be obtained using the authentication
exchange with the KDC.
The Subject will be populated with the TGT.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab=<keytab filename> principal = <principal name> storeKey = true
```

The key for the principal will be retrieved from the keytab.
If the key is not available in the keytab the user will be prompted
for the principal's password. The Subject will be populated
with the principal's key either from the keytab or derived from the
password entered.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true doNotPrompt = false
```

The user will be prompted for the service principal name.
If the principal's
longterm key is available in the keytab , it will be added to the
Subject's private credentials. An authentication exchange will be
attempted with the principal name and the key from the Keytab.
If successful the TGT will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set. Otherwise the authentication will fail.

```java
isInitiator = false useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true principal = *
```

The acceptor will be an unbound acceptor and it can act as any principal
as long that principal has keys in the keytab.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <file name>
storeKey = true
principal = <principal name>
```

The client's TGT will be retrieved from the ticket cache and added to the

Subject

's private credentials. If the TGT is not available
in the ticket cache, or the TGT's client name does not match the principal
name, Java will use a secret key to obtain the TGT using the authentication
exchange and added to the Subject's private credentials.
This secret key will be first retrieved from the keytab. If the key
is not available, the user will be prompted for the password. In either
case, the key derived from the password will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set.

```java
isInitiator = false
```

Configured to act as acceptor only, credentials are not acquired
via AS exchange. For acceptors only, set this value to false.
For initiators, do not set this value to false.

```java
isInitiator = true
```

Configured to act as initiator, credentials are acquired
via AS exchange. For initiators, set this value to true, or leave this
option unset, in which case default value (true) will be used.

This

LoginModule

also recognizes the following additional

Configuration

options that enable you to share username and passwords across different
authentication modules:

**useFirstPass :** if, true, this LoginModule retrieves the
username and password from the module's shared state,
using "javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. The retrieved values are used for authentication.
If authentication fails, no attempt for a retry
is made, and the failure is reported back to the
calling application.
**tryFirstPass :** if, true, this LoginModule retrieves the
the username and password from the module's shared
state using "javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. The retrieved values are used for
authentication.
If authentication fails, the module uses the
CallbackHandler to retrieve a new username
and password, and another attempt to authenticate
is made. If the authentication fails,
the failure is reported back to the calling application
**storePass :** if, true, this LoginModule stores the username and
password obtained from the CallbackHandler in the
modules shared state, using
"javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective
keys. This is not performed if existing values already
exist for the username and password in the shared
state, or if authentication fails.
**clearPass :** if, true, this LoginModule clears the
username and password stored in the module's shared
state after both phases of authentication
(login and commit) have completed.

If the principal system property or key is already provided, the value of
"javax.security.auth.login.name" in the shared state is ignored.

When multiple mechanisms to retrieve a ticket or key is provided, the
preference order is:

- ticket cache

keytab

shared state

user prompt

Note that if any step fails, it will fallback to the next step.
There's only one exception, if the shared state step fails and

useFirstPass = true

, no user prompt is made.

password entered.

```java
useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true doNotPrompt = false
```

The user will be prompted for the service principal name.
If the principal's
longterm key is available in the keytab , it will be added to the
Subject's private credentials. An authentication exchange will be
attempted with the principal name and the key from the Keytab.
If successful the TGT will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set. Otherwise the authentication will fail.

```java
isInitiator = false useKeyTab = true keyTab = <keytabname> storeKey = true principal = *
```

The acceptor will be an unbound acceptor and it can act as any principal
as long that principal has keys in the keytab.

```java
useTicketCache = true
ticketCache = <file name>
useKeyTab = true
keyTab = <file name>
storeKey = true
principal = <principal name>
```

The client's TGT will be retrieved from the ticket cache and added to the

Subject

's private credentials. If the TGT is not available
in the ticket cache, or the TGT's client name does not match the principal
name, Java will use a secret key to obtain the TGT using the authentication
exchange and added to the Subject's private credentials.
This secret key will be first retrieved from the keytab. If the key
is not available, the user will be prompted for the password. In either
case, the key derived from the password will be added to the
Subject's private credentials set.

```java
isInitiator = false
```

Configured to act as acceptor only, credentials are not acquired
via AS exchange. For acceptors only, set this value to false.
For initiators, do not set this value to false.

```java
isInitiator = true
```

Configured to act as initiator, credentials are acquired
via AS exchange. For initiators, set this value to true, or leave this
option unset, in which case default value (true) will be used.
