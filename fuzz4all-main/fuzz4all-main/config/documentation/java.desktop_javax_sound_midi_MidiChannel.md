# Interface MidiChannel

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\sound\midi\MidiChannel.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
MidiChannel
```

A

MidiChannel

object represents a single MIDI channel. Generally,
each

MidiChannel

method processes a like-named MIDI "channel voice"
or "channel mode" message as defined by the MIDI specification. However,

MidiChannel

adds some "get" methods that retrieve the value most
recently set by one of the standard MIDI channel messages. Similarly, methods
for per-channel solo and mute have been added.

A

Synthesizer

object has a collection of

MidiChannels

,
usually one for each of the 16 channels prescribed by the MIDI 1.0
specification. The

Synthesizer

generates sound when its

MidiChannels

receive

noteOn

messages.

See the MIDI 1.0 Specification for more information about the prescribed
behavior of the MIDI channel messages, which are not exhaustively documented
here. The specification is titled

MIDI Reference: The Complete MIDI 1.0 Detailed Specification

, and is
published by the MIDI Manufacturer's Association
(

http://www.midi.org

).

MIDI was originally a protocol for reporting the gestures of a keyboard
musician. This genesis is visible in the

MidiChannel

API, which
preserves such MIDI concepts as key number, key velocity, and key pressure.
It should be understood that the MIDI data does not necessarily originate
with a keyboard player (the source could be a different kind of musician, or
software). Some devices might generate constant values for velocity and
pressure, regardless of how the note was performed. Also, the MIDI
specification often leaves it up to the synthesizer to use the data in the
way the implementor sees fit. For example, velocity data need not always be
mapped to volume and/or brightness.

### Method Details

#### void noteOn​(int noteNumber,
int velocity)

Starts the specified note sounding. The key-down velocity usually
controls the note's volume and/or brightness. If

velocity

is
zero, this method instead acts like

noteOff(int)

, terminating
the note.

**Parameters:**
- noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)
- velocity

- the speed with which the key was depressed

**See Also:**
- noteOff(int, int)

---

#### void noteOff​(int noteNumber,
int velocity)

Turns the specified note off. The key-up velocity, if not ignored, can be
used to affect how quickly the note decays. In any case, the note might
not die away instantaneously; its decay rate is determined by the
internals of the

Instrument

. If the Hold Pedal (a controller; see

controlChange

) is down, the effect of
this method is deferred until the pedal is released.

**Parameters:**
- noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)
- velocity

- the speed with which the key was released

**See Also:**
- noteOff(int)

,

noteOn(int, int)

,

allNotesOff()

,

allSoundOff()

---

#### void noteOff​(int noteNumber)

Turns the specified note off.

**Parameters:**
- noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)

**See Also:**
- noteOff(int, int)

---

#### void setPolyPressure​(int noteNumber,
int pressure)

Reacts to a change in the specified note's key pressure. Polyphonic key
pressure allows a keyboard player to press multiple keys simultaneously,
each with a different amount of pressure. The pressure, if not ignored,
is typically used to vary such features as the volume, brightness, or
vibrato of the note.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support this MIDI
message. In order to verify that

setPolyPressure

was successful,
use

getPolyPressure

.

**Parameters:**
- noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)
- pressure

- value for the specified key, from 0 to 127
(127 = maximum pressure)

**See Also:**
- getPolyPressure(int)

---

#### int getPolyPressure​(int noteNumber)

Obtains the pressure with which the specified key is being depressed.

If the device does not support setting poly pressure, this method always
returns 0. Calling

setPolyPressure

will have no effect then.

**Parameters:**
- noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)

**Returns:**
- the amount of pressure for that note, from 0 to 127
(127 = maximum pressure)

**See Also:**
- setPolyPressure(int, int)

---

#### void setChannelPressure​(int pressure)

Reacts to a change in the keyboard pressure. Channel pressure indicates
how hard the keyboard player is depressing the entire keyboard. This can
be the maximum or average of the per-key pressure-sensor values, as set
by

setPolyPressure

. More commonly, it is a measurement of a
single sensor on a device that doesn't implement polyphonic key pressure.
Pressure can be used to control various aspects of the sound, as
described under

setPolyPressure

.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support this MIDI
message. In order to verify that

setChannelPressure

was
successful, use

getChannelPressure

.

**Parameters:**
- pressure

- the pressure with which the keyboard is being depressed,
from 0 to 127 (127 = maximum pressure)

**See Also:**
- setPolyPressure(int, int)

,

getChannelPressure()

---

#### int getChannelPressure()

Obtains the channel's keyboard pressure.

If the device does not support setting channel pressure, this method
always returns 0. Calling

setChannelPressure

will have no effect
then.

**Returns:**
- the amount of pressure for that note, from 0 to 127
(127 = maximum pressure)

**See Also:**
- setChannelPressure(int)

---

#### void controlChange​(int controller,
int value)

Reacts to a change in the specified controller's value. A controller is
some control other than a keyboard key, such as a switch, slider, pedal,
wheel, or breath-pressure sensor. The MIDI 1.0 Specification provides
standard numbers for typical controllers on MIDI devices, and describes
the intended effect for some of the controllers. The way in which an

Instrument

reacts to a controller change may be specific to the

Instrument

.

The MIDI 1.0 Specification defines both 7-bit controllers and 14-bit
controllers. Continuous controllers, such as wheels and sliders,
typically have 14 bits (two MIDI bytes), while discrete controllers, such
as switches, typically have 7 bits (one MIDI byte). Refer to the
specification to see the expected resolution for each type of control.

Controllers 64 through 95 (0x40 - 0x5F) allow 7-bit precision. The value
of a 7-bit controller is set completely by the

value

argument. An
additional set of controllers provide 14-bit precision by using two
controller numbers, one for the most significant 7 bits and another for
the least significant 7 bits. Controller numbers 0 through 31
(0x00 - 0x1F) control the most significant 7 bits of 14-bit controllers;
controller numbers 32 through 63 (0x20 - 0x3F) control the least
significant 7 bits of these controllers. For example, controller number 7
(0x07) controls the upper 7 bits of the channel volume controller, and
controller number 39 (0x27) controls the lower 7 bits. The value of a
14-bit controller is determined by the interaction of the two halves.
When the most significant 7 bits of a controller are set (using
controller numbers 0 through 31), the lower 7 bits are automatically set
to 0. The corresponding controller number for the lower 7 bits may then
be used to further modulate the controller value.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support a
specific controller message. In order to verify that a call to

controlChange

was successful, use

getController

.

**Parameters:**
- controller

- the controller number (0 to 127; see the MIDI 1.0
Specification for the interpretation)
- value

- the value to which the specified controller is changed
(0 to 127)

**See Also:**
- getController(int)

---

#### int getController​(int controller)

Obtains the current value of the specified controller. The return value
is represented with 7 bits. For 14-bit controllers, the MSB and LSB
controller value needs to be obtained separately. For example, the 14-bit
value of the volume controller can be calculated by multiplying the value
of controller 7 (0x07, channel volume MSB) with 128 and adding the value
of controller 39 (0x27, channel volume LSB).

If the device does not support setting a specific controller, this method
returns 0 for that controller. Calling

controlChange

will have no
effect then.

**Parameters:**
- controller

- the number of the controller whose value is desired.
The allowed range is 0-127; see the MIDI 1.0 Specification for
the interpretation.

**Returns:**
- the current value of the specified controller (0 to 127)

**See Also:**
- controlChange(int, int)

---

#### void programChange​(int program)

Changes a program (patch). This selects a specific instrument from the
currently selected bank of instruments.

The MIDI specification does not dictate whether notes that are already
sounding should switch to the new instrument (timbre) or continue with
their original timbre until terminated by a note-off.

The program number is zero-based (expressed from 0 to 127). Note that
MIDI hardware displays and literature about MIDI typically use the range
1 to 128 instead.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support a
specific program. In order to verify that a call to

programChange

was successful, use

getProgram

.

**Parameters:**
- program

- the program number to switch to (0 to 127)

**See Also:**
- programChange(int, int)

,

getProgram()

---

#### void programChange​(int bank,
int program)

Changes the program using bank and program (patch) numbers.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support a
specific bank, or program. In order to verify that a call to

programChange

was successful, use

getProgram

and

getController

. Since banks are changed by way of control changes,
you can verify the current bank with the following statement:

```java
int bank = (getController(0) * 128) + getController(32);
```

**Parameters:**
- bank

- the bank number to switch to (0 to 16383)
- program

- the program (patch) to use in the specified bank
(0 to 127)

**See Also:**
- programChange(int)

,

getProgram()

---

#### int getProgram()

Obtains the current program number for this channel.

**Returns:**
- the program number of the currently selected patch

**See Also:**
- Patch.getProgram()

,

Synthesizer.loadInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

,

programChange(int)

---

#### void setPitchBend​(int bend)

Changes the pitch offset for all notes on this channel. This affects all
currently sounding notes as well as subsequent ones. (For pitch bend to
cease, the value needs to be reset to the center position.)

The MIDI specification stipulates that pitch bend be a 14-bit value,
where zero is maximum downward bend, 16383 is maximum upward bend, and
8192 is the center (no pitch bend). The actual amount of pitch change is
not specified; it can be changed by a pitch-bend sensitivity setting.
However, the General MIDI specification says that the default range
should be two semitones up and down from center.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support this MIDI
message. In order to verify that

setPitchBend

was successful, use

getPitchBend

.

**Parameters:**
- bend

- the amount of pitch change, as a nonnegative 14-bit value
(8192 = no bend)

**See Also:**
- getPitchBend()

---

#### int getPitchBend()

Obtains the upward or downward pitch offset for this channel. If the
device does not support setting pitch bend, this method always returns
8192. Calling

setPitchBend

will have no effect then.

**Returns:**
- bend amount, as a nonnegative 14-bit value (8192 = no bend)

**See Also:**
- setPitchBend(int)

---

#### void resetAllControllers()

Resets all the implemented controllers to their default values.

**See Also:**
- controlChange(int, int)

---

#### void allNotesOff()

Turns off all notes that are currently sounding on this channel. The
notes might not die away instantaneously; their decay rate is determined
by the internals of the

Instrument

. If the Hold Pedal controller
(see

controlChange

) is down, the effect
of this method is deferred until the pedal is released.

**See Also:**
- allSoundOff()

,

noteOff(int)

---

#### void allSoundOff()

Immediately turns off all sounding notes on this channel, ignoring the
state of the Hold Pedal and the internal decay rate of the current

Instrument

.

**See Also:**
- allNotesOff()

---

#### boolean localControl​(boolean on)

Turns local control on or off. The default is for local control to be on.
The "on" setting means that if a device is capable of both synthesizing
sound and transmitting MIDI messages, it will synthesize sound in
response to the note-on and note-off messages that it itself transmits.
It will also respond to messages received from other transmitting
devices. The "off" setting means that the synthesizer will ignore its own
transmitted MIDI messages, but not those received from other devices.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support local
control. In order to verify that a call to

localControl

was
successful, check the return value.

**Parameters:**
- on

-

true

to turn local control on,

false

to turn
local control off

**Returns:**
- the new local-control value, or false if local control is not
supported

---

#### void setMono​(boolean on)

Turns mono mode on or off. In mono mode, the channel synthesizes only one
note at a time. In poly mode (identical to mono mode off), the channel
can synthesize multiple notes simultaneously. The default is mono off
(poly mode on).

"Mono" is short for the word "monophonic," which in this context is
opposed to the word "polyphonic" and refers to a single synthesizer voice
per MIDI channel. It has nothing to do with how many audio channels there
might be (as in "monophonic" versus "stereophonic" recordings).

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support mono
mode. In order to verify that a call to

setMono

was successful,
use

getMono

.

**Parameters:**
- on

-

true

to turn mono mode on,

false

to turn it
off (which means turning poly mode on)

**See Also:**
- getMono()

,

VoiceStatus

---

#### boolean getMono()

Obtains the current mono/poly mode. Synthesizers that do not allow
changing mono/poly mode will always return the same value, regardless of
calls to

setMono

.

**Returns:**
- true

if mono mode is on, otherwise

false

(meaning
poly mode is on)

**See Also:**
- setMono(boolean)

---

#### void setOmni​(boolean on)

Turns omni mode on or off. In omni mode, the channel responds to messages
sent on all channels. When omni is off, the channel responds only to
messages sent on its channel number. The default is omni off.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support omni
mode. In order to verify that

setOmni

was successful, use

getOmni

.

**Parameters:**
- on

-

true

to turn omni mode on,

false

to turn it
off

**See Also:**
- getOmni()

,

VoiceStatus

---

#### boolean getOmni()

Obtains the current omni mode. Synthesizers that do not allow changing
the omni mode will always return the same value, regardless of calls to

setOmni

.

**Returns:**
- true

if omni mode is on, otherwise

false

(meaning
omni mode is off)

**See Also:**
- setOmni(boolean)

---

#### void setMute​(boolean mute)

Sets the mute state for this channel. A value of

true

means the
channel is to be muted,

false

means the channel can sound (if
other channels are not soloed).

Unlike

allSoundOff()

, this method applies to only a specific
channel, not to all channels. Further, it silences not only currently
sounding notes, but also subsequently received notes.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support muting
channels. In order to verify that a call to

setMute

was
successful, use

getMute

.

**Parameters:**
- mute

- the new mute state

**See Also:**
- getMute()

,

setSolo(boolean)

---

#### boolean getMute()

Obtains the current mute state for this channel. If the underlying
synthesizer does not support muting this channel, this method always
returns

false

.

**Returns:**
- true

the channel is muted, or

false

if not

**See Also:**
- setMute(boolean)

---

#### void setSolo​(boolean soloState)

Sets the solo state for this channel. If

solo

is

true

only this channel and other soloed channels will sound. If

solo

is

false

then only other soloed channels will sound, unless no
channels are soloed, in which case all unmuted channels will sound.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support solo
channels. In order to verify that a call to

setSolo

was
successful, use

getSolo

.

**Parameters:**
- soloState

- new solo state for the channel

**See Also:**
- getSolo()

---

#### boolean getSolo()

Obtains the current solo state for this channel. If the underlying
synthesizer does not support solo on this channel, this method always
returns

false

.

**Returns:**
- true

the channel is solo, or

false

if not

**See Also:**
- setSolo(boolean)

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- noteOn

```java
void noteOn​(int noteNumber,
int velocity)
```

Starts the specified note sounding. The key-down velocity usually
controls the note's volume and/or brightness. If

velocity

is
zero, this method instead acts like

noteOff(int)

, terminating
the note.

**Parameters:** noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)
**Parameters:** velocity

- the speed with which the key was depressed
**See Also:** noteOff(int, int)

- noteOff

```java
void noteOff​(int noteNumber,
int velocity)
```

Turns the specified note off. The key-up velocity, if not ignored, can be
used to affect how quickly the note decays. In any case, the note might
not die away instantaneously; its decay rate is determined by the
internals of the

Instrument

. If the Hold Pedal (a controller; see

controlChange

) is down, the effect of
this method is deferred until the pedal is released.

**Parameters:** noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)
**Parameters:** velocity

- the speed with which the key was released
**See Also:** noteOff(int)

,

noteOn(int, int)

,

allNotesOff()

,

allSoundOff()

- noteOff

```java
void noteOff​(int noteNumber)
```

Turns the specified note off.

**Parameters:** noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)
**See Also:** noteOff(int, int)

- setPolyPressure

```java
void setPolyPressure​(int noteNumber,
int pressure)
```

Reacts to a change in the specified note's key pressure. Polyphonic key
pressure allows a keyboard player to press multiple keys simultaneously,
each with a different amount of pressure. The pressure, if not ignored,
is typically used to vary such features as the volume, brightness, or
vibrato of the note.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support this MIDI
message. In order to verify that

setPolyPressure

was successful,
use

getPolyPressure

.

**Parameters:** noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)
**Parameters:** pressure

- value for the specified key, from 0 to 127
(127 = maximum pressure)
**See Also:** getPolyPressure(int)

- getPolyPressure

```java
int getPolyPressure​(int noteNumber)
```

Obtains the pressure with which the specified key is being depressed.

If the device does not support setting poly pressure, this method always
returns 0. Calling

setPolyPressure

will have no effect then.

**Parameters:** noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)
**Returns:** the amount of pressure for that note, from 0 to 127
(127 = maximum pressure)
**See Also:** setPolyPressure(int, int)

- setChannelPressure

```java
void setChannelPressure​(int pressure)
```

Reacts to a change in the keyboard pressure. Channel pressure indicates
how hard the keyboard player is depressing the entire keyboard. This can
be the maximum or average of the per-key pressure-sensor values, as set
by

setPolyPressure

. More commonly, it is a measurement of a
single sensor on a device that doesn't implement polyphonic key pressure.
Pressure can be used to control various aspects of the sound, as
described under

setPolyPressure

.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support this MIDI
message. In order to verify that

setChannelPressure

was
successful, use

getChannelPressure

.

**Parameters:** pressure

- the pressure with which the keyboard is being depressed,
from 0 to 127 (127 = maximum pressure)
**See Also:** setPolyPressure(int, int)

,

getChannelPressure()

- getChannelPressure

```java
int getChannelPressure()
```

Obtains the channel's keyboard pressure.

If the device does not support setting channel pressure, this method
always returns 0. Calling

setChannelPressure

will have no effect
then.

**Returns:** the amount of pressure for that note, from 0 to 127
(127 = maximum pressure)
**See Also:** setChannelPressure(int)

- controlChange

```java
void controlChange​(int controller,
int value)
```

Reacts to a change in the specified controller's value. A controller is
some control other than a keyboard key, such as a switch, slider, pedal,
wheel, or breath-pressure sensor. The MIDI 1.0 Specification provides
standard numbers for typical controllers on MIDI devices, and describes
the intended effect for some of the controllers. The way in which an

Instrument

reacts to a controller change may be specific to the

Instrument

.

The MIDI 1.0 Specification defines both 7-bit controllers and 14-bit
controllers. Continuous controllers, such as wheels and sliders,
typically have 14 bits (two MIDI bytes), while discrete controllers, such
as switches, typically have 7 bits (one MIDI byte). Refer to the
specification to see the expected resolution for each type of control.

Controllers 64 through 95 (0x40 - 0x5F) allow 7-bit precision. The value
of a 7-bit controller is set completely by the

value

argument. An
additional set of controllers provide 14-bit precision by using two
controller numbers, one for the most significant 7 bits and another for
the least significant 7 bits. Controller numbers 0 through 31
(0x00 - 0x1F) control the most significant 7 bits of 14-bit controllers;
controller numbers 32 through 63 (0x20 - 0x3F) control the least
significant 7 bits of these controllers. For example, controller number 7
(0x07) controls the upper 7 bits of the channel volume controller, and
controller number 39 (0x27) controls the lower 7 bits. The value of a
14-bit controller is determined by the interaction of the two halves.
When the most significant 7 bits of a controller are set (using
controller numbers 0 through 31), the lower 7 bits are automatically set
to 0. The corresponding controller number for the lower 7 bits may then
be used to further modulate the controller value.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support a
specific controller message. In order to verify that a call to

controlChange

was successful, use

getController

.

**Parameters:** controller

- the controller number (0 to 127; see the MIDI 1.0
Specification for the interpretation)
**Parameters:** value

- the value to which the specified controller is changed
(0 to 127)
**See Also:** getController(int)

- getController

```java
int getController​(int controller)
```

Obtains the current value of the specified controller. The return value
is represented with 7 bits. For 14-bit controllers, the MSB and LSB
controller value needs to be obtained separately. For example, the 14-bit
value of the volume controller can be calculated by multiplying the value
of controller 7 (0x07, channel volume MSB) with 128 and adding the value
of controller 39 (0x27, channel volume LSB).

If the device does not support setting a specific controller, this method
returns 0 for that controller. Calling

controlChange

will have no
effect then.

**Parameters:** controller

- the number of the controller whose value is desired.
The allowed range is 0-127; see the MIDI 1.0 Specification for
the interpretation.
**Returns:** the current value of the specified controller (0 to 127)
**See Also:** controlChange(int, int)

- programChange

```java
void programChange​(int program)
```

Changes a program (patch). This selects a specific instrument from the
currently selected bank of instruments.

The MIDI specification does not dictate whether notes that are already
sounding should switch to the new instrument (timbre) or continue with
their original timbre until terminated by a note-off.

The program number is zero-based (expressed from 0 to 127). Note that
MIDI hardware displays and literature about MIDI typically use the range
1 to 128 instead.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support a
specific program. In order to verify that a call to

programChange

was successful, use

getProgram

.

**Parameters:** program

- the program number to switch to (0 to 127)
**See Also:** programChange(int, int)

,

getProgram()

- programChange

```java
void programChange​(int bank,
int program)
```

Changes the program using bank and program (patch) numbers.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support a
specific bank, or program. In order to verify that a call to

programChange

was successful, use

getProgram

and

getController

. Since banks are changed by way of control changes,
you can verify the current bank with the following statement:

```java
int bank = (getController(0) * 128) + getController(32);
```

**Parameters:** bank

- the bank number to switch to (0 to 16383)
**Parameters:** program

- the program (patch) to use in the specified bank
(0 to 127)
**See Also:** programChange(int)

,

getProgram()

- getProgram

```java
int getProgram()
```

Obtains the current program number for this channel.

**Returns:** the program number of the currently selected patch
**See Also:** Patch.getProgram()

,

Synthesizer.loadInstrument(javax.sound.midi.Instrument)

,

programChange(int)

- setPitchBend

```java
void setPitchBend​(int bend)
```

Changes the pitch offset for all notes on this channel. This affects all
currently sounding notes as well as subsequent ones. (For pitch bend to
cease, the value needs to be reset to the center position.)

The MIDI specification stipulates that pitch bend be a 14-bit value,
where zero is maximum downward bend, 16383 is maximum upward bend, and
8192 is the center (no pitch bend). The actual amount of pitch change is
not specified; it can be changed by a pitch-bend sensitivity setting.
However, the General MIDI specification says that the default range
should be two semitones up and down from center.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support this MIDI
message. In order to verify that

setPitchBend

was successful, use

getPitchBend

.

**Parameters:** bend

- the amount of pitch change, as a nonnegative 14-bit value
(8192 = no bend)
**See Also:** getPitchBend()

- getPitchBend

```java
int getPitchBend()
```

Obtains the upward or downward pitch offset for this channel. If the
device does not support setting pitch bend, this method always returns
8192. Calling

setPitchBend

will have no effect then.

**Returns:** bend amount, as a nonnegative 14-bit value (8192 = no bend)
**See Also:** setPitchBend(int)

- resetAllControllers

```java
void resetAllControllers()
```

Resets all the implemented controllers to their default values.

**See Also:** controlChange(int, int)

- allNotesOff

```java
void allNotesOff()
```

Turns off all notes that are currently sounding on this channel. The
notes might not die away instantaneously; their decay rate is determined
by the internals of the

Instrument

. If the Hold Pedal controller
(see

controlChange

) is down, the effect
of this method is deferred until the pedal is released.

**See Also:** allSoundOff()

,

noteOff(int)

- allSoundOff

```java
void allSoundOff()
```

Immediately turns off all sounding notes on this channel, ignoring the
state of the Hold Pedal and the internal decay rate of the current

Instrument

.

**See Also:** allNotesOff()

- localControl

```java
boolean localControl​(boolean on)
```

Turns local control on or off. The default is for local control to be on.
The "on" setting means that if a device is capable of both synthesizing
sound and transmitting MIDI messages, it will synthesize sound in
response to the note-on and note-off messages that it itself transmits.
It will also respond to messages received from other transmitting
devices. The "off" setting means that the synthesizer will ignore its own
transmitted MIDI messages, but not those received from other devices.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support local
control. In order to verify that a call to

localControl

was
successful, check the return value.

**Parameters:** on

-

true

to turn local control on,

false

to turn
local control off
**Returns:** the new local-control value, or false if local control is not
supported

- setMono

```java
void setMono​(boolean on)
```

Turns mono mode on or off. In mono mode, the channel synthesizes only one
note at a time. In poly mode (identical to mono mode off), the channel
can synthesize multiple notes simultaneously. The default is mono off
(poly mode on).

"Mono" is short for the word "monophonic," which in this context is
opposed to the word "polyphonic" and refers to a single synthesizer voice
per MIDI channel. It has nothing to do with how many audio channels there
might be (as in "monophonic" versus "stereophonic" recordings).

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support mono
mode. In order to verify that a call to

setMono

was successful,
use

getMono

.

**Parameters:** on

-

true

to turn mono mode on,

false

to turn it
off (which means turning poly mode on)
**See Also:** getMono()

,

VoiceStatus

- getMono

```java
boolean getMono()
```

Obtains the current mono/poly mode. Synthesizers that do not allow
changing mono/poly mode will always return the same value, regardless of
calls to

setMono

.

**Returns:** true

if mono mode is on, otherwise

false

(meaning
poly mode is on)
**See Also:** setMono(boolean)

- setOmni

```java
void setOmni​(boolean on)
```

Turns omni mode on or off. In omni mode, the channel responds to messages
sent on all channels. When omni is off, the channel responds only to
messages sent on its channel number. The default is omni off.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support omni
mode. In order to verify that

setOmni

was successful, use

getOmni

.

**Parameters:** on

-

true

to turn omni mode on,

false

to turn it
off
**See Also:** getOmni()

,

VoiceStatus

- getOmni

```java
boolean getOmni()
```

Obtains the current omni mode. Synthesizers that do not allow changing
the omni mode will always return the same value, regardless of calls to

setOmni

.

**Returns:** true

if omni mode is on, otherwise

false

(meaning
omni mode is off)
**See Also:** setOmni(boolean)

- setMute

```java
void setMute​(boolean mute)
```

Sets the mute state for this channel. A value of

true

means the
channel is to be muted,

false

means the channel can sound (if
other channels are not soloed).

Unlike

allSoundOff()

, this method applies to only a specific
channel, not to all channels. Further, it silences not only currently
sounding notes, but also subsequently received notes.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support muting
channels. In order to verify that a call to

setMute

was
successful, use

getMute

.

**Parameters:** mute

- the new mute state
**See Also:** getMute()

,

setSolo(boolean)

- getMute

```java
boolean getMute()
```

Obtains the current mute state for this channel. If the underlying
synthesizer does not support muting this channel, this method always
returns

false

.

**Returns:** true

the channel is muted, or

false

if not
**See Also:** setMute(boolean)

- setSolo

```java
void setSolo​(boolean soloState)
```

Sets the solo state for this channel. If

solo

is

true

only this channel and other soloed channels will sound. If

solo

is

false

then only other soloed channels will sound, unless no
channels are soloed, in which case all unmuted channels will sound.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support solo
channels. In order to verify that a call to

setSolo

was
successful, use

getSolo

.

**Parameters:** soloState

- new solo state for the channel
**See Also:** getSolo()

- getSolo

```java
boolean getSolo()
```

Obtains the current solo state for this channel. If the underlying
synthesizer does not support solo on this channel, this method always
returns

false

.

**Returns:** true

the channel is solo, or

false

if not
**See Also:** setSolo(boolean)

int pressure)
```

Reacts to a change in the specified note's key pressure. Polyphonic key
pressure allows a keyboard player to press multiple keys simultaneously,
each with a different amount of pressure. The pressure, if not ignored,
is typically used to vary such features as the volume, brightness, or
vibrato of the note.

void controlChange​(int controller,
int value)
```

Reacts to a change in the specified controller's value. A controller is

(0 to 127)
**See Also:** getController(int)

- getController

```java
int getController​(int controller)
```

Obtains the current value of the specified controller. The return value
is represented with 7 bits. For 14-bit controllers, the MSB and LSB
controller value needs to be obtained separately. For example, the 14-bit
value of the volume controller can be calculated by multiplying the value
of controller 7 (0x07, channel volume MSB) with 128 and adding the value
of controller 39 (0x27, channel volume LSB).

sounding should switch to the new instrument (timbre) or continue with
their original timbre until terminated by a note-off.

The program number is zero-based (expressed from 0 to 127). Note that

Changes the pitch offset for all notes on this channel. This affects all
currently sounding notes as well as subsequent ones. (For pitch bend to
cease, the value needs to be reset to the center position.)

The MIDI specification stipulates that pitch bend be a 14-bit value,
where zero is maximum downward bend, 16383 is maximum upward bend, and
8192 is the center (no pitch bend). The actual amount of pitch change is
not specified; it can be changed by a pitch-bend sensitivity setting.
However, the General MIDI specification says that the default range
should be two semitones up and down from center.

**See Also:** controlChange(int, int)

- allNotesOff

```java
void allNotesOff()
```

Turns off all notes that are currently sounding on this channel. The
notes might not die away instantaneously; their decay rate is determined
by the internals of the

Instrument

. If the Hold Pedal controller
(see

controlChange

) is down, the effect
of this method is deferred until the pedal is released.

**See Also:** allSoundOff()

,

Instrument

.

**See Also:** allNotesOff()

- localControl

```java
boolean localControl​(boolean on)
```

Turns local control on or off. The default is for local control to be on.
The "on" setting means that if a device is capable of both synthesizing
sound and transmitting MIDI messages, it will synthesize sound in
response to the note-on and note-off messages that it itself transmits.
It will also respond to messages received from other transmitting
devices. The "off" setting means that the synthesizer will ignore its own
transmitted MIDI messages, but not those received from other devices.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support local
control. In order to verify that a call to

localControl

was
successful, check the return value.

**Parameters:** on

-

true

to turn local control on,

false

to turn
local control off
**Returns:** the new local-control value, or false if local control is not
supported

- setMono

```java
void setMono​(boolean on)
```

Turns mono mode on or off. In mono mode, the channel synthesizes only one
note at a time. In poly mode (identical to mono mode off), the channel
can synthesize multiple notes simultaneously. The default is mono off
(poly mode on).

"Mono" is short for the word "monophonic," which in this context is
opposed to the word "polyphonic" and refers to a single synthesizer voice
per MIDI channel. It has nothing to do with how many audio channels there
might be (as in "monophonic" versus "stereophonic" recordings).

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support mono
mode. In order to verify that a call to

setMono

was successful,
use

getMono

.

**Parameters:** on

-

true

to turn mono mode on,

false

to turn it
off (which means turning poly mode on)
**See Also:** getMono()

,

VoiceStatus

- getMono

```java
boolean getMono()
```

Obtains the current mono/poly mode. Synthesizers that do not allow
changing mono/poly mode will always return the same value, regardless of
calls to

setMono

.

**Returns:** true

if mono mode is on, otherwise

false

(meaning
poly mode is on)
**See Also:** setMono(boolean)

- setOmni

```java
void setOmni​(boolean on)
```

Turns omni mode on or off. In omni mode, the channel responds to messages
sent on all channels. When omni is off, the channel responds only to
messages sent on its channel number. The default is omni off.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support omni
mode. In order to verify that

setOmni

was successful, use

getOmni

.

**Parameters:** on

-

true

to turn omni mode on,

false

to turn it
off
**See Also:** getOmni()

,

VoiceStatus

- getOmni

```java
boolean getOmni()
```

Obtains the current omni mode. Synthesizers that do not allow changing
the omni mode will always return the same value, regardless of calls to

setOmni

.

**Returns:** true

if omni mode is on, otherwise

false

(meaning
omni mode is off)
**See Also:** setOmni(boolean)

- setMute

```java
void setMute​(boolean mute)
```

Sets the mute state for this channel. A value of

true

means the
channel is to be muted,

false

means the channel can sound (if
other channels are not soloed).

Unlike

allSoundOff()

, this method applies to only a specific
channel, not to all channels. Further, it silences not only currently
sounding notes, but also subsequently received notes.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support muting
channels. In order to verify that a call to

setMute

was
successful, use

getMute

.

**Parameters:** mute

- the new mute state
**See Also:** getMute()

,

setSolo(boolean)

- getMute

```java
boolean getMute()
```

Obtains the current mute state for this channel. If the underlying
synthesizer does not support muting this channel, this method always
returns

false

.

**Returns:** true

the channel is muted, or

false

if not
**See Also:** setMute(boolean)

- setSolo

```java
void setSolo​(boolean soloState)
```

Sets the solo state for this channel. If

solo

is

true

only this channel and other soloed channels will sound. If

solo

is

false

then only other soloed channels will sound, unless no
channels are soloed, in which case all unmuted channels will sound.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support solo
channels. In order to verify that a call to

setSolo

was
successful, use

getSolo

.

**Parameters:** soloState

- new solo state for the channel
**See Also:** getSolo()

- getSolo

```java
boolean getSolo()
```

Obtains the current solo state for this channel. If the underlying
synthesizer does not support solo on this channel, this method always
returns

false

.

**Returns:** true

the channel is solo, or

false

if not
**See Also:** setSolo(boolean)

#### Method Detail

noteOn

```java
void noteOn​(int noteNumber,
int velocity)
```

Starts the specified note sounding. The key-down velocity usually
controls the note's volume and/or brightness. If

velocity

is
zero, this method instead acts like

noteOff(int)

, terminating
the note.

**Parameters:** noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)
**Parameters:** velocity

- the speed with which the key was depressed
**See Also:** noteOff(int, int)

#### noteOn

void noteOn​(int noteNumber,
int velocity)

Starts the specified note sounding. The key-down velocity usually
controls the note's volume and/or brightness. If

velocity

is
zero, this method instead acts like

noteOff(int)

, terminating
the note.

noteOff

```java
void noteOff​(int noteNumber,
int velocity)
```

Turns the specified note off. The key-up velocity, if not ignored, can be
used to affect how quickly the note decays. In any case, the note might
not die away instantaneously; its decay rate is determined by the
internals of the

Instrument

. If the Hold Pedal (a controller; see

controlChange

) is down, the effect of
this method is deferred until the pedal is released.

**Parameters:** noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)

setPolyPressure

```java
void setPolyPressure​(int noteNumber,
int pressure)
```

Reacts to a change in the specified note's key pressure. Polyphonic key
pressure allows a keyboard player to press multiple keys simultaneously,
each with a different amount of pressure. The pressure, if not ignored,
is typically used to vary such features as the volume, brightness, or
vibrato of the note.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support this MIDI
message. In order to verify that

setPolyPressure

was successful,
use

getPolyPressure

.

**Parameters:** noteNumber

- the MIDI note number, from 0 to 127 (60 = Middle C)

setChannelPressure

```java
void setChannelPressure​(int pressure)
```

Reacts to a change in the keyboard pressure. Channel pressure indicates
how hard the keyboard player is depressing the entire keyboard. This can
be the maximum or average of the per-key pressure-sensor values, as set
by

setPolyPressure

. More commonly, it is a measurement of a
single sensor on a device that doesn't implement polyphonic key pressure.
Pressure can be used to control various aspects of the sound, as
described under

controlChange

```java
void controlChange​(int controller,
int value)
```

Reacts to a change in the specified controller's value. A controller is
some control other than a keyboard key, such as a switch, slider, pedal,
wheel, or breath-pressure sensor. The MIDI 1.0 Specification provides
standard numbers for typical controllers on MIDI devices, and describes
the intended effect for some of the controllers. The way in which an

Instrument

reacts to a controller change may be specific to the

Instrument

.

The MIDI 1.0 Specification defines both 7-bit controllers and 14-bit
controllers. Continuous controllers, such as wheels and sliders,
typically have 14 bits (two MIDI bytes), while discrete controllers, such
as switches, typically have 7 bits (one MIDI byte). Refer to the
specification to see the expected resolution for each type of control.

Controllers 64 through 95 (0x40 - 0x5F) allow 7-bit precision. The value
of a 7-bit controller is set completely by the

value

argument. An
additional set of controllers provide 14-bit precision by using two
controller numbers, one for the most significant 7 bits and another for
the least significant 7 bits. Controller numbers 0 through 31
(0x00 - 0x1F) control the most significant 7 bits of 14-bit controllers;
controller numbers 32 through 63 (0x20 - 0x3F) control the least
significant 7 bits of these controllers. For example, controller number 7
(0x07) controls the upper 7 bits of the channel volume controller, and
controller number 39 (0x27) controls the lower 7 bits. The value of a
14-bit controller is determined by the interaction of the two halves.
When the most significant 7 bits of a controller are set (using
controller numbers 0 through 31), the lower 7 bits are automatically set
to 0. The corresponding controller number for the lower 7 bits may then
be used to further modulate the controller value.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support a
specific controller message. In order to verify that a call to

controlChange

was successful, use

getController

.

**Parameters:** controller

- the controller number (0 to 127; see the MIDI 1.0
Specification for the interpretation)
**Parameters:** value

- the value to which the specified controller is changed
(0 to 127)

getController

```java
int getController​(int controller)
```

Obtains the current value of the specified controller. The return value
is represented with 7 bits. For 14-bit controllers, the MSB and LSB
controller value needs to be obtained separately. For example, the 14-bit
value of the volume controller can be calculated by multiplying the value
of controller 7 (0x07, channel volume MSB) with 128 and adding the value
of controller 39 (0x27, channel volume LSB).

If the device does not support setting a specific controller, this method
returns 0 for that controller. Calling

will have no
effect then.

**Parameters:** controller

- the number of the controller whose value is desired.
The allowed range is 0-127; see the MIDI 1.0 Specification for
the interpretation.
**Returns:** the current value of the specified controller (0 to 127)

localControl

```java
boolean localControl​(boolean on)
```

Turns local control on or off. The default is for local control to be on.
The "on" setting means that if a device is capable of both synthesizing
sound and transmitting MIDI messages, it will synthesize sound in
response to the note-on and note-off messages that it itself transmits.
It will also respond to messages received from other transmitting
devices. The "off" setting means that the synthesizer will ignore its own
transmitted MIDI messages, but not those received from other devices.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support local
control. In order to verify that a call to

localControl

was
successful, check the return value.

**Parameters:** on

-

true

to turn local control on,

false

to turn
local control off
**Returns:** the new local-control value, or false if local control is not
supported

---

#### localControl

boolean localControl​(boolean on)

Turns local control on or off. The default is for local control to be on.
The "on" setting means that if a device is capable of both synthesizing
sound and transmitting MIDI messages, it will synthesize sound in
response to the note-on and note-off messages that it itself transmits.
It will also respond to messages received from other transmitting
devices. The "off" setting means that the synthesizer will ignore its own
transmitted MIDI messages, but not those received from other devices.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support local
control. In order to verify that a call to

localControl

was
successful, check the return value.

setMono

```java
void setMono​(boolean on)
```

Turns mono mode on or off. In mono mode, the channel synthesizes only one
note at a time. In poly mode (identical to mono mode off), the channel
can synthesize multiple notes simultaneously. The default is mono off
(poly mode on).

"Mono" is short for the word "monophonic," which in this context is
opposed to the word "polyphonic" and refers to a single synthesizer voice
per MIDI channel. It has nothing to do with how many audio channels there
might be (as in "monophonic" versus "stereophonic" recordings).

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support mono
mode. In order to verify that a call to

setMono

was successful,
use

getMono

.

**Parameters:** on

-

true

to turn mono mode on,

false

to turn it
off (which means turning poly mode on)
**See Also:** getMono()

Obtains the current mono/poly mode. Synthesizers that do not allow
changing mono/poly mode will always return the same value, regardless of
calls to

setMono

.

**Returns:** true

if mono mode is on, otherwise

false

(meaning
poly mode is on)

setOmni

```java
void setOmni​(boolean on)
```

Turns omni mode on or off. In omni mode, the channel responds to messages
sent on all channels. When omni is off, the channel responds only to
messages sent on its channel number. The default is omni off.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support omni
mode. In order to verify that

setMute

```java
void setMute​(boolean mute)
```

Sets the mute state for this channel. A value of

true

means the
channel is to be muted,

false

means the channel can sound (if
other channels are not soloed).

Unlike

allSoundOff()

, this method applies to only a specific
channel, not to all channels. Further, it silences not only currently
sounding notes, but also subsequently received notes.

It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support muting
channels. In order to verify that a call to

setMute

was
