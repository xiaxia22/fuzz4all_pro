# Interface Sequencer

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\sound\midi\Sequencer.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Sequencer

extends
MidiDevice
```

A hardware or software device that plays back a MIDI

sequence

is known as a

sequencer

. A MIDI sequence
contains lists of time-stamped MIDI data, such as might be read from a
standard MIDI file. Most sequencers also provide functions for creating and
editing sequences.

The

Sequencer

interface includes methods for the following basic MIDI
sequencer operations:

- obtaining a sequence from MIDI file data

starting and stopping playback

moving to an arbitrary position in the sequence

changing the tempo (speed) of playback

synchronizing playback to an internal clock or to received MIDI
messages

controlling the timing of another device

In addition, the following operations are supported, either directly, or
indirectly through objects that the

Sequencer

has access to:

- editing the data by adding or deleting individual MIDI events or entire
tracks

muting or soloing individual tracks in the sequence

notifying listener objects about any meta-events or control-change
events encountered while playing back the sequence

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### void setSequence​(
Sequence
sequence)
throws
InvalidMidiDataException

Sets the current sequence on which the sequencer operates.

This method can be called even if the

Sequencer

is closed.

**Parameters:**
- sequence

- the sequence to be loaded

**Throws:**
- InvalidMidiDataException

- if the sequence contains invalid MIDI
data, or is not supported

---

#### void setSequence​(
InputStream
stream)
throws
IOException
,

InvalidMidiDataException

Sets the current sequence on which the sequencer operates. The stream
must point to MIDI file data.

This method can be called even if the

Sequencer

is closed.

**Parameters:**
- stream

- stream containing MIDI file data

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs during reading of the
stream
- InvalidMidiDataException

- if invalid data is encountered in the
stream, or the stream is not supported

---

#### Sequence
getSequence()

Obtains the sequence on which the Sequencer is currently operating.

This method can be called even if the

Sequencer

is closed.

**Returns:**
- the current sequence, or

null

if no sequence is currently
set

---

#### void start()

Starts playback of the MIDI data in the currently loaded sequence.
Playback will begin from the current position. If the playback position
reaches the loop end point, and the loop count is greater than 0,
playback will resume at the loop start point for the number of
repetitions set with

setLoopCount

. After that, or if the loop
count is 0, playback will continue to play to the end of the sequence.

The implementation ensures that the synthesizer is brought to a
consistent state when jumping to the loop start point by sending
appropriate controllers, pitch bend, and program change events.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the

Sequencer

is closed

**See Also:**
- setLoopStartPoint(long)

,

setLoopEndPoint(long)

,

setLoopCount(int)

,

stop()

---

#### void stop()

Stops recording, if active, and playback of the currently loaded
sequence, if any.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the

Sequencer

is closed

**See Also:**
- start()

,

isRunning()

---

#### boolean isRunning()

Indicates whether the Sequencer is currently running. The default is

false

. The Sequencer starts running when either

start()

or

startRecording()

is called.

isRunning

then returns

true

until playback of the sequence completes or

stop()

is
called.

**Returns:**
- true

if the Sequencer is running, otherwise

false

---

#### void startRecording()

Starts recording and playback of MIDI data. Data is recorded to all
enabled tracks, on the channel(s) for which they were enabled. Recording
begins at the current position of the sequencer. Any events already in
the track are overwritten for the duration of the recording session.
Events from the currently loaded sequence, if any, are delivered to the
sequencer's transmitter(s) along with messages received during recording.

Note that tracks are not by default enabled for recording. In order to
record MIDI data, at least one track must be specifically enabled for
recording.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the

Sequencer

is closed

**See Also:**
- recordEnable(javax.sound.midi.Track, int)

,

recordDisable(javax.sound.midi.Track)

---

#### void stopRecording()

Stops recording, if active. Playback of the current sequence continues.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- if the

Sequencer

is closed

**See Also:**
- startRecording()

,

isRecording()

---

#### boolean isRecording()

Indicates whether the Sequencer is currently recording. The default is

false

. The Sequencer begins recording when

startRecording()

is called, and then returns

true

until

stop()

or

stopRecording()

is called.

**Returns:**
- true

if the Sequencer is recording, otherwise

false

---

#### void recordEnable​(
Track
track,
int channel)

Prepares the specified track for recording events received on a
particular channel. Once enabled, a track will receive events when
recording is active.

**Parameters:**
- track

- the track to which events will be recorded
- channel

- the channel on which events will be received. If -1 is
specified for the channel value, the track will receive data from
all channels.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- thrown if the track is not part of the
current sequence

---

#### void recordDisable​(
Track
track)

Disables recording to the specified track. Events will no longer be
recorded into this track.

**Parameters:**
- track

- the track to disable for recording, or

null

to
disable recording for all tracks

#### float getTempoInBPM()

Obtains the current tempo, expressed in beats per minute. The actual
tempo of playback is the product of the returned value and the tempo
factor.

**Returns:**
- the current tempo in beats per minute

**See Also:**
- getTempoFactor()

,

setTempoInBPM(float)

,

getTempoInMPQ()

---

#### void setTempoInBPM​(float bpm)

,

setTempoInBPM(float)

,

getTempoInMPQ()

---

#### void setTempoFactor​(float factor)

Scales the sequencer's actual playback tempo by the factor provided. The
default is 1.0. A value of 1.0 represents the natural rate (the tempo
specified in the sequence), 2.0 means twice as fast, etc. The tempo
factor does not affect the values returned by

getTempoInMPQ()

and

getTempoInBPM()

. Those values indicate the tempo prior to scaling.

Note that the tempo factor cannot be adjusted when external
synchronization is used. In that situation,

setTempoFactor

always
sets the tempo factor to 1.0.

#### void setTrackMute​(int track,
boolean mute)

Sets the mute state for a track. This method may fail for a number of
reasons. For example, the track number specified may not be valid for the
current sequence, or the sequencer may not support this functionality. An
application which needs to verify whether this operation succeeded should
follow this call with a call to

implies the
track should be muted,

false

implies the track should be
unmuted.

**See Also:**
- getSequence()

---

#### boolean getTrackMute​(int track)

Obtains the current mute state for a track. The default mute state for
all tracks which have not been muted is false. In any case where the
specified track has not been muted, this method should return false. This
applies if the sequencer does not support muting of tracks, and if the
specified track index is not valid.

**Parameters:**
- track

- the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.

**Returns:**
- true

if muted,

false

if not

---

#### void setTrackSolo​(int track,
boolean solo)

Sets the solo state for a track. If

solo

is

true

only
this track and other solo'd tracks will sound. If

solo

is

false

then only other solo'd tracks will sound, unless no tracks
are solo'd in which case all un-muted tracks will sound.

This method may fail for a number of reasons. For example, the track
number specified may not be valid for the current sequence, or the
sequencer may not support this functionality. An application which needs
to verify whether this operation succeeded should follow this call with a
call to

getTrackSolo(int)

.

**Parameters:**
- track

- the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.
- solo

- the new solo state for the track.

true

implies the
track should be solo'd,

false

implies the track should
not be solo'd.

**See Also:**
- getSequence()

---

#### boolean getTrackSolo​(int track)

Obtains the current solo state for a track. The default mute state for
all tracks which have not been solo'd is false. In any case where the
specified track has not been solo'd, this method should return false.
This applies if the sequencer does not support soloing of tracks, and if
the specified track index is not valid.

**Parameters:**
- track

- the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.

**Returns:**
- true

if solo'd,

false

if not

---

#### boolean addMetaEventListener​(
MetaEventListener
listener)

Registers a meta-event listener to receive notification whenever a
meta-event is encountered in the sequence and processed by the sequencer.
This method can fail if, for instance,this class of sequencer does not
support meta-event notification.

**Parameters:**

registered listeners, if in fact the listener is registered.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- the meta-event listener to remove

**See Also:**
- addMetaEventListener(javax.sound.midi.MetaEventListener)

---

#### int[] addControllerEventListener​(
ControllerEventListener
listener,
int[] controllers)

Registers a controller event listener to receive notification whenever
the sequencer processes a control-change event of the requested type or
types. The types are specified by the

controllers

argument, which
should contain an array of MIDI controller numbers. (Each number should
be between 0 and 127, inclusive. See the MIDI 1.0 Specification for the
numbers that correspond to various types of controllers.)

The returned array contains the MIDI controller numbers for which the
listener will now receive events. Some sequencers might not support
controller event notification, in which case the array has a length of 0.
Other sequencers might support notification for some controllers but not
all. This method may be invoked repeatedly. Each time, the returned array
indicates all the controllers that the listener will be notified about,
not only the controllers requested in that particular invocation.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- the controller event listener to add to the list of
registered listeners
- controllers

- the MIDI controller numbers for which change
notification is requested

**Returns:**
- the numbers of all the MIDI controllers whose changes will now be
reported to the specified listener

**See Also:**
- removeControllerEventListener(javax.sound.midi.ControllerEventListener, int[])

,

ControllerEventListener

---

#### int[] removeControllerEventListener​(
ControllerEventListener
listener,
int[] controllers)

Removes a controller event listener's interest in one or more types of
controller event. The

controllers

argument is an array of MIDI
numbers corresponding to the controllers for which the listener should no
longer receive change notifications. To completely remove this listener
from the list of registered listeners, pass in

null

for

controllers

. The returned array contains the MIDI controller
numbers for which the listener will now receive events. The array has a
length of 0 if the listener will not receive change notifications for any
controllers.

**Parameters:**
- listener

- old listener
- controllers

- the MIDI controller numbers for which change
notification should be cancelled, or

null

to cancel for
all controllers

**Returns:**
- the numbers of all the MIDI controllers whose changes will now be
reported to the specified listener

**See Also:**
- addControllerEventListener(javax.sound.midi.ControllerEventListener, int[])

---

#### void setLoopStartPoint​(long tick)

Sets the first MIDI tick that will be played in the loop. If the loop
count is greater than 0, playback will jump to this point when reaching
the loop end point.

A value of 0 for the starting point means the beginning of the loaded
sequence. The starting point must be lower than or equal to the ending
point, and it must fall within the size of the loaded sequence.

A sequencer's loop start point defaults to start of the sequence.

**Parameters:**
- tick

- the loop's starting position, in MIDI ticks (zero-based)

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the requested loop start point cannot
be set, usually because it falls outside the sequence's duration
or because the start point is after the end point

**See Also:**
- setLoopEndPoint(long)

,

setLoopCount(int)

,

getLoopStartPoint()

,

start()

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### long getLoopStartPoint()

Obtains the start position of the loop, in MIDI ticks.

**Returns:**
- the start position of the loop, in MIDI ticks (zero-based)

**See Also:**
- setLoopStartPoint(long)

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### void setLoopEndPoint​(long tick)

Sets the last MIDI tick that will be played in the loop. If the loop
count is 0, the loop end point has no effect and playback continues to
play when reaching the loop end point.

A value of -1 for the ending point indicates the last tick of the
sequence. Otherwise, the ending point must be greater than or equal to
the starting point, and it must fall within the size of the loaded
sequence.

A sequencer's loop end point defaults to -1, meaning the end of the
sequence.

**Parameters:**
- tick

- the loop's ending position, in MIDI ticks (zero-based), or
-1 to indicate the final tick

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the requested loop point cannot be
set, usually because it falls outside the sequence's duration or
because the ending point is before the starting point

**See Also:**
- setLoopStartPoint(long)

,

setLoopCount(int)

,

getLoopEndPoint()

,

start()

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### long getLoopEndPoint()

Obtains the end position of the loop, in MIDI ticks.

**Returns:**
- the end position of the loop, in MIDI ticks (zero-based), or -1
to indicate the end of the sequence

**See Also:**
- setLoopEndPoint(long)

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### void setLoopCount​(int count)

Sets the number of repetitions of the loop for playback. When the
playback position reaches the loop end point, it will loop back to the
loop start point

count

times, after which playback will continue
to play to the end of the sequence.

If the current position when this method is invoked is greater than the
loop end point, playback continues to the end of the sequence without
looping, unless the loop end point is changed subsequently.

A

count

value of 0 disables looping: playback will continue at
the loop end point, and it will not loop back to the loop start point.
This is a sequencer's default.

If playback is stopped during looping, the current loop status is
cleared; subsequent start requests are not affected by an interrupted
loop operation.

**Parameters:**
- count

- the number of times playback should loop back from the
loop's end position to the loop's start position, or

LOOP_CONTINUOUSLY

to indicate that looping should
continue until interrupted

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

count

is negative and not
equal to

LOOP_CONTINUOUSLY

**See Also:**
- setLoopStartPoint(long)

,

setLoopEndPoint(long)

,

getLoopCount()

,

start()

**Since:**
- 1.5

---

#### int getLoopCount()

Obtains the number of repetitions for playback.

**Returns:**
- the number of loops after which playback plays to the end of the
sequence

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- setSequence

```java
void setSequence​(
Sequence
sequence)
throws
InvalidMidiDataException
```

Sets the current sequence on which the sequencer operates.

This method can be called even if the

Sequencer

is closed.

**Parameters:** sequence

- the sequence to be loaded
**Throws:** InvalidMidiDataException

- if the sequence contains invalid MIDI
data, or is not supported

- setSequence

```java
void setSequence​(
InputStream
stream)
throws
IOException
,

InvalidMidiDataException
```

Sets the current sequence on which the sequencer operates. The stream
must point to MIDI file data.

This method can be called even if the

Sequencer

is closed.

**Parameters:** stream

- stream containing MIDI file data
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O exception occurs during reading of the
stream
**Throws:** InvalidMidiDataException

- if invalid data is encountered in the
stream, or the stream is not supported

- getSequence

```java
Sequence
getSequence()
```

Obtains the sequence on which the Sequencer is currently operating.

This method can be called even if the

Sequencer

is closed.

**Returns:** the current sequence, or

null

if no sequence is currently
set

- start

```java
void start()
```

Starts playback of the MIDI data in the currently loaded sequence.
Playback will begin from the current position. If the playback position
reaches the loop end point, and the loop count is greater than 0,
playback will resume at the loop start point for the number of
repetitions set with

setLoopCount

. After that, or if the loop
count is 0, playback will continue to play to the end of the sequence.

The implementation ensures that the synthesizer is brought to a
consistent state when jumping to the loop start point by sending
appropriate controllers, pitch bend, and program change events.

**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the

Sequencer

is closed
**See Also:** setLoopStartPoint(long)

,

setLoopEndPoint(long)

,

setLoopCount(int)

,

stop()

- stop

```java
void stop()
```

Stops recording, if active, and playback of the currently loaded
sequence, if any.

**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the

Sequencer

is closed
**See Also:** start()

,

isRunning()

- isRunning

```java
boolean isRunning()
```

Indicates whether the Sequencer is currently running. The default is

false

. The Sequencer starts running when either

start()

or

startRecording()

is called.

isRunning

then returns

true

until playback of the sequence completes or

stop()

is
called.

**Returns:** true

if the Sequencer is running, otherwise

false

- startRecording

```java
void startRecording()
```

Starts recording and playback of MIDI data. Data is recorded to all
enabled tracks, on the channel(s) for which they were enabled. Recording
begins at the current position of the sequencer. Any events already in
the track are overwritten for the duration of the recording session.
Events from the currently loaded sequence, if any, are delivered to the
sequencer's transmitter(s) along with messages received during recording.

Note that tracks are not by default enabled for recording. In order to
record MIDI data, at least one track must be specifically enabled for
recording.

**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the

Sequencer

is closed
**See Also:** recordEnable(javax.sound.midi.Track, int)

,

recordDisable(javax.sound.midi.Track)

- stopRecording

```java
void stopRecording()
```

Stops recording, if active. Playback of the current sequence continues.

**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the

Sequencer

is closed
**See Also:** startRecording()

,

isRecording()

- isRecording

```java
boolean isRecording()
```

Indicates whether the Sequencer is currently recording. The default is

false

. The Sequencer begins recording when

startRecording()

is called, and then returns

true

until

stop()

particular channel. Once enabled, a track will receive events when
recording is active.

**Parameters:** track

- the track to which events will be recorded
**Parameters:** channel

- the channel on which events will be received. If -1 is
specified for the channel value, the track will receive data from
all channels.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- thrown if the track is not part of the
current sequence

- recordDisable

```java
void recordDisable​(
Track
track)
```

Disables recording to the specified track. Events will no longer be
recorded into this track.

**Parameters:** track

- the track to disable for recording, or

null

to
disable recording for all tracks

- getTempoInBPM

```java
float getTempoInBPM()
```

**See Also:** getTempoFactor()

,

setTempoInBPM(float)

,

getTempoInMPQ()

- setTempoFactor

```java
void setTempoFactor​(float factor)
```

Scales the sequencer's actual playback tempo by the factor provided. The
default is 1.0. A value of 1.0 represents the natural rate (the tempo
specified in the sequence), 2.0 means twice as fast, etc. The tempo
factor does not affect the values returned by

getTempoInMPQ()

and

getTempoInBPM()

. Those values indicate the tempo prior to scaling.

Note that the tempo factor cannot be adjusted when external
synchronization is used. In that situation,

setTempoFactor

always

boolean mute)
```

Sets the mute state for a track. This method may fail for a number of
reasons. For example, the track number specified may not be valid for the
current sequence, or the sequencer may not support this functionality. An
application which needs to verify whether this operation succeeded should
follow this call with a call to

getTrackMute(int)

.

**Parameters:** track

- the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.
**Parameters:** mute

- the new mute state for the track.

true

implies the
track should be muted,

false

implies the track should be
unmuted.
**See Also:** getSequence()

- getTrackMute

```java
boolean getTrackMute​(int track)
```

Obtains the current mute state for a track. The default mute state for
all tracks which have not been muted is false. In any case where the
specified track has not been muted, this method should return false. This
applies if the sequencer does not support muting of tracks, and if the
specified track index is not valid.

**Parameters:** track

- the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.
**Returns:** true

if muted,

false

if not

only
this track and other solo'd tracks will sound. If

solo

is

false

then only other solo'd tracks will sound, unless no tracks
are solo'd in which case all un-muted tracks will sound.

This method may fail for a number of reasons. For example, the track
number specified may not be valid for the current sequence, or the
sequencer may not support this functionality. An application which needs
to verify whether this operation succeeded should follow this call with a
call to

getTrackSolo(int)

.

**Parameters:** track

- the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.
**Parameters:** solo

- the new solo state for the track.

true

implies the
track should be solo'd,

false

implies the track should
not be solo'd.
**See Also:** getSequence()

- getTrackSolo

```java
boolean getTrackSolo​(int track)
```

Obtains the current solo state for a track. The default mute state for
all tracks which have not been solo'd is false. In any case where the
specified track has not been solo'd, this method should return false.
This applies if the sequencer does not support soloing of tracks, and if
the specified track index is not valid.

**Parameters:** track

- the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.
**Returns:** true

if solo'd,

false

if not

- addMetaEventListener

```java
boolean addMetaEventListener​(
MetaEventListener
listener)
```

Registers a meta-event listener to receive notification whenever a
meta-event is encountered in the sequence and processed by the sequencer.
This method can fail if, for instance,this class of sequencer does not
support meta-event notification.

**Parameters:** listener

listener)
```

Removes the specified meta-event listener from this sequencer's list of
registered listeners, if in fact the listener is registered.

**Parameters:** listener

- the meta-event listener to remove
**See Also:** addMetaEventListener(javax.sound.midi.MetaEventListener)

- addControllerEventListener

```java
int[] addControllerEventListener​(
ControllerEventListener
listener,
int[] controllers)
```

Registers a controller event listener to receive notification whenever
the sequencer processes a control-change event of the requested type or
types. The types are specified by the

controllers

argument, which
should contain an array of MIDI controller numbers. (Each number should
be between 0 and 127, inclusive. See the MIDI 1.0 Specification for the
numbers that correspond to various types of controllers.)

The returned array contains the MIDI controller numbers for which the
listener will now receive events. Some sequencers might not support
controller event notification, in which case the array has a length of 0.
Other sequencers might support notification for some controllers but not
all. This method may be invoked repeatedly. Each time, the returned array
indicates all the controllers that the listener will be notified about,
not only the controllers requested in that particular invocation.

**Parameters:** listener

- the controller event listener to add to the list of
registered listeners
**Parameters:** controllers

- the MIDI controller numbers for which change
notification is requested
**Returns:** the numbers of all the MIDI controllers whose changes will now be
reported to the specified listener
**See Also:** removeControllerEventListener(javax.sound.midi.ControllerEventListener, int[])

,

ControllerEventListener

- removeControllerEventListener

```java
int[] removeControllerEventListener​(
ControllerEventListener
listener,
int[] controllers)
```

Removes a controller event listener's interest in one or more types of
controller event. The

controllers

argument is an array of MIDI
numbers corresponding to the controllers for which the listener should no
longer receive change notifications. To completely remove this listener
from the list of registered listeners, pass in

null

for

controllers

. The returned array contains the MIDI controller
numbers for which the listener will now receive events. The array has a
length of 0 if the listener will not receive change notifications for any
controllers.

**Parameters:** listener

- old listener
**Parameters:** controllers

- the MIDI controller numbers for which change
notification should be cancelled, or

null

to cancel for
all controllers
**Returns:** the numbers of all the MIDI controllers whose changes will now be
reported to the specified listener
**See Also:** addControllerEventListener(javax.sound.midi.ControllerEventListener, int[])

- setLoopStartPoint

```java
void setLoopStartPoint​(long tick)
```

Sets the first MIDI tick that will be played in the loop. If the loop
count is greater than 0, playback will jump to this point when reaching
the loop end point.

A value of 0 for the starting point means the beginning of the loaded
sequence. The starting point must be lower than or equal to the ending
point, and it must fall within the size of the loaded sequence.

A sequencer's loop start point defaults to start of the sequence.

**Parameters:** tick

- the loop's starting position, in MIDI ticks (zero-based)
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the requested loop start point cannot
be set, usually because it falls outside the sequence's duration
or because the start point is after the end point

Sets the last MIDI tick that will be played in the loop. If the loop
count is 0, the loop end point has no effect and playback continues to
play when reaching the loop end point.

A value of -1 for the ending point indicates the last tick of the
sequence. Otherwise, the ending point must be greater than or equal to
the starting point, and it must fall within the size of the loaded
sequence.

A sequencer's loop end point defaults to -1, meaning the end of the
sequence.

**Parameters:** tick

- the loop's ending position, in MIDI ticks (zero-based), or
-1 to indicate the final tick
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the requested loop point cannot be
set, usually because it falls outside the sequence's duration or
because the ending point is before the starting point

Obtains the end position of the loop, in MIDI ticks.

**Returns:** the end position of the loop, in MIDI ticks (zero-based), or -1
to indicate the end of the sequence
**Since:** 1.5
**See Also:** setLoopEndPoint(long)

- setLoopCount

```java
void setLoopCount​(int count)
```

Sets the number of repetitions of the loop for playback. When the
playback position reaches the loop end point, it will loop back to the
loop start point

count

times, after which playback will continue
to play to the end of the sequence.

If the current position when this method is invoked is greater than the
loop end point, playback continues to the end of the sequence without
looping, unless the loop end point is changed subsequently.

A

count

value of 0 disables looping: playback will continue at
the loop end point, and it will not loop back to the loop start point.
This is a sequencer's default.

If playback is stopped during looping, the current loop status is
cleared; subsequent start requests are not affected by an interrupted
loop operation.

Sequencer

is closed.

**Returns:** the current sequence, or

null

if no sequence is currently
set

- start

```java
void start()
```

Starts playback of the MIDI data in the currently loaded sequence.
Playback will begin from the current position. If the playback position
reaches the loop end point, and the loop count is greater than 0,
playback will resume at the loop start point for the number of
repetitions set with

setLoopCount

. After that, or if the loop
count is 0, playback will continue to play to the end of the sequence.

The implementation ensures that the synthesizer is brought to a
consistent state when jumping to the loop start point by sending
appropriate controllers, pitch bend, and program change events.

- setTrackMute

```java
void setTrackMute​(int track,
boolean mute)
```

Sets the mute state for a track. This method may fail for a number of
reasons. For example, the track number specified may not be valid for the
current sequence, or the sequencer may not support this functionality. An
application which needs to verify whether this operation succeeded should
follow this call with a call to

then only other solo'd tracks will sound, unless no tracks
are solo'd in which case all un-muted tracks will sound.

This method may fail for a number of reasons. For example, the track
number specified may not be valid for the current sequence, or the
sequencer may not support this functionality. An application which needs
to verify whether this operation succeeded should follow this call with a
call to

getTrackSolo(int)

.

```

Registers a controller event listener to receive notification whenever
the sequencer processes a control-change event of the requested type or
types. The types are specified by the

controllers

argument, which
should contain an array of MIDI controller numbers. (Each number should
be between 0 and 127, inclusive. See the MIDI 1.0 Specification for the
numbers that correspond to various types of controllers.)

The returned array contains the MIDI controller numbers for which the
listener will now receive events. Some sequencers might not support
controller event notification, in which case the array has a length of 0.
Other sequencers might support notification for some controllers but not
all. This method may be invoked repeatedly. Each time, the returned array
indicates all the controllers that the listener will be notified about,
not only the controllers requested in that particular invocation.

**Parameters:** listener

- the controller event listener to add to the list of
registered listeners
**Parameters:** controllers

- the MIDI controller numbers for which change
notification is requested
**Returns:** the numbers of all the MIDI controllers whose changes will now be
reported to the specified listener

ControllerEventListener

- removeControllerEventListener

```java
int[] removeControllerEventListener​(
ControllerEventListener
listener,
int[] controllers)
```

Removes a controller event listener's interest in one or more types of
controller event. The

controllers

argument is an array of MIDI
numbers corresponding to the controllers for which the listener should no
longer receive change notifications. To completely remove this listener
from the list of registered listeners, pass in

null

for

controllers

. The returned array contains the MIDI controller
numbers for which the listener will now receive events. The array has a
length of 0 if the listener will not receive change notifications for any
controllers.

**Parameters:** listener

- old listener

- setLoopStartPoint

```java
void setLoopStartPoint​(long tick)
```

Sets the first MIDI tick that will be played in the loop. If the loop
count is greater than 0, playback will jump to this point when reaching
the loop end point.

A value of 0 for the starting point means the beginning of the loaded
sequence. The starting point must be lower than or equal to the ending
point, and it must fall within the size of the loaded sequence.

A sequencer's loop start point defaults to start of the sequence.

**Parameters:** tick

- the loop's starting position, in MIDI ticks (zero-based)
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the requested loop start point cannot

void setLoopEndPoint​(long tick)
```

Sets the last MIDI tick that will be played in the loop. If the loop
count is 0, the loop end point has no effect and playback continues to
play when reaching the loop end point.

A value of -1 for the ending point indicates the last tick of the
sequence. Otherwise, the ending point must be greater than or equal to
the starting point, and it must fall within the size of the loaded
sequence.

A sequencer's loop end point defaults to -1, meaning the end of the
sequence.

**Parameters:** tick

- the loop's ending position, in MIDI ticks (zero-based), or
-1 to indicate the final tick
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the requested loop point cannot be
set, usually because it falls outside the sequence's duration or

void setLoopCount​(int count)

Sets the number of repetitions of the loop for playback. When the
playback position reaches the loop end point, it will loop back to the
loop start point

count

times, after which playback will continue
to play to the end of the sequence.

If the current position when this method is invoked is greater than the
loop end point, playback continues to the end of the sequence without
looping, unless the loop end point is changed subsequently.

A

count

value of 0 disables looping: playback will continue at
the loop end point, and it will not loop back to the loop start point.
This is a sequencer's default.

If playback is stopped during looping, the current loop status is
cleared; subsequent start requests are not affected by an interrupted
loop operation.
