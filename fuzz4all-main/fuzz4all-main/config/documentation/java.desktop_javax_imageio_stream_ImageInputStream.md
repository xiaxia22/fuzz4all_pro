### Method Details

#### void setByteOrder​(
ByteOrder
byteOrder)

Sets the desired byte order for future reads of data values
from this stream. For example, the sequence of bytes '0x01
0x02 0x03 0x04' if read as a 4-byte integer would have the
value '0x01020304' using network byte order and the value
'0x04030201' under the reverse byte order.

The enumeration class

java.nio.ByteOrder

is
used to specify the byte order. A value of

ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN

specifies so-called
big-endian or network byte order, in which the high-order byte
comes first. Motorola and Sparc processors store data in this
format, while Intel processors store data in the reverse

ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN

order.

The byte order has no effect on the results returned from
the

readBits

method (or the value written by

ImageOutputStream.writeBits

).

**Parameters:**
- byteOrder

- one of

ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN

or

java.nio.ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN

, indicating whether
network byte order or its reverse will be used for future
reads.

**See Also:**

#### String
readLine()
throws
IOException

Reads the next line of text from the input stream. It reads
successive bytes, converting each byte separately into a
character, until it encounters a line terminator or end of
file; the characters read are then returned as a

String

. Note that because this method processes
bytes, it does not support input of the full Unicode character
set.

If end of file is encountered before even one byte can be
read, then

null

is returned. Otherwise, each byte
that is read is converted to type

char

by
zero-extension. If the character

'\n'

is
encountered, it is discarded and reading ceases. If the
character

'\r'

is encountered, it is discarded
and, if the following byte converts to the character

'\n'

, then that is discarded also; reading then
ceases. If end of file is encountered before either of the
characters

'\n'

and

'\r'

is
encountered, reading ceases. Once reading has ceased, a

String

is returned that contains all the
characters read and not discarded, taken in order. Note that
every character in this string will have a value less than

\u0100

, that is,

(char)256

.

The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
the read occurs.

**Specified by:**
- readLine

in interface

DataInput

**Returns:**
- a String containing a line of text from the stream.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### String
readUTF()
throws
IOException

Reads in a string that has been encoded using a

modified
UTF-8

format. The general contract of

readUTF

is that
it reads a representation of a Unicode character string encoded
in modified UTF-8 format; this string of characters is
then returned as a

String

.

First, two bytes are read and used to construct an unsigned
16-bit integer in the manner of the

readUnsignedShort

method, using network byte order
(regardless of the current byte order setting). This integer
value is called the

UTF length

and specifies the number
of additional bytes to be read. These bytes are then converted
to characters by considering them in groups. The length of each
group is computed from the value of the first byte of the
group. The byte following a group, if any, is the first byte of
the next group.

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

0xxxxxxx

(where

x

means "may be

0

or

1

"), then the group consists of
just that byte. The byte is zero-extended to form a character.

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

110xxxxx

, then the group consists of that byte

a

and a second byte

b

. If there is no
byte

b

(because byte

a

was the last
of the bytes to be read), or if byte

b

does not
match the bit pattern

10xxxxxx

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
group is converted to the character:

```java
(char)(((a& 0x1F) << 6) | (b & 0x3F))
```

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

1110xxxx

, then the group consists of that byte

a

and two more bytes

b

and

c

. If there is no byte

c

(because
byte

a

was one of the last two of the bytes to be
read), or either byte

b

or byte

c

does not match the bit pattern

10xxxxxx

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
group is converted to the character:

```java
(char)(((a & 0x0F) << 12) | ((b & 0x3F) << 6) | (c & 0x3F))
```

If the first byte of a group matches the pattern

1111xxxx

or the pattern

10xxxxxx

,
then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown.

If end of file is encountered at any time during this
entire process, then a

java.io.EOFException

is thrown.

After every group has been converted to a character by this
process, the characters are gathered, in the same order in
which their corresponding groups were read from the input
stream, to form a

String

, which is returned.

The current byte order setting is ignored.

The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
the read occurs.

Note:

This method should not be used in
the implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8,
because the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with
standard UTF-8.

**Specified by:**
- readUTF

in interface

DataInput

**Returns:**
- a String read from the stream.

**Throws:**
- EOFException

- if this stream reaches the end
before reading all the bytes.
- UTFDataFormatException

- if the bytes do not represent
a valid modified UTF-8 encoding of a string.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

inclusive. The bit offset is updated implicitly by calls to
the

readBits

method. A value of 0 indicates the
most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least

method.

**Returns:**
- an

int

containing the bit offset between

The byte offset within the stream, as returned by

getStreamPosition

, is left unchanged.
A value of 0 indicates the
most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least
significant bit, of the byte being read.

**Parameters:**

int

with the value

0

or

1

. The bit offset is advanced by one and reduced
modulo 8.

**Returns:**
- an

int

containing the value

0

or

1

.

**Throws:**

---

#### long readBits​(int numBits)
throws
IOException

Reads a bitstring from the stream and returns it as a

long

, with the first bit read becoming the most
significant bit of the output. The read starts within the byte
indicated by

getStreamPosition

, at the bit given
by

getBitOffset

. The bit offset is advanced by

numBits

and reduced modulo 8.

The byte order of the stream has no effect on this
method. The return value of this method is constructed as
though the bits were read one at a time, and shifted into
the right side of the return value, as shown by the following
pseudo-code:

```java
long accum = 0L;
for (int i = 0; i < numBits; i++) {
accum <<= 1; // Shift left one bit to make room
accum |= readBit();
}
```

Note that the result of

readBits(32)

may thus not
be equal to that of

readInt()

if a reverse network
byte order is being used (i.e.,

getByteOrder() == false

).

If the end of the stream is encountered before all the bits
have been read, a

java.io.EOFException

is thrown.

**Parameters:**
- numBits

- the number of bits to read, as an

int

between 0 and 64, inclusive.

**Returns:**
- the bitstring, as a

long

with the last bit
read stored in the least significant bit.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

numBits

is not between 0 and 64, inclusive.
- EOFException

- if the stream reaches the end before
reading all the bits.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### long length()
throws
IOException

Returns the total length of the stream, if known. Otherwise,

-1

is returned.

**Returns:**
- a

long

containing the length of the
stream, if known, or else

-1

.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### int skipBytes​(int n)
throws
IOException

Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes. It
is possible that this method will only be able to skip forward
by a smaller number of bytes than requested, for example if the
end of the stream is reached. In all cases, the actual number
of bytes skipped is returned. The bit offset is set to zero
prior to advancing the position.

**Specified by:**
- skipBytes

in interface

DataInput

**Parameters:**
- n

- an

int

containing the number of bytes to
be skipped.

**Returns:**
- an

int

representing the number of bytes skipped.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### long skipBytes​(long n)
throws
IOException

Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes.
This method is identical to

skipBytes(int)

except
that it allows for a larger skip distance.

**Parameters:**
- n

- a

long

containing the number of bytes to
be skipped.

**Returns:**
- a

long

representing the number of bytes
skipped.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### void seek​(long pos)
throws
IOException

Sets the current stream position to the desired location. The
next read will occur at this location. The bit offset is set
to 0.

An

IndexOutOfBoundsException

will be thrown if

pos

is smaller than the flushed position (as
returned by

getflushedPosition

).

It is legal to seek past the end of the file;
a

java.io.EOFException

will be thrown only if a read is
performed.

**Parameters:**
- pos

- a

long

containing the desired file
pointer position.

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

pos

is smaller
than the flushed position.
- IOException

- if any other I/O error occurs.

---

#### void mark()

Marks a position in the stream to be returned to by a
subsequent call to

reset

. Unlike a standard

InputStream

, all

ImageInputStream

s
support marking. Additionally, calls to

mark

and

reset

may be nested arbitrarily.

Unlike the

mark

methods declared by the

Reader

and

InputStream

interfaces, no

readLimit

parameter is used. An arbitrary amount
of data may be read following the call to

mark

.

The bit position used by the

readBits

method
is saved and restored by each pair of calls to

mark

and

reset

.

Note that it is valid for an

ImageReader

to call

flushBefore

as part of a read operation.
Therefore, if an application calls

mark

prior to
passing that stream to an

ImageReader

, the application
should not assume that the marked position will remain valid after
the read operation has completed.

---

#### void reset()
throws
IOException

Returns the stream pointer to its previous position, including
the bit offset, at the time of the most recent unmatched call
to

mark

.

Calls to

reset

without a corresponding call
to

mark

have no effect.

An

IOException

will be thrown if the previous
marked position lies in the discarded portion of the stream.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### void flushBefore​(long pos)
throws
IOException

Discards the initial portion of the stream prior to the
indicated position. Attempting to seek to an offset within the
flushed portion of the stream will result in an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

.

Calling

flushBefore

may allow classes
implementing this interface to free up resources such as memory
or disk space that are being used to store data from the
stream.

**Parameters:**
- pos

- a

long

containing the length of the
stream prefix that may be flushed.

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

pos

lies
in the flushed portion of the stream or past the current stream
position.
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### void flush()
throws
IOException

Discards the initial position of the stream prior to the current
stream position. Equivalent to

flushBefore(getStreamPosition())

.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### long getFlushedPosition()

Returns the earliest position in the stream to which seeking
may be performed. The returned value will be the maximum of
all values passed into previous calls to

flushBefore

.

**Returns:**
- the earliest legal position for seeking, as a

long

.

---

#### boolean isCached()

Returns

true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards.
Applications may consult this in order to decide how frequently,
or whether, to flush in order to conserve cache resources.

**Returns:**
- true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data.

**See Also:**
- isCachedMemory()

,

isCachedFile()

---

#### boolean isCachedMemory()

Returns

true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and
the cache is kept in main memory. Applications may consult
this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush
in order to conserve cache resources.

**Returns:**
- true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data in main memory.

**See Also:**
- isCached()

,

isCachedFile()

---

#### boolean isCachedFile()

Returns

true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and
the cache is kept in a temporary file. Applications may consult
this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush
in order to conserve cache resources.

**Returns:**
- true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data in a temporary file.

**See Also:**
- isCached()

,

isCachedMemory()

---

#### void close()
throws
IOException

Closes the stream. Attempts to access a stream that has been
closed may result in

IOException

s or incorrect
behavior. Calling this method may allow classes implementing
this interface to release resources associated with the stream
such as memory, disk space, or file descriptors.

**Specified by:**
- close

in interface

AutoCloseable
- close

in interface

Closeable

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

value '0x01020304' using network byte order and the value
'0x04030201' under the reverse byte order.

The enumeration class

java.nio.ByteOrder

is
used to specify the byte order. A value of

ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN

specifies so-called
big-endian or network byte order, in which the high-order byte
comes first. Motorola and Sparc processors store data in this
format, while Intel processors store data in the reverse

ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN

order.

The byte order has no effect on the results returned from
the

readBits

method (or the value written by

ImageOutputStream.writeBits

).

**Parameters:** byteOrder

- one of

ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN

or

java.nio.ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN

, indicating whether
network byte order or its reverse will be used for future
reads.
**See Also:** ByteOrder

- readLine

```java
String
readLine()
throws
IOException
```

Reads the next line of text from the input stream. It reads
successive bytes, converting each byte separately into a
character, until it encounters a line terminator or end of
file; the characters read are then returned as a

String

. Note that because this method processes
bytes, it does not support input of the full Unicode character
set.

If end of file is encountered before even one byte can be
read, then

null

is returned. Otherwise, each byte
that is read is converted to type

char

by
zero-extension. If the character

'\n'

is
encountered, it is discarded and reading ceases. If the
character

'\r'

is encountered, it is discarded
and, if the following byte converts to the character

'\n'

, then that is discarded also; reading then
ceases. If end of file is encountered before either of the
characters

'\n'

and

'\r'

is
encountered, reading ceases. Once reading has ceased, a

String

is returned that contains all the
characters read and not discarded, taken in order. Note that
every character in this string will have a value less than

\u0100

, that is,

(char)256

.

The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
the read occurs.

**Specified by:** readLine

in interface

DataInput
**Returns:** a String containing a line of text from the stream.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- readUTF

```java
String
readUTF()
throws
IOException
```

Reads in a string that has been encoded using a

modified
UTF-8

format. The general contract of

readUTF

is that
it reads a representation of a Unicode character string encoded
in modified UTF-8 format; this string of characters is
then returned as a

String

.

First, two bytes are read and used to construct an unsigned
16-bit integer in the manner of the

readUnsignedShort

method, using network byte order
(regardless of the current byte order setting). This integer
value is called the

UTF length

and specifies the number
of additional bytes to be read. These bytes are then converted
to characters by considering them in groups. The length of each
group is computed from the value of the first byte of the
group. The byte following a group, if any, is the first byte of
the next group.

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

0xxxxxxx

(where

x

means "may be

0

or

1

"), then the group consists of
just that byte. The byte is zero-extended to form a character.

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

110xxxxx

, then the group consists of that byte

a

and a second byte

b

. If there is no
byte

b

(because byte

a

was the last
of the bytes to be read), or if byte

b

does not
match the bit pattern

10xxxxxx

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
group is converted to the character:

```java
(char)(((a& 0x1F) << 6) | (b & 0x3F))
```

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

1110xxxx

, then the group consists of that byte

a

and two more bytes

b

and

c

. If there is no byte

c

(because
byte

a

was one of the last two of the bytes to be
read), or either byte

b

or byte

c

does not match the bit pattern

10xxxxxx

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
group is converted to the character:

```java
(char)(((a & 0x0F) << 12) | ((b & 0x3F) << 6) | (c & 0x3F))
```

If the first byte of a group matches the pattern

1111xxxx

or the pattern

10xxxxxx

,
then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown.

If end of file is encountered at any time during this
entire process, then a

java.io.EOFException

is thrown.

After every group has been converted to a character by this
process, the characters are gathered, in the same order in
which their corresponding groups were read from the input
stream, to form a

String

, which is returned.

The current byte order setting is ignored.

The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
the read occurs.

Note:

This method should not be used in
the implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8,
because the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with
standard UTF-8.

Reads a bitstring from the stream and returns it as a

long

, with the first bit read becoming the most
significant bit of the output. The read starts within the byte
indicated by

getStreamPosition

, at the bit given
by

getBitOffset

. The bit offset is advanced by

numBits

and reduced modulo 8.

The byte order of the stream has no effect on this
method. The return value of this method is constructed as
though the bits were read one at a time, and shifted into
the right side of the return value, as shown by the following
pseudo-code:

```java
long accum = 0L;
for (int i = 0; i < numBits; i++) {
accum <<= 1; // Shift left one bit to make room
accum |= readBit();
}
```

Note that the result of

readBits(32)

may thus not
be equal to that of

readInt()

if a reverse network
byte order is being used (i.e.,

getByteOrder() == false

).

If the end of the stream is encountered before all the bits
have been read, a

java.io.EOFException

is thrown.

**Parameters:** numBits

reading all the bits.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- length

```java
long length()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the total length of the stream, if known. Otherwise,

-1

is returned.

**Returns:** a

long

containing the length of the
stream, if known, or else

-1

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- skipBytes

```java
int skipBytes​(int n)
throws
IOException
```

Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes. It
is possible that this method will only be able to skip forward
by a smaller number of bytes than requested, for example if the
end of the stream is reached. In all cases, the actual number
of bytes skipped is returned. The bit offset is set to zero
prior to advancing the position.

**Specified by:** skipBytes

in interface

DataInput
**Parameters:** n

- an

int

containing the number of bytes to
be skipped.
**Returns:** an

int

representing the number of bytes skipped.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- skipBytes

```java
long skipBytes​(long n)
throws
IOException
```

Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes.
This method is identical to

skipBytes(int)

except
that it allows for a larger skip distance.

**Parameters:** n

- a

long

containing the number of bytes to
be skipped.
**Returns:** a

long

representing the number of bytes
skipped.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- seek

```java
void seek​(long pos)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the current stream position to the desired location. The
next read will occur at this location. The bit offset is set
to 0.

An

IndexOutOfBoundsException

will be thrown if

pos

is smaller than the flushed position (as
returned by

getflushedPosition

).

It is legal to seek past the end of the file;
a

java.io.EOFException

will be thrown only if a read is
performed.

**Parameters:** pos

- a

long

containing the desired file
pointer position.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

pos

is smaller
than the flushed position.
**Throws:** IOException

- if any other I/O error occurs.

- mark

```java
void mark()
```

Marks a position in the stream to be returned to by a
subsequent call to

reset

. Unlike a standard

InputStream

, all

ImageInputStream

s
support marking. Additionally, calls to

mark

and

reset

may be nested arbitrarily.

Unlike the

mark

methods declared by the

Reader

and

InputStream

interfaces, no

readLimit

parameter is used. An arbitrary amount
of data may be read following the call to

mark

.

The bit position used by the

readBits

method
is saved and restored by each pair of calls to

mark

and

reset

.

Note that it is valid for an

ImageReader

to call

flushBefore

as part of a read operation.
Therefore, if an application calls

mark

prior to
passing that stream to an

ImageReader

, the application
should not assume that the marked position will remain valid after
the read operation has completed.

- reset

```java
void reset()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the stream pointer to its previous position, including
the bit offset, at the time of the most recent unmatched call
to

mark

.

Calls to

reset

without a corresponding call
to

mark

have no effect.

An

IOException

will be thrown if the previous
marked position lies in the discarded portion of the stream.

**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- flushBefore

```java
void flushBefore​(long pos)
throws
IOException
```

Discards the initial portion of the stream prior to the
indicated position. Attempting to seek to an offset within the
flushed portion of the stream will result in an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

.

Calling

flushBefore

may allow classes
implementing this interface to free up resources such as memory
or disk space that are being used to store data from the
stream.

**Parameters:** pos

- a

long

containing the length of the
stream prefix that may be flushed.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

pos

lies
in the flushed portion of the stream or past the current stream
position.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- flush

```java
void flush()
throws
IOException
```

Discards the initial position of the stream prior to the current
stream position. Equivalent to

flushBefore(getStreamPosition())

.

**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- getFlushedPosition

```java
long getFlushedPosition()
```

Returns the earliest position in the stream to which seeking
may be performed. The returned value will be the maximum of
all values passed into previous calls to

flushBefore

.

**Returns:** the earliest legal position for seeking, as a

long

.

- isCached

```java
boolean isCached()
```

Returns

true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards.
Applications may consult this in order to decide how frequently,
or whether, to flush in order to conserve cache resources.

**Returns:** true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data.
**See Also:** isCachedMemory()

,

isCachedFile()

- isCachedMemory

```java
boolean isCachedMemory()
```

Returns

true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and
the cache is kept in main memory. Applications may consult
this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush
in order to conserve cache resources.

**Returns:** true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data in main memory.
**See Also:** isCached()

,

isCachedFile()

- isCachedFile

```java
boolean isCachedFile()
```

Returns

true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and
the cache is kept in a temporary file. Applications may consult
this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush
in order to conserve cache resources.

**Returns:** true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data in a temporary file.
**See Also:** isCached()

,

isCachedMemory()

- close

```java
void close()
throws
IOException
```

Closes the stream. Attempts to access a stream that has been
closed may result in

IOException

s or incorrect
behavior. Calling this method may allow classes implementing
this interface to release resources associated with the stream
such as memory, disk space, or file descriptors.

**Specified by:** close

in interface

AutoCloseable
**Specified by:** close

in interface

Closeable
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

Method Detail

- setByteOrder

```java
void setByteOrder​(
ByteOrder
byteOrder)
```

Sets the desired byte order for future reads of data values
from this stream. For example, the sequence of bytes '0x01
0x02 0x03 0x04' if read as a 4-byte integer would have the
value '0x01020304' using network byte order and the value
'0x04030201' under the reverse byte order.

The enumeration class

java.nio.ByteOrder

is
used to specify the byte order. A value of

ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN

specifies so-called
big-endian or network byte order, in which the high-order byte
comes first. Motorola and Sparc processors store data in this
format, while Intel processors store data in the reverse

ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN

order.

The byte order has no effect on the results returned from
the

readBits

method (or the value written by

ImageOutputStream.writeBits

).

**Parameters:** byteOrder

- one of

ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN

or

java.nio.ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN

, indicating whether
network byte order or its reverse will be used for future
reads.
**See Also:** ByteOrder

,

getByteOrder()

,

readBits(int)

- getByteOrder

```java
ByteOrder
getByteOrder()
```

Returns the byte order with which data values will be read from
this stream as an instance of the

java.nio.ByteOrder

enumeration.

**Returns:** one of

ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN

- readLine

```java
String
readLine()
throws
IOException
```

Reads the next line of text from the input stream. It reads
successive bytes, converting each byte separately into a
character, until it encounters a line terminator or end of
file; the characters read are then returned as a

String

. Note that because this method processes
bytes, it does not support input of the full Unicode character
set.

If end of file is encountered before even one byte can be
read, then

null

is returned. Otherwise, each byte
that is read is converted to type

char

by
zero-extension. If the character

'\n'

is
encountered, it is discarded and reading ceases. If the
character

'\r'

is encountered, it is discarded
and, if the following byte converts to the character

'\n'

, then that is discarded also; reading then
ceases. If end of file is encountered before either of the
characters

'\n'

and

'\r'

is
encountered, reading ceases. Once reading has ceased, a

String

is returned that contains all the
characters read and not discarded, taken in order. Note that
every character in this string will have a value less than

\u0100

, that is,

(char)256

.

The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
the read occurs.

**Specified by:** readLine

in interface

DataInput
**Returns:** a String containing a line of text from the stream.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- readUTF

```java
String
readUTF()
throws
IOException
```

Reads in a string that has been encoded using a

modified
UTF-8

format. The general contract of

readUTF

is that
it reads a representation of a Unicode character string encoded
in modified UTF-8 format; this string of characters is
then returned as a

String

.

First, two bytes are read and used to construct an unsigned
16-bit integer in the manner of the

readUnsignedShort

method, using network byte order
(regardless of the current byte order setting). This integer
value is called the

UTF length

and specifies the number
of additional bytes to be read. These bytes are then converted
to characters by considering them in groups. The length of each
group is computed from the value of the first byte of the
group. The byte following a group, if any, is the first byte of
the next group.

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

0xxxxxxx

(where

x

means "may be

0

or

1

"), then the group consists of
just that byte. The byte is zero-extended to form a character.

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

110xxxxx

, then the group consists of that byte

a

and a second byte

b

. If there is no
byte

b

(because byte

a

was the last
of the bytes to be read), or if byte

b

does not
match the bit pattern

10xxxxxx

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
group is converted to the character:

```java
(char)(((a& 0x1F) << 6) | (b & 0x3F))
```

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

1110xxxx

, then the group consists of that byte

a

and two more bytes

b

and

c

. If there is no byte

c

(because
byte

a

was one of the last two of the bytes to be
read), or either byte

b

or byte

c

does not match the bit pattern

10xxxxxx

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
group is converted to the character:

```java
(char)(((a & 0x0F) << 12) | ((b & 0x3F) << 6) | (c & 0x3F))
```

If the first byte of a group matches the pattern

1111xxxx

or the pattern

10xxxxxx

,
then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown.

If end of file is encountered at any time during this
entire process, then a

java.io.EOFException

is thrown.

After every group has been converted to a character by this
process, the characters are gathered, in the same order in
which their corresponding groups were read from the input
stream, to form a

String

, which is returned.

The current byte order setting is ignored.

The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
the read occurs.

Note:

This method should not be used in
the implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8,
because the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with
standard UTF-8.

- getStreamPosition

```java
long getStreamPosition()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the current byte position of the stream. The next read
will take place starting at this offset.

**Returns:** a long containing the position of the stream.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- getBitOffset

```java
int getBitOffset()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the current bit offset, as an integer between 0 and 7,
inclusive. The bit offset is updated implicitly by calls to
the

readBits

method. A value of 0 indicates the
most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least
significant bit, of the byte being read.

The bit offset is set to 0 when a stream is first
opened, and is reset to 0 by calls to

seek

,

skipBytes

, or any

read

or

readFully

method.

**Returns:** an

int

containing the bit offset between
0 and 7, inclusive.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
**See Also:** setBitOffset(int)

- setBitOffset

```java
void setBitOffset​(int bitOffset)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the bit offset to an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive.
The byte offset within the stream, as returned by

getStreamPosition

, is left unchanged.
A value of 0 indicates the
most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least
significant bit, of the byte being read.

**Parameters:** bitOffset

- the desired offset, as an

int

between 0 and 7, inclusive.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

bitOffset

is not between 0 and 7, inclusive.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.
**See Also:** getBitOffset()

- readBit

```java
int readBit()
throws
IOException
```

Reads a single bit from the stream and returns it as an

int

with the value

0

or

1

. The bit offset is advanced by one and reduced
modulo 8.

**Returns:** an

int

containing the value

0

or

1

.
**Throws:** EOFException

reading all the bits.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- readBits

```java
long readBits​(int numBits)
throws
IOException
```

Reads a bitstring from the stream and returns it as a

long

, with the first bit read becoming the most
significant bit of the output. The read starts within the byte
indicated by

getStreamPosition

, at the bit given
by

getBitOffset

. The bit offset is advanced by

numBits

and reduced modulo 8.

The byte order of the stream has no effect on this
method. The return value of this method is constructed as
though the bits were read one at a time, and shifted into
the right side of the return value, as shown by the following
pseudo-code:

```java
long accum = 0L;
for (int i = 0; i < numBits; i++) {
accum <<= 1; // Shift left one bit to make room
accum |= readBit();
}
```

Note that the result of

readBits(32)

may thus not
be equal to that of

readInt()

if a reverse network
byte order is being used (i.e.,

getByteOrder() == false

).

If the end of the stream is encountered before all the bits
have been read, a

java.io.EOFException

is thrown.

**Parameters:** numBits

- the number of bits to read, as an

int

between 0 and 64, inclusive.
**Returns:** the bitstring, as a

long

with the last bit
read stored in the least significant bit.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

numBits

is not between 0 and 64, inclusive.
**Throws:** EOFException

- if the stream reaches the end before
reading all the bits.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- length

```java
long length()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the total length of the stream, if known. Otherwise,

-1

is returned.

**Returns:** a

long

containing the length of the
stream, if known, or else

-1

.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- skipBytes

```java
int skipBytes​(int n)
throws
IOException
```

Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes. It
is possible that this method will only be able to skip forward
by a smaller number of bytes than requested, for example if the
end of the stream is reached. In all cases, the actual number
of bytes skipped is returned. The bit offset is set to zero
prior to advancing the position.

**Specified by:** skipBytes

in interface

DataInput
**Parameters:** n

- an

int

containing the number of bytes to
be skipped.
**Returns:** an

int

representing the number of bytes skipped.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- skipBytes

```java
long skipBytes​(long n)
throws
IOException
```

Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes.
This method is identical to

skipBytes(int)

except
that it allows for a larger skip distance.

**Parameters:** n

- a

long

containing the number of bytes to
be skipped.
**Returns:** a

long

representing the number of bytes
skipped.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- seek

```java
void seek​(long pos)
throws
IOException
```

Sets the current stream position to the desired location. The
next read will occur at this location. The bit offset is set
to 0.

An

IndexOutOfBoundsException

will be thrown if

pos

is smaller than the flushed position (as
returned by

getflushedPosition

).

It is legal to seek past the end of the file;
a

java.io.EOFException

will be thrown only if a read is
performed.

**Parameters:** pos

- a

long

containing the desired file
pointer position.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

pos

is smaller
than the flushed position.
**Throws:** IOException

- if any other I/O error occurs.

- mark

```java
void mark()
```

Marks a position in the stream to be returned to by a
subsequent call to

reset

. Unlike a standard

InputStream

, all

ImageInputStream

s
support marking. Additionally, calls to

mark

and

reset

may be nested arbitrarily.

Unlike the

mark

methods declared by the

Reader

and

InputStream

interfaces, no

readLimit

parameter is used. An arbitrary amount
of data may be read following the call to

mark

.

The bit position used by the

readBits

method
is saved and restored by each pair of calls to

mark

and

reset

.

Note that it is valid for an

ImageReader

to call

flushBefore

as part of a read operation.
Therefore, if an application calls

mark

prior to
passing that stream to an

ImageReader

, the application
should not assume that the marked position will remain valid after
the read operation has completed.

- reset

```java
void reset()
throws
IOException
```

Returns the stream pointer to its previous position, including
the bit offset, at the time of the most recent unmatched call
to

mark

.

Calls to

reset

without a corresponding call
to

mark

have no effect.

An

IOException

will be thrown if the previous
marked position lies in the discarded portion of the stream.

**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- flushBefore

```java
void flushBefore​(long pos)
throws
IOException
```

Discards the initial portion of the stream prior to the
indicated position. Attempting to seek to an offset within the
flushed portion of the stream will result in an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

.

Calling

flushBefore

may allow classes
implementing this interface to free up resources such as memory
or disk space that are being used to store data from the
stream.

**Parameters:** pos

- a

long

containing the length of the
stream prefix that may be flushed.
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

pos

lies
in the flushed portion of the stream or past the current stream
position.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- flush

```java
void flush()
throws
IOException
```

Discards the initial position of the stream prior to the current
stream position. Equivalent to

flushBefore(getStreamPosition())

.

**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

- getFlushedPosition

```java
long getFlushedPosition()
```

Returns the earliest position in the stream to which seeking
may be performed. The returned value will be the maximum of
all values passed into previous calls to

flushBefore

.

**Returns:** the earliest legal position for seeking, as a

long

.

- isCached

```java
boolean isCached()
```

Returns

true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards.
Applications may consult this in order to decide how frequently,
or whether, to flush in order to conserve cache resources.

**Returns:** true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data.
**See Also:** isCachedMemory()

,

isCachedFile()

- isCachedMemory

```java
boolean isCachedMemory()
```

Returns

true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and
the cache is kept in main memory. Applications may consult
this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush
in order to conserve cache resources.

**Returns:** true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data in main memory.
**See Also:** isCached()

,

isCachedFile()

- isCachedFile

```java
boolean isCachedFile()
```

Returns

true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and
the cache is kept in a temporary file. Applications may consult
this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush
in order to conserve cache resources.

**Returns:** true

if this

ImageInputStream

caches data in a temporary file.
**See Also:** isCached()

,

isCachedMemory()

- close

```java
void close()
throws
IOException
```

Closes the stream. Attempts to access a stream that has been
closed may result in

IOException

s or incorrect
behavior. Calling this method may allow classes implementing
this interface to release resources associated with the stream
such as memory, disk space, or file descriptors.

**Specified by:** close

#### Method Detail

setByteOrder

```java
void setByteOrder​(
ByteOrder
byteOrder)
```

Sets the desired byte order for future reads of data values
from this stream. For example, the sequence of bytes '0x01
0x02 0x03 0x04' if read as a 4-byte integer would have the
value '0x01020304' using network byte order and the value
'0x04030201' under the reverse byte order.

The enumeration class

java.nio.ByteOrder

is
used to specify the byte order. A value of

ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN

specifies so-called
big-endian or network byte order, in which the high-order byte
comes first. Motorola and Sparc processors store data in this
format, while Intel processors store data in the reverse

ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN

order.

The byte order has no effect on the results returned from
the

readBits

method (or the value written by

ImageOutputStream.writeBits

).

**Parameters:** byteOrder

- one of

ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN

or

java.nio.ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN

, indicating whether
network byte order or its reverse will be used for future
reads.

read, then

null

is returned. Otherwise, each byte
that is read is converted to type

char

by
zero-extension. If the character

is
encountered, it is discarded and reading ceases. If the
character

'\r'

is encountered, it is discarded
and, if the following byte converts to the character

readUTF

```java
String
readUTF()
throws
IOException
```

Reads in a string that has been encoded using a

modified
UTF-8

format. The general contract of

readUTF

is that
it reads a representation of a Unicode character string encoded
in modified UTF-8 format; this string of characters is
then returned as a

String

.

First, two bytes are read and used to construct an unsigned
16-bit integer in the manner of the

readUnsignedShort

method, using network byte order
(regardless of the current byte order setting). This integer
value is called the

UTF length

and specifies the number
of additional bytes to be read. These bytes are then converted
to characters by considering them in groups. The length of each
group is computed from the value of the first byte of the
group. The byte following a group, if any, is the first byte of
the next group.

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

0xxxxxxx

(where

x

means "may be

0

or

1

"), then the group consists of
just that byte. The byte is zero-extended to form a character.

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

110xxxxx

, then the group consists of that byte

a

and a second byte

b

. If there is no
byte

b

(because byte

a

was the last
of the bytes to be read), or if byte

b

does not
match the bit pattern

10xxxxxx

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
group is converted to the character:

```java
(char)(((a& 0x1F) << 6) | (b & 0x3F))
```

If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern

1110xxxx

, then the group consists of that byte

a

and two more bytes

b

and

c

. If there is no byte

c

(because
byte

a

was one of the last two of the bytes to be
read), or either byte

b

or byte

c

does not match the bit pattern

10xxxxxx

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, the
group is converted to the character:

```java
(char)(((a & 0x0F) << 12) | ((b & 0x3F) << 6) | (c & 0x3F))
```

If the first byte of a group matches the pattern

1111xxxx

or the pattern

10xxxxxx

,
then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown.

If end of file is encountered at any time during this
entire process, then a

java.io.EOFException

is thrown.

After every group has been converted to a character by this
process, the characters are gathered, in the same order in
which their corresponding groups were read from the input
stream, to form a

String

, which is returned.

The current byte order setting is ignored.

The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
the read occurs.

Note:

This method should not be used in
the implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8,
because the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with
standard UTF-8.

**Specified by:** readUTF

in interface

DataInput
**Returns:** a String read from the stream.
**Throws:** EOFException

- if this stream reaches the end
before reading all the bytes.

interfaces, no

readLimit

parameter is used. An arbitrary amount
of data may be read following the call to

mark

.

The bit position used by the

readBits

method
is saved and restored by each pair of calls to

mark

and

as part of a read operation.
Therefore, if an application calls

mark

prior to
passing that stream to an

ImageReader

, the application
should not assume that the marked position will remain valid after
the read operation has completed.
