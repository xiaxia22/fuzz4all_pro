# Interface Map<K,​V>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Map.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Map<K,​V>
```

An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys;
each key can map to at most one value.

This interface takes the place of the

Dictionary

class, which
was a totally abstract class rather than an interface.

The

Map

interface provides three

collection views

, which
allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys, collection of values,
or set of key-value mappings. The

order

of a map is defined as
the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views return their
elements. Some map implementations, like the

TreeMap

class, make
specific guarantees as to their order; others, like the

HashMap

class, do not.

Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map
keys. The behavior of a map is not specified if the value of an object is
changed in a manner that affects

equals

comparisons while the
object is a key in the map. A special case of this prohibition is that it
is not permissible for a map to contain itself as a key. While it is
permissible for a map to contain itself as a value, extreme caution is
advised: the

equals

and

hashCode

methods are no longer
well defined on such a map.

All general-purpose map implementation classes should provide two
"standard" constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor which creates an
empty map, and a constructor with a single argument of type

Map

,
which creates a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument.
In effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any map,
producing an equivalent map of the desired class. There is no way to
enforce this recommendation (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) but
all of the general-purpose map implementations in the JDK comply.

The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the
methods that modify the map on which they operate, are specified to throw

UnsupportedOperationException

if this map does not support the
operation. If this is the case, these methods may, but are not required
to, throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

if the invocation would
have no effect on the map. For example, invoking the

putAll(Map)

method on an unmodifiable map may, but is not required to, throw the
exception if the map whose mappings are to be "superimposed" is empty.

Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys and values they
may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null keys and
values, and some have restrictions on the types of their keys. Attempting
to insert an ineligible key or value throws an unchecked exception,
typically

NullPointerException

or

ClassCastException

.
Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible key or value may throw an
exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit
the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally,
attempting an operation on an ineligible key or value whose completion
would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the map may
throw an exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
interface.

Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined
in terms of the

equals

method. For
example, the specification for the

containsKey(Object key)

method says: "returns

true

if and
only if this map contains a mapping for a key

k

such that

(key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k))

." This specification should

not

be construed to imply that invoking

Map.containsKey

with a non-null argument

key

will cause

key.equals(k)

to
be invoked for any key

k

. Implementations are free to
implement optimizations whereby the

equals

invocation is avoided,
for example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two keys. (The

Object.hashCode()

specification guarantees that two objects with
unequal hash codes cannot be equal.) More generally, implementations of
the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of
the specified behavior of underlying

Object

methods wherever the
implementor deems it appropriate.

Some map operations which perform recursive traversal of the map may fail
with an exception for self-referential instances where the map directly or
indirectly contains itself. This includes the

clone()

,

equals()

,

hashCode()

and

toString()

methods.
Implementations may optionally handle the self-referential scenario, however
most current implementations do not do so.

Unmodifiable Maps

The

Map.of

,

Map.ofEntries

, and

Map.copyOf

static factory methods provide a convenient way to create unmodifiable maps.
The

Map

instances created by these methods have the following characteristics:

- They are

unmodifiable

. Keys and values
cannot be added, removed, or updated. Calling any mutator method on the Map
will always cause

UnsupportedOperationException

to be thrown.
However, if the contained keys or values are themselves mutable, this may cause the
Map to behave inconsistently or its contents to appear to change.

They disallow

null

keys and values. Attempts to create them with

null

keys or values result in

NullPointerException

.

They are serializable if all keys and values are serializable.

They reject duplicate keys at creation time. Duplicate keys
passed to a static factory method result in

IllegalArgumentException

.

The iteration order of mappings is unspecified and is subject to change.

They are

value-based

.
Callers should make no assumptions about the identity of the returned instances.
Factories are free to create new instances or reuse existing ones. Therefore,
identity-sensitive operations on these instances (reference equality (

==

),
identity hash code, and synchronization) are unreliable and should be avoided.

They are serialized as specified on the

Serialized Form

page.

This interface is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

**Type Parameters:** K

- the type of keys maintained by this map
**Type Parameters:** V

- the type of mapped values

---

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### int size()

Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map. If the
map contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

**Returns:**
- the number of key-value mappings in this map

---

#### boolean isEmpty()

Returns

true

if this map contains no key-value mappings.

**Returns:**
- true

if this map contains no key-value mappings

---

#### boolean containsKey​(
Object
key)

Returns

true

if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key. More formally, returns

true

if and only if
this map contains a mapping for a key

k

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

. (There can be
at most one such mapping.)

**Parameters:**
- key

- key whose presence in this map is to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

---

#### boolean containsValue​(
Object
value)

Returns

true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value. More formally, returns

true

if and only if
this map contains at least one mapping to a value

v

such that

Objects.equals(value, v)

. This operation
will probably require time linear in the map size for most
implementations of the

Map

interface.

**Parameters:**
- value

- value whose presence in this map is to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the value is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified value is null and this
map does not permit null values
(

optional

)

---

#### V
get​(
Object
key)

Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key

k

to a value

v

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

,
then this method returns

v

; otherwise
it returns

null

. (There can be at most one such mapping.)

If this map permits null values, then a return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map
contains no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
explicitly maps the key to

null

. The

containsKey

operation may be used to distinguish these two cases.

**Parameters:**
- key

- the key whose associated value is to be returned

**Returns:**
- the value to which the specified key is mapped, or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

---

#### V
put​(
K
key,

V
value)

Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map
(optional operation). If the map previously contained a mapping for
the key, the old value is replaced by the specified value. (A map

m

is said to contain a mapping for a key

k

if and only
if

m.containsKey(k)

would return

true

.)

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
- value

- value to be associated with the specified key

**Returns:**
- the previous value associated with

key

, or

null

if there was no mapping for

key

.
(A

null

return can also indicate that the map
previously associated

null

with

key

,
if the implementation supports

null

values.)

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

put

operation
is not supported by this map
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified key or value
prevents it from being stored in this map
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key or value is null
and this map does not permit null keys or values
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified key
or value prevents it from being stored in this map

---

#### V
remove​(
Object
key)

Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present
(optional operation). More formally, if this map contains a mapping
from key

k

to value

v

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

, that mapping
is removed. (The map can contain at most one such mapping.)

Returns the value to which this map previously associated the key,
or

null

if the map contained no mapping for the key.

If this map permits null values, then a return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map
contained no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
explicitly mapped the key to

null

.

The map will not contain a mapping for the specified key once the
call returns.

**Parameters:**
- key

- key whose mapping is to be removed from the map

**Returns:**
- the previous value associated with

key

, or

null

if there was no mapping for

key

.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

remove

operation
is not supported by this map
- ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this
map does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

---

#### void putAll​(
Map
<? extends
K
,​? extends
V
> m)

Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map
(optional operation). The effect of this call is equivalent to that
of calling

put(k, v)

on this map once
for each mapping from key

k

to value

v

in the
specified map. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the
specified map is modified while the operation is in progress.

**Parameters:**
- m

- mappings to be stored in this map

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

putAll

operation
is not supported by this map
- ClassCastException

- if the class of a key or value in the
specified map prevents it from being stored in this map
- NullPointerException

- if the specified map is null, or if
this map does not permit null keys or values, and the
specified map contains null keys or values
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of a key or value in
the specified map prevents it from being stored in this map

---

#### void clear()

Removes all of the mappings from this map (optional operation).
The map will be empty after this call returns.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

clear

operation
is not supported by this map

---

#### Set
<
K
> keySet()

Returns a

Set

view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Returns:**
- a set view of the keys contained in this map

---

#### Collection
<
V
> values()

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

remove

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not
support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Returns:**
- a collection view of the values contained in this map

---

#### Set
<
Map.Entry
<
K
,​
V
>> entrySet()

Returns a

Set

view of the mappings contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation, or through the

setValue

operation on a map entry returned by the
iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Returns:**
- a set view of the mappings contained in this map

---

#### boolean equals​(
Object
o)

Compares the specified object with this map for equality. Returns

true

if the given object is also a map and the two maps
represent the same mappings. More formally, two maps

m1

and

m2

represent the same mappings if

m1.entrySet().equals(m2.entrySet())

. This ensures that the

equals

method works properly across different implementations
of the

Map

interface.

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- o

- object to be compared for equality with this map

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified object is equal to this map

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

---

#### int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this map. The hash code of a map is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's

entrySet()

view. This ensures that

m1.equals(m2)

implies that

m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()

for any two maps

m1

and

m2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- the hash code value for this map

**See Also:**
- Map.Entry.hashCode()

,

Object.equals(Object)

,

equals(Object)

---

#### default
V
getOrDefault​(
Object
key,

V
defaultValue)

Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or

defaultValue

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

**Parameters:**
- key

- the key whose associated value is to be returned
- defaultValue

- the default mapping of the key

**Returns:**
- the value to which the specified key is mapped, or

defaultValue

if this map contains no mapping for the key

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

---

#### default void forEach​(
BiConsumer
<? super
K
,​? super
V
> action)

Performs the given action for each entry in this map until all entries
have been processed or the action throws an exception. Unless

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the specified value is associated
- value

- value to be associated with the specified key

**Returns:**
- the previous value associated with the specified key, or

---

#### default
V
computeIfAbsent​(
K
key,

Function
<? super
K
,​? extends
V
> mappingFunction)

If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped
to

null

), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping
function and enters it into this map unless

null

.

If the mapping function returns

null

, no mapping is recorded.
If the mapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and no mapping is recorded. The most
common usage is to construct a new object serving as an initial
mapped value or memoized result, as in:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new Value(f(k)));
```

Or to implement a multi-value map,

Map<K,Collection<V>>

,
supporting multiple values per key:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new HashSet<V>()).add(v);
```

The mapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
- mappingFunction

- the mapping function to compute a value

**Returns:**
- the current (existing or computed) value associated with
the specified key, or null if the computed value is null

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and
this map does not support null keys, or the mappingFunction
is null
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

put

operation
is not supported by this map
(

optional

)
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified key or value
prevents it from being stored in this map
(

optional

)
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified key
or value prevents it from being stored in this map
(

optional

)

**Since:**
- 1.8

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation is equivalent to the following steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if now
absent:

```java
if (map.get(key) == null) {
V newValue = mappingFunction.apply(key);
if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
}
```

The default implementation makes no guarantees about detecting if the
mapping function modifies this map during computation and, if
appropriate, reporting an error. Non-concurrent implementations should
override this method and, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if it is detected that the
mapping function modifies this map during computation. Concurrent
implementations should override this method and, on a best-effort basis,
throw an

IllegalStateException

if it is detected that the
mapping function modifies this map during computation and as a result
computation would never complete.

The default implementation makes no guarantees about synchronization
or atomicity properties of this method. Any implementation providing
atomicity guarantees must override this method and document its
concurrency properties. In particular, all implementations of
subinterface

ConcurrentMap

must document
whether the mapping function is applied once atomically only if the value
is not present.

---

#### default
V
computeIfPresent​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)

If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to
compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
- remappingFunction

- the remapping function to compute a value

**Returns:**
- the new value associated with the specified key, or null if none

**Throws:**

)
- ClassCastException

**Since:**
- 1.8

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation is equivalent to performing the following
steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if now absent:

```java
if (map.get(key) != null) {

V newValue = remappingFunction.apply(key, oldValue);
if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
else

The default implementation makes no guarantees about detecting if the
remapping function modifies this map during computation and, if
appropriate, reporting an error. Non-concurrent implementations should
override this method and, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if it is detected that the
remapping function modifies this map during computation. Concurrent
implementations should override this method and, on a best-effort basis,
throw an

IllegalStateException

if it is detected that the
remapping function modifies this map during computation and as a result
computation would never complete.

The default implementation makes no guarantees about synchronization
or atomicity properties of this method. Any implementation providing
atomicity guarantees must override this method and document its
concurrency properties. In particular, all implementations of
subinterface

ConcurrentMap

must document
whether the remapping function is applied once atomically only if the
value is not present.

#### default
V
compute​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)

Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current
mapped value (or

null

if there is no current mapping). For
example, to either create or append a

String

msg to a value
mapping:

```java
map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? msg : v.concat(msg))
```

(Method

merge()

is often simpler to use for such purposes.)

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed
(or remains absent if initially absent). If the remapping function
itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception is rethrown, and
the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
- remappingFunction

- the remapping function to compute a value

**Returns:**
- the new value associated with the specified key, or null if none

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and
this map does not support null keys, or the
remappingFunction is null
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

put

operation
is not supported by this map
(

optional

)
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified key or value
prevents it from being stored in this map
(

optional

- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified key
or value prevents it from being stored in this map
(

optional

**Since:**

**Implementation Requirements:**

steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if absent:

```java
V oldValue = map.get(key);
V newValue = remappingFunction.apply(key, oldValue);
if (oldValue != null) {
if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
else
map.remove(key);

if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
else
return null;

#### default
V
merge​(
K
key,

V
value,

BiFunction
<? super
V
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)

If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is
associated with null, associates it with the given non-null value.
Otherwise, replaces the associated value with the results of the given
remapping function, or removes if the result is

null

. This
method may be of use when combining multiple mapped values for a key.
For example, to either create or append a

String msg

to a
value mapping:

```java
map.merge(key, msg, String::concat)
```

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the resulting value is to be associated
- value

- the non-null value to be merged with the existing value
associated with the key or, if no existing value or a null value
is associated with the key, to be associated with the key
- remappingFunction

- the remapping function to recompute a value if
present

**Returns:**
- the new value associated with the specified key, or null if no
value is associated with the key

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

put

operation
is not supported by this map
(

optional

)
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified key or value
prevents it from being stored in this map
(

optional

)
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified key
or value prevents it from being stored in this map
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not support null keys or the value or remappingFunction is
null

**Since:**
- 1.8

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation is equivalent to performing the following
steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if absent:

if (newValue == null)
map.remove(key);
else
map.put(key, newValue);

#### @SafeVarargs

static <K,​V>
Map
<K,​V> ofEntries​(
Map.Entry
<? extends K,​? extends V>... entries)

Returns an unmodifiable map containing keys and values extracted from the given entries.
The entries themselves are not stored in the map.
See

Unmodifiable Maps

for details.

**Parameters:**
- entries

-

Map.Entry

s containing the keys and values from which the map is populated

**Returns:**
- a

Map

containing the specified mappings

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if there are any duplicate keys
- NullPointerException

- if any entry, key, or value is

null

, or if
the

entries

array is

null

**See Also:**
- Map.entry()

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- It is convenient to create the map entries using the

Map.entry()

method.
For example,

```java
import static java.util.Map.entry;

Map<Integer,String> map = Map.ofEntries(
entry(1, "a"),
entry(2, "b"),
entry(3, "c"),
...
entry(26, "z"));
```

**Type Parameters:**
- K

- the

Map

's key type
- V

- the

Map

's value type

---

#### static <K,​V>
Map.Entry
<K,​V> entry​(K k,
V v)

Returns an unmodifiable

Map.Entry

containing the given key and value.
These entries are suitable for populating

Map

instances using the

Map.ofEntries()

method.
The

Entry

instances created by this method have the following characteristics:

- They disallow

null

keys and values. Attempts to create them using a

null

key or value result in

NullPointerException

.

They are unmodifiable. Calls to

Entry.setValue()

on a returned

Entry

result in

UnsupportedOperationException

.

They are not serializable.

They are

value-based

.
Callers should make no assumptions about the identity of the returned instances.
This method is free to create new instances or reuse existing ones. Therefore,
identity-sensitive operations on these instances (reference equality (

==

),
identity hash code, and synchronization) are unreliable and should be avoided.

**Parameters:**
- k

- the key
- v

- the value

**Returns:**
- an

Entry

containing the specified key and value

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if the key or value is

null

**See Also:**
- Map.ofEntries()

**Since:**
- 9

**API Note:**
- For a serializable

Entry

, see

AbstractMap.SimpleEntry

or

AbstractMap.SimpleImmutableEntry

.

**Type Parameters:**
- K

- the key's type
- V

- the value's type

---

#### static <K,​V>
Map
<K,​V> copyOf​(
Map
<? extends K,​? extends V> map)

Returns an

unmodifiable Map

containing the entries
of the given Map. The given Map must not be null, and it must not contain any
null keys or values. If the given Map is subsequently modified, the returned
Map will not reflect such modifications.

**Parameters:**
- map

- a

Map

from which entries are drawn, must be non-null

**Returns:**
- a

Map

containing the entries of the given

Map

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if map is null, or if it contains any null keys or values

**Since:**
- 10

**Implementation Note:**
- If the given Map is an

unmodifiable Map

,
calling copyOf will generally not create a copy.

**Type Parameters:**
- K

- the

Map

's key type
- V

- the

Map

's value type

```java
public interface
Map<K,​V>
```

An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys;
each key can map to at most one value.

This interface takes the place of the

Dictionary

class, which
was a totally abstract class rather than an interface.

The

Map

interface provides three

collection views

, which
allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys, collection of values,
or set of key-value mappings. The

order

of a map is defined as
the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views return their
elements. Some map implementations, like the

TreeMap

class, make
specific guarantees as to their order; others, like the

HashMap

class, do not.

Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map
keys. The behavior of a map is not specified if the value of an object is
changed in a manner that affects

equals

comparisons while the
object is a key in the map. A special case of this prohibition is that it
is not permissible for a map to contain itself as a key. While it is
permissible for a map to contain itself as a value, extreme caution is
advised: the

equals

and

hashCode

methods are no longer
well defined on such a map.

All general-purpose map implementation classes should provide two
"standard" constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor which creates an
empty map, and a constructor with a single argument of type

Map

,
which creates a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument.
In effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any map,
producing an equivalent map of the desired class. There is no way to
enforce this recommendation (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) but
all of the general-purpose map implementations in the JDK comply.

The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the
methods that modify the map on which they operate, are specified to throw

UnsupportedOperationException

if this map does not support the
operation. If this is the case, these methods may, but are not required
to, throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

if the invocation would
have no effect on the map. For example, invoking the

putAll(Map)

method on an unmodifiable map may, but is not required to, throw the
exception if the map whose mappings are to be "superimposed" is empty.

Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys and values they
may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null keys and
values, and some have restrictions on the types of their keys. Attempting
to insert an ineligible key or value throws an unchecked exception,
typically

NullPointerException

or

ClassCastException

.
Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible key or value may throw an
exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit
the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally,
attempting an operation on an ineligible key or value whose completion
would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the map may
throw an exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
interface.

Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined
in terms of the

equals

method. For
example, the specification for the

containsKey(Object key)

method says: "returns

public interface

Map<K,​V>

An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys;
each key can map to at most one value.

This interface takes the place of the

Dictionary

class, which
was a totally abstract class rather than an interface.

The

Map

interface provides three

collection views

, which
allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys, collection of values,
or set of key-value mappings. The

order

of a map is defined as
the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views return their
elements. Some map implementations, like the

TreeMap

class, make
specific guarantees as to their order; others, like the

HashMap

class, do not.

Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map
keys. The behavior of a map is not specified if the value of an object is
changed in a manner that affects

equals

comparisons while the
object is a key in the map. A special case of this prohibition is that it
is not permissible for a map to contain itself as a key. While it is
permissible for a map to contain itself as a value, extreme caution is
advised: the

equals

and

hashCode

methods are no longer
well defined on such a map.

All general-purpose map implementation classes should provide two
"standard" constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor which creates an
empty map, and a constructor with a single argument of type

Map

,
which creates a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument.
In effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any map,
producing an equivalent map of the desired class. There is no way to
enforce this recommendation (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) but
all of the general-purpose map implementations in the JDK comply.

The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the
methods that modify the map on which they operate, are specified to throw

UnsupportedOperationException

if this map does not support the
operation. If this is the case, these methods may, but are not required
to, throw an

UnsupportedOperationException

if the invocation would
have no effect on the map. For example, invoking the

putAll(Map)

method on an unmodifiable map may, but is not required to, throw the
exception if the map whose mappings are to be "superimposed" is empty.

Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys and values they
may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null keys and
values, and some have restrictions on the types of their keys. Attempting
to insert an ineligible key or value throws an unchecked exception,
typically

NullPointerException

or

ClassCastException

.
Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible key or value may throw an
exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit
the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally,
attempting an operation on an ineligible key or value whose completion
would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the map may
throw an exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
interface.

Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined
in terms of the

equals

method. For
example, the specification for the

containsKey(Object key)

method says: "returns

true

if and
only if this map contains a mapping for a key

k

such that

(key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k))

." This specification should

not

be construed to imply that invoking

Map.containsKey

with a non-null argument

key

will cause

key.equals(k)

to
be invoked for any key

k

. Implementations are free to
implement optimizations whereby the

equals

invocation is avoided,
for example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two keys. (The

Object.hashCode()

specification guarantees that two objects with
unequal hash codes cannot be equal.) More generally, implementations of
the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of
the specified behavior of underlying

Object

methods wherever the
implementor deems it appropriate.

Some map operations which perform recursive traversal of the map may fail
with an exception for self-referential instances where the map directly or
indirectly contains itself. This includes the

clone()

equals()

,

hashCode()

and

toString()

most current implementations do not do so.

instances created by these methods have the following characteristics:

- They are

unmodifiable

. Keys and values
cannot be added, removed, or updated. Calling any mutator method on the Map
will always cause

UnsupportedOperationException

to be thrown.
However, if the contained keys or values are themselves mutable, this may cause the
Map to behave inconsistently or its contents to appear to change.

They disallow

null

keys and values. Attempts to create them with

null

keys or values result in

NullPointerException

.

They are serializable if all keys and values are serializable.

They reject duplicate keys at creation time. Duplicate keys
passed to a static factory method result in

IllegalArgumentException

.

The iteration order of mappings is unspecified and is subject to change.

They are

value-based

.
Callers should make no assumptions about the identity of the returned instances.
Factories are free to create new instances or reuse existing ones. Therefore,
identity-sensitive operations on these instances (reference equality (

==

),
identity hash code, and synchronization) are unreliable and should be avoided.

They are serialized as specified on the

Serialized Form

page.

This interface is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys and values they
may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null keys and
values, and some have restrictions on the types of their keys. Attempting
to insert an ineligible key or value throws an unchecked exception,
typically

NullPointerException

or

ClassCastException

.
Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible key or value may throw an
exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit
the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally,
attempting an operation on an ineligible key or value whose completion
would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the map may
throw an exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
interface.

Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined
in terms of the

equals

method. For
example, the specification for the

containsKey(Object key)

method says: "returns

true

if and
only if this map contains a mapping for a key

k

such that

(key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k))

." This specification should

not

be construed to imply that invoking

Map.containsKey

with a non-null argument

key

will cause

key.equals(k)

to
be invoked for any key

k

. Implementations are free to
implement optimizations whereby the

equals

invocation is avoided,
for example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two keys. (The

Object.hashCode()

specification guarantees that two objects with
unequal hash codes cannot be equal.) More generally, implementations of
the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of
the specified behavior of underlying

Object

methods wherever the
implementor deems it appropriate.

Some map operations which perform recursive traversal of the map may fail
with an exception for self-referential instances where the map directly or
indirectly contains itself. This includes the

clone()

,

equals()

,

hashCode()

and

toString()

methods.
Implementations may optionally handle the self-referential scenario, however
most current implementations do not do so.

Unmodifiable Maps

The

Map.of

Map.ofEntries

, and

Map.copyOf

static factory methods provide a convenient way to create unmodifiable maps.
The

Map

instances created by these methods have the following characteristics:

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- size

```java
int size()
```

Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map. If the
map contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

**Returns:** the number of key-value mappings in this map

- isEmpty

```java
boolean isEmpty()
```

Returns

true

if this map contains no key-value mappings.

**Returns:** true

if this map contains no key-value mappings

- containsKey

```java
boolean containsKey​(
Object
key)
```

Returns

true

if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key. More formally, returns

true

if and only if
this map contains a mapping for a key

k

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

. (There can be
at most one such mapping.)

**Parameters:** key

- key whose presence in this map is to be tested
**Returns:** true

if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

- containsValue

```java
boolean containsValue​(
Object
value)
```

Returns

true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value. More formally, returns

true

if and only if
this map contains at least one mapping to a value

v

such that

Objects.equals(value, v)

. This operation
will probably require time linear in the map size for most
implementations of the

Map

interface.

**Parameters:** value

- value whose presence in this map is to be tested
**Returns:** true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the value is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified value is null and this
map does not permit null values
(

optional

)

- get

```java
V
get​(
Object
key)
```

Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key

k

to a value

v

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

,
then this method returns

v

; otherwise
it returns

null

. (There can be at most one such mapping.)

If this map permits null values, then a return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map
contains no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
explicitly maps the key to

null

. The

containsKey

operation may be used to distinguish these two cases.

**Parameters:** key

- the key whose associated value is to be returned
**Returns:** the value to which the specified key is mapped, or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

- put

```java
V
put​(
K
key,

V
value)
```

Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map
(optional operation). If the map previously contained a mapping for
the key, the old value is replaced by the specified value. (A map

m

is said to contain a mapping for a key

k

if and only
if

m.containsKey(k)

would return

true

.)

**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** value

- value to be associated with the specified key
**Returns:** the previous value associated with

key

, or

null

if there was no mapping for

key

.
(A

null

return can also indicate that the map
previously associated

null

with

key

,
if the implementation supports

null

values.)
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

put

operation
is not supported by this map
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified key or value
prevents it from being stored in this map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key or value is null
and this map does not permit null keys or values
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified key
or value prevents it from being stored in this map

- remove

```java
V
remove​(
Object
key)
```

Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present
(optional operation). More formally, if this map contains a mapping
from key

k

to value

v

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

, that mapping
is removed. (The map can contain at most one such mapping.)

Returns the value to which this map previously associated the key,
or

null

if the map contained no mapping for the key.

If this map permits null values, then a return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map
contained no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
explicitly mapped the key to

null

.

The map will not contain a mapping for the specified key once the
call returns.

**Parameters:** key

- key whose mapping is to be removed from the map
**Returns:** the previous value associated with

key

, or

null

if there was no mapping for

key

.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

remove

operation
is not supported by this map
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this
map does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

- putAll

```java
void putAll​(
Map
<? extends
K
,​? extends
V
> m)
```

Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map
(optional operation). The effect of this call is equivalent to that
of calling

put(k, v)

on this map once
for each mapping from key

k

to value

v

in the
specified map. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the
specified map is modified while the operation is in progress.

**Parameters:** m

- mappings to be stored in this map
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

putAll

operation
is not supported by this map
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of a key or value in the
specified map prevents it from being stored in this map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified map is null, or if
this map does not permit null keys or values, and the
specified map contains null keys or values
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of a key or value in
the specified map prevents it from being stored in this map

- clear

```java
void clear()
```

Removes all of the mappings from this map (optional operation).
The map will be empty after this call returns.

**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

clear

operation
is not supported by this map

- keySet

```java
Set
<
K
> keySet()
```

Returns a

Set

view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Returns:** a set view of the keys contained in this map

- values

```java
Collection
<
V
> values()
```

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

remove

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not
support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Returns:** a collection view of the values contained in this map

- entrySet

```java
Set
<
Map.Entry
<
K
,​
V
>> entrySet()
```

Returns a

Set

view of the mappings contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation, or through the

setValue

operation on a map entry returned by the
iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Returns:** a set view of the mappings contained in this map

- equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Compares the specified object with this map for equality. Returns

true

if the given object is also a map and the two maps
represent the same mappings. More formally, two maps

m1

and

m2

represent the same mappings if

m1.entrySet().equals(m2.entrySet())

. This ensures that the

equals

method works properly across different implementations
of the

Map

interface.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** o

- object to be compared for equality with this map
**Returns:** true

if the specified object is equal to this map
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this map. The hash code of a map is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's

entrySet()

view. This ensures that

m1.equals(m2)

implies that

m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()

for any two maps

m1

and

m2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** the hash code value for this map
**See Also:** Map.Entry.hashCode()

,

Object.equals(Object)

,

equals(Object)

- getOrDefault

```java
default
V
getOrDefault​(
Object
key,

V
defaultValue)
```

Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or

defaultValue

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

map

:

```java
if (map.containsKey(key) && Objects.equals(map.get(key), value)) {
map.put(key, newValue);
return true;

```

Replaces the entry for the specified key only if it is
currently mapped to some value.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation is equivalent to, for this

map

:

```java
if (map.containsKey(key)) {
return map.put(key, value);
} else
return null;
```

The default implementation makes no guarantees about synchronization
or atomicity properties of this method. Any implementation providing
atomicity guarantees must override this method and document its
concurrency properties.
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is associated
**Parameters:** value

- value to be associated with the specified key
**Returns:** the previous value associated with the specified key, or

null

if there was no mapping for the key.
(A

null

return can also indicate that the map

- computeIfAbsent

```java
default
V
computeIfAbsent​(
K
key,

Function
<? super
K
,​? extends
V
> mappingFunction)
```

If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped
to

null

), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping
function and enters it into this map unless

null

.

If the mapping function returns

null

, no mapping is recorded.
If the mapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and no mapping is recorded. The most
common usage is to construct a new object serving as an initial
mapped value or memoized result, as in:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new Value(f(k)));
```

Or to implement a multi-value map,

Map<K,Collection<V>>

,
supporting multiple values per key:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new HashSet<V>()).add(v);
```

The mapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation is equivalent to the following steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if now
absent:

```java
if (map.get(key) == null) {
V newValue = mappingFunction.apply(key);
if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
}
```

The default implementation makes no guarantees about detecting if the
mapping function modifies this map during computation and, if
appropriate, reporting an error. Non-concurrent implementations should
override this method and, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if it is detected that the
mapping function modifies this map during computation. Concurrent
implementations should override this method and, on a best-effort basis,
throw an

IllegalStateException

if it is detected that the
mapping function modifies this map during computation and as a result
computation would never complete.

The default implementation makes no guarantees about synchronization
or atomicity properties of this method. Any implementation providing
atomicity guarantees must override this method and document its
concurrency properties. In particular, all implementations of
subinterface

ConcurrentMap

must document
whether the mapping function is applied once atomically only if the value
is not present.
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** mappingFunction

- the mapping function to compute a value
**Returns:** the current (existing or computed) value associated with
the specified key, or null if the computed value is null
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and
this map does not support null keys, or the mappingFunction
is null
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

put

operation
is not supported by this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified key or value
prevents it from being stored in this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified key
or value prevents it from being stored in this map

**Since:** 1.8

- computeIfPresent

```java
default
V
computeIfPresent​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)
```

If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to
compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation is equivalent to performing the following
steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if now absent:

```java
if (map.get(key) != null) {
V oldValue = map.get(key);
V newValue = remappingFunction.apply(key, oldValue);
if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
else
map.remove(key);
}
```

The default implementation makes no guarantees about detecting if the
remapping function modifies this map during computation and, if
appropriate, reporting an error. Non-concurrent implementations should
override this method and, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if it is detected that the
remapping function modifies this map during computation. Concurrent
implementations should override this method and, on a best-effort basis,
throw an

IllegalStateException

if it is detected that the
remapping function modifies this map during computation and as a result
computation would never complete.

value is not present.
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** remappingFunction

- the remapping function to compute a value
**Returns:** the new value associated with the specified key, or null if none
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and
this map does not support null keys, or the
remappingFunction is null
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

operation
is not supported by this map
(

- compute

```java
default
V
compute​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)
```

Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current
mapped value (or

null

if there is no current mapping). For
example, to either create or append a

String

msg to a value
mapping:

```java
map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? msg : v.concat(msg))
```

(Method

merge()

is often simpler to use for such purposes.)

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed
(or remains absent if initially absent). If the remapping function
itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception is rethrown, and
the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation is equivalent to performing the following
steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if absent:

```java
V oldValue = map.get(key);
V newValue = remappingFunction.apply(key, oldValue);
if (oldValue != null) {
if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
else
map.remove(key);
} else {
if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
else
return null;
}
```

The default implementation makes no guarantees about detecting if the
remapping function modifies this map during computation and, if
appropriate, reporting an error. Non-concurrent implementations should
override this method and, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if it is detected that the
remapping function modifies this map during computation. Concurrent
implementations should override this method and, on a best-effort basis,
throw an

IllegalStateException

if it is detected that the
remapping function modifies this map during computation and as a result
computation would never complete.

The default implementation makes no guarantees about synchronization
or atomicity properties of this method. Any implementation providing
atomicity guarantees must override this method and document its
concurrency properties. In particular, all implementations of
subinterface

ConcurrentMap

must document
whether the remapping function is applied once atomically only if the
value is not present.
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** remappingFunction

- the remapping function to compute a value
**Returns:** the new value associated with the specified key, or null if none
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and
this map does not support null keys, or the
remappingFunction is null
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

put

operation
is not supported by this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified key or value
prevents it from being stored in this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified key
or value prevents it from being stored in this map
(

optional

)

- merge

```java
default
V
merge​(
K
key,

V
value,

BiFunction
<? super
V
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)
```

If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is
associated with null, associates it with the given non-null value.
Otherwise, replaces the associated value with the results of the given
remapping function, or removes if the result is

null

. This
method may be of use when combining multiple mapped values for a key.
For example, to either create or append a

String msg

to a
value mapping:

```java
map.merge(key, msg, String::concat)
```

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation is equivalent to performing the following
steps for this

- ofEntries

```java
@SafeVarargs

static <K,​V>
Map
<K,​V> ofEntries​(
Map.Entry
<? extends K,​? extends V>... entries)
```

Returns an unmodifiable map containing keys and values extracted from the given entries.
The entries themselves are not stored in the map.
See

Unmodifiable Maps

for details.

**API Note:** It is convenient to create the map entries using the

Map.entry()

method.
For example,

```java
import static java.util.Map.entry;

Map<Integer,String> map = Map.ofEntries(
entry(1, "a"),
entry(2, "b"),
entry(3, "c"),
...
entry(26, "z"));
```
**Type Parameters:** K

- the

Map

's key type
**Type Parameters:** V

- the

Map

's value type
**Parameters:** entries

-

Map.Entry

s containing the keys and values from which the map is populated
**Returns:** a

Map

containing the specified mappings
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if there are any duplicate keys
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any entry, key, or value is

null

, or if
the

entries

array is

null
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** Map.entry()

- entry

```java
static <K,​V>
Map.Entry
<K,​V> entry​(K k,
V v)
```

Returns an unmodifiable

Map.Entry

containing the given key and value.
These entries are suitable for populating

Map

instances using the

Map.ofEntries()

method.
The

Entry

instances created by this method have the following characteristics:

- They disallow

null

keys and values. Attempts to create them using a

null

key or value result in

NullPointerException

.

They are unmodifiable. Calls to

Entry.setValue()

on a returned

Entry

result in

UnsupportedOperationException

.

They are not serializable.

They are

value-based

.
Callers should make no assumptions about the identity of the returned instances.
This method is free to create new instances or reuse existing ones. Therefore,
identity-sensitive operations on these instances (reference equality (

==

),
identity hash code, and synchronization) are unreliable and should be avoided.

**API Note:** For a serializable

Entry

, see

AbstractMap.SimpleEntry

or

AbstractMap.SimpleImmutableEntry

.
**Type Parameters:** K

- the key's type
**Type Parameters:** V

- the value's type
**Parameters:** k

- the key
**Parameters:** v

- the value
**Returns:** an

Entry

containing the specified key and value
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the key or value is

null
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** Map.ofEntries()

- copyOf

```java
static <K,​V>
Map
<K,​V> copyOf​(
Map
<? extends K,​? extends V> map)
```

Returns an

unmodifiable Map

containing the entries
of the given Map. The given Map must not be null, and it must not contain any
null keys or values. If the given Map is subsequently modified, the returned
Map will not reflect such modifications.

**Implementation Note:** If the given Map is an

unmodifiable Map

,
calling copyOf will generally not create a copy.
**Type Parameters:** K

- the

Map

's key type
**Type Parameters:** V

- the

Map

's value type
**Parameters:** map

- a

Map

from which entries are drawn, must be non-null
**Returns:** a

Map

containing the entries of the given

Map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if map is null, or if it contains any null keys or values
**Since:** 10

Method Detail

- size

```java
int size()
```

Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map. If the
map contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

**Returns:** the number of key-value mappings in this map

- isEmpty

```java
boolean isEmpty()
```

Returns

true

if this map contains no key-value mappings.

**Returns:** true

if this map contains no key-value mappings

- containsKey

```java
boolean containsKey​(
Object
key)
```

Returns

true

if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key. More formally, returns

true

if and only if
this map contains a mapping for a key

k

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

. (There can be
at most one such mapping.)

**Parameters:** key

- key whose presence in this map is to be tested
**Returns:** true

if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

- containsValue

```java
boolean containsValue​(
Object
value)
```

Returns

true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value. More formally, returns

true

if and only if
this map contains at least one mapping to a value

v

such that

Objects.equals(value, v)

. This operation
will probably require time linear in the map size for most
implementations of the

Map

interface.

**Parameters:** value

- value whose presence in this map is to be tested
**Returns:** true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the value is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified value is null and this
map does not permit null values
(

optional

)

- get

```java
V
get​(
Object
key)
```

Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key

k

to a value

v

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

,
then this method returns

v

; otherwise
it returns

null

. (There can be at most one such mapping.)

If this map permits null values, then a return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map
contains no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
explicitly maps the key to

null

. The

containsKey

operation may be used to distinguish these two cases.

**Parameters:** key

- the key whose associated value is to be returned
**Returns:** the value to which the specified key is mapped, or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

- put

```java
V
put​(
K
key,

V
value)
```

Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map
(optional operation). If the map previously contained a mapping for
the key, the old value is replaced by the specified value. (A map

m

is said to contain a mapping for a key

k

if and only
if

m.containsKey(k)

would return

true

.)

**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** value

- value to be associated with the specified key
**Returns:** the previous value associated with

key

, or

null

if there was no mapping for

key

.
(A

null

return can also indicate that the map
previously associated

null

with

key

,
if the implementation supports

null

values.)
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

put

operation
is not supported by this map
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified key or value
prevents it from being stored in this map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key or value is null
and this map does not permit null keys or values
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified key
or value prevents it from being stored in this map

- remove

```java
V
remove​(
Object
key)
```

Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present
(optional operation). More formally, if this map contains a mapping
from key

k

to value

v

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

, that mapping
is removed. (The map can contain at most one such mapping.)

Returns the value to which this map previously associated the key,
or

null

if the map contained no mapping for the key.

If this map permits null values, then a return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map
contained no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
explicitly mapped the key to

null

.

The map will not contain a mapping for the specified key once the
call returns.

**Parameters:** key

- key whose mapping is to be removed from the map
**Returns:** the previous value associated with

key

, or

null

if there was no mapping for

key

.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

remove

operation
is not supported by this map
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this
map does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

- putAll

```java
void putAll​(
Map
<? extends
K
,​? extends
V
> m)
```

Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map
(optional operation). The effect of this call is equivalent to that
of calling

put(k, v)

on this map once
for each mapping from key

k

to value

v

in the
specified map. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the
specified map is modified while the operation is in progress.

**Parameters:** m

- mappings to be stored in this map
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

putAll

operation
is not supported by this map
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of a key or value in the
specified map prevents it from being stored in this map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified map is null, or if
this map does not permit null keys or values, and the
specified map contains null keys or values
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of a key or value in
the specified map prevents it from being stored in this map

- clear

```java
void clear()
```

Removes all of the mappings from this map (optional operation).
The map will be empty after this call returns.

**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

clear

operation
is not supported by this map

- keySet

```java
Set
<
K
> keySet()
```

Returns a

Set

view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Returns:** a set view of the keys contained in this map

- values

```java
Collection
<
V
> values()
```

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

remove

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not
support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Returns:** a collection view of the values contained in this map

- entrySet

```java
Set
<
Map.Entry
<
K
,​
V
>> entrySet()
```

Returns a

Set

view of the mappings contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation, or through the

setValue

operation on a map entry returned by the
iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Returns:** a set view of the mappings contained in this map

- equals

```java
boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Compares the specified object with this map for equality. Returns

true

if the given object is also a map and the two maps
represent the same mappings. More formally, two maps

m1

and

m2

represent the same mappings if

m1.entrySet().equals(m2.entrySet())

. This ensures that the

equals

method works properly across different implementations
of the

Map

interface.

**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Parameters:** o

- object to be compared for equality with this map
**Returns:** true

if the specified object is equal to this map
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this map. The hash code of a map is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's

entrySet()

view. This ensures that

m1.equals(m2)

implies that

m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()

for any two maps

m1

and

m2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Returns:** the hash code value for this map
**See Also:** Map.Entry.hashCode()

,

Object.equals(Object)

,

equals(Object)

map

:

```java
if (map.containsKey(key) && Objects.equals(map.get(key), value)) {
map.put(key, newValue);
return true;

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation is equivalent to, for this

map

:

```java
if (map.containsKey(key)) {
return map.put(key, value);
} else
return null;
```

The default implementation makes no guarantees about synchronization

- computeIfAbsent

```java
default
V
computeIfAbsent​(
K
key,

Function
<? super
K
,​? extends
V
> mappingFunction)
```

If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped
to

null

), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping
function and enters it into this map unless

null

.

If the mapping function returns

null

, no mapping is recorded.
If the mapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and no mapping is recorded. The most
common usage is to construct a new object serving as an initial
mapped value or memoized result, as in:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new Value(f(k)));
```

Or to implement a multi-value map,

Map<K,Collection<V>>

,
supporting multiple values per key:

```java
map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new HashSet<V>()).add(v);
```

The mapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation is equivalent to the following steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if now
absent:

```java
if (map.get(key) == null) {
V newValue = mappingFunction.apply(key);
if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
}
```

The default implementation makes no guarantees about detecting if the
mapping function modifies this map during computation and, if
appropriate, reporting an error. Non-concurrent implementations should
override this method and, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if it is detected that the
mapping function modifies this map during computation. Concurrent
implementations should override this method and, on a best-effort basis,
throw an

IllegalStateException

if it is detected that the
mapping function modifies this map during computation and as a result
computation would never complete.

The default implementation makes no guarantees about synchronization
or atomicity properties of this method. Any implementation providing
atomicity guarantees must override this method and document its
concurrency properties. In particular, all implementations of

is not present.
**Parameters:** key

**Parameters:** mappingFunction

- the mapping function to compute a value
**Returns:** the current (existing or computed) value associated with
the specified key, or null if the computed value is null
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and
this map does not support null keys, or the mappingFunction
is null
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

```java
default
V
computeIfPresent​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends

> remappingFunction)
```

If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to
compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the
exception is rethrown, and the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation is equivalent to performing the following
steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if now absent:

```java
if (map.get(key) != null) {
V oldValue = map.get(key);
V newValue = remappingFunction.apply(key, oldValue);
if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
else
map.remove(key);

- compute

```java
default
V
compute​(
K
key,

BiFunction
<? super
K
,​? super
V
,​? extends
V
> remappingFunction)
```

Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current
mapped value (or

null

if there is no current mapping). For
example, to either create or append a

String

msg to a value
mapping:

```java
map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? msg : v.concat(msg))
```

(Method

merge()

is often simpler to use for such purposes.)

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed
(or remains absent if initially absent). If the remapping function
itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception is rethrown, and
the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation is equivalent to performing the following
steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if absent:

map.put(key, newValue);
else
map.remove(key);

default
V
merge​(

```

If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is
associated with null, associates it with the given non-null value.
Otherwise, replaces the associated value with the results of the given
remapping function, or removes if the result is

null

. This
method may be of use when combining multiple mapped values for a key.
For example, to either create or append a

String msg

to a
value mapping:

```java
map.merge(key, msg, String::concat)
```

If the remapping function returns

null

, the mapping is removed.
If the remapping function itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the

- ofEntries

```java
@SafeVarargs

static <K,​V>
Map
<K,​V> ofEntries​(
Map.Entry
<? extends K,​? extends V>... entries)
```

Returns an unmodifiable map containing keys and values extracted from the given entries.
The entries themselves are not stored in the map.
See

Unmodifiable Maps

for details.

**API Note:** It is convenient to create the map entries using the

Map.entry()

method.
For example,

```java
import static java.util.Map.entry;

Map<Integer,String> map = Map.ofEntries(
entry(1, "a"),
entry(2, "b"),
entry(3, "c"),
...
entry(26, "z"));
```
**Type Parameters:** K

- the

Map

's key type
**Type Parameters:** V

- the

Map

's value type
**Parameters:** entries

-

Map.Entry

s containing the keys and values from which the map is populated
**Returns:** a

Map

containing the specified mappings
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if there are any duplicate keys
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any entry, key, or value is

null

, or if
the

entries

array is

null
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** Map.entry()

- entry

```java
static <K,​V>
Map.Entry
<K,​V> entry​(K k,
V v)
```

Returns an unmodifiable

Map.Entry

containing the given key and value.
These entries are suitable for populating

Map

instances using the

Map.ofEntries()

method.
The

Entry

instances created by this method have the following characteristics:

- They disallow

null

keys and values. Attempts to create them using a

null

key or value result in

NullPointerException

.

They are unmodifiable. Calls to

Entry.setValue()

on a returned

Entry

result in

UnsupportedOperationException

.

They are not serializable.

They are

value-based

.
Callers should make no assumptions about the identity of the returned instances.
This method is free to create new instances or reuse existing ones. Therefore,
identity-sensitive operations on these instances (reference equality (

==

),
identity hash code, and synchronization) are unreliable and should be avoided.

**API Note:** For a serializable

Entry

, see

AbstractMap.SimpleEntry

or

AbstractMap.SimpleImmutableEntry

.
**Type Parameters:** K

- the key's type
**Type Parameters:** V

- the value's type
**Parameters:** k

- the key
**Parameters:** v

- the value
**Returns:** an

Entry

containing the specified key and value
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the key or value is

null
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** Map.ofEntries()

- copyOf

```java
static <K,​V>
Map
<K,​V> copyOf​(
Map
<? extends K,​? extends V> map)
```

Returns an

unmodifiable Map

containing the entries
of the given Map. The given Map must not be null, and it must not contain any
null keys or values. If the given Map is subsequently modified, the returned
Map will not reflect such modifications.

**Implementation Note:** If the given Map is an

unmodifiable Map

,
calling copyOf will generally not create a copy.
**Type Parameters:** K

- the

Map

's key type
**Type Parameters:** V

- the

Map

's value type
**Parameters:** map

- a

Map

from which entries are drawn, must be non-null
**Returns:** a

Map

containing the entries of the given

Map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if map is null, or if it contains any null keys or values
**Since:** 10

specified map is modified while the operation is in progress.

**Parameters:** m

- mappings to be stored in this map
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

putAll

operation
is not supported by this map
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of a key or value in the
specified map prevents it from being stored in this map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified map is null, or if
this map does not permit null keys or values, and the
specified map contains null keys or values
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

---

#### putAll

void putAll​(

Map

<? extends

K

,​? extends

keySet

```java
Set
<
K
> keySet()
```

Returns a

Set

view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Returns:** a set view of the keys contained in this map

---

#### keySet

Set

values

```java
Collection
<
V
> values()
```

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

remove

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

remove

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not
support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

entrySet

```java
Set

view of the mappings contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation, or through the

**Implementation Requirements:** The default implementation is equivalent to performing the following
steps for this

map

, then returning the current value or

null

if absent:

```java
V oldValue = map.get(key);
V newValue = remappingFunction.apply(key, oldValue);
if (oldValue != null) {
if (newValue != null)
map.put(key, newValue);
else
map.remove(key);

map.put(key, newValue);
else
return null;
}
```

The default implementation makes no guarantees about detecting if the
remapping function modifies this map during computation and, if
appropriate, reporting an error. Non-concurrent implementations should
override this method and, on a best-effort basis, throw a

ConcurrentModificationException

if it is detected that the
remapping function modifies this map during computation. Concurrent
implementations should override this method and, on a best-effort basis,
throw an

IllegalStateException

if it is detected that the
remapping function modifies this map during computation and as a result
computation would never complete.

The default implementation makes no guarantees about synchronization
or atomicity properties of this method. Any implementation providing
atomicity guarantees must override this method and document its
concurrency properties. In particular, all implementations of

value is not present.

Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current
mapped value (or

```java
map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? msg : v.concat(msg))

is often simpler to use for such purposes.)

If the remapping function returns

itself throws an (unchecked) exception, the exception is rethrown, and
the current mapping is left unchanged.

The remapping function should not modify this map during computation.

<? extends K,​? extends V>... entries)
```

Returns an unmodifiable map containing keys and values extracted from the given entries.
The entries themselves are not stored in the map.
See

Unmodifiable Maps

for details.

**API Note:** It is convenient to create the map entries using the

Map.entry()

method.
For example,

```java
import static java.util.Map.entry;

Map<Integer,String> map = Map.ofEntries(
entry(1, "a"),
entry(2, "b"),
entry(3, "c"),
...
entry(26, "z"));
```
**Type Parameters:** K

- the

Map

's key type
**Type Parameters:** V

- the

Map

's value type
**Parameters:** entries

-

Map.Entry

s containing the keys and values from which the map is populated
**Returns:** a

Map

containing the specified mappings
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if there are any duplicate keys
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any entry, key, or value is

null

, or if
the

entries

array is

null
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** Map.entry()

#### ofEntries

@SafeVarargs

static <K,​V>

Map

<K,​V> ofEntries​(

Map.Entry

<? extends K,​? extends V>... entries)

Returns an unmodifiable map containing keys and values extracted from the given entries.
The entries themselves are not stored in the map.
See

Unmodifiable Maps

for details.

import static java.util.Map.entry;

Map<Integer,String> map = Map.ofEntries(
entry(1, "a"),
entry(2, "b"),
entry(3, "c"),
...
entry(26, "z"));

entry

```java
static <K,​V>
Map.Entry
<K,​V> entry​(K k,
V v)
```

Returns an unmodifiable

Map.Entry

containing the given key and value.
These entries are suitable for populating

Map

instances using the

Map.ofEntries()

method.
The

Entry

instances created by this method have the following characteristics:

- They disallow

null

keys and values. Attempts to create them using a

null

key or value result in

NullPointerException

.

They are unmodifiable. Calls to

Entry.setValue()

on a returned

Entry

result in

UnsupportedOperationException

.

They are not serializable.

They are

value-based

.
Callers should make no assumptions about the identity of the returned instances.
This method is free to create new instances or reuse existing ones. Therefore,
identity-sensitive operations on these instances (reference equality (

==

),
identity hash code, and synchronization) are unreliable and should be avoided.

**API Note:** For a serializable

Entry

, see

AbstractMap.SimpleEntry

or

AbstractMap.SimpleImmutableEntry

.
**Type Parameters:** K

- the key's type
**Type Parameters:** V

- the value's type
**Parameters:** k

- the key
**Parameters:** v

- the value
**Returns:** an

Entry

containing the specified key and value
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the key or value is

null
**Since:** 9
**See Also:** Map.ofEntries()

copyOf

```java
static <K,​V>
Map
<K,​V> copyOf​(
Map
<? extends K,​? extends V> map)
```

Returns an

unmodifiable Map

containing the entries
of the given Map. The given Map must not be null, and it must not contain any
null keys or values. If the given Map is subsequently modified, the returned
Map will not reflect such modifications.

**Implementation Note:** If the given Map is an

unmodifiable Map

,
calling copyOf will generally not create a copy.
**Type Parameters:** K

- the

Map

's key type
**Type Parameters:** V

- the

Map

's value type
**Parameters:** map

- a

Map

from which entries are drawn, must be non-null
**Returns:** a

Map

containing the entries of the given

Map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if map is null, or if it contains any null keys or values
**Since:** 10

#### copyOf

static <K,​V>

Map

<K,​V> copyOf​(

Map

<? extends K,​? extends V> map)

Returns an

unmodifiable Map

containing the entries
of the given Map. The given Map must not be null, and it must not contain any
null keys or values. If the given Map is subsequently modified, the returned
Map will not reflect such modifications.
