# Class JMXConnectorServerFactory

**Source:** `java.management\javax\management\remote\JMXConnectorServerFactory.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
JMXConnectorServerFactory

extends
Object
```

Factory to create JMX API connector servers. There
are no instances of this class.

Each connector server is created by an instance of

JMXConnectorServerProvider

. This instance is found as follows. Suppose
the given

JMXServiceURL

looks like

"service:jmx:

protocol

:

remainder

"

.
Then the factory will attempt to find the appropriate

JMXConnectorServerProvider

for

protocol

. Each
occurrence of the character

+

or

-

in

protocol

is replaced by

.

or

_

, respectively.

A

provider package list

is searched for as follows:

- If the

environment

parameter to

newJMXConnectorServer

contains the key

jmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs

then the associated
value is the provider package list.

Otherwise, if the system property

jmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs

exists, then its value
is the provider package list.

Otherwise, there is no provider package list.

The provider package list is a string that is interpreted as a
list of non-empty Java package names separated by vertical bars
(

|

). If the string is empty, then so is the provider
package list. If the provider package list is not a String, or if
it contains an element that is an empty string, a

JMXProviderException

is thrown.

If the provider package list exists and is not empty, then for
each element

pkg

of the list, the factory
will attempt to load the class

pkg

.

protocol

.ServerProvider

If the

environment

parameter to

newJMXConnectorServer

contains the key

jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader

then the
associated value is the class loader to use to load the provider.
If the associated value is not an instance of

ClassLoader

, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

If the

jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader

key is not present in the

environment

parameter, the
calling thread's context class loader is used.

If the attempt to load this class produces a

ClassNotFoundException

, the search for a handler continues with
the next element of the list.

Otherwise, a problem with the provider found is signalled by a

JMXProviderException

whose

cause

indicates the
underlying exception, as follows:

- if the attempt to load the class produces an exception other
than

ClassNotFoundException

, that is the

cause

;

if

Class.newInstance()

for the class produces an
exception, that is the

cause

.

If no provider is found by the above steps, including the
default case where there is no provider package list, then the
implementation will use its own provider for

protocol

, or it will throw a

MalformedURLException

if there is none. An
implementation may choose to find providers by other means. For
example, it may support

service providers

,
where the service interface is

JMXConnectorServerProvider

.

Every implementation must support the RMI connector protocol with
the default RMI transport, specified with string

rmi

.

Once a provider is found, the result of the

newJMXConnectorServer

method is the result of calling

newJMXConnectorServer

on the provider.

The

Map

parameter passed to the

JMXConnectorServerProvider

is a new read-only

Map

that contains all the entries that were in the

environment

parameter to

JMXConnectorServerFactory.newJMXConnectorServer

, if there was one.
Additionally, if the

jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader

key is not
present in the

environment

parameter, it is added to
the new read-only

Map

. The associated value is the
calling thread's context class loader.

**Since:** 1.5

### Method Details

#### public static
JMXConnectorServer
newJMXConnectorServer​(
JMXServiceURL
serviceURL,

Map
<
String
,​?> environment,

MBeanServer
mbeanServer)
throws
IOException

Creates a connector server at the given address. The
resultant server is not started until its

start

method is called.

**Parameters:**
- serviceURL

- the address of the new connector server. The
actual address of the new connector server, as returned by its

getAddress

method, will
not necessarily be exactly the same. For example, it might
include a port number if the original address did not.
- environment

- a set of attributes to control the new
connector server's behavior. This parameter can be null.
Keys in this map must be Strings. The appropriate type of each
associated value depends on the attribute. The contents of

environment

are not changed by this call.
- mbeanServer

- the MBean server that this connector server
is attached to. Null if this connector server will be attached
to an MBean server by being registered in it.

**Returns:**
- a

JMXConnectorServer

representing the new
connector server. Each successful call to this method produces
a different object.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

serviceURL

is null.
- IOException

- if the connector server cannot be made
because of a communication problem.
- MalformedURLException

- if there is no provider for the
protocol in

serviceURL

.
- JMXProviderException

- if there is a provider for the
protocol in

serviceURL

but it cannot be used for
some reason.
