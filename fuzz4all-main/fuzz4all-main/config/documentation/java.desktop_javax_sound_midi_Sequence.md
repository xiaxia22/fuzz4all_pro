# Class Sequence

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\sound\midi\Sequence.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Sequence

extends
Object
```

A

Sequence

is a data structure containing musical information (often
an entire song or composition) that can be played back by a

Sequencer

object. Specifically, the

Sequence

contains timing information and
one or more tracks. Each

track

consists of a series of MIDI
events (such as note-ons, note-offs, program changes, and meta-events). The
sequence's timing information specifies the type of unit that is used to
time-stamp the events in the sequence.

A

Sequence

can be created from a MIDI file by reading the file into
an input stream and invoking one of the

getSequence

methods of

MidiSystem

. A sequence can also be built from scratch by adding new

Tracks

to an empty

Sequence

, and adding

MidiEvent

objects to these

Tracks

.

### Constructor Details

#### public Sequence​(float divisionType,
int resolution)
throws
InvalidMidiDataException

Constructs a new MIDI sequence with the specified timing division type
and timing resolution. The division type must be one of the recognized
MIDI timing types. For tempo-based timing,

divisionType

is PPQ
(pulses per quarter note) and the resolution is specified in ticks per
beat. For SMTPE timing,

divisionType

specifies the number of
frames per second and the resolution is specified in ticks per frame. The
sequence will contain no initial tracks. Tracks may be added to or
removed from the sequence using

createTrack()

and

deleteTrack(javax.sound.midi.Track)

.

**Parameters:**
- divisionType

- the timing division type (PPQ or one of the SMPTE
types)
- resolution

- the timing resolution

**Throws:**
- InvalidMidiDataException

#### public Sequence​(float divisionType,
int resolution,
int numTracks)
throws
InvalidMidiDataException

Constructs a new MIDI sequence with the specified timing division type,
timing resolution, and number of tracks. The division type must be one of
the recognized MIDI timing types. For tempo-based timing,

divisionType

is PPQ (pulses per quarter note) and the resolution
is specified in ticks per beat. For SMTPE timing,

divisionType

specifies the number of frames per second and the resolution is specified
in ticks per frame. The sequence will be initialized with the number of
tracks specified by

numTracks

. These tracks are initially empty
(i.e. they contain only the meta-event End of Track). The tracks may be
retrieved for editing using the

getTracks()

method. Additional
tracks may be added, or existing tracks removed, using

createTrack()

and

deleteTrack(javax.sound.midi.Track)

.

**Parameters:**
- divisionType

- the timing division type (PPQ or one of the SMPTE
types)
- resolution

- the timing resolution

Constructs a new MIDI sequence with the specified timing division type,
timing resolution, and number of tracks. The division type must be one of
the recognized MIDI timing types. For tempo-based timing,

divisionType

is PPQ (pulses per quarter note) and the resolution
is specified in ticks per beat. For SMTPE timing,

divisionType

specifies the number of frames per second and the resolution is specified
in ticks per frame. The sequence will be initialized with the number of
tracks specified by

numTracks

. These tracks are initially empty
(i.e. they contain only the meta-event End of Track). The tracks may be
retrieved for editing using the

getTracks()

method. Additional
tracks may be added, or existing tracks removed, using

createTrack()

and

deleteTrack(javax.sound.midi.Track)

.

**Parameters:** divisionType

- the timing division type (PPQ or one of the SMPTE
