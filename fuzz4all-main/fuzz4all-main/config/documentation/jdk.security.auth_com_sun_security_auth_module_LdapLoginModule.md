# Class LdapLoginModule

**Source:** `jdk.security.auth\com\sun\security\auth\module\LdapLoginModule.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
LdapLoginModule

extends
Object

implements
LoginModule
```

This

LoginModule

performs LDAP-based authentication.
A username and password is verified against the corresponding user
credentials stored in an LDAP directory.
This module requires the supplied

CallbackHandler

to support a

NameCallback

and a

PasswordCallback

.
If authentication is successful then a new

LdapPrincipal

is created
using the user's distinguished name and a new

UserPrincipal

is
created using the user's username and both are associated
with the current

Subject

.

This module operates in one of three modes:

search-first

,

authentication-first

or

authentication-only

.
A mode is selected by specifying a particular set of options.

In search-first mode, the LDAP directory is searched to determine the
user's distinguished name and then authentication is attempted.
An (anonymous) search is performed using the supplied username in
conjunction with a specified search filter.
If successful then authentication is attempted using the user's
distinguished name and the supplied password.
To enable this mode, set the

userFilter

option and omit the

authIdentity

option.
Use search-first mode when the user's distinguished name is not
known in advance.

In authentication-first mode, authentication is attempted using the
supplied username and password and then the LDAP directory is searched.
If authentication is successful then a search is performed using the
supplied username in conjunction with a specified search filter.
To enable this mode, set the

authIdentity

and the

userFilter

options.
Use authentication-first mode when accessing an LDAP directory
that has been configured to disallow anonymous searches.

In authentication-only mode, authentication is attempted using the
supplied username and password. The LDAP directory is not searched because
the user's distinguished name is already known.
To enable this mode, set the

authIdentity

option to a valid
distinguished name and omit the

userFilter

option.
Use authentication-only mode when the user's distinguished name is
known in advance.

The following option is mandatory and must be specified in this
module's login

Configuration

:

**userProvider= ldap_urls:** This option identifies the LDAP directory that stores user entries.

ldap_urls

is a list of space-separated LDAP URLs
(

RFC 2255

)
that identifies the LDAP server to use and the position in
its directory tree where user entries are located.
When several LDAP URLs are specified then each is attempted,
in turn, until the first successful connection is established.
Spaces in the distinguished name component of the URL must be escaped
using the standard mechanism of percent character ('

%

')
followed by two hexadecimal digits (see

URI

).
Query components must also be omitted from the URL.

Automatic discovery of the LDAP server via DNS
(

RFC 2782

)
is supported (once DNS has been configured to support such a service).
It is enabled by omitting the hostname and port number components from
the LDAP URL.

This module also recognizes the following optional

Configuration

options:

**userFilter= ldap_filter:** This option specifies the search filter to use to locate a user's
entry in the LDAP directory. It is used to determine a user's
distinguished name.

ldap_filter

is an LDAP filter string
(

RFC 2254

).
If it contains the special token "

{USERNAME}

"
then that token will be replaced with the supplied username value
before the filter is used to search the directory.
**authIdentity= auth_id:** This option specifies the identity to use when authenticating a user
to the LDAP directory.

auth_id

may be an LDAP distinguished name string
(

RFC 2253

) or some
other string name.
It must contain the special token "

{USERNAME}

"
which will be replaced with the supplied username value before the
name is used for authentication.
Note that if this option does not contain a distinguished name then
the

userFilter

option must also be specified.
**authzIdentity= authz_id:** This option specifies an authorization identity for the user.

authz_id

is any string name.
If it comprises a single special token with curly braces then
that token is treated as a attribute name and will be replaced with a
single value of that attribute from the user's LDAP entry.
If the attribute cannot be found then the option is ignored.
When this option is supplied and the user has been successfully
authenticated then an additional

UserPrincipal

is created using the authorization identity and it is associated with
the current

Subject

.
**useSSL:** if

false

, this module does not establish an SSL connection
to the LDAP server before attempting authentication. SSL is used to
protect the privacy of the user's password because it is transmitted
in the clear over LDAP.
By default, this module uses SSL.
**useFirstPass:** if

true

, this module retrieves the username and password
from the module's shared state, using "javax.security.auth.login.name"
and "javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective keys. The
retrieved values are used for authentication. If authentication fails,
no attempt for a retry is made, and the failure is reported back to
the calling application.
**tryFirstPass:** if

true

, this module retrieves the username and password
from the module's shared state, using "javax.security.auth.login.name"
and "javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective keys. The
retrieved values are used for authentication. If authentication fails,
the module uses the

CallbackHandler

to retrieve a new username
and password, and another attempt to authenticate is made. If the
authentication fails, the failure is reported back to the calling
application.
**storePass:** if

true

, this module stores the username and password
obtained from the

CallbackHandler

in the module's shared state,
using
"javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective keys. This is
not performed if existing values already exist for the username and
password in the shared state, or if authentication fails.
**clearPass:** if

true

, this module clears the username and password
stored in the module's shared state after both phases of authentication
(login and commit) have completed.
**debug:** if

true

, debug messages are displayed on the standard
output stream.

Arbitrary

"JNDI properties"

may also be specified in the

Configuration

.
They are added to the environment and passed to the LDAP provider.
Note that the following four JNDI properties are set by this module directly
and are ignored if also present in the configuration:

- java.naming.provider.url

java.naming.security.principal

java.naming.security.credentials

java.naming.security.protocol

Three sample

Configuration

s are shown below.
The first one activates search-first mode. It identifies the LDAP server
and specifies that users' entries be located by their

uid

and

objectClass

attributes. It also specifies that an identity
based on the user's

employeeNumber

attribute should be created.
The second one activates authentication-first mode. It requests that the
LDAP server be located dynamically, that authentication be performed using
the supplied username directly but without the protection of SSL and that
users' entries be located by one of three naming attributes and their

objectClass

attribute.
The third one activates authentication-only mode. It identifies alternative
LDAP servers, it specifies the distinguished name to use for
authentication and a fixed identity to use for authorization. No directory
search is performed.

```java
ExampleApplication {
com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule REQUIRED
userProvider="ldap://ldap-svr/ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
userFilter="(&(uid={USERNAME})(objectClass=inetOrgPerson))"
authzIdentity="{EMPLOYEENUMBER}"
debug=true;
};

ExampleApplication {
com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule REQUIRED
userProvider="ldap:///cn=users,dc=example,dc=com"
authIdentity="{USERNAME}"
userFilter="(&(|(samAccountName={USERNAME})(userPrincipalName={USERNAME})(cn={USERNAME}))(objectClass=user))"
useSSL=false
debug=true;
};

ExampleApplication {
com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule REQUIRED
userProvider="ldap://ldap-svr1 ldap://ldap-svr2"
authIdentity="cn={USERNAME},ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
authzIdentity="staff"
debug=true;
};
```

**Note:** When a

SecurityManager

is active then an application
that creates a

LoginContext

and uses a

LoginModule

must be granted certain permissions.

If the application creates a login context using an

installed

Configuration

then the application must be granted the

AuthPermission

to create login contexts.
For example, the following security policy allows an application in
the user's current directory to instantiate

any

login context:

```java
grant codebase "file:${user.dir}/" {
permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "createLoginContext.*";
};
```

Alternatively, if the application creates a login context using a

caller-specified

Configuration

then the application
must be granted the permissions required by the

LoginModule

.

This

module requires the following two permissions:

- The

SocketPermission

to connect to an LDAP server.

The

AuthPermission

to modify the set of

Principal

s
associated with a

Subject

.

For example, the following security policy grants an application in the
user's current directory all the permissions required by this module:

```java
grant codebase "file:${user.dir}/" {
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:389", "connect";
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:636", "connect";
permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "modifyPrincipals";
};
```

debug=true;
};
```

**Note:** When a

SecurityManager

is active then an application
that creates a

LoginContext

and uses a

LoginModule

must be granted certain permissions.

If the application creates a login context using an

installed

Configuration

then the application must be granted the

AuthPermission

to create login contexts.
For example, the following security policy allows an application in
the user's current directory to instantiate

any

login context:

```java
grant codebase "file:${user.dir}/" {
permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "createLoginContext.*";
};
```

Alternatively, if the application creates a login context using a

caller-specified

Configuration

then the application
must be granted the permissions required by the

LoginModule

.

This

module requires the following two permissions:

- The

SocketPermission

to connect to an LDAP server.

The

AuthPermission

to modify the set of

Principal

s
associated with a

Subject

.

For example, the following security policy grants an application in the
user's current directory all the permissions required by this module:

```java
grant codebase "file:${user.dir}/" {
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:389", "connect";
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:636", "connect";
permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "modifyPrincipals";
};

**Note:** When a

SecurityManager

is active then an application
that creates a

LoginContext

and uses a

LoginModule

must be granted certain permissions.

If the application creates a login context using an

installed

Configuration

then the application must be granted the

AuthPermission

to create login contexts.
For example, the following security policy allows an application in
the user's current directory to instantiate

any

login context:

```java
grant codebase "file:${user.dir}/" {
permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "createLoginContext.*";
};
```

Alternatively, if the application creates a login context using a

caller-specified

Configuration

then the application
must be granted the permissions required by the

LoginModule

.

This

module requires the following two permissions:

- The

SocketPermission

to connect to an LDAP server.

The

AuthPermission

to modify the set of

Principal

s
associated with a

Subject

.

For example, the following security policy grants an application in the
user's current directory all the permissions required by this module:

```java
grant codebase "file:${user.dir}/" {
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:389", "connect";
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:636", "connect";
permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "modifyPrincipals";
};
```

This module operates in one of three modes:

search-first

,

authentication-first

or

authentication-only

.
A mode is selected by specifying a particular set of options.

In search-first mode, the LDAP directory is searched to determine the
user's distinguished name and then authentication is attempted.
An (anonymous) search is performed using the supplied username in
conjunction with a specified search filter.
If successful then authentication is attempted using the user's
distinguished name and the supplied password.
To enable this mode, set the

userFilter

option and omit the

authIdentity

option.
Use search-first mode when the user's distinguished name is not
known in advance.

In authentication-first mode, authentication is attempted using the
supplied username and password and then the LDAP directory is searched.
If authentication is successful then a search is performed using the
supplied username in conjunction with a specified search filter.
To enable this mode, set the

authIdentity

and the

userFilter

options.
Use authentication-first mode when accessing an LDAP directory
that has been configured to disallow anonymous searches.

In authentication-only mode, authentication is attempted using the
supplied username and password. The LDAP directory is not searched because
the user's distinguished name is already known.
To enable this mode, set the

authIdentity

option to a valid
distinguished name and omit the

userFilter

option.
Use authentication-only mode when the user's distinguished name is
known in advance.

The following option is mandatory and must be specified in this
module's login

Configuration

:

**userProvider= ldap_urls:** This option identifies the LDAP directory that stores user entries.

ldap_urls

is a list of space-separated LDAP URLs
(

RFC 2255

)
that identifies the LDAP server to use and the position in
its directory tree where user entries are located.
When several LDAP URLs are specified then each is attempted,
in turn, until the first successful connection is established.
Spaces in the distinguished name component of the URL must be escaped
using the standard mechanism of percent character ('

%

')
followed by two hexadecimal digits (see

URI

).
Query components must also be omitted from the URL.

Automatic discovery of the LDAP server via DNS
(

RFC 2782

)
is supported (once DNS has been configured to support such a service).
It is enabled by omitting the hostname and port number components from
the LDAP URL.

This module also recognizes the following optional

Configuration

options:

**userFilter= ldap_filter:** This option specifies the search filter to use to locate a user's
entry in the LDAP directory. It is used to determine a user's
distinguished name.

ldap_filter

is an LDAP filter string
(

RFC 2254

).
If it contains the special token "

{USERNAME}

"
then that token will be replaced with the supplied username value
before the filter is used to search the directory.
**authIdentity= auth_id:** This option specifies the identity to use when authenticating a user
to the LDAP directory.

auth_id

may be an LDAP distinguished name string
(

RFC 2253

) or some
other string name.
It must contain the special token "

{USERNAME}

"
which will be replaced with the supplied username value before the
name is used for authentication.
Note that if this option does not contain a distinguished name then
the

userFilter

option must also be specified.
**authzIdentity= authz_id:** This option specifies an authorization identity for the user.

authz_id

is any string name.
If it comprises a single special token with curly braces then
that token is treated as a attribute name and will be replaced with a
single value of that attribute from the user's LDAP entry.
If the attribute cannot be found then the option is ignored.
When this option is supplied and the user has been successfully
authenticated then an additional

UserPrincipal

is created using the authorization identity and it is associated with
the current

Subject

.
**useSSL:** if

false

, this module does not establish an SSL connection
to the LDAP server before attempting authentication. SSL is used to
protect the privacy of the user's password because it is transmitted
in the clear over LDAP.
By default, this module uses SSL.
**useFirstPass:** if

true

, this module retrieves the username and password
from the module's shared state, using "javax.security.auth.login.name"
and "javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective keys. The
retrieved values are used for authentication. If authentication fails,
no attempt for a retry is made, and the failure is reported back to
the calling application.
**tryFirstPass:** if

true

, this module retrieves the username and password
from the module's shared state, using "javax.security.auth.login.name"
and "javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective keys. The
retrieved values are used for authentication. If authentication fails,
the module uses the

CallbackHandler

to retrieve a new username
and password, and another attempt to authenticate is made. If the
authentication fails, the failure is reported back to the calling
application.
**storePass:** if

true

, this module stores the username and password
obtained from the

CallbackHandler

in the module's shared state,
using
"javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective keys. This is
not performed if existing values already exist for the username and
password in the shared state, or if authentication fails.
**clearPass:** if

true

, this module clears the username and password
stored in the module's shared state after both phases of authentication
(login and commit) have completed.
**debug:** if

true

, debug messages are displayed on the standard
output stream.

Arbitrary

"JNDI properties"

may also be specified in the

Configuration

.
They are added to the environment and passed to the LDAP provider.
Note that the following four JNDI properties are set by this module directly
and are ignored if also present in the configuration:

- java.naming.provider.url

java.naming.security.principal

java.naming.security.credentials

java.naming.security.protocol

Three sample

Configuration

s are shown below.
The first one activates search-first mode. It identifies the LDAP server
and specifies that users' entries be located by their

uid

and

objectClass

attributes. It also specifies that an identity
based on the user's

employeeNumber

attribute should be created.
The second one activates authentication-first mode. It requests that the
LDAP server be located dynamically, that authentication be performed using
the supplied username directly but without the protection of SSL and that
users' entries be located by one of three naming attributes and their

objectClass

attribute.
The third one activates authentication-only mode. It identifies alternative
LDAP servers, it specifies the distinguished name to use for
authentication and a fixed identity to use for authorization. No directory
search is performed.

```java
ExampleApplication {
com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule REQUIRED
userProvider="ldap://ldap-svr/ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
userFilter="(&(uid={USERNAME})(objectClass=inetOrgPerson))"
authzIdentity="{EMPLOYEENUMBER}"
debug=true;

protect the privacy of the user's password because it is transmitted
in the clear over LDAP.
By default, this module uses SSL.
**useFirstPass:** if

true

, this module retrieves the username and password
from the module's shared state, using "javax.security.auth.login.name"
and "javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective keys. The
retrieved values are used for authentication. If authentication fails,
no attempt for a retry is made, and the failure is reported back to
the calling application.

the module uses the

CallbackHandler

to retrieve a new username
and password, and another attempt to authenticate is made. If the
authentication fails, the failure is reported back to the calling
application.
**storePass:** if

true

, this module stores the username and password
obtained from the

Arbitrary

"JNDI properties"

may also be specified in the

Configuration

.
They are added to the environment and passed to the LDAP provider.
Note that the following four JNDI properties are set by this module directly
and are ignored if also present in the configuration:

- java.naming.provider.url

java.naming.security.principal

java.naming.security.credentials

java.naming.security.protocol

Three sample

Configuration

s are shown below.
The first one activates search-first mode. It identifies the LDAP server
and specifies that users' entries be located by their

uid

and

objectClass

attributes. It also specifies that an identity
based on the user's

employeeNumber

attribute should be created.
The second one activates authentication-first mode. It requests that the
LDAP server be located dynamically, that authentication be performed using
the supplied username directly but without the protection of SSL and that
users' entries be located by one of three naming attributes and their

objectClass

attribute.
The third one activates authentication-only mode. It identifies alternative
LDAP servers, it specifies the distinguished name to use for
authentication and a fixed identity to use for authorization. No directory
search is performed.

```java
ExampleApplication {
com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule REQUIRED
userProvider="ldap://ldap-svr/ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
userFilter="(&(uid={USERNAME})(objectClass=inetOrgPerson))"
authzIdentity="{EMPLOYEENUMBER}"
debug=true;
};

ExampleApplication {
com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule REQUIRED
userProvider="ldap:///cn=users,dc=example,dc=com"
authIdentity="{USERNAME}"
userFilter="(&(|(samAccountName={USERNAME})(userPrincipalName={USERNAME})(cn={USERNAME}))(objectClass=user))"
useSSL=false
debug=true;
};

ExampleApplication {
com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule REQUIRED
userProvider="ldap://ldap-svr1 ldap://ldap-svr2"
authIdentity="cn={USERNAME},ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
authzIdentity="staff"
debug=true;
};
```

**Note:** When a

SecurityManager

is active then an application
that creates a

LoginContext

and uses a

LoginModule

must be granted certain permissions.

If the application creates a login context using an

installed

Configuration

then the application must be granted the

AuthPermission

to create login contexts.
For example, the following security policy allows an application in
the user's current directory to instantiate

any

login context:

```java
grant codebase "file:${user.dir}/" {
permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "createLoginContext.*";
};
```

Alternatively, if the application creates a login context using a

caller-specified

Configuration

then the application
must be granted the permissions required by the

LoginModule

.

This

module requires the following two permissions:

- The

SocketPermission

to connect to an LDAP server.

The

AuthPermission

to modify the set of

Principal

s
associated with a

Subject

.

For example, the following security policy grants an application in the
user's current directory all the permissions required by this module:

```java
grant codebase "file:${user.dir}/" {
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:389", "connect";
permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:636", "connect";
permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "modifyPrincipals";
};
```

The following option is mandatory and must be specified in this
module's login

Configuration

:

**userProvider= ldap_urls:** This option identifies the LDAP directory that stores user entries.

ldap_urls

is a list of space-separated LDAP URLs
(

RFC 2255

)
that identifies the LDAP server to use and the position in
its directory tree where user entries are located.
When several LDAP URLs are specified then each is attempted,
in turn, until the first successful connection is established.
Spaces in the distinguished name component of the URL must be escaped
using the standard mechanism of percent character ('

%

')
followed by two hexadecimal digits (see

URI

).
Query components must also be omitted from the URL.

Automatic discovery of the LDAP server via DNS
(

RFC 2782

)
is supported (once DNS has been configured to support such a service).
It is enabled by omitting the hostname and port number components from
the LDAP URL.

This module also recognizes the following optional

Configuration

options:

**userFilter= ldap_filter:** This option specifies the search filter to use to locate a user's
entry in the LDAP directory. It is used to determine a user's
distinguished name.

ldap_filter

is an LDAP filter string
(

RFC 2254

).
If it contains the special token "

{USERNAME}

"
then that token will be replaced with the supplied username value
before the filter is used to search the directory.
**authIdentity= auth_id:** This option specifies the identity to use when authenticating a user
to the LDAP directory.

auth_id

may be an LDAP distinguished name string
(

RFC 2253

) or some
other string name.
It must contain the special token "

{USERNAME}

"
which will be replaced with the supplied username value before the
name is used for authentication.
Note that if this option does not contain a distinguished name then
the

userFilter

option must also be specified.
**authzIdentity= authz_id:** This option specifies an authorization identity for the user.

authz_id

is any string name.
If it comprises a single special token with curly braces then
that token is treated as a attribute name and will be replaced with a
single value of that attribute from the user's LDAP entry.
If the attribute cannot be found then the option is ignored.
When this option is supplied and the user has been successfully
authenticated then an additional

UserPrincipal

is created using the authorization identity and it is associated with
the current

Subject

.
**useSSL:** if

false

, this module does not establish an SSL connection
to the LDAP server before attempting authentication. SSL is used to
protect the privacy of the user's password because it is transmitted
in the clear over LDAP.
By default, this module uses SSL.

and "javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective keys. The
retrieved values are used for authentication. If authentication fails,
no attempt for a retry is made, and the failure is reported back to
the calling application.

in the module's shared state,
using
"javax.security.auth.login.name" and
"javax.security.auth.login.password" as the respective keys. This is
not performed if existing values already exist for the username and
password in the shared state, or if authentication fails.
**clearPass:** if

true

, this module clears the username and password
stored in the module's shared state after both phases of authentication
(login and commit) have completed.
**debug:** if

true

, debug messages are displayed on the standard
output stream.
