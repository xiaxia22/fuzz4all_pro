# Class AbstractMap<K,​V>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\AbstractMap.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
AbstractMap<K,​V>

extends
Object

implements
Map
<K,​V>
```

This class provides a skeletal implementation of the

Map

interface, to minimize the effort required to implement this interface.

To implement an unmodifiable map, the programmer needs only to extend this
class and provide an implementation for the

entrySet

method, which
returns a set-view of the map's mappings. Typically, the returned set
will, in turn, be implemented atop

AbstractSet

. This set should
not support the

add

or

remove

methods, and its iterator
should not support the

remove

method.

To implement a modifiable map, the programmer must additionally override
this class's

put

method (which otherwise throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

), and the iterator returned by

entrySet().iterator()

must additionally implement its

remove

method.

The programmer should generally provide a void (no argument) and map
constructor, as per the recommendation in the

Map

interface
specification.

The documentation for each non-abstract method in this class describes its
implementation in detail. Each of these methods may be overridden if the
map being implemented admits a more efficient implementation.

This class is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

**Type Parameters:** K

- the type of keys maintained by this map
**Type Parameters:** V

- the type of mapped values

---

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected AbstractMap()

Sole constructor. (For invocation by subclass constructors, typically
implicit.)

---

### Method Details

#### public int size()

Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map. If the
map contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

**Specified by:**
- size

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Returns:**
- the number of key-value mappings in this map

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation returns

entrySet().size()

.

---

#### public boolean isEmpty()

Returns

true

if this map contains no key-value mappings.

**Specified by:**
- isEmpty

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Returns:**
- true

if this map contains no key-value mappings

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation returns

size() == 0

.

---

#### public boolean containsValue​(
Object
value)

Returns

true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value. More formally, returns

true

if and only if
this map contains at least one mapping to a value

v

such that

Objects.equals(value, v)

. This operation
will probably require time linear in the map size for most
implementations of the

Map

interface.

**Specified by:**
- containsValue

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- value

- value whose presence in this map is to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the value is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified value is null and this
map does not permit null values
(

optional

)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

searching
for an entry with the specified value. If such an entry is found,

true

is returned. If the iteration terminates without
finding such an entry,

false

is returned. Note that this
implementation requires linear time in the size of the map.

---

#### public boolean containsKey​(
Object
key)

Returns

true

if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key. More formally, returns

true

if and only if
this map contains a mapping for a key

k

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

. (There can be
at most one such mapping.)

**Specified by:**
- containsKey

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- key

- key whose presence in this map is to be tested

**Returns:**
- true

if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

searching
for an entry with the specified key. If such an entry is found,

true

is returned. If the iteration terminates without
finding such an entry,

false

is returned. Note that this
implementation requires linear time in the size of the map; many
implementations will override this method.

---

#### public
V
get​(
Object
key)

Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key

k

to a value

v

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

,
then this method returns

v

; otherwise
it returns

null

. (There can be at most one such mapping.)

If this map permits null values, then a return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map
contains no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
explicitly maps the key to

null

. The

containsKey

operation may be used to distinguish these two cases.

**Specified by:**
- get

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- key

- the key whose associated value is to be returned

**Returns:**
- the value to which the specified key is mapped, or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

searching
for an entry with the specified key. If such an entry is found,
the entry's value is returned. If the iteration terminates without
finding such an entry,

null

is returned. Note that this
implementation requires linear time in the size of the map; many
implementations will override this method.

---

#### public
V
put​(
K
key,

V
value)

Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map
(optional operation). If the map previously contained a mapping for
the key, the old value is replaced by the specified value. (A map

m

is said to contain a mapping for a key

k

if and only
if

m.containsKey(k)

would return

true

.)

**Specified by:**
- put

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
- value

- value to be associated with the specified key

**Returns:**
- the previous value associated with

key

, or

null

if there was no mapping for

key

.
(A

null

return can also indicate that the map
previously associated

null

with

key

,
if the implementation supports

null

values.)

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

put

operation
is not supported by this map
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified key or value
prevents it from being stored in this map
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key or value is null
and this map does not permit null keys or values
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified key
or value prevents it from being stored in this map

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation always throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.

---

#### public
V
remove​(
Object
key)

Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present
(optional operation). More formally, if this map contains a mapping
from key

k

to value

v

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

, that mapping
is removed. (The map can contain at most one such mapping.)

Returns the value to which this map previously associated the key,
or

null

if the map contained no mapping for the key.

If this map permits null values, then a return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map
contained no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
explicitly mapped the key to

null

.

The map will not contain a mapping for the specified key once the
call returns.

**Specified by:**
- remove

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- key

- key whose mapping is to be removed from the map

**Returns:**
- the previous value associated with

key

, or

null

if there was no mapping for

key

.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

remove

operation
is not supported by this map
- ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this
map does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

searching for an
entry with the specified key. If such an entry is found, its value is
obtained with its

getValue

operation, the entry is removed
from the collection (and the backing map) with the iterator's

remove

operation, and the saved value is returned. If the
iteration terminates without finding such an entry,

null

is
returned. Note that this implementation requires linear time in the
size of the map; many implementations will override this method.

Note that this implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

if the

entrySet

iterator does not support the

remove

method and this map
contains a mapping for the specified key.

---

#### public void putAll​(
Map
<? extends
K
,​? extends
V
> m)

Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map
(optional operation). The effect of this call is equivalent to that
of calling

put(k, v)

on this map once
for each mapping from key

k

to value

v

in the
specified map. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the
specified map is modified while the operation is in progress.

**Specified by:**
- putAll

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Parameters:**
- m

- mappings to be stored in this map

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

putAll

operation
is not supported by this map
- ClassCastException

- if the class of a key or value in the
specified map prevents it from being stored in this map
- NullPointerException

- if the specified map is null, or if
this map does not permit null keys or values, and the
specified map contains null keys or values
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of a key or value in
the specified map prevents it from being stored in this map

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation iterates over the specified map's

entrySet()

collection, and calls this map's

put

operation once for each entry returned by the iteration.

Note that this implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

if this map does not support
the

put

operation and the specified map is nonempty.

---

#### public void clear()

Removes all of the mappings from this map (optional operation).
The map will be empty after this call returns.

**Specified by:**
- clear

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

clear

operation
is not supported by this map

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation calls

entrySet().clear()

.

Note that this implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

if the

entrySet

does not support the

clear

operation.

---

#### public
Set
<
K
> keySet()

Returns a

Set

view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Specified by:**
- keySet

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Returns:**
- a set view of the keys contained in this map

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation returns a set that subclasses

AbstractSet

.
The subclass's iterator method returns a "wrapper object" over this
map's

entrySet()

iterator. The

size

method
delegates to this map's

size

method and the

contains

method delegates to this map's

containsKey

method.

The set is created the first time this method is called,
and returned in response to all subsequent calls. No synchronization
is performed, so there is a slight chance that multiple calls to this
method will not all return the same set.

---

#### public
Collection
<
V
> values()

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

remove

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not
support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Specified by:**
- values

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Returns:**
- a collection view of the values contained in this map

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation returns a collection that subclasses

AbstractCollection

. The subclass's iterator method returns a
"wrapper object" over this map's

entrySet()

iterator.
The

size

method delegates to this map's

size

method and the

contains

method delegates to this map's

containsValue

method.

The collection is created the first time this method is called, and
returned in response to all subsequent calls. No synchronization is
performed, so there is a slight chance that multiple calls to this
method will not all return the same collection.

---

#### public boolean equals​(
Object
o)

Compares the specified object with this map for equality. Returns

true

if the given object is also a map and the two maps
represent the same mappings. More formally, two maps

m1

and

m2

represent the same mappings if

m1.entrySet().equals(m2.entrySet())

. This ensures that the

equals

method works properly across different implementations
of the

Map

interface.

**Specified by:**
- equals

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Overrides:**
- equals

in class

Object

**Parameters:**
- o

- object to be compared for equality with this map

**Returns:**
- true

if the specified object is equal to this map

**See Also:**
- Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation first checks if the specified object is this map;
if so it returns

true

. Then, it checks if the specified
object is a map whose size is identical to the size of this map; if
not, it returns

false

. If so, it iterates over this map's

entrySet

collection, and checks that the specified map
contains each mapping that this map contains. If the specified map
fails to contain such a mapping,

false

is returned. If the
iteration completes,

true

is returned.

---

#### public int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this map. The hash code of a map is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's

entrySet()

view. This ensures that

m1.equals(m2)

implies that

m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()

for any two maps

m1

and

m2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

**Specified by:**
- hashCode

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>

**Overrides:**
- hashCode

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- the hash code value for this map

**See Also:**
- Map.Entry.hashCode()

,

Object.equals(Object)

,

Set.equals(Object)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

, calling

hashCode()

on each element (entry) in the
set, and adding up the results.

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string representation of this map. The string representation
consists of a list of key-value mappings in the order returned by the
map's

entrySet

view's iterator, enclosed in braces
(

"{}"

). Adjacent mappings are separated by the characters

", "

(comma and space). Each key-value mapping is rendered as
the key followed by an equals sign (

"="

) followed by the
associated value. Keys and values are converted to strings as by

String.valueOf(Object)

.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this map

---

#### protected
Object
clone()
throws
CloneNotSupportedException

Returns a shallow copy of this

AbstractMap

instance: the keys
and values themselves are not cloned.

**Overrides:**
- clone

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a shallow copy of this map

**Throws:**
- CloneNotSupportedException

- if the object's class does not
support the

Cloneable

interface. Subclasses
that override the

clone

method can also
throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
be cloned.

**See Also:**
- Cloneable

implicit.)

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- size

```java
public int size()
```

Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map. If the
map contains more than

Integer.MAX_VALUE

elements, returns

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

**Specified by:** size

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation returns

entrySet().size()

.
**Returns:** the number of key-value mappings in this map

- isEmpty

```java
public boolean isEmpty()
```

Returns

true

if this map contains no key-value mappings.

**Specified by:** isEmpty

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation returns

size() == 0

.
**Returns:** true

if this map contains no key-value mappings

- containsValue

```java
public boolean containsValue​(
Object
value)
```

Returns

true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value. More formally, returns

true

if and only if
this map contains at least one mapping to a value

v

such that

Objects.equals(value, v)

. This operation
will probably require time linear in the map size for most
implementations of the

Map

interface.

**Specified by:** containsValue

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

searching
for an entry with the specified value. If such an entry is found,

true

is returned. If the iteration terminates without
finding such an entry,

false

is returned. Note that this
implementation requires linear time in the size of the map.
**Parameters:** value

- value whose presence in this map is to be tested
**Returns:** true

if this map maps one or more keys to the
specified value
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the value is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified value is null and this
map does not permit null values
(

optional

)

- containsKey

```java
public boolean containsKey​(
Object
key)
```

Returns

true

if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key. More formally, returns

true

if and only if
this map contains a mapping for a key

k

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

. (There can be
at most one such mapping.)

**Specified by:** containsKey

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

searching
for an entry with the specified key. If such an entry is found,

true

is returned. If the iteration terminates without
finding such an entry,

false

is returned. Note that this
implementation requires linear time in the size of the map; many
implementations will override this method.
**Parameters:** key

- key whose presence in this map is to be tested
**Returns:** true

if this map contains a mapping for the specified
key
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

- get

```java
public
V
get​(
Object
key)
```

Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key.

More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key

k

to a value

v

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

,
then this method returns

v

; otherwise
it returns

null

. (There can be at most one such mapping.)

If this map permits null values, then a return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map
contains no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
explicitly maps the key to

null

. The

containsKey

operation may be used to distinguish these two cases.

**Specified by:** get

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

searching
for an entry with the specified key. If such an entry is found,
the entry's value is returned. If the iteration terminates without
finding such an entry,

null

is returned. Note that this
implementation requires linear time in the size of the map; many
implementations will override this method.
**Parameters:** key

- the key whose associated value is to be returned
**Returns:** the value to which the specified key is mapped, or

null

if this map contains no mapping for the key
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this map
does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

- put

```java
public
V
put​(
K
key,

V
value)
```

Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map
(optional operation). If the map previously contained a mapping for
the key, the old value is replaced by the specified value. (A map

m

is said to contain a mapping for a key

k

if and only
if

m.containsKey(k)

would return

true

.)

**Specified by:** put

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation always throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

.
**Parameters:** key

- key with which the specified value is to be associated
**Parameters:** value

- value to be associated with the specified key
**Returns:** the previous value associated with

key

, or

null

if there was no mapping for

key

.
(A

null

return can also indicate that the map
previously associated

null

with

key

,
if the implementation supports

null

values.)
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

put

operation
is not supported by this map
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified key or value
prevents it from being stored in this map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key or value is null
and this map does not permit null keys or values
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified key
or value prevents it from being stored in this map

- remove

```java
public
V
remove​(
Object
key)
```

Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present
(optional operation). More formally, if this map contains a mapping
from key

k

to value

v

such that

Objects.equals(key, k)

, that mapping
is removed. (The map can contain at most one such mapping.)

Returns the value to which this map previously associated the key,
or

null

if the map contained no mapping for the key.

If this map permits null values, then a return value of

null

does not

necessarily

indicate that the map
contained no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
explicitly mapped the key to

null

.

The map will not contain a mapping for the specified key once the
call returns.

**Specified by:** remove

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

searching for an
entry with the specified key. If such an entry is found, its value is
obtained with its

getValue

operation, the entry is removed
from the collection (and the backing map) with the iterator's

remove

operation, and the saved value is returned. If the
iteration terminates without finding such an entry,

null

is
returned. Note that this implementation requires linear time in the
size of the map; many implementations will override this method.

Note that this implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

if the

entrySet

iterator does not support the

remove

method and this map
contains a mapping for the specified key.
**Parameters:** key

- key whose mapping is to be removed from the map
**Returns:** the previous value associated with

key

, or

null

if there was no mapping for

key

.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

remove

operation
is not supported by this map
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the key is of an inappropriate type for
this map
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified key is null and this
map does not permit null keys
(

optional

)

- putAll

```java
public void putAll​(
Map
<? extends
K
,​? extends
V
> m)
```

Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map
(optional operation). The effect of this call is equivalent to that
of calling

put(k, v)

on this map once
for each mapping from key

k

to value

v

in the
specified map. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the
specified map is modified while the operation is in progress.

**Specified by:** putAll

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation iterates over the specified map's

entrySet()

collection, and calls this map's

put

operation once for each entry returned by the iteration.

Note that this implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

if this map does not support
the

put

operation and the specified map is nonempty.
**Parameters:** m

- mappings to be stored in this map
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

putAll

operation
is not supported by this map
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of a key or value in the
specified map prevents it from being stored in this map
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified map is null, or if
this map does not permit null keys or values, and the
specified map contains null keys or values
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of a key or value in
the specified map prevents it from being stored in this map

- clear

```java
public void clear()
```

Removes all of the mappings from this map (optional operation).
The map will be empty after this call returns.

**Specified by:** clear

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation calls

entrySet().clear()

.

Note that this implementation throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

if the

entrySet

does not support the

clear

operation.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if the

clear

operation
is not supported by this map

- keySet

```java
public
Set
<
K
> keySet()
```

Returns a

Set

view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Set.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

, and

clear

operations. It does not support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Specified by:** keySet

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation returns a set that subclasses

AbstractSet

.
The subclass's iterator method returns a "wrapper object" over this
map's

entrySet()

iterator. The

size

method
delegates to this map's

size

method and the

contains

method delegates to this map's

containsKey

method.

The set is created the first time this method is called,
and returned in response to all subsequent calls. No synchronization
is performed, so there is a slight chance that multiple calls to this
method will not all return the same set.
**Returns:** a set view of the keys contained in this map

- values

```java
public
Collection
<
V
> values()
```

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

remove

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

,

Collection.remove

,

removeAll

,

retainAll

and

clear

operations. It does not
support the

add

or

addAll

operations.

**Specified by:** values

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation returns a collection that subclasses

AbstractCollection

. The subclass's iterator method returns a
"wrapper object" over this map's

entrySet()

iterator.
The

size

method delegates to this map's

size

method and the

contains

method delegates to this map's

containsValue

method.

The collection is created the first time this method is called, and
returned in response to all subsequent calls. No synchronization is
performed, so there is a slight chance that multiple calls to this
method will not all return the same collection.
**Returns:** a collection view of the values contained in this map

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Compares the specified object with this map for equality. Returns

true

if the given object is also a map and the two maps
represent the same mappings. More formally, two maps

m1

and

m2

represent the same mappings if

m1.entrySet().equals(m2.entrySet())

. This ensures that the

equals

method works properly across different implementations
of the

Map

interface.

**Specified by:** equals

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation first checks if the specified object is this map;
if so it returns

true

. Then, it checks if the specified
object is a map whose size is identical to the size of this map; if
not, it returns

false

. If so, it iterates over this map's

entrySet

collection, and checks that the specified map
contains each mapping that this map contains. If the specified map
fails to contain such a mapping,

false

is returned. If the
iteration completes,

true

is returned.
**Parameters:** o

- object to be compared for equality with this map
**Returns:** true

if the specified object is equal to this map
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this map. The hash code of a map is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's

entrySet()

view. This ensures that

m1.equals(m2)

implies that

m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()

for any two maps

m1

and

m2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

**Specified by:** hashCode

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

V

>
**Overrides:** hashCode

in class

Object
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

, calling

hashCode()

on each element (entry) in the
set, and adding up the results.
**Returns:** the hash code value for this map
**See Also:** Map.Entry.hashCode()

,

Object.equals(Object)

,

Set.equals(Object)

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this map. The string representation
consists of a list of key-value mappings in the order returned by the
map's

entrySet

view's iterator, enclosed in braces
(

"{}"

). Adjacent mappings are separated by the characters

", "

(comma and space). Each key-value mapping is rendered as
the key followed by an equals sign (

"="

) followed by the
associated value. Keys and values are converted to strings as by

String.valueOf(Object)

.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of this map

- clone

```java
protected
Object
clone()
throws
CloneNotSupportedException
```

Returns a shallow copy of this

AbstractMap

instance: the keys
and values themselves are not cloned.

**Overrides:** clone

in class

Object
**Returns:** a shallow copy of this map
**Throws:** CloneNotSupportedException

- if the object's class does not
support the

Cloneable

interface. Subclasses
that override the

clone

method can also
throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
be cloned.

- keySet

```java
public
Set
<
K

```

Returns a

Set

view of the keys contained in this map.
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified
while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
the iterator's own

remove

operation), the results of
the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal,
which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the

Iterator.remove

operations. It does not support the

add

or

**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation returns a set that subclasses

AbstractSet

.
The subclass's iterator method returns a "wrapper object" over this
map's

entrySet()

iterator. The

size

method
delegates to this map's

size

method and the

contains

method delegates to this map's

containsKey

method.

The set is created the first time this method is called,
and returned in response to all subsequent calls. No synchronization
is performed, so there is a slight chance that multiple calls to this
method will not all return the same set.
**Returns:** a set view of the keys contained in this map

- values

```java
public
Collection
<
V

```

Returns a

Collection

view of the values contained in this map.
The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is
modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
(except through the iterator's own

operation),
the results of the iteration are undefined. The collection
supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
mapping from the map, via the

**Returns:** a collection view of the values contained in this map

- equals

```java
public boolean equals​(
Object
o)
```

Compares the specified object with this map for equality. Returns

true

if the given object is also a map and the two maps
represent the same mappings. More formally, two maps

m1

and

m2

represent the same mappings if

m1.entrySet().equals(m2.entrySet())

. This ensures that the

equals

method works properly across different implementations
of the

Map

interface.

**Specified by:** equals

in interface

Map

<

K

,​

>
**Overrides:** equals

in class

Object
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation first checks if the specified object is this map;
if so it returns

true

. Then, it checks if the specified
object is a map whose size is identical to the size of this map; if
not, it returns

false

. If so, it iterates over this map's

entrySet

collection, and checks that the specified map
contains each mapping that this map contains. If the specified map
fails to contain such a mapping,

false

is returned. If the
iteration completes,

true

is returned.
**Parameters:** o

- object to be compared for equality with this map
**Returns:** true

if the specified object is equal to this map
**See Also:** Object.hashCode()

,

HashMap

- hashCode

```java
public int hashCode()
```

Returns the hash code value for this map. The hash code of a map is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's

entrySet()

view. This ensures that

m1.equals(m2)

implies that

m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()

for any two maps

m1

and

m2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

**Specified by:** hashCode

**See Also:** Map.Entry.hashCode()

,

Object.equals(Object)

,

Set.equals(Object)

- toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this map. The string representation
consists of a list of key-value mappings in the order returned by the
map's

entrySet

view's iterator, enclosed in braces
(

"{}"

). Adjacent mappings are separated by the characters

", "

(comma and space). Each key-value mapping is rendered as
the key followed by an equals sign (

"="

) followed by the
associated value. Keys and values are converted to strings as by

String.valueOf(Object)

.

**Overrides:** toString

in class

Object
**Returns:** a string representation of this map

- clone

```java
protected
Object
clone()
throws
CloneNotSupportedException
```

Returns a shallow copy of this

AbstractMap

instance: the keys
and values themselves are not cloned.

**Overrides:** clone

in class

Object
**Returns:** a shallow copy of this map
**Throws:** CloneNotSupportedException

- if the object's class does not
support the

Cloneable

interface. Subclasses
that override the

clone

method can also
throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
be cloned.

Object
**Implementation Requirements:** This implementation iterates over

entrySet()

, calling

hashCode()

on each element (entry) in the
set, and adding up the results.
**Returns:** the hash code value for this map
**See Also:** Map.Entry.hashCode()

,

Object.equals(Object)

,

Set.equals(Object)

---

#### hashCode

public int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this map. The hash code of a map is
defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's

entrySet()

view. This ensures that

m1.equals(m2)

implies that

m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()

for any two maps

m1

and

m2

, as required by the general contract of

Object.hashCode()

.

toString

```java
public
String
toString()
```

Returns a string representation of this map. The string representation
consists of a list of key-value mappings in the order returned by the
map's

entrySet

view's iterator, enclosed in braces
(

"{}"

). Adjacent mappings are separated by the characters

", "

(comma and space). Each key-value mapping is rendered as
the key followed by an equals sign (

"="

) followed by the
associated value. Keys and values are converted to strings as by

String.valueOf(Object)

.
