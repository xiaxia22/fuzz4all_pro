# Interface BlockingQueue<E>

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\concurrent\BlockingQueue.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
BlockingQueue<E>

extends
Queue
<E>
```

A

Queue

that additionally supports operations that wait for
the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait
for space to become available in the queue when storing an element.

BlockingQueue

methods come in four forms, with different ways
of handling operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be
satisfied at some point in the future:
one throws an exception, the second returns a special value (either

null

or

false

, depending on the operation), the third
blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed,
and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving
up. These methods are summarized in the following table:

A

BlockingQueue

does not accept

elements.
Implementations throw

NullPointerException

on attempts
to

add

,

put

or

offer

a

null

. A

null

is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of

poll

operations.

A

BlockingQueue

may be capacity bounded. At any given
time it may have a

remainingCapacity

beyond which no
additional elements can be

put

without blocking.
A

BlockingQueue

without any intrinsic capacity constraints always
reports a remaining capacity of

Integer.MAX_VALUE

.

BlockingQueue

implementations are designed to be used
primarily for producer-consumer queues, but additionally support
the

Collection

interface. So, for example, it is
possible to remove an arbitrary element from a queue using

remove(x)

. However, such operations are in general

not

performed very efficiently, and are intended for only
occasional use, such as when a queued message is cancelled.

BlockingQueue

implementations are thread-safe. All
queuing methods achieve their effects atomically using internal
locks or other forms of concurrency control. However, the

bulk

Collection operations

addAll

,

containsAll

,

retainAll

and

removeAll

are

not

necessarily performed atomically unless specified
otherwise in an implementation. So it is possible, for example, for

addAll(c)

to fail (throwing an exception) after adding
only some of the elements in

c

.

A

BlockingQueue

does

not

intrinsically support
any kind of "close" or "shutdown" operation to
indicate that no more items will be added. The needs and usage of
such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For example, a
common tactic is for producers to insert special

end-of-stream

or

poison

objects, that are
interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.

Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario.
Note that a

BlockingQueue

can safely be used with multiple
producers and multiple consumers.

```java
class Producer implements Runnable {
private final BlockingQueue queue;
Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
public void run() {
try {
while (true) { queue.put(produce()); }
} catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
}
Object produce() { ... }
}

class Consumer implements Runnable {
private final BlockingQueue queue;
Consumer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
public void run() {
try {
while (true) { consume(queue.take()); }
} catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
}
void consume(Object x) { ... }
}

class Setup {
void main() {
BlockingQueue q = new SomeQueueImplementation();
Producer p = new Producer(q);
Consumer c1 = new Consumer(q);
Consumer c2 = new Consumer(q);
new Thread(p).start();
new Thread(c1).start();
new Thread(c2).start();
}
}
```

Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent
collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a

BlockingQueue

happen-before

actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
the

BlockingQueue

in another thread.

This interface is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

**Type Parameters:** E

- the type of elements held in this queue

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### boolean add​(
E
e)

Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do
so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning

true

upon success and throwing an

IllegalStateException

if no space is currently available.
When using a capacity-restricted queue, it is generally preferable to
use

offer

.

**Specified by:**
- add

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
- add

in interface

Queue

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- e

- the element to add

**Returns:**
- true

(as specified by

Collection.add(E)

)

**Throws:**

- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified
element prevents it from being added to this queue

---

#### boolean offer​(
E
e)

Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do
so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning

true

upon success and

false

if no space is currently
available. When using a capacity-restricted queue, this method is
generally preferable to

add(E)

, which can fail to insert an
element only by throwing an exception.

**Specified by:**

prevents it from being added to this queue
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified
element prevents it from being added to this queue

---

#### void put​(
E
e)
throws
InterruptedException

Inserts the specified element into this queue, waiting if necessary
for space to become available.

- the element to add

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if interrupted while waiting
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this queue
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified
element prevents it from being added to this queue

---

#### boolean offer​(
E
e,
long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException

Inserts the specified element into this queue, waiting up to the
specified wait time if necessary for space to become available.

**Parameters:**
- e

- the element to add
- timeout

- how long to wait before giving up, in units of

unit
- unit

- a

TimeUnit

determining how to interpret the

timeout

parameter

**Returns:**
- true

if successful, or

false

if
the specified waiting time elapses before space is available

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if interrupted while waiting
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this queue
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified
element prevents it from being added to this queue

---

#### E
take()
throws
InterruptedException

Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, waiting if necessary
until an element becomes available.

**Returns:**
- the head of this queue

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if interrupted while waiting

---

#### E
poll​(long timeout,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException

Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, waiting up to the
specified wait time if necessary for an element to become available.

**Parameters:**
- timeout

- how long to wait before giving up, in units of

unit
- unit

- a

TimeUnit

determining how to interpret the

timeout

parameter

**Returns:**
- the head of this queue, or

null

if the
specified waiting time elapses before an element is available

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if interrupted while waiting

---

#### int remainingCapacity()

Returns the number of additional elements that this queue can ideally
(in the absence of memory or resource constraints) accept without
blocking, or

Integer.MAX_VALUE

if there is no intrinsic
limit.

Note that you

cannot

always tell if an attempt to insert
an element will succeed by inspecting

remainingCapacity

because it may be the case that another thread is about to
insert or remove an element.

**Returns:**
- the remaining capacity

---

#### boolean remove​(
Object
o)

Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue,
if it is present. More formally, removes an element

e

such
that

o.equals(e)

, if this queue contains one or more such
elements.
Returns

true

if this queue contained the specified element
(or equivalently, if this queue changed as a result of the call).

**Specified by:**
- remove

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- o

- element to be removed from this queue, if present

**Returns:**
- true

if this queue changed as a result of the call

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
is incompatible with this queue
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null
(

optional

)

---

#### boolean contains​(
Object
o)

Returns

true

if this queue contains the specified element.
More formally, returns

true

if and only if this queue contains
at least one element

e

such that

o.equals(e)

.

**Specified by:**
- contains

in interface

Collection

<

E

>

**Parameters:**
- o

- object to be checked for containment in this queue

**Returns:**
- true

if this queue contains the specified element

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
is incompatible with this queue
(

optional

)
- NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null
(

optional

)

---

#### int drainTo​(
Collection
<? super
E
> c)

Removes all available elements from this queue and adds them
to the given collection. This operation may be more
efficient than repeatedly polling this queue. A failure
encountered while attempting to add elements to
collection

c

may result in elements being in neither,
either or both collections when the associated exception is
thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in

IllegalArgumentException

. Further, the behavior of
this operation is undefined if the specified collection is
modified while the operation is in progress.

**Parameters:**
- c

- the collection to transfer elements into

**Returns:**
- the number of elements transferred

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if addition of elements
is not supported by the specified collection
- ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this queue
prevents it from being added to the specified collection
- NullPointerException

- if the specified collection is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified collection is this
queue, or some property of an element of this queue prevents
it from being added to the specified collection

---

#### int drainTo​(
Collection
<? super
E
> c,
int maxElements)

Removes at most the given number of available elements from
this queue and adds them to the given collection. A failure
encountered while attempting to add elements to
collection

c

may result in elements being in neither,
either or both collections when the associated exception is
thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in

IllegalArgumentException

. Further, the behavior of
this operation is undefined if the specified collection is
modified while the operation is in progress.

**Parameters:**
- c

- the collection to transfer elements into
- maxElements

- the maximum number of elements to transfer

**Returns:**
- the number of elements transferred

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if addition of elements
is not supported by the specified collection
- ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this queue
prevents it from being added to the specified collection
- NullPointerException

- if the specified collection is null
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified collection is this
queue, or some property of an element of this queue prevents
it from being added to the specified collection

any kind of "close" or "shutdown" operation to
indicate that no more items will be added. The needs and usage of
such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For example, a
common tactic is for producers to insert special

end-of-stream

or

poison

objects, that are
interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.

Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario.
Note that a

BlockingQueue

can safely be used with multiple
producers and multiple consumers.

```java
class Producer implements Runnable {
private final BlockingQueue queue;
Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
public void run() {
try {
while (true) { queue.put(produce()); }
} catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
}
Object produce() { ... }
}

class Consumer implements Runnable {
private final BlockingQueue queue;
Consumer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
public void run() {
try {
while (true) { consume(queue.take()); }
} catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
}
void consume(Object x) { ... }
}

class Setup {
void main() {
BlockingQueue q = new SomeQueueImplementation();
Producer p = new Producer(q);
Consumer c1 = new Consumer(q);
Consumer c2 = new Consumer(q);
new Thread(p).start();
new Thread(c1).start();
new Thread(c2).start();
}
}
```

Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent
collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a

BlockingQueue

happen-before

actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
the

BlockingQueue

in another thread.

This interface is a member of the

Java Collections Framework

.

BlockingQueue

implementations are designed to be used
primarily for producer-consumer queues, but additionally support
the

Collection

interface. So, for example, it is
possible to remove an arbitrary element from a queue using

remove(x)

. However, such operations are in general

not

performed very efficiently, and are intended for only
occasional use, such as when a queued message is cancelled.

BlockingQueue

implementations are thread-safe. All
queuing methods achieve their effects atomically using internal
locks or other forms of concurrency control. However, the

bulk

Collection operations

addAll

,

containsAll

,

retainAll

and

removeAll

are

not

necessarily performed atomically unless specified
otherwise in an implementation. So it is possible, for example, for

addAll(c)

to fail (throwing an exception) after adding
only some of the elements in

c

.

if no space is currently available.
When using a capacity-restricted queue, it is generally preferable to
use

offer

.

**Specified by:** add

in interface

Collection

<

E

element prevents it from being added to this queue

- offer

```java
boolean offer​(
E
e)
```

Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do
so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning

true

upon success and

false

if no space is currently
available. When using a capacity-restricted queue, this method is
generally preferable to

add(E)

, which can fail to insert an
element only by throwing an exception.

**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
prevents it from being added to this queue
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if some property of the specified
element prevents it from being added to this queue

```

Returns the number of additional elements that this queue can ideally
(in the absence of memory or resource constraints) accept without
blocking, or

Integer.MAX_VALUE

if there is no intrinsic
limit.

Note that you

cannot

always tell if an attempt to insert
an element will succeed by inspecting

remainingCapacity

because it may be the case that another thread is about to
insert or remove an element.

**Returns:** the remaining capacity

- remove

```java
boolean remove​(
Object
o)
```

Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue,
if it is present. More formally, removes an element

e

such
that

o.equals(e)

, if this queue contains one or more such
elements.
Returns

true

if this queue contained the specified element
(or equivalently, if this queue changed as a result of the call).

**Specified by:** remove

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** o

- element to be removed from this queue, if present
**Returns:** true

if this queue changed as a result of the call
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of the specified element
is incompatible with this queue
(

optional

)
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified element is null
(

optional

)

- contains

```java
boolean contains​(
Object
o)
```

optional

)

- drainTo

```java
int drainTo​(
Collection
<? super
E
> c)
```

Removes all available elements from this queue and adds them
to the given collection. This operation may be more
efficient than repeatedly polling this queue. A failure
encountered while attempting to add elements to
collection

c

may result in elements being in neither,
either or both collections when the associated exception is
thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in

IllegalArgumentException

. Further, the behavior of
this operation is undefined if the specified collection is
modified while the operation is in progress.

**Parameters:** c

- the collection to transfer elements into
**Returns:** the number of elements transferred
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if addition of elements
is not supported by the specified collection
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this queue
prevents it from being added to the specified collection
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified collection is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified collection is this
queue, or some property of an element of this queue prevents
it from being added to the specified collection

- drainTo

```java
int drainTo​(
Collection
<? super
E
> c,
int maxElements)
```

Removes at most the given number of available elements from
this queue and adds them to the given collection. A failure
encountered while attempting to add elements to
collection

c

may result in elements being in neither,
either or both collections when the associated exception is
thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in

IllegalArgumentException

. Further, the behavior of
this operation is undefined if the specified collection is
modified while the operation is in progress.

**Parameters:** c

- the collection to transfer elements into
**Parameters:** maxElements

- the maximum number of elements to transfer
**Returns:** the number of elements transferred
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if addition of elements
is not supported by the specified collection
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if the class of an element of this queue
prevents it from being added to the specified collection
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if the specified collection is null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the specified collection is this
queue, or some property of an element of this queue prevents
it from being added to the specified collection

- how long to wait before giving up, in units of

unit
**Parameters:** unit

- a

TimeUnit

determining how to interpret the

timeout

parameter

```

Returns the number of additional elements that this queue can ideally
(in the absence of memory or resource constraints) accept without
blocking, or

Integer.MAX_VALUE

if there is no intrinsic

- remove

```java
boolean remove​(
Object
o)
```

Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue,
if it is present. More formally, removes an element

e

such
that

o.equals(e)

, if this queue contains one or more such
elements.
Returns

true

if this queue contained the specified element
(or equivalently, if this queue changed as a result of the call).

**Specified by:** remove

in interface

Collection

<

E

>
**Parameters:** o

- element to be removed from this queue, if present
**Returns:** true

if this queue changed as a result of the call
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- drainTo

```java
int drainTo​(
Collection
<? super
E
> c)
```

Removes all available elements from this queue and adds them
to the given collection. This operation may be more
efficient than repeatedly polling this queue. A failure
encountered while attempting to add elements to
collection

c

may result in elements being in neither,
either or both collections when the associated exception is
thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in

IllegalArgumentException

. Further, the behavior of
this operation is undefined if the specified collection is
modified while the operation is in progress.

queue, or some property of an element of this queue prevents
it from being added to the specified collection

- drainTo

```java
int drainTo​(
Collection
<? super
E
> c,
int maxElements)
```

Removes at most the given number of available elements from
this queue and adds them to the given collection. A failure
encountered while attempting to add elements to
collection

c

may result in elements being in neither,
either or both collections when the associated exception is
thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in

**Parameters:** c

- the collection to transfer elements into
**Parameters:** maxElements

- the maximum number of elements to transfer
**Returns:** the number of elements transferred
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

#### Method Detail

add

```java
boolean add​(
E
e)
```

Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do
so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning

true

upon success and throwing an

IllegalStateException

if no space is currently available.
When using a capacity-restricted queue, it is generally preferable to
use

offer

.
