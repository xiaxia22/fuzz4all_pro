### Class Description

```java
public interface
Lock
```

Lock

implementations provide more extensive locking
operations than can be obtained using

synchronized

methods
and statements. They allow more flexible structuring, may have
quite different properties, and may support multiple associated

Condition

objects.

A lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared resource by
multiple threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access to a
shared resource: only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and
all access to the shared resource requires that the lock be
acquired first. However, some locks may allow concurrent access to
a shared resource, such as the read lock of a

ReadWriteLock

.

The use of

synchronized

methods or statements provides
access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but
forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way:
when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite
order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which
they were acquired.

While the scoping mechanism for

synchronized

methods
and statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks,
and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks,
there are occasions where you need to work with locks in a more
flexible way. For example, some algorithms for traversing
concurrently accessed data structures require the use of
"hand-over-hand" or "chain locking": you
acquire the lock of node A, then node B, then release A and acquire
C, then release B and acquire D and so on. Implementations of the

Lock

interface enable the use of such techniques by
allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes,
and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any
order.

With this increased flexibility comes additional
responsibility. The absence of block-structured locking removes the
automatic release of locks that occurs with

synchronized

methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom
should be used:

```java
Lock l = ...;
l.lock();
try {
// access the resource protected by this lock
} finally {
l.unlock();
}
```

When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be
taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is
held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the
lock is released when necessary.

Lock

implementations provide additional functionality
over the use of

synchronized

methods and statements by
providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock (

tryLock()

), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be
interrupted (

lockInterruptibly()

, and an attempt to acquire
the lock that can timeout (

tryLock(long, TimeUnit)

).

A

Lock

class can also provide behavior and semantics
that is quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock,
such as guaranteed ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock
detection. If an implementation provides such specialized semantics
then the implementation must document those semantics.

Note that

Lock

instances are just normal objects and can
themselves be used as the target in a

synchronized

statement.
Acquiring the
monitor lock of a

Lock

instance has no specified relationship
with invoking any of the

lock()

methods of that instance.
It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use

Lock

instances in this way, except within their own implementation.

Except where noted, passing a

null

value for any
parameter will result in a

NullPointerException

being
thrown.

Memory Synchronization

All

Lock

implementations

must

enforce the same
memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor
lock, as described in

Chapter 17 of

The Java™ Language Specification

:

- A successful

lock

operation has the same memory
synchronization effects as a successful

Lock

action.

A successful

unlock

operation has the same
memory synchronization effects as a successful

Unlock

action.

Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant
locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory
synchronization effects.

Implementation Considerations

The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible,
non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance
characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation
qualities. Further, the ability to interrupt the

ongoing

acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given

Lock

class. Consequently, an implementation is not required to define
exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of
lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an
ongoing lock acquisition. An implementation is required to clearly
document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
locking methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as
defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock
acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on
method entry.

As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### void lock()

Acquires the lock.

If the lock is not available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until the
lock has been acquired.

Implementation Considerations

A

Lock

implementation may be able to detect erroneous use
of the lock, such as an invocation that would cause deadlock, and
may throw an (unchecked) exception in such circumstances. The
circumstances and the exception type must be documented by that

Lock

implementation.

---

#### void lockInterruptibly()
throws
InterruptedException

Acquires the lock unless the current thread is

interrupted

.

Acquires the lock if it is available and returns immediately.

If the lock is not available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of two things happens:

- The lock is acquired by the current thread; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the
current thread, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while acquiring the
lock, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

Implementation Considerations

The ability to interrupt a lock acquisition in some
implementations may not be possible, and if possible may be an
expensive operation. The programmer should be aware that this
may be the case. An implementation should document when this is
the case.

An implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over
normal method return.

A

Lock

implementation may be able to detect
erroneous use of the lock, such as an invocation that would
cause deadlock, and may throw an (unchecked) exception in such
circumstances. The circumstances and the exception type must
be documented by that

Lock

implementation.

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if the current thread is
interrupted while acquiring the lock (and interruption
of lock acquisition is supported)

---

#### boolean tryLock()

Acquires the lock only if it is free at the time of invocation.

Acquires the lock if it is available and returns immediately
with the value

true

.
If the lock is not available then this method will return
immediately with the value

false

.

A typical usage idiom for this method would be:

```java
Lock lock = ...;
if (lock.tryLock()) {
try {
// manipulate protected state
} finally {
lock.unlock();
}
} else {
// perform alternative actions
}
```

This usage ensures that the lock is unlocked if it was acquired, and
doesn't try to unlock if the lock was not acquired.

**Returns:**
- true

if the lock was acquired and

false

otherwise

---

#### boolean tryLock​(long time,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException

Acquires the lock if it is free within the given waiting time and the
current thread has not been

interrupted

.

If the lock is available this method returns immediately
with the value

true

.
If the lock is not available then
the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:

- The lock is acquired by the current thread; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the
current thread, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported; or

The specified waiting time elapses

If the lock is acquired then the value

true

is returned.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while acquiring
the lock, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

If the specified waiting time elapses then the value

false

is returned.
If the time is
less than or equal to zero, the method will not wait at all.

Implementation Considerations

The ability to interrupt a lock acquisition in some implementations
may not be possible, and if possible may
be an expensive operation.
The programmer should be aware that this may be the case. An
implementation should document when this is the case.

An implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over normal
method return, or reporting a timeout.

A

Lock

implementation may be able to detect
erroneous use of the lock, such as an invocation that would cause
deadlock, and may throw an (unchecked) exception in such circumstances.
The circumstances and the exception type must be documented by that

Lock

implementation.

**Parameters:**
- time

- the maximum time to wait for the lock
- unit

- the time unit of the

time

argument

**Returns:**
- true

if the lock was acquired and

false

if the waiting time elapsed before the lock was acquired

**Throws:**
- InterruptedException

- if the current thread is interrupted
while acquiring the lock (and interruption of lock
acquisition is supported)

---

#### void unlock()

Releases the lock.

Implementation Considerations

A

Lock

implementation will usually impose
restrictions on which thread can release a lock (typically only the
holder of the lock can release it) and may throw
an (unchecked) exception if the restriction is violated.
Any restrictions and the exception
type must be documented by that

Lock

implementation.

---

#### Condition
newCondition()

Returns a new

Condition

instance that is bound to this

Lock

instance.

Before waiting on the condition the lock must be held by the
current thread.
A call to

Condition.await()

will atomically release the lock
before waiting and re-acquire the lock before the wait returns.

Implementation Considerations

The exact operation of the

Condition

instance depends on
the

Lock

implementation and must be documented by that
implementation.

**Returns:**
- A new

Condition

instance for this

Lock

instance

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if this

Lock

implementation does not support conditions

detection. If an implementation provides such specialized semantics
then the implementation must document those semantics.

Note that

Lock

instances are just normal objects and can
themselves be used as the target in a

synchronized

statement.
Acquiring the
monitor lock of a

Lock

instance has no specified relationship
with invoking any of the

lock()

methods of that instance.
It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use

Lock

instances in this way, except within their own implementation.

Except where noted, passing a

null

value for any
parameter will result in a

NullPointerException

being
thrown.

Memory Synchronization

All

Lock

implementations

must

enforce the same
memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor
lock, as described in

Chapter 17 of

The Java™ Language Specification

:

- A successful

lock

operation has the same memory
synchronization effects as a successful

Lock

action.

A successful

unlock

operation has the same
memory synchronization effects as a successful

Unlock

action.

Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant
locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory
synchronization effects.

Implementation Considerations

The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible,
non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance
characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation
qualities. Further, the ability to interrupt the

ongoing

acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given

Lock

class. Consequently, an implementation is not required to define
exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of
lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an
ongoing lock acquisition. An implementation is required to clearly
document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
locking methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as
defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock
acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on
method entry.

As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

With this increased flexibility comes additional
responsibility. The absence of block-structured locking removes the
automatic release of locks that occurs with

synchronized

methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom
should be used:

```java
Lock l = ...;
l.lock();
try {
// access the resource protected by this lock
} finally {
l.unlock();
}
```

When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be
taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is
held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the
lock is released when necessary.

Lock

implementations provide additional functionality
over the use of

synchronized

methods and statements by
providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock (

tryLock()

), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be
interrupted (

lockInterruptibly()

, and an attempt to acquire
the lock that can timeout (

tryLock(long, TimeUnit)

).

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- lock

```java
void lock()
```

Acquires the lock.

If the lock is not available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until the
lock has been acquired.

Implementation Considerations

A

Lock

implementation may be able to detect erroneous use
of the lock, such as an invocation that would cause deadlock, and
may throw an (unchecked) exception in such circumstances. The
circumstances and the exception type must be documented by that

Lock

implementation.

- lockInterruptibly

```java
void lockInterruptibly()
throws
InterruptedException
```

Acquires the lock unless the current thread is

interrupted

.

Acquires the lock if it is available and returns immediately.

If the lock is not available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of two things happens:

- The lock is acquired by the current thread; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the
current thread, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while acquiring the
lock, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

Implementation Considerations

The ability to interrupt a lock acquisition in some
implementations may not be possible, and if possible may be an
expensive operation. The programmer should be aware that this
may be the case. An implementation should document when this is
the case.

An implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over
normal method return.

Lock

implementation may be able to detect
erroneous use of the lock, such as an invocation that would
cause deadlock, and may throw an (unchecked) exception in such
circumstances. The circumstances and the exception type must
be documented by that

Lock

implementation.

**Throws:** InterruptedException

- if the current thread is
interrupted while acquiring the lock (and interruption
of lock acquisition is supported)

- tryLock

```java
boolean tryLock()
```

Acquires the lock only if it is free at the time of invocation.

Acquires the lock if it is available and returns immediately
with the value

true

.
If the lock is not available then this method will return
immediately with the value

false

.

A typical usage idiom for this method would be:

```java
Lock lock = ...;
if (lock.tryLock()) {
try {
// manipulate protected state
} finally {
lock.unlock();
}
} else {
// perform alternative actions
}
```

This usage ensures that the lock is unlocked if it was acquired, and
doesn't try to unlock if the lock was not acquired.

**Returns:** true

if the lock was acquired and

false

otherwise

- tryLock

```java
boolean tryLock​(long time,

TimeUnit
unit)
throws
InterruptedException
```

Acquires the lock if it is free within the given waiting time and the
current thread has not been

interrupted

.

If the lock is available this method returns immediately
with the value

true

.
If the lock is not available then
the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:

- The lock is acquired by the current thread; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the
current thread, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported; or

The specified waiting time elapses

If the lock is acquired then the value

true

is returned.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while acquiring
the lock, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

If the specified waiting time elapses then the value

false

is returned.
If the time is
less than or equal to zero, the method will not wait at all.

- unlock

```java
void unlock()
```

Releases the lock.

Implementation Considerations

A

Lock

implementation will usually impose
restrictions on which thread can release a lock (typically only the
holder of the lock can release it) and may throw
an (unchecked) exception if the restriction is violated.
Any restrictions and the exception
type must be documented by that

Lock

implementation.

- newCondition

```java
Condition
newCondition()
```

Returns a new

Condition

instance that is bound to this

Lock

instance.

Before waiting on the condition the lock must be held by the
current thread.
A call to

Condition.await()

will atomically release the lock
before waiting and re-acquire the lock before the wait returns.

Implementation Considerations

The exact operation of the

Condition

instance depends on
the

#### lock

void lock()

Acquires the lock.

If the lock is not available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until the
lock has been acquired.

A

Lock

implementation may be able to detect erroneous use
of the lock, such as an invocation that would cause deadlock, and
may throw an (unchecked) exception in such circumstances. The

lockInterruptibly

```java

```

Acquires the lock unless the current thread is

interrupted

.

Acquires the lock if it is available and returns immediately.

If the lock is not available then the current thread becomes
disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
one of two things happens:

- The lock is acquired by the current thread; or

Some other thread

interrupts

the
current thread, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported.

If the current thread:

- has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

is

interrupted

while acquiring the
lock, and interruption of lock acquisition is supported,

then

InterruptedException

is thrown and the current thread's
interrupted status is cleared.

Implementation Considerations

The ability to interrupt a lock acquisition in some
implementations may not be possible, and if possible may be an
expensive operation. The programmer should be aware that this
may be the case. An implementation should document when this is
the case.

tryLock

```java
boolean tryLock()
```

Acquires the lock only if it is free at the time of invocation.

Acquires the lock if it is available and returns immediately
with the value

true

.
If the lock is not available then this method will return
immediately with the value

false

.

A typical usage idiom for this method would be:

```java
Lock lock = ...;
if (lock.tryLock()) {
try {
// manipulate protected state
} finally {
lock.unlock();
}
} else {
// perform alternative actions
}
```

This usage ensures that the lock is unlocked if it was acquired, and
doesn't try to unlock if the lock was not acquired.

**Returns:** true

if the lock was acquired and

false

otherwise
