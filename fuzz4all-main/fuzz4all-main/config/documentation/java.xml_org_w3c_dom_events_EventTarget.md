# Interface EventTarget

**Source:** `java.xml\org\w3c\dom\events\EventTarget.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
EventTarget
```

The

EventTarget

interface is implemented by all

Nodes

in an implementation which supports the DOM Event
Model. Therefore, this interface can be obtained by using
binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the

Node

interface. The interface allows registration and removal of

EventListeners

on an

EventTarget

and dispatch
of events to that

EventTarget

.

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Events Specification

### Method Details

#### void addEventListener​(
String
type,

EventListener
listener,
boolean useCapture)

This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event
target. If an

EventListener

is added to an

EventTarget

while it is processing an event, it will not
be triggered by the current actions but may be triggered during a
later stage of event flow, such as the bubbling phase.

If multiple identical

EventListener

s are registered
on the same

EventTarget

with the same parameters the
duplicate instances are discarded. They do not cause the

EventListener

to be called twice and since they are
discarded they do not need to be removed with the

removeEventListener

method.

**Parameters:**
- type

- The event type for which the user is registering
- listener

- The

listener

parameter takes an interface
implemented by the user which contains the methods to be called
when the event occurs.
- useCapture

- If true,

useCapture

indicates that the
user wishes to initiate capture. After initiating capture, all
events of the specified type will be dispatched to the registered

EventListener

before being dispatched to any

EventTargets

beneath them in the tree. Events which
are bubbling upward through the tree will not trigger an

EventListener

designated to use capture.

---

#### void removeEventListener​(
String
type,

EventListener
listener,
boolean useCapture)

This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event
target. If an

EventListener

is removed from an

EventTarget

while it is processing an event, it will not
be triggered by the current actions.

EventListener

s can
never be invoked after being removed.

Calling

removeEventListener

with arguments which do
not identify any currently registered

EventListener

on
the

EventTarget

has no effect.

**Parameters:**
- type

- Specifies the event type of the

EventListener

being removed.
- listener

- The

EventListener

parameter indicates the

EventListener

to be removed.
- useCapture

- Specifies whether the

EventListener

being removed was registered as a capturing listener or not. If a
listener was registered twice, one with capture and one without,
each must be removed separately. Removal of a capturing listener
does not affect a non-capturing version of the same listener, and
vice versa.

---

#### boolean dispatchEvent​(
Event
evt)
throws
EventException

This method allows the dispatch of events into the implementations
event model. Events dispatched in this manner will have the same
capturing and bubbling behavior as events dispatched directly by the
implementation. The target of the event is the

EventTarget

on which

dispatchEvent

is
called.

**Parameters:**
- evt

- Specifies the event type, behavior, and contextual
information to be used in processing the event.

**Returns:**
- The return value of

dispatchEvent

indicates
whether any of the listeners which handled the event called

preventDefault

. If

preventDefault

was
called the value is false, else the value is true.

**Throws:**
- EventException

- UNSPECIFIED_EVENT_TYPE_ERR: Raised if the

Event

's type
was not specified by initializing the event before

dispatchEvent

was called. Specification of the

Event

's type as

null

or an empty string
will also trigger this exception.
