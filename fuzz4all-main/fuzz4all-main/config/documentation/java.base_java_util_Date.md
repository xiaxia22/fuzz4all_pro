### Class Description

```java
public class
Date

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
,
Cloneable
,
Comparable
<
Date
>
```

The class

Date

represents a specific instant
in time, with millisecond precision.

Prior to JDK 1.1, the class

Date

had two additional
functions. It allowed the interpretation of dates as year, month, day, hour,
minute, and second values. It also allowed the formatting and parsing
of date strings. Unfortunately, the API for these functions was not
amenable to internationalization. As of JDK 1.1, the

Calendar

class should be used to convert between dates and time
fields and the

DateFormat

class should be used to format and
parse date strings.
The corresponding methods in

Date

are deprecated.

Although the

Date

class is intended to reflect
coordinated universal time (UTC), it may not do so exactly,
depending on the host environment of the Java Virtual Machine.
Nearly all modern operating systems assume that 1 day =
24 × 60 × 60 = 86400 seconds
in all cases. In UTC, however, about once every year or two there
is an extra second, called a "leap second." The leap
second is always added as the last second of the day, and always
on December 31 or June 30. For example, the last minute of the
year 1995 was 61 seconds long, thanks to an added leap second.
Most computer clocks are not accurate enough to be able to reflect
the leap-second distinction.

Some computer standards are defined in terms of Greenwich mean
time (GMT), which is equivalent to universal time (UT). GMT is
the "civil" name for the standard; UT is the
"scientific" name for the same standard. The
distinction between UTC and UT is that UTC is based on an atomic
clock and UT is based on astronomical observations, which for all
practical purposes is an invisibly fine hair to split. Because the
earth's rotation is not uniform (it slows down and speeds up
in complicated ways), UT does not always flow uniformly. Leap
seconds are introduced as needed into UTC so as to keep UTC within
0.9 seconds of UT1, which is a version of UT with certain
corrections applied. There are other time and date systems as
well; for example, the time scale used by the satellite-based
global positioning system (GPS) is synchronized to UTC but is

not

adjusted for leap seconds. An interesting source of
further information is the United States Naval Observatory (USNO):

```java
http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO
```

and the material regarding "Systems of Time" at:

```java
http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/master-clock/systems-of-time
```

which has descriptions of various different time systems including
UT, UT1, and UTC.

In all methods of class

Date

that accept or return
year, month, date, hours, minutes, and seconds values, the
following representations are used:

- A year

y

is represented by the integer

y

- 1900

.

A month is represented by an integer from 0 to 11; 0 is January,
1 is February, and so forth; thus 11 is December.

A date (day of month) is represented by an integer from 1 to 31
in the usual manner.

An hour is represented by an integer from 0 to 23. Thus, the hour
from midnight to 1 a.m. is hour 0, and the hour from noon to 1
p.m. is hour 12.

A minute is represented by an integer from 0 to 59 in the usual manner.

A second is represented by an integer from 0 to 61; the values 60 and
61 occur only for leap seconds and even then only in Java
implementations that actually track leap seconds correctly. Because
of the manner in which leap seconds are currently introduced, it is
extremely unlikely that two leap seconds will occur in the same
minute, but this specification follows the date and time conventions
for ISO C.

In all cases, arguments given to methods for these purposes need
not fall within the indicated ranges; for example, a date may be
specified as January 32 and is interpreted as meaning February 1.

minute, exactly as for the

Date

constructor with six
arguments, except that the arguments are interpreted relative
to UTC rather than to the local time zone. The time indicated is

the date and time specified by the arguments.

**See Also:**
- Calendar

---

#### @Deprecated

public static long parse​(
String
s)

Attempts to interpret the string

s

as a representation
of a date and time. If the attempt is successful, the time
indicated is returned represented as the distance, measured in
milliseconds, of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on
January 1, 1970). If the attempt fails, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

It accepts many syntaxes; in particular, it recognizes the IETF
standard date syntax: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995 13:30:00 GMT". It also
understands the continental U.S. time-zone abbreviations, but for
general use, a time-zone offset should be used: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995
13:30:00 GMT+0430" (4 hours, 30 minutes west of the Greenwich
meridian). If no time zone is specified, the local time zone is
assumed. GMT and UTC are considered equivalent.

The string

s

is processed from left to right, looking for
data of interest. Any material in

s

that is within the
ASCII parenthesis characters

(

and

)

is ignored.
Parentheses may be nested. Otherwise, the only characters permitted
within

s

are these ASCII characters:

```java
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789,+-:/
```

and whitespace characters.

A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal
number:

- If a number is preceded by

+

or

-

and a year
has already been recognized, then the number is a time-zone
offset. If the number is less than 24, it is an offset measured
in hours. Otherwise, it is regarded as an offset in minutes,
expressed in 24-hour time format without punctuation. A
preceding

-

means a westward offset. Time zone offsets
are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus, for example,

-5

occurring in the string would mean "five hours west
of Greenwich" and

+0430

would mean "four hours and
thirty minutes east of Greenwich." It is permitted for the
string to specify

GMT

,

UT

, or

UTC

redundantly-for example,

GMT-5

or

utc+0430

.

The number is regarded as a year number if one of the
following conditions is true:

- The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a
space, comma, slash, or end of string

The number is less than 70, and both a month and a day of
the month have already been recognized

If the recognized year number is less than 100, it is
interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of
which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after
the time when the Date class is initialized.
After adjusting the year number, 1900 is subtracted from
it. For example, if the current year is 1999 then years in
the range 19 to 99 are assumed to mean 1919 to 1999, while
years from 0 to 18 are assumed to mean 2000 to 2018. Note
that this is slightly different from the interpretation of
years less than 100 that is used in

SimpleDateFormat

.

If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour,
unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is
regarded as a minute.

If the number is followed by a slash, it is regarded as a month
(it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range

0

to

11

), unless a month has already been recognized, in
which case it is regarded as a day of the month.

If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or
end of string, then if an hour has been recognized but not a
minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has
been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second;
otherwise, it is regarded as a day of the month.

A consecutive sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated
as follows:

- A word that matches

AM

, ignoring case, is ignored (but
the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less
than

1

or greater than

12

).

A word that matches

PM

, ignoring case, adds

12

to the hour (but the parse fails if an hour has not been
recognized or is less than

1

or greater than

12

).

Any word that matches any prefix of

SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY,
WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY

, or

SATURDAY

, ignoring
case, is ignored. For example,

sat, Friday, TUE

, and

Thurs

are ignored.

Otherwise, any word that matches any prefix of

JANUARY,
FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER,
OCTOBER, NOVEMBER

, or

DECEMBER

, ignoring case, and
considering them in the order given here, is recognized as
specifying a month and is converted to a number (

0

to

11

). For example,

aug, Sept, april

, and

NOV

are recognized as months. So is

Ma

, which
is recognized as

MARCH

, not

MAY

.

Any word that matches

GMT, UT

, or

UTC

, ignoring
case, is treated as referring to UTC.

Any word that matches

EST, CST, MST

, or

PST

,
ignoring case, is recognized as referring to the time zone in
North America that is five, six, seven, or eight hours west of
Greenwich, respectively. Any word that matches

EDT, CDT,
MDT

, or

PDT

, ignoring case, is recognized as
referring to the same time zone, respectively, during daylight
saving time.

Once the entire string s has been scanned, it is converted to a time
result in one of two ways. If a time zone or time-zone offset has been
recognized, then the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
second are interpreted in UTC and then the time-zone offset is
applied. Otherwise, the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
second are interpreted in the local time zone.

**Parameters:**
- s

- a string to be parsed as a date.

**Returns:**
- the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT
represented by the string argument.

#### @Deprecated

public int getYear()

Returns a value that is the result of subtracting 1900 from the
year that contains or begins with the instant in time represented
by this

Date

object, as interpreted in the local
time zone.

- the year represented by this date, minus 1900.

**See Also:**
- Calendar

---

#### @Deprecated

public void setYear​(int year)

Sets the year of this

Date

object to be the specified
value plus 1900. This

Date

object is modified so
that it represents a point in time within the specified year,
with the month, date, hour, minute, and second the same as
before, as interpreted in the local time zone. (Of course, if
the date was February 29, for example, and the year is set to a
non-leap year, then the new date will be treated as if it were
on March 1.)

**Parameters:**
- year

- the year value.

**See Also:**
- Calendar

---

#### @Deprecated

public int getMonth()

Returns a number representing the month that contains or begins
with the instant in time represented by this

#### @Deprecated

public void setMonth​(int month)

Sets the month of this date to the specified value. This

Date

object is modified so that it represents a point
in time within the specified month, with the year, date, hour,
minute, and second the same as before, as interpreted in the
local time zone. If the date was October 31, for example, and
the month is set to June, then the new date will be treated as

Compares two dates for equality.
The result is

true

if and only if the argument is
not

null

and is a

Date

object that
represents the same point in time, to the millisecond, as this object.

of the form:

```java
dow mon dd hh:mm:ss zzz yyyy
```

where:

- dow

is the day of the week (

Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed,
Thu, Fri, Sat

).

mon

is the month (

Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun,

is the second within the minute (

00

through

61

, as two decimal digits.

zzz

is the time zone (and may reflect daylight saving
time). Standard time zone abbreviations include those
recognized by the method

parse

. If time zone
information is not available, then

zzz

is empty -
that is, it consists of no characters at all.

yyyy

is the year, as four decimal digits.

---

#### @Deprecated

public
String
toLocaleString()

Creates a string representation of this

Date

object in an
implementation-dependent form. The intent is that the form should
be familiar to the user of the Java application, wherever it may
happen to be running. The intent is comparable to that of the
"

%c

" format supported by the

strftime()

function of ISO C.

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this date, using the locale
conventions.

**See Also:**
- DateFormat

---

#### @Deprecated

public
String
toGMTString()

Creates a string representation of this

Date

object of
the form:

```java
d mon yyyy hh:mm:ss GMT
```

where:

- d

is the day of the month (

1

through

31

),
as one or two decimal digits.

mon

is the month (

Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul,

mm

is the minute within the hour (

00

through

59

), as two decimal digits.

ss

is the second within the minute (

00

through

61

), as two decimal digits.

GMT

is exactly the ASCII letters "

GMT

" to indicate
Greenwich Mean Time.

The result does not depend on the local time zone.

**Returns:**
- a string representation of this date, using the Internet GMT
conventions.

,

toLocaleString()

---

#### @Deprecated

public int getTimezoneOffset()

Returns the offset, measured in minutes, for the local time zone
relative to UTC that is appropriate for the time represented by
this

Date

object.

For example, in Massachusetts, five time zones west of Greenwich:

```java
new Date(96, 1, 14).getTimezoneOffset() returns 300
```

because on February 14, 1996, standard time (Eastern Standard Time)
is in use, which is offset five hours from UTC; but:

```java
new Date(96, 5, 1).getTimezoneOffset() returns 240
```

because on June 1, 1996, daylight saving time (Eastern Daylight Time)
is in use, which is offset only four hours from UTC.

This method produces the same result as if it computed:

```java
(this.getTime() - UTC(this.getYear(),
this.getMonth(),
this.getDate(),
this.getHours(),
this.getMinutes(),
this.getSeconds())) / (60 * 1000)
```

**Returns:**
- the time-zone offset, in minutes, for the current time zone.

**See Also:**
- Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET

,

Calendar.DST_OFFSET

,

TimeZone.getDefault()

---

#### public static
Date
from​(
Instant
instant)

Obtains an instance of

Date

from an

Instant

object.

Instant

uses a precision of nanoseconds, whereas

Date

uses a precision of milliseconds. The conversion will truncate any
excess precision information as though the amount in nanoseconds was
subject to integer division by one million.

Instant

can store points on the time-line further in the future
and further in the past than

Date

. In this scenario, this method
will throw an exception.

The class

Date

represents a specific instant
in time, with millisecond precision.

Prior to JDK 1.1, the class

Date

had two additional
functions. It allowed the interpretation of dates as year, month, day, hour,
minute, and second values. It also allowed the formatting and parsing
of date strings. Unfortunately, the API for these functions was not
amenable to internationalization. As of JDK 1.1, the

Calendar

class should be used to convert between dates and time
fields and the

DateFormat

class should be used to format and
parse date strings.
The corresponding methods in

Date

are deprecated.

Although the

Date

class is intended to reflect
coordinated universal time (UTC), it may not do so exactly,
depending on the host environment of the Java Virtual Machine.
Nearly all modern operating systems assume that 1 day =
24 × 60 × 60 = 86400 seconds
in all cases. In UTC, however, about once every year or two there
is an extra second, called a "leap second." The leap
second is always added as the last second of the day, and always
on December 31 or June 30. For example, the last minute of the
year 1995 was 61 seconds long, thanks to an added leap second.
Most computer clocks are not accurate enough to be able to reflect
the leap-second distinction.

Some computer standards are defined in terms of Greenwich mean
time (GMT), which is equivalent to universal time (UT). GMT is
the "civil" name for the standard; UT is the
"scientific" name for the same standard. The
distinction between UTC and UT is that UTC is based on an atomic
clock and UT is based on astronomical observations, which for all
practical purposes is an invisibly fine hair to split. Because the
earth's rotation is not uniform (it slows down and speeds up
in complicated ways), UT does not always flow uniformly. Leap
seconds are introduced as needed into UTC so as to keep UTC within
0.9 seconds of UT1, which is a version of UT with certain
corrections applied. There are other time and date systems as
well; for example, the time scale used by the satellite-based
global positioning system (GPS) is synchronized to UTC but is

not

adjusted for leap seconds. An interesting source of
further information is the United States Naval Observatory (USNO):

```java
http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO
```

and the material regarding "Systems of Time" at:

```java
http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/master-clock/systems-of-time
```

which has descriptions of various different time systems including
UT, UT1, and UTC.

In all methods of class

Date

that accept or return
year, month, date, hours, minutes, and seconds values, the
following representations are used:

- A year

y

is represented by the integer

y

- 1900

.

A month is represented by an integer from 0 to 11; 0 is January,
1 is February, and so forth; thus 11 is December.

A date (day of month) is represented by an integer from 1 to 31
in the usual manner.

An hour is represented by an integer from 0 to 23. Thus, the hour
from midnight to 1 a.m. is hour 0, and the hour from noon to 1
p.m. is hour 12.

A minute is represented by an integer from 0 to 59 in the usual manner.

A second is represented by an integer from 0 to 61; the values 60 and
61 occur only for leap seconds and even then only in Java
implementations that actually track leap seconds correctly. Because
of the manner in which leap seconds are currently introduced, it is
extremely unlikely that two leap seconds will occur in the same
minute, but this specification follows the date and time conventions
for ISO C.

In all cases, arguments given to methods for these purposes need
not fall within the indicated ranges; for example, a date may be
specified as January 32 and is interpreted as meaning February 1.

, using a UTC

TimeZone

, followed by

Calendar.getTime().getTime()

- parse

```java
@Deprecated

public static long parse​(
String
s)
```

Deprecated.

As of JDK version 1.1,
replaced by

DateFormat.parse(String s)

.

Attempts to interpret the string

s

as a representation
of a date and time. If the attempt is successful, the time
indicated is returned represented as the distance, measured in
milliseconds, of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on
January 1, 1970). If the attempt fails, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

It accepts many syntaxes; in particular, it recognizes the IETF
standard date syntax: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995 13:30:00 GMT". It also
understands the continental U.S. time-zone abbreviations, but for
general use, a time-zone offset should be used: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995
13:30:00 GMT+0430" (4 hours, 30 minutes west of the Greenwich
meridian). If no time zone is specified, the local time zone is
assumed. GMT and UTC are considered equivalent.

The string

s

is processed from left to right, looking for
data of interest. Any material in

s

that is within the
ASCII parenthesis characters

(

and

)

is ignored.
Parentheses may be nested. Otherwise, the only characters permitted
within

s

are these ASCII characters:

```java
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789,+-:/
```

and whitespace characters.

A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal
number:

- If a number is preceded by

+

or

-

and a year
has already been recognized, then the number is a time-zone
offset. If the number is less than 24, it is an offset measured
in hours. Otherwise, it is regarded as an offset in minutes,
expressed in 24-hour time format without punctuation. A
preceding

-

means a westward offset. Time zone offsets
are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus, for example,

-5

occurring in the string would mean "five hours west
of Greenwich" and

+0430

would mean "four hours and
thirty minutes east of Greenwich." It is permitted for the
string to specify

GMT

,

UT

, or

UTC

redundantly-for example,

GMT-5

or

utc+0430

.

The number is regarded as a year number if one of the
following conditions is true:

- The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a
space, comma, slash, or end of string

The number is less than 70, and both a month and a day of
the month have already been recognized

If the recognized year number is less than 100, it is
interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of
which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after
the time when the Date class is initialized.
After adjusting the year number, 1900 is subtracted from
it. For example, if the current year is 1999 then years in
the range 19 to 99 are assumed to mean 1919 to 1999, while
years from 0 to 18 are assumed to mean 2000 to 2018. Note
that this is slightly different from the interpretation of
years less than 100 that is used in

SimpleDateFormat

.

If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour,
unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is
regarded as a minute.

If the number is followed by a slash, it is regarded as a month
(it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range

0

to

11

), unless a month has already been recognized, in
which case it is regarded as a day of the month.

If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or
end of string, then if an hour has been recognized but not a
minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has
been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second;
otherwise, it is regarded as a day of the month.

A consecutive sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated
as follows:

- A word that matches

AM

, ignoring case, is ignored (but
the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less
than

1

or greater than

12

).

A word that matches

PM

, ignoring case, adds

12

to the hour (but the parse fails if an hour has not been
recognized or is less than

1

or greater than

12

).

Any word that matches any prefix of

SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY,
WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY

, or

SATURDAY

, ignoring
case, is ignored. For example,

sat, Friday, TUE

, and

Thurs

are ignored.

Otherwise, any word that matches any prefix of

JANUARY,
FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER,
OCTOBER, NOVEMBER

, or

DECEMBER

, ignoring case, and
considering them in the order given here, is recognized as
specifying a month and is converted to a number (

0

to

11

). For example,

aug, Sept, april

, and

NOV

are recognized as months. So is

Ma

, which
is recognized as

MARCH

, not

MAY

.

Any word that matches

GMT, UT

, or

UTC

, ignoring
case, is treated as referring to UTC.

Any word that matches

EST, CST, MST

, or

PST

,
ignoring case, is recognized as referring to the time zone in
North America that is five, six, seven, or eight hours west of
Greenwich, respectively. Any word that matches

EDT, CDT,
MDT

, or

PDT

, ignoring case, is recognized as
referring to the same time zone, respectively, during daylight
saving time.

Once the entire string s has been scanned, it is converted to a time
result in one of two ways. If a time zone or time-zone offset has been
recognized, then the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
second are interpreted in UTC and then the time-zone offset is
applied. Otherwise, the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
second are interpreted in the local time zone.

**Parameters:** s

- a string to be parsed as a date.
**Returns:** the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT
represented by the string argument.
**See Also:** DateFormat

- getYear

```java
@Deprecated

public int getYear()

Calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 1900

.

Returns a value that is the result of subtracting 1900 from the
year that contains or begins with the instant in time represented
by this

Date

object, as interpreted in the local
time zone.

**Returns:** the year represented by this date, minus 1900.
**See Also:** Calendar

- setYear

```java
@Deprecated

public void setYear​(int year)
```

Deprecated.

As of JDK version 1.1,
replaced by

Calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year + 1900)

.

Sets the year of this

Date

object to be the specified
value plus 1900. This

Date

object is modified so
that it represents a point in time within the specified year,
with the month, date, hour, minute, and second the same as
before, as interpreted in the local time zone. (Of course, if
the date was February 29, for example, and the year is set to a
non-leap year, then the new date will be treated as if it were
on March 1.)

**Parameters:** year

- the year value.
**See Also:** Calendar

- getMonth

```java
@Deprecated

public int getMonth()
```

Deprecated.

As of JDK version 1.1,
replaced by

Calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH)

.

Returns a number representing the month that contains or begins
with the instant in time represented by this

Date

object.
The value returned is between

0

and

11

,
with the value

0

representing January.

**Returns:** the month represented by this date.
**See Also:** Calendar

- setMonth

```java
@Deprecated

public void setMonth​(int month)
```

Deprecated.

As of JDK version 1.1,
replaced by

Calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, int month)

.

Sets the month of this date to the specified value. This

Date

object is modified so that it represents a point
in time within the specified month, with the year, date, hour,
minute, and second the same as before, as interpreted in the
local time zone. If the date was October 31, for example, and
the month is set to June, then the new date will be treated as
if it were on July 1, because June has only 30 days.

**Parameters:** month

- the month value between 0-11.
**See Also:** Calendar

- getDate

```java
@Deprecated

public int getDate()
```

Deprecated.

As of JDK version 1.1,

month, with the year, month, hour, minute, and second the same
as before, as interpreted in the local time zone. If the date
was April 30, for example, and the date is set to 31, then it
will be treated as if it were on May 1, because April has only
30 days.

```

Deprecated.

As of JDK version 1.1,
replaced by

-(Calendar.get(Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET) +
Calendar.get(Calendar.DST_OFFSET)) / (60 * 1000)

.

Returns the offset, measured in minutes, for the local time zone
relative to UTC that is appropriate for the time represented by
this

Date

object.

For example, in Massachusetts, five time zones west of Greenwich:

```java
new Date(96, 1, 14).getTimezoneOffset() returns 300
```

because on February 14, 1996, standard time (Eastern Standard Time)
is in use, which is offset five hours from UTC; but:

```java
new Date(96, 5, 1).getTimezoneOffset() returns 240
```

because on June 1, 1996, daylight saving time (Eastern Daylight Time)
is in use, which is offset only four hours from UTC.

This method produces the same result as if it computed:

```java
(this.getTime() - UTC(this.getYear(),
this.getMonth(),
this.getDate(),
this.getHours(),
this.getMinutes(),
this.getSeconds())) / (60 * 1000)
```

**Returns:** the time-zone offset, in minutes, for the current time zone.
**See Also:** Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET

Calendar.DST_OFFSET

,

TimeZone.getDefault()

- from

```java
public static
Date
from​(
Instant
instant)
```

Obtains an instance of

Date

from an

Instant

object.

Instant

uses a precision of nanoseconds, whereas

Date

uses a precision of milliseconds. The conversion will truncate any
excess precision information as though the amount in nanoseconds was
subject to integer division by one million.

Instant

can store points on the time-line further in the future
and further in the past than

Date

. In this scenario, this method
will throw an exception.

**Parameters:** instant

- the instant to convert
**Returns:** a

Date

representing the same point on the time-line as
the provided instant
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

instant

is null.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the instant is too large to
represent as a

Date
**Since:** 1.8

- toInstant

```java

- parse

```java
@Deprecated

public static long parse​(
String

```

Deprecated.

As of JDK version 1.1,
replaced by

DateFormat.parse(String s)

.

Attempts to interpret the string

s

as a representation
of a date and time. If the attempt is successful, the time
indicated is returned represented as the distance, measured in
milliseconds, of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on
January 1, 1970). If the attempt fails, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

It accepts many syntaxes; in particular, it recognizes the IETF
standard date syntax: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995 13:30:00 GMT". It also
understands the continental U.S. time-zone abbreviations, but for
general use, a time-zone offset should be used: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995
13:30:00 GMT+0430" (4 hours, 30 minutes west of the Greenwich
meridian). If no time zone is specified, the local time zone is
assumed. GMT and UTC are considered equivalent.

The string

s

is processed from left to right, looking for
data of interest. Any material in

s

that is within the
ASCII parenthesis characters

(

and

)

is ignored.
Parentheses may be nested. Otherwise, the only characters permitted
within

s

are these ASCII characters:

```java
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789,+-:/
```

and whitespace characters.

A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal
number:

- If a number is preceded by

+

or

-

and a year
has already been recognized, then the number is a time-zone
offset. If the number is less than 24, it is an offset measured
in hours. Otherwise, it is regarded as an offset in minutes,
expressed in 24-hour time format without punctuation. A
preceding

-

means a westward offset. Time zone offsets
are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus, for example,

-5

occurring in the string would mean "five hours west
of Greenwich" and

+0430

would mean "four hours and
thirty minutes east of Greenwich." It is permitted for the
string to specify

GMT

,

UT

, or

UTC

redundantly-for example,

GMT-5

or

utc+0430

.

The number is regarded as a year number if one of the
following conditions is true:

- The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a
space, comma, slash, or end of string

The number is less than 70, and both a month and a day of
the month have already been recognized

If the recognized year number is less than 100, it is
interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of
which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after
the time when the Date class is initialized.
After adjusting the year number, 1900 is subtracted from
it. For example, if the current year is 1999 then years in
the range 19 to 99 are assumed to mean 1919 to 1999, while
years from 0 to 18 are assumed to mean 2000 to 2018. Note
that this is slightly different from the interpretation of
years less than 100 that is used in

SimpleDateFormat

.

If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour,
unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is
regarded as a minute.

If the number is followed by a slash, it is regarded as a month
(it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range

0

to

11

), unless a month has already been recognized, in
which case it is regarded as a day of the month.

If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or
end of string, then if an hour has been recognized but not a
minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has
been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second;
otherwise, it is regarded as a day of the month.

A consecutive sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated
as follows:

- A word that matches

AM

, ignoring case, is ignored (but
the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less
than

1

or greater than

12

).

A word that matches

PM

, ignoring case, adds

12

to the hour (but the parse fails if an hour has not been
recognized or is less than

1

or greater than

12

).

Any word that matches any prefix of

SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY,
WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY

, or

SATURDAY

, ignoring
case, is ignored. For example,

sat, Friday, TUE

, and

Thurs

are ignored.

Otherwise, any word that matches any prefix of

JANUARY,
FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER,
OCTOBER, NOVEMBER

, or

DECEMBER

, ignoring case, and
considering them in the order given here, is recognized as
specifying a month and is converted to a number (

0

to

11

). For example,

aug, Sept, april

, and

NOV

are recognized as months. So is

Ma

, which
is recognized as

MARCH

, not

MAY

.

Any word that matches

GMT, UT

, or

UTC

, ignoring
case, is treated as referring to UTC.

Any word that matches

EST, CST, MST

, or

PST

,
ignoring case, is recognized as referring to the time zone in
North America that is five, six, seven, or eight hours west of
Greenwich, respectively. Any word that matches

EDT, CDT,
MDT

, or

PDT

, ignoring case, is recognized as
referring to the same time zone, respectively, during daylight
saving time.

Once the entire string s has been scanned, it is converted to a time
result in one of two ways. If a time zone or time-zone offset has been
recognized, then the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
second are interpreted in UTC and then the time-zone offset is
applied. Otherwise, the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
second are interpreted in the local time zone.

**Parameters:** s

```

Deprecated.

As of JDK version 1.1,

-(Calendar.get(Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET) +
Calendar.get(Calendar.DST_OFFSET)) / (60 * 1000)

.

Returns the offset, measured in minutes, for the local time zone
relative to UTC that is appropriate for the time represented by
this

Date

object.

For example, in Massachusetts, five time zones west of Greenwich:

```java
new Date(96, 1, 14).getTimezoneOffset() returns 300
```

because on February 14, 1996, standard time (Eastern Standard Time)
is in use, which is offset five hours from UTC; but:

```java
new Date(96, 5, 1).getTimezoneOffset() returns 240
```

because on June 1, 1996, daylight saving time (Eastern Daylight Time)
is in use, which is offset only four hours from UTC.

This method produces the same result as if it computed:

```java
(this.getTime() - UTC(this.getYear(),
this.getMonth(),
this.getDate(),
this.getHours(),
this.getMinutes(),
this.getSeconds())) / (60 * 1000)
```

**Returns:** the time-zone offset, in minutes, for the current time zone.
**See Also:** Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET

,

Calendar.DST_OFFSET

,

TimeZone.getDefault()

- from

```java
public static
Date
from​(
Instant
instant)
```

Obtains an instance of

Date

from an

Instant

object.

Instant

uses a precision of nanoseconds, whereas

Date

uses a precision of milliseconds. The conversion will truncate any
excess precision information as though the amount in nanoseconds was
subject to integer division by one million.

Instant

can store points on the time-line further in the future
and further in the past than

Date

. In this scenario, this method
will throw an exception.

**Parameters:** instant

- the instant to convert
**Returns:** a

Date

representing the same point on the time-line as
the provided instant
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

instant

is null.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the instant is too large to
represent as a

Date
**Since:** 1.8

- toInstant

```java
public
Instant
toInstant()
```

Converts this

Date

object to an

Instant

.

The conversion creates an

Instant

that represents the same
point on the time-line as this

Date

.

**Returns:** an instant representing the same point on the time-line as
this

Date

object
**Since:** 1.8

hour of the day, minute within the hour, and second within the
minute, exactly as for the

Date

constructor with six
arguments, except that the arguments are interpreted relative

parse

```java
@Deprecated

public static long parse​(
String

```

Deprecated.

As of JDK version 1.1,
replaced by

DateFormat.parse(String s)

.

Attempts to interpret the string

s

as a representation
of a date and time. If the attempt is successful, the time
indicated is returned represented as the distance, measured in
milliseconds, of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on
January 1, 1970). If the attempt fails, an

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown.

It accepts many syntaxes; in particular, it recognizes the IETF
standard date syntax: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995 13:30:00 GMT". It also
understands the continental U.S. time-zone abbreviations, but for
general use, a time-zone offset should be used: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995
13:30:00 GMT+0430" (4 hours, 30 minutes west of the Greenwich
meridian). If no time zone is specified, the local time zone is
assumed. GMT and UTC are considered equivalent.

The string

s

is processed from left to right, looking for
data of interest. Any material in

s

that is within the
ASCII parenthesis characters

(

and

)

is ignored.
Parentheses may be nested. Otherwise, the only characters permitted
within

s

are these ASCII characters:

```java
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789,+-:/
```

and whitespace characters.

A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal
number:

- If a number is preceded by

+

or

-

and a year
has already been recognized, then the number is a time-zone
offset. If the number is less than 24, it is an offset measured
in hours. Otherwise, it is regarded as an offset in minutes,
expressed in 24-hour time format without punctuation. A
preceding

-

means a westward offset. Time zone offsets
are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus, for example,

-5

occurring in the string would mean "five hours west
of Greenwich" and

+0430

would mean "four hours and
thirty minutes east of Greenwich." It is permitted for the
string to specify

GMT

,

UT

, or

UTC

redundantly-for example,

GMT-5

or

utc+0430

.

The number is regarded as a year number if one of the
following conditions is true:

- The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a
space, comma, slash, or end of string

The number is less than 70, and both a month and a day of
the month have already been recognized

If the recognized year number is less than 100, it is
interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of
which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after
the time when the Date class is initialized.
After adjusting the year number, 1900 is subtracted from
it. For example, if the current year is 1999 then years in
the range 19 to 99 are assumed to mean 1919 to 1999, while
years from 0 to 18 are assumed to mean 2000 to 2018. Note
that this is slightly different from the interpretation of
years less than 100 that is used in

SimpleDateFormat

.

If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour,
unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is
regarded as a minute.

If the number is followed by a slash, it is regarded as a month
(it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range

0

to

11

), unless a month has already been recognized, in
which case it is regarded as a day of the month.

If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or
end of string, then if an hour has been recognized but not a
minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has
been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second;
otherwise, it is regarded as a day of the month.

A consecutive sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated
as follows:

- A word that matches

AM

, ignoring case, is ignored (but
the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less
than

1

or greater than

12

).

A word that matches

PM

, ignoring case, adds

12

to the hour (but the parse fails if an hour has not been
recognized or is less than

1

or greater than

12

).

Any word that matches any prefix of

SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY,
WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY

, or

SATURDAY

, ignoring
case, is ignored. For example,

sat, Friday, TUE

, and

Thurs

are ignored.

Otherwise, any word that matches any prefix of

JANUARY,
FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER,
OCTOBER, NOVEMBER

, or

DECEMBER

, ignoring case, and
considering them in the order given here, is recognized as
specifying a month and is converted to a number (

0

to

11

). For example,

aug, Sept, april

, and

NOV

are recognized as months. So is

Ma

, which
is recognized as

MARCH

, not

MAY

.

Any word that matches

GMT, UT

, or

UTC

, ignoring
case, is treated as referring to UTC.

Any word that matches

EST, CST, MST

, or

PST

,
ignoring case, is recognized as referring to the time zone in
North America that is five, six, seven, or eight hours west of
Greenwich, respectively. Any word that matches

EDT, CDT,
MDT

, or

PDT

, ignoring case, is recognized as
referring to the same time zone, respectively, during daylight
saving time.

Once the entire string s has been scanned, it is converted to a time
result in one of two ways. If a time zone or time-zone offset has been
recognized, then the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
second are interpreted in UTC and then the time-zone offset is
applied. Otherwise, the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
second are interpreted in the local time zone.

**Parameters:** s

- a string to be parsed as a date.
**Returns:** the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT
represented by the string argument.

A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal
number:

- If a number is preceded by

+

or

-

and a year
has already been recognized, then the number is a time-zone
offset. If the number is less than 24, it is an offset measured
in hours. Otherwise, it is regarded as an offset in minutes,
expressed in 24-hour time format without punctuation. A
preceding

-

means a westward offset. Time zone offsets
are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus, for example,

-5

occurring in the string would mean "five hours west
of Greenwich" and

+0430

would mean "four hours and
thirty minutes east of Greenwich." It is permitted for the
string to specify

GMT

,

UT

, or

UTC

redundantly-for example,

GMT-5

or

utc+0430

.

The number is regarded as a year number if one of the
following conditions is true:

- The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a
space, comma, slash, or end of string

The number is less than 70, and both a month and a day of
the month have already been recognized

If the recognized year number is less than 100, it is
interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of
which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after
the time when the Date class is initialized.
After adjusting the year number, 1900 is subtracted from
it. For example, if the current year is 1999 then years in
the range 19 to 99 are assumed to mean 1919 to 1999, while
years from 0 to 18 are assumed to mean 2000 to 2018. Note
that this is slightly different from the interpretation of
years less than 100 that is used in

SimpleDateFormat

.

If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour,
unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is
regarded as a minute.

If the number is followed by a slash, it is regarded as a month
(it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range

0

to

11

), unless a month has already been recognized, in
which case it is regarded as a day of the month.

If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or
end of string, then if an hour has been recognized but not a
minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has
been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second;
otherwise, it is regarded as a day of the month.

A consecutive sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated
as follows:

- A word that matches

AM

, ignoring case, is ignored (but
the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less
than

1

or greater than

12

).

A word that matches

PM

, ignoring case, adds

12

to the hour (but the parse fails if an hour has not been
recognized or is less than

1

or greater than

12

).

Any word that matches any prefix of

SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY,
WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY

, or

SATURDAY

, ignoring
case, is ignored. For example,

sat, Friday, TUE

, and

Thurs

are ignored.

Otherwise, any word that matches any prefix of

JANUARY,
FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER,
OCTOBER, NOVEMBER

, or

DECEMBER

, ignoring case, and
considering them in the order given here, is recognized as
specifying a month and is converted to a number (

0

to

11

). For example,

aug, Sept, april

, and

NOV

are recognized as months. So is

Ma

, which
is recognized as

MARCH

, not

MAY

.

Any word that matches

GMT, UT

, or

UTC

, ignoring
case, is treated as referring to UTC.

Any word that matches

EST, CST, MST

, or

PST

,
ignoring case, is recognized as referring to the time zone in
North America that is five, six, seven, or eight hours west of
Greenwich, respectively. Any word that matches

EDT, CDT,
MDT

, or

PDT

, ignoring case, is recognized as
referring to the same time zone, respectively, during daylight
saving time.

Once the entire string s has been scanned, it is converted to a time
result in one of two ways. If a time zone or time-zone offset has been
recognized, then the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
second are interpreted in UTC and then the time-zone offset is
applied. Otherwise, the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
second are interpreted in the local time zone.

It accepts many syntaxes; in particular, it recognizes the IETF
standard date syntax: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995 13:30:00 GMT". It also
understands the continental U.S. time-zone abbreviations, but for
general use, a time-zone offset should be used: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995
13:30:00 GMT+0430" (4 hours, 30 minutes west of the Greenwich
meridian). If no time zone is specified, the local time zone is
assumed. GMT and UTC are considered equivalent.

The string

s

is processed from left to right, looking for
data of interest. Any material in

s

that is within the
ASCII parenthesis characters

(

is ignored.
Parentheses may be nested. Otherwise, the only characters permitted
within

s

are these ASCII characters:
