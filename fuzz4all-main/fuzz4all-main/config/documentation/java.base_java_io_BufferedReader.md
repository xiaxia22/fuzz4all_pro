# Class BufferedReader

**Source:** `java.base\java\io\BufferedReader.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
BufferedReader

extends
Reader
```

Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to
provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be used. The
default is large enough for most purposes.

In general, each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding
read request to be made of the underlying character or byte stream. It is
therefore advisable to wrap a BufferedReader around any Reader whose read()
operations may be costly, such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders. For
example,

```java
BufferedReader in
= new BufferedReader(new FileReader("foo.in"));
```

will buffer the input from the specified file. Without buffering, each
invocation of read() or readLine() could cause bytes to be read from the
file, converted into characters, and then returned, which can be very
inefficient.

Programs that use DataInputStreams for textual input can be localized by
replacing each DataInputStream with an appropriate BufferedReader.

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public BufferedReader​(
Reader
in,
int sz)

Creates a buffering character-input stream that uses an input buffer of
the specified size.

**Parameters:**
- in

- A Reader
- sz

- Input-buffer size

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If

sz <= 0

---

#### public BufferedReader​(
Reader
in)

Creates a buffering character-input stream that uses a default-sized
input buffer.

**Parameters:**
- in

- A Reader

---

### Method Details

#### public int read()
throws
IOException

Reads a single character.

**Overrides:**
- read

in class

Reader

**Returns:**
- The character read, as an integer in the range
0 to 65535 (

0x00-0xffff

), or -1 if the
end of the stream has been reached

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public int read​(char[] cbuf,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException

Reads characters into a portion of an array.

This method implements the general contract of the corresponding

read

method of the

Reader

class. As an additional convenience, it
attempts to read as many characters as possible by repeatedly invoking
the

read

method of the underlying stream. This iterated

read

continues until one of the following conditions becomes
true:

- The specified number of characters have been read,

The

read

method of the underlying stream returns

-1

, indicating end-of-file, or

The

ready

method of the underlying stream
returns

false

, indicating that further input requests
would block.

If the first

read

on the underlying stream returns

-1

to indicate end-of-file then this method returns

-1

. Otherwise this method returns the number of characters
actually read.

Subclasses of this class are encouraged, but not required, to
attempt to read as many characters as possible in the same fashion.

Ordinarily this method takes characters from this stream's character
buffer, filling it from the underlying stream as necessary. If,
however, the buffer is empty, the mark is not valid, and the requested
length is at least as large as the buffer, then this method will read
characters directly from the underlying stream into the given array.
Thus redundant

BufferedReader

s will not copy data
unnecessarily.

**Specified by:**
- read

in class

Reader

**Parameters:**
- cbuf

- Destination buffer
- off

- Offset at which to start storing characters
- len

- Maximum number of characters to read

**Returns:**
- The number of characters read, or -1 if the end of the
stream has been reached

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public
String
readLine()
throws
IOException

Reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one
of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), a carriage return
followed immediately by a line feed, or by reaching the end-of-file
(EOF).

**Returns:**
- A String containing the contents of the line, not including
any line-termination characters, or null if the end of the
stream has been reached without reading any characters

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

**See Also:**
- Files.readAllLines(java.nio.file.Path, java.nio.charset.Charset)

---

#### public long skip​(long n)
throws
IOException

Skips characters.

**Overrides:**
- skip

in class

Reader

**Parameters:**
- n

- The number of characters to skip

**Returns:**
- The number of characters actually skipped

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If

n

is negative.
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public boolean ready()
throws
IOException

Tells whether this stream is ready to be read. A buffered character
stream is ready if the buffer is not empty, or if the underlying
character stream is ready.

**Overrides:**
- ready

in class

Reader

**Returns:**
- True if the next read() is guaranteed not to block for input,
false otherwise. Note that returning false does not guarantee that the
next read will block.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public boolean markSupported()

Tells whether this stream supports the mark() operation, which it does.

**Overrides:**
- markSupported

in class

Reader

**Returns:**
- true if and only if this stream supports the mark operation.

---

#### public void mark​(int readAheadLimit)
throws
IOException

Marks the present position in the stream. Subsequent calls to reset()
will attempt to reposition the stream to this point.

**Overrides:**
- mark

in class

Reader

**Parameters:**
- readAheadLimit

- Limit on the number of characters that may be
read while still preserving the mark. An attempt
to reset the stream after reading characters
up to this limit or beyond may fail.
A limit value larger than the size of the input
buffer will cause a new buffer to be allocated
whose size is no smaller than limit.
Therefore large values should be used with care.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If

readAheadLimit < 0
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public void reset()
throws
IOException

Resets the stream to the most recent mark.

**Overrides:**
- reset

in class

Reader

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If the stream has never been marked,
or if the mark has been invalidated

---

#### public
Stream
<
String
> lines()

Returns a

Stream

, the elements of which are lines read from
this

BufferedReader

. The

Stream

is lazily populated,
i.e., read only occurs during the

terminal
stream operation

.

The reader must not be operated on during the execution of the
terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream
operation is undefined.

After execution of the terminal stream operation there are no
guarantees that the reader will be at a specific position from which to
read the next character or line.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the underlying

BufferedReader

, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the

Stream

method that caused the read to take place. This method will return a
Stream if invoked on a BufferedReader that is closed. Any operation on
that stream that requires reading from the BufferedReader after it is
closed, will cause an UncheckedIOException to be thrown.

**Returns:**
- a

Stream<String>

providing the lines of text
described by this

BufferedReader

**Since:**
- 1.8

operation is undefined.

After execution of the terminal stream operation there are no
guarantees that the reader will be at a specific position from which to
read the next character or line.

If an

IOException

is thrown when accessing the underlying

BufferedReader

, it is wrapped in an

UncheckedIOException

which will be thrown from the

Stream

method that caused the read to take place. This method will return a
Stream if invoked on a BufferedReader that is closed. Any operation on
that stream that requires reading from the BufferedReader after it is
closed, will cause an UncheckedIOException to be thrown.

**Returns:** a

Stream<String>

providing the lines of text
described by this

BufferedReader
**Since:** 1.8

#### Method Detail

read

```java
public int read()
throws
IOException
```

Reads a single character.

**Overrides:** read

in class

Reader
**Returns:** The character read, as an integer in the range
0 to 65535 (

0x00-0xffff

), or -1 if the
end of the stream has been reached
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### read

public int read()
throws

IOException

Reads a single character.

read

```java
public int read​(char[] cbuf,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException
```

Reads characters into a portion of an array.

This method implements the general contract of the corresponding

read

method of the

Reader

class. As an additional convenience, it
attempts to read as many characters as possible by repeatedly invoking
the

read

method of the underlying stream. This iterated

read

continues until one of the following conditions becomes
true:

- The specified number of characters have been read,

The

read

method of the underlying stream returns

-1

, indicating end-of-file, or

The

ready

method of the underlying stream
returns

false

, indicating that further input requests
would block.

If the first

read

on the underlying stream returns

-1

to indicate end-of-file then this method returns

-1

. Otherwise this method returns the number of characters
actually read.

Subclasses of this class are encouraged, but not required, to
attempt to read as many characters as possible in the same fashion.

Ordinarily this method takes characters from this stream's character
buffer, filling it from the underlying stream as necessary. If,
however, the buffer is empty, the mark is not valid, and the requested
length is at least as large as the buffer, then this method will read
characters directly from the underlying stream into the given array.
Thus redundant

BufferedReader

s will not copy data
unnecessarily.

**Specified by:** read

in class

Reader
**Parameters:** cbuf

- Destination buffer
**Parameters:** off

- Offset at which to start storing characters
**Parameters:** len

- Maximum number of characters to read
**Returns:** The number of characters read, or -1 if the end of the
stream has been reached
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If an I/O error occurs

readLine

```java
public
String
readLine()
throws
IOException
```

Reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one
of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), a carriage return
followed immediately by a line feed, or by reaching the end-of-file
(EOF).

**Returns:** A String containing the contents of the line, not including
any line-termination characters, or null if the end of the
stream has been reached without reading any characters
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
**See Also:** Files.readAllLines(java.nio.file.Path, java.nio.charset.Charset)

---

#### readLine

public

String

readLine()
throws

IOException

Reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one
of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), a carriage return
followed immediately by a line feed, or by reaching the end-of-file
(EOF).

skip

```java
public long skip​(long n)
throws
IOException
```

Skips characters.

**Overrides:** skip

in class

Reader
**Parameters:** n

- The number of characters to skip
**Returns:** The number of characters actually skipped
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If

n

is negative.
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### skip

public long skip​(long n)
throws

IOException

Skips characters.

ready

```java
public boolean ready()
throws
IOException
```

Tells whether this stream is ready to be read. A buffered character
stream is ready if the buffer is not empty, or if the underlying
character stream is ready.

**Overrides:** ready

in class

Reader
**Returns:** True if the next read() is guaranteed not to block for input,
false otherwise. Note that returning false does not guarantee that the
next read will block.
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### ready

public boolean ready()
throws

IOException

Tells whether this stream is ready to be read. A buffered character
stream is ready if the buffer is not empty, or if the underlying
character stream is ready.

markSupported

```java
public boolean markSupported()
```

Tells whether this stream supports the mark() operation, which it does.

**Overrides:** markSupported

in class

Reader
**Returns:** true if and only if this stream supports the mark operation.

---

#### markSupported

public boolean markSupported()

Tells whether this stream supports the mark() operation, which it does.

mark

```java
public void mark​(int readAheadLimit)
throws
IOException
```

Marks the present position in the stream. Subsequent calls to reset()
will attempt to reposition the stream to this point.

**Overrides:** mark

in class

Reader
**Parameters:** readAheadLimit

- Limit on the number of characters that may be
read while still preserving the mark. An attempt
to reset the stream after reading characters
up to this limit or beyond may fail.
A limit value larger than the size of the input
buffer will cause a new buffer to be allocated
whose size is no smaller than limit.
Therefore large values should be used with care.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If

readAheadLimit < 0
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### mark

public void mark​(int readAheadLimit)
throws

IOException

Marks the present position in the stream. Subsequent calls to reset()
will attempt to reposition the stream to this point.

reset

```java
public void reset()
throws
IOException
```

Resets the stream to the most recent mark.

**Overrides:** reset

in class

Reader
**Throws:** IOException

- If the stream has never been marked,
or if the mark has been invalidated

---

#### reset

public void reset()
throws

IOException

Resets the stream to the most recent mark.
