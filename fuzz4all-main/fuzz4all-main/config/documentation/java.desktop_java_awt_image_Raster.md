# Class Raster

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\Raster.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Raster

extends
Object
```

A class representing a rectangular array of pixels. A Raster
encapsulates a DataBuffer that stores the sample values and a
SampleModel that describes how to locate a given sample value in a
DataBuffer.

A Raster defines values for pixels occupying a particular
rectangular area of the plane, not necessarily including (0, 0).
The rectangle, known as the Raster's bounding rectangle and
available by means of the getBounds method, is defined by minX,
minY, width, and height values. The minX and minY values define
the coordinate of the upper left corner of the Raster. References
to pixels outside of the bounding rectangle may result in an
exception being thrown, or may result in references to unintended
elements of the Raster's associated DataBuffer. It is the user's
responsibility to avoid accessing such pixels.

A SampleModel describes how samples of a Raster
are stored in the primitive array elements of a DataBuffer.
Samples may be stored one per data element, as in a
PixelInterleavedSampleModel or BandedSampleModel, or packed several to
an element, as in a SinglePixelPackedSampleModel or
MultiPixelPackedSampleModel. The SampleModel is also
controls whether samples are sign extended, allowing unsigned
data to be stored in signed Java data types such as byte, short, and
int.

Although a Raster may live anywhere in the plane, a SampleModel
makes use of a simple coordinate system that starts at (0, 0). A
Raster therefore contains a translation factor that allows pixel
locations to be mapped between the Raster's coordinate system and
that of the SampleModel. The translation from the SampleModel
coordinate system to that of the Raster may be obtained by the
getSampleModelTranslateX and getSampleModelTranslateY methods.

A Raster may share a DataBuffer with another Raster either by
explicit construction or by the use of the createChild and
createTranslatedChild methods. Rasters created by these methods
can return a reference to the Raster they were created from by
means of the getParent method. For a Raster that was not
constructed by means of a call to createTranslatedChild or
createChild, getParent will return null.

The createTranslatedChild method returns a new Raster that
shares all of the data of the current Raster, but occupies a
bounding rectangle of the same width and height but with a
different starting point. For example, if the parent Raster
occupied the region (10, 10) to (100, 100), and the translated
Raster was defined to start at (50, 50), then pixel (20, 20) of the
parent and pixel (60, 60) of the child occupy the same location in
the DataBuffer shared by the two Rasters. In the first case, (-10,
-10) should be added to a pixel coordinate to obtain the
corresponding SampleModel coordinate, and in the second case (-50,
-50) should be added.

The translation between a parent and child Raster may be
determined by subtracting the child's sampleModelTranslateX and
sampleModelTranslateY values from those of the parent.

The createChild method may be used to create a new Raster
occupying only a subset of its parent's bounding rectangle
(with the same or a translated coordinate system) or
with a subset of the bands of its parent.

All constructors are protected. The correct way to create a
Raster is to use one of the static create methods defined in this
class. These methods create instances of Raster that use the
standard Interleaved, Banded, and Packed SampleModels and that may
be processed more efficiently than a Raster created by combining
an externally generated SampleModel and DataBuffer.

through its getParent() method.

**Parameters:**
- childMinX

- the X coordinate of the upper-left
corner of the new

Raster
- childMinY

- the Y coordinate of the upper-left
corner of the new

Raster

**Returns:**
- a new

Raster

with the same size, SampleModel,
and DataBuffer as this

#### public
Raster
createChild​(int parentX,
int parentY,
int width,
int height,
int childMinX,
int childMinY,
int[] bandList)

Returns a new Raster which shares all or part of this Raster's
DataBuffer. The new Raster will possess a reference to the
current Raster, accessible through its getParent() method.

The parentX, parentY, width and height parameters
form a Rectangle in this Raster's coordinate space,
indicating the area of pixels to be shared. An error will
be thrown if this Rectangle is not contained with the bounds
of the current Raster.

The new Raster may additionally be translated to a
different coordinate system for the plane than that used by the current
Raster. The childMinX and childMinY parameters give the new
(x, y) coordinate of the upper-left pixel of the returned
Raster; the coordinate (childMinX, childMinY) in the new Raster
will map to the same pixel as the coordinate (parentX, parentY)
in the current Raster.

The new Raster may be defined to contain only a subset of
the bands of the current Raster, possibly reordered, by means
of the bandList parameter. If bandList is null, it is taken to
include all of the bands of the current Raster in their current
order.

To create a new Raster that contains a subregion of the current
Raster, but shares its coordinate system and bands,
this method should be called with childMinX equal to parentX,
childMinY equal to parentY, and bandList equal to null.

**Parameters:**
- parentX

- The X coordinate of the upper-left corner
in this Raster's coordinates
- parentY

- The Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
in this Raster's coordinates
- width

- Width of the region starting at (parentX, parentY)
- height

- Height of the region starting at (parentX, parentY).
- childMinX

- The X coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the returned Raster
- childMinY

- The Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
of the returned Raster
- bandList

- Array of band indices, or null to use all bands

**Returns:**
- a new

Raster

.

**Throws:**
- RasterFormatException

- if the specified subregion is outside
of the raster bounds.
- RasterFormatException

- if

width

or

height

is less than or equal to zero, or computing any of

parentX + width

,

parentY + height

,

childMinX + width

, or

childMinY + height

results in integer
overflow

#### Class Raster

**Direct Known Subclasses:** WritableRaster

```java
public class
Raster

extends
Object
```

A class representing a rectangular array of pixels. A Raster
encapsulates a DataBuffer that stores the sample values and a
SampleModel that describes how to locate a given sample value in a
DataBuffer.

A Raster defines values for pixels occupying a particular
rectangular area of the plane, not necessarily including (0, 0).
The rectangle, known as the Raster's bounding rectangle and
available by means of the getBounds method, is defined by minX,
minY, width, and height values. The minX and minY values define
the coordinate of the upper left corner of the Raster. References
to pixels outside of the bounding rectangle may result in an
exception being thrown, or may result in references to unintended
elements of the Raster's associated DataBuffer. It is the user's
responsibility to avoid accessing such pixels.

A SampleModel describes how samples of a Raster
are stored in the primitive array elements of a DataBuffer.
Samples may be stored one per data element, as in a
PixelInterleavedSampleModel or BandedSampleModel, or packed several to
an element, as in a SinglePixelPackedSampleModel or
MultiPixelPackedSampleModel. The SampleModel is also
controls whether samples are sign extended, allowing unsigned
data to be stored in signed Java data types such as byte, short, and
int.

Although a Raster may live anywhere in the plane, a SampleModel
makes use of a simple coordinate system that starts at (0, 0). A
Raster therefore contains a translation factor that allows pixel
locations to be mapped between the Raster's coordinate system and
that of the SampleModel. The translation from the SampleModel
coordinate system to that of the Raster may be obtained by the
getSampleModelTranslateX and getSampleModelTranslateY methods.

A Raster may share a DataBuffer with another Raster either by
explicit construction or by the use of the createChild and
createTranslatedChild methods. Rasters created by these methods
can return a reference to the Raster they were created from by
means of the getParent method. For a Raster that was not
constructed by means of a call to createTranslatedChild or
createChild, getParent will return null.

The createTranslatedChild method returns a new Raster that
shares all of the data of the current Raster, but occupies a
bounding rectangle of the same width and height but with a
different starting point. For example, if the parent Raster
occupied the region (10, 10) to (100, 100), and the translated
Raster was defined to start at (50, 50), then pixel (20, 20) of the
parent and pixel (60, 60) of the child occupy the same location in
the DataBuffer shared by the two Rasters. In the first case, (-10,
-10) should be added to a pixel coordinate to obtain the
corresponding SampleModel coordinate, and in the second case (-50,
-50) should be added.

The translation between a parent and child Raster may be
determined by subtracting the child's sampleModelTranslateX and
sampleModelTranslateY values from those of the parent.

The createChild method may be used to create a new Raster
occupying only a subset of its parent's bounding rectangle
(with the same or a translated coordinate system) or
with a subset of the bands of its parent.

All constructors are protected. The correct way to create a
Raster is to use one of the static create methods defined in this
class. These methods create instances of Raster that use the
standard Interleaved, Banded, and Packed SampleModels and that may
be processed more efficiently than a Raster created by combining
an externally generated SampleModel and DataBuffer.

makes use of a simple coordinate system that starts at (0, 0). A
Raster therefore contains a translation factor that allows pixel
locations to be mapped between the Raster's coordinate system and
that of the SampleModel. The translation from the SampleModel
coordinate system to that of the Raster may be obtained by the
getSampleModelTranslateX and getSampleModelTranslateY methods.

A Raster may share a DataBuffer with another Raster either by
explicit construction or by the use of the createChild and
createTranslatedChild methods. Rasters created by these methods
can return a reference to the Raster they were created from by
means of the getParent method. For a Raster that was not
constructed by means of a call to createTranslatedChild or
createChild, getParent will return null.

The createTranslatedChild method returns a new Raster that
shares all of the data of the current Raster, but occupies a
bounding rectangle of the same width and height but with a
different starting point. For example, if the parent Raster
occupied the region (10, 10) to (100, 100), and the translated
Raster was defined to start at (50, 50), then pixel (20, 20) of the
parent and pixel (60, 60) of the child occupy the same location in
the DataBuffer shared by the two Rasters. In the first case, (-10,
-10) should be added to a pixel coordinate to obtain the
corresponding SampleModel coordinate, and in the second case (-50,
-50) should be added.

The translation between a parent and child Raster may be
determined by subtracting the child's sampleModelTranslateX and
sampleModelTranslateY values from those of the parent.

The createChild method may be used to create a new Raster
occupying only a subset of its parent's bounding rectangle
(with the same or a translated coordinate system) or
with a subset of the bands of its parent.

All constructors are protected. The correct way to create a
Raster is to use one of the static create methods defined in this
class. These methods create instances of Raster that use the
standard Interleaved, Banded, and Packed SampleModels and that may
be processed more efficiently than a Raster created by combining
an externally generated SampleModel and DataBuffer.

```

Returns a new Raster which shares all or part of this Raster's
DataBuffer. The new Raster will possess a reference to the
current Raster, accessible through its getParent() method.

The parentX, parentY, width and height parameters
form a Rectangle in this Raster's coordinate space,
indicating the area of pixels to be shared. An error will
be thrown if this Rectangle is not contained with the bounds
of the current Raster.

The new Raster may additionally be translated to a
different coordinate system for the plane than that used by the current
Raster. The childMinX and childMinY parameters give the new
(x, y) coordinate of the upper-left pixel of the returned
Raster; the coordinate (childMinX, childMinY) in the new Raster
will map to the same pixel as the coordinate (parentX, parentY)
in the current Raster.

The new Raster may be defined to contain only a subset of
the bands of the current Raster, possibly reordered, by means
of the bandList parameter. If bandList is null, it is taken to
include all of the bands of the current Raster in their current
order.

To create a new Raster that contains a subregion of the current
Raster, but shares its coordinate system and bands,
this method should be called with childMinX equal to parentX,
childMinY equal to parentY, and bandList equal to null.

Raster

.
**Throws:** RasterFormatException

- if the specified subregion is outside
of the raster bounds.
**Throws:** RasterFormatException

- if

width

or

height

is less than or equal to zero, or computing any of

parentX + width

,

parentY + height

,

childMinX + width

, or

childMinY + height

results in integer
overflow

#### Raster

protected Raster​(

SampleModel

sampleModel,

DataBuffer

dataBuffer,

Rectangle

aRegion,

Point

sampleModelTranslate,

Raster

parent)

Constructs a Raster with the given SampleModel, DataBuffer, and
parent. aRegion specifies the bounding rectangle of the new
Raster. When translated into the base Raster's coordinate
system, aRegion must be contained by the base Raster.
(The base Raster is the Raster's ancestor which has no parent.)
sampleModelTranslate specifies the sampleModelTranslateX and
sampleModelTranslateY values of the new Raster.

Note that this constructor should generally be called by other
constructors or create methods, it should not be used directly.

DataBuffer. The new Raster will possess a reference to the
current Raster, accessible through its getParent() method.

The parentX, parentY, width and height parameters
form a Rectangle in this Raster's coordinate space,
indicating the area of pixels to be shared. An error will
be thrown if this Rectangle is not contained with the bounds
of the current Raster.

The new Raster may additionally be translated to a
different coordinate system for the plane than that used by the current

(x, y) coordinate of the upper-left pixel of the returned
Raster; the coordinate (childMinX, childMinY) in the new Raster
will map to the same pixel as the coordinate (parentX, parentY)
in the current Raster.

The new Raster may be defined to contain only a subset of
the bands of the current Raster, possibly reordered, by means
of the bandList parameter. If bandList is null, it is taken to
include all of the bands of the current Raster in their current
order.
