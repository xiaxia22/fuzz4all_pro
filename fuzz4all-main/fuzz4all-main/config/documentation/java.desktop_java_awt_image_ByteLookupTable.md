# Class ByteLookupTable

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\ByteLookupTable.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
ByteLookupTable

extends
LookupTable
```

This class defines a lookup table object. The output of a
lookup operation using an object of this class is interpreted
as an unsigned byte quantity. The lookup table contains byte
data arrays for one or more bands (or components) of an image,
and it contains an offset which will be subtracted from the
input values before indexing the arrays. This allows an array
smaller than the native data size to be provided for a
constrained input. If there is only one array in the lookup
table, it will be applied to all bands.

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public ByteLookupTable​(int offset,
byte[][] data)

Constructs a ByteLookupTable object from an array of byte
arrays representing a lookup table for each
band. The offset will be subtracted from input
values before indexing into the arrays. The number of
bands is the length of the data argument. The
data array for each band is stored as a reference.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- the value subtracted from the input values
before indexing into the arrays
- data

- an array of byte arrays representing a lookup
table for each band

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

offset

is
is less than 0 or if the length of

data

is less than 1

---

#### public ByteLookupTable​(int offset,
byte[] data)

Constructs a ByteLookupTable object from an array
of bytes representing a lookup table to be applied to all
bands. The offset will be subtracted from input
values before indexing into the array.
The data array is stored as a reference.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- the value subtracted from the input values
before indexing into the array
- data

- an array of bytes

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

offset

is
is less than 0 or if the length of

data

is less than 1

---

### Method Details

#### public final byte[][] getTable()

Returns the lookup table data by reference. If this ByteLookupTable
was constructed using a single byte array, the length of the returned
array is one.

**Returns:**
- the data array of this

ByteLookupTable

.

---

#### public int[] lookupPixel​(int[] src,
int[] dst)

Returns an array of samples of a pixel, translated with the lookup
table. The source and destination array can be the same array.
Array

dst

is returned.

**Specified by:**
- lookupPixel

in class

LookupTable

**Parameters:**
- src

- the source array.
- dst

- the destination array. This array must be at least as
long as

src

. If

dst

is

null

, a new array will be allocated having the
same length as

src

.

**Returns:**
- the array

dst

, an

int

array of
samples.

**Throws:**
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

src

is
longer than

dst

or if for any element

i

of

src

,

src[i]-offset

is either less than zero or
greater than or equal to the length of the lookup table
for any band.

---

#### public byte[] lookupPixel​(byte[] src,
byte[] dst)

Returns an array of samples of a pixel, translated with the lookup
table. The source and destination array can be the same array.
Array

dst

is returned.

**Parameters:**
- src

- the source array.
- dst

- the destination array. This array must be at least as
long as

src

. If

dst

is

null

, a new array will be allocated having the
same length as

src

.

**Returns:**
- the array

dst

, an

int

array of
samples.

**Throws:**
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

src

is
longer than

dst

or if for any element

i

of

src

,

(src[i]&0xff)-offset

is either less than
zero or greater than or equal to the length of the
lookup table for any band.
