# Interface LSParser

**Source:** `java.xml\org\w3c\dom\ls\LSParser.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
LSParser
```

An interface to an object that is able to build, or augment, a DOM tree
from various input sources.

LSParser

provides an API for parsing XML and building the
corresponding DOM document structure. A

LSParser

instance
can be obtained by invoking the

DOMImplementationLS.createLSParser()

method.

As specified in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, when a document is first made available via the LSParser:

- there will
never be two adjacent nodes of type NODE_TEXT, and there will never be
empty text nodes.
- it is expected that the

value

and

nodeValue

attributes of an

Attr

node initially
return the

XML 1.0
normalized value

. However, if the parameters
"

validate-if-schema

" and
"

datatype-normalization

"
are set to

true

, depending on the attribute normalization
used, the attribute values may differ from the ones obtained by the XML
1.0 attribute normalization. If the parameters
"

datatype-normalization

"
is set to

false

, the XML 1.0 attribute normalization is
guaranteed to occur, and if the attributes list does not contain
namespace declarations, the

attributes

attribute on

Element

node represents the property

[attributes]

defined in
[

XML Information Set

].

Asynchronous

LSParser

objects are expected to also
implement the

events::EventTarget

interface so that event
listeners can be registered on asynchronous

LSParser

objects.

Events supported by asynchronous

LSParser

objects are:

**load:** The

LSParser

finishes to load the document. See also the
definition of the

LSLoadEvent

interface.
**progress:** The

LSParser

signals progress as data is parsed. This
specification does not attempt to define exactly when progress events
should be dispatched. That is intentionally left as
implementation-dependent. Here is one example of how an application might
dispatch progress events: Once the parser starts receiving data, a
progress event is dispatched to indicate that the parsing starts. From
there on, a progress event is dispatched for every 4096 bytes of data
that is received and processed. This is only one example, though, and
implementations can choose to dispatch progress events at any time while
parsing, or not dispatch them at all. See also the definition of the

LSProgressEvent

interface.

Note:

All events defined in this specification use the
namespace URI

"http://www.w3.org/2002/DOMLS"

.

While parsing an input source, errors are reported to the application
through the error handler (

LSParser.domConfig

's
"

error-handler

"
parameter). This specification does in no way try to define all possible
errors that can occur while parsing XML, or any other markup, but some
common error cases are defined. The types (

DOMError.type

) of
errors and warnings defined by this specification are:

**"check-character-normalization-failure" [error]:** Raised if the parameter
"

check-character-normalization

"
is set to true and a string is encountered that fails normalization
checking.
**"doctype-not-allowed" [fatal]:** Raised if the
configuration parameter "disallow-doctype" is set to

true

and a doctype is encountered.
**"no-input-specified" [fatal]:** Raised when loading a document and no input is specified in the

LSInput

object.
**"pi-base-uri-not-preserved" [warning]:** Raised if a processing
instruction is encountered in a location where the base URI of the
processing instruction can not be preserved. One example of a case where
this warning will be raised is if the configuration parameter
"

entities

"
is set to

false

and the following XML file is parsed:

```java
<!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY e SYSTEM 'subdir/myentity.ent' ]>
<root> &e; </root>
```

And

subdir/myentity.ent

contains:

```java
<one> <two/> </one> <?pi 3.14159?>
<more/>
```
**"unbound-prefix-in-entity" [warning]:** An
implementation dependent warning that may be raised if the configuration parameter
"

namespaces

"
is set to

true

and an unbound namespace prefix is
encountered in an entity's replacement text. Raising this warning is not
enforced since some existing parsers may not recognize unbound namespace
prefixes in the replacement text of entities.
**"unknown-character-denormalization" [fatal]:** Raised if the
configuration parameter "ignore-unknown-character-denormalizations" is
set to

false

and a character is encountered for which the
processor cannot determine the normalization properties.
**"unsupported-encoding" [fatal]:** Raised if an unsupported
encoding is encountered.
**"unsupported-media-type" [fatal]:** Raised if the configuration parameter "supported-media-types-only" is set
to

true

and an unsupported media type is encountered.

In addition to raising the defined errors and warnings, implementations
are expected to raise implementation specific errors and warnings for any
other error and warning cases such as IO errors (file not found,
permission denied,...), XML well-formedness errors, and so on.

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load and Save Specification

LSParser

finishes to load the document. See also the

### Constructor Details

*No entries found.*

### Method Details

#### DOMConfiguration
getDomConfig()

The

DOMConfiguration

object used when parsing an input
source. This

DOMConfiguration

is specific to the parse
operation. No parameter values from this

DOMConfiguration

object are passed automatically to the

DOMConfiguration

object on the

Document

that is created, or used, by the
parse operation. The DOM application is responsible for passing any
needed parameter values from this

DOMConfiguration

object to the

DOMConfiguration

object referenced by the

Document

object.

In addition to the parameters recognized in on the

DOMConfiguration

interface defined in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, the

DOMConfiguration

objects for

LSParser

add or modify the following parameters:

**"charset-overrides-xml-encoding":** **true:** [

optional

] (

default

) If a higher level protocol such as HTTP
[

IETF RFC 2616

] provides an
indication of the character encoding of the input stream being
processed, that will override any encoding specified in the XML
declaration or the Text declaration (see also section 4.3.3,
"Character Encoding in Entities", in [

XML 1.0

]).
Explicitly setting an encoding in the

LSInput

overrides
any encoding from the protocol.
**false:** [

required

] The parser ignores any character set encoding information from
higher-level protocols.
**"disallow-doctype":** **true:** [

optional

] Throw a fatal

"doctype-not-allowed"

error
if a doctype node is found while parsing the document. This is
useful when dealing with things like SOAP envelopes where doctype
nodes are not allowed.
**false:** [

required

] (

default

) Allow doctype nodes in the document.
**"ignore-unknown-character-denormalizations":** **true:** [

required

] (

default

) If, while verifying full normalization when
[

XML 1.1

] is
supported, a processor encounters characters for which it cannot
determine the normalization properties, then the processor will
ignore any possible denormalizations caused by these characters.
This parameter is ignored for [

XML 1.0

].
**false:** [

optional

] Report an fatal

"unknown-character-denormalization"

error if a character is encountered for which the processor cannot
determine the normalization properties.

required

] A reference to a

LSResourceResolver

object, or null. If
the value of this parameter is not null when an external resource
(such as an external XML entity or an XML schema location) is
encountered, the implementation will request that the

LSResourceResolver

referenced in this parameter resolves
the resource.
**"supported-media-types-only":** **true:** [

optional

] Check that the media type of the parsed resource is a supported media
type. If an unsupported media type is encountered, a fatal error of

will be raised. The media types defined in
[

IETF RFC 3023

] must always
be accepted.
**false:** [

required

] (

default

#### LSParserFilter
getFilter()

When a filter is provided, the implementation will call out to the
filter as it is constructing the DOM tree structure. The filter can
choose to remove elements from the document being constructed, or to
terminate the parsing early.

The filter is invoked after the operations requested by the

DOMConfiguration

parameters have been applied. For
example, if "

validate

"
is set to

true

, the validation is done before invoking the
filter.

---

#### void setFilter​(
LSParserFilter
filter)

When a filter is provided, the implementation will call out to the
filter as it is constructing the DOM tree structure. The filter can
choose to remove elements from the document being constructed, or to
terminate the parsing early.

The filter is invoked after the operations requested by the

DOMConfiguration

parameters have been applied. For
example, if "

validate

"
is set to

true

, the validation is done before invoking the
filter.

---

#### boolean getAsync()

true

if the

LSParser

is asynchronous,

false

if it is synchronous.

---

#### boolean getBusy()

true

if the

LSParser

is currently busy
loading a document, otherwise

false

.

---

#### Document
parse​(
LSInput
input)
throws
DOMException
,

LSException

Parse an XML document from a resource identified by a

LSInput

.

**Parameters:**
- input

- The

LSInput

from which the source of the
document is to be read.

**Returns:**
- If the

LSParser

is a synchronous

LSParser

, the newly created and populated

Document

is returned. If the

LSParser

is
asynchronous,

null

is returned since the document
object may not yet be constructed when this method returns.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

's

LSParser.busy

attribute is

true

.
- LSException

- PARSE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

was unable to load
the XML document. DOM applications should attach a

DOMErrorHandler

using the parameter
"

error-handler

"
if they wish to get details on the error.

---

#### Document
parseURI​(
String
uri)
throws
DOMException
,

LSException

Parse an XML document from a location identified by a URI reference
[

IETF RFC 2396

]. If the URI
contains a fragment identifier (see section 4.1 in
[

IETF RFC 2396

]), the
behavior is not defined by this specification, future versions of
this specification may define the behavior.

**Parameters:**
- uri

- The location of the XML document to be read.

**Returns:**
- If the

LSParser

is a synchronous

LSParser

, the newly created and populated

Document

is returned, or

null

if an error
occured. If the

LSParser

is asynchronous,

null

is returned since the document object may not yet
be constructed when this method returns.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser.busy

attribute is

true

.
- LSException

- PARSE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

was unable to load
the XML document. DOM applications should attach a

DOMErrorHandler

using the parameter
"

error-handler

"
if they wish to get details on the error.

---

#### Node
parseWithContext​(
LSInput
input,

Node
contextArg,
short action)
throws
DOMException
,

LSException

Parse an XML fragment from a resource identified by a

LSInput

and insert the content into an existing document
at the position specified with the

context

and

action

arguments. When parsing the input stream, the
context node (or its parent, depending on where the result will be
inserted) is used for resolving unbound namespace prefixes. The
context node's

ownerDocument

node (or the node itself if
the node of type

DOCUMENT_NODE

) is used to resolve
default attributes and entity references.

As the new data is inserted into the document, at least one
mutation event is fired per new immediate child or sibling of the
context node.

If the context node is a

Document

node and the action
is

ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN

, then the document that is
passed as the context node will be changed such that its

xmlEncoding

,

documentURI

,

xmlVersion

,

inputEncoding

,

xmlStandalone

, and all other such attributes are set to
what they would be set to if the input source was parsed using

LSParser.parse()

.

This method is always synchronous, even if the

LSParser

is asynchronous (

LSParser.async

is

true

).

If an error occurs while parsing, the caller is notified through
the

ErrorHandler

instance associated with the
"

error-handler

"
parameter of the

DOMConfiguration

.

When calling

parseWithContext

, the values of the
following configuration parameters will be ignored and their default
values will always be used instead:
"

validate

",
"

validate-if-schema

",
and
"

element-content-whitespace

".
Other parameters will be treated normally, and the parser is expected
to call the

LSParserFilter

just as if a whole document
was parsed.

**Parameters:**
- input

- The

LSInput

from which the source document
is to be read. The source document must be an XML fragment, i.e.
anything except a complete XML document (except in the case where
the context node of type

DOCUMENT_NODE

, and the action
is

ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN

), a DOCTYPE (internal
subset), entity declaration(s), notation declaration(s), or XML or
text declaration(s).
- contextArg

- The node that is used as the context for the data
that is being parsed. This node must be a

Document

node, a

DocumentFragment

node, or a node of a type
that is allowed as a child of an

Element

node, e.g. it
cannot be an

Attribute

node.
- action

- This parameter describes which action should be taken
between the new set of nodes being inserted and the existing
children of the context node. The set of possible actions is
defined in

ACTION_TYPES

above.

**Returns:**
- Return the node that is the result of the parse operation. If
the result is more than one top-level node, the first one is
returned.

**Throws:**
- DOMException

- HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if the content cannot replace, be
inserted before, after, or as a child of the context node (see also

Node.insertBefore

or

Node.replaceChild

in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
).

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

doesn't
support this method, or if the context node is of type

Document

and the DOM implementation doesn't support
the replacement of the

DocumentType

child or

Element

child.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if the context node is a
read only node and the content is being appended to its child list,
or if the parent node of the context node is read only node and the
content is being inserted in its child list.

INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser.busy

attribute is

true

.
- LSException

- PARSE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

was unable to load
the XML fragment. DOM applications should attach a

DOMErrorHandler

using the parameter
"

error-handler

"
if they wish to get details on the error.

---

#### void abort()

Abort the loading of the document that is currently being loaded by
the

LSParser

. If the

LSParser

is currently
not busy, a call to this method does nothing.

LSParser
```

An interface to an object that is able to build, or augment, a DOM tree
from various input sources.

LSParser

provides an API for parsing XML and building the
corresponding DOM document structure. A

LSParser

instance
can be obtained by invoking the

DOMImplementationLS.createLSParser()

method.

As specified in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, when a document is first made available via the LSParser:

- there will
never be two adjacent nodes of type NODE_TEXT, and there will never be
empty text nodes.
- it is expected that the

normalized value

. However, if the parameters
"

validate-if-schema

" and
"

datatype-normalization

"
are set to

true

, depending on the attribute normalization
used, the attribute values may differ from the ones obtained by the XML
1.0 attribute normalization. If the parameters
"

datatype-normalization

"
is set to

false

, the XML 1.0 attribute normalization is
guaranteed to occur, and if the attributes list does not contain
namespace declarations, the

attributes

attribute on

Element

node represents the property

[attributes]

defined in
[

XML Information Set

].

Asynchronous

LSParser

objects are expected to also
implement the

events::EventTarget

interface so that event
listeners can be registered on asynchronous

LSParser

objects.

Events supported by asynchronous

LSParser

objects are:

**load:** The

LSParser

finishes to load the document. See also the
definition of the

LSLoadEvent

interface.
**progress:** The

LSParser

signals progress as data is parsed. This
specification does not attempt to define exactly when progress events
should be dispatched. That is intentionally left as
implementation-dependent. Here is one example of how an application might
dispatch progress events: Once the parser starts receiving data, a
progress event is dispatched to indicate that the parsing starts. From
there on, a progress event is dispatched for every 4096 bytes of data
that is received and processed. This is only one example, though, and
implementations can choose to dispatch progress events at any time while
parsing, or not dispatch them at all. See also the definition of the

LSProgressEvent

interface.

Note:

All events defined in this specification use the
namespace URI

"http://www.w3.org/2002/DOMLS"

.

While parsing an input source, errors are reported to the application
through the error handler (

LSParser.domConfig

's
"

error-handler

"
parameter). This specification does in no way try to define all possible
errors that can occur while parsing XML, or any other markup, but some
common error cases are defined. The types (

DOMError.type

) of
errors and warnings defined by this specification are:

**"check-character-normalization-failure" [error]:** Raised if the parameter
"

check-character-normalization

"
is set to true and a string is encountered that fails normalization
checking.
**"doctype-not-allowed" [fatal]:** Raised if the
configuration parameter "disallow-doctype" is set to

true

and a doctype is encountered.
**"no-input-specified" [fatal]:** Raised when loading a document and no input is specified in the

LSInput

object.
**"pi-base-uri-not-preserved" [warning]:** Raised if a processing
instruction is encountered in a location where the base URI of the
processing instruction can not be preserved. One example of a case where
this warning will be raised is if the configuration parameter
"

entities

"
is set to

false

and the following XML file is parsed:

```java
<!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY e SYSTEM 'subdir/myentity.ent' ]>
<root> &e; </root>
```

And

subdir/myentity.ent

contains:

```java
<one> <two/> </one> <?pi 3.14159?>
<more/>
```
**"unbound-prefix-in-entity" [warning]:** An
implementation dependent warning that may be raised if the configuration parameter
"

namespaces

"
is set to

true

and an unbound namespace prefix is
encountered in an entity's replacement text. Raising this warning is not
enforced since some existing parsers may not recognize unbound namespace
prefixes in the replacement text of entities.
**"unknown-character-denormalization" [fatal]:** Raised if the
configuration parameter "ignore-unknown-character-denormalizations" is
set to

false

and a character is encountered for which the
processor cannot determine the normalization properties.
**"unsupported-encoding" [fatal]:** Raised if an unsupported
encoding is encountered.
**"unsupported-media-type" [fatal]:** Raised if the configuration parameter "supported-media-types-only" is set
to

true

and an unsupported media type is encountered.

In addition to raising the defined errors and warnings, implementations
are expected to raise implementation specific errors and warnings for any
other error and warning cases such as IO errors (file not found,
permission denied,...), XML well-formedness errors, and so on.

signals progress as data is parsed. This
specification does not attempt to define exactly when progress events
should be dispatched. That is intentionally left as
implementation-dependent. Here is one example of how an application might
dispatch progress events: Once the parser starts receiving data, a
progress event is dispatched to indicate that the parsing starts. From
there on, a progress event is dispatched for every 4096 bytes of data
that is received and processed. This is only one example, though, and
implementations can choose to dispatch progress events at any time while
parsing, or not dispatch them at all. See also the definition of the

LSProgressEvent

interface.

Note:

All events defined in this specification use the
namespace URI

"http://www.w3.org/2002/DOMLS"

.

While parsing an input source, errors are reported to the application
through the error handler (

LSParser.domConfig

's
"

error-handler

"
parameter). This specification does in no way try to define all possible
errors that can occur while parsing XML, or any other markup, but some
common error cases are defined. The types (

DOMError.type

) of
errors and warnings defined by this specification are:

**"check-character-normalization-failure" [error]:** Raised if the parameter
"

check-character-normalization

"
is set to true and a string is encountered that fails normalization
checking.
**"doctype-not-allowed" [fatal]:** Raised if the
configuration parameter "disallow-doctype" is set to

true

and a doctype is encountered.
**"no-input-specified" [fatal]:** Raised when loading a document and no input is specified in the

LSInput

object.
**"pi-base-uri-not-preserved" [warning]:** Raised if a processing
instruction is encountered in a location where the base URI of the
processing instruction can not be preserved. One example of a case where
this warning will be raised is if the configuration parameter
"

entities

"
is set to

false

and the following XML file is parsed:

```java
<!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY e SYSTEM 'subdir/myentity.ent' ]>
<root> &e; </root>
```

And

subdir/myentity.ent

contains:

```java
<one> <two/> </one> <?pi 3.14159?>
<more/>
```
**"unbound-prefix-in-entity" [warning]:** An
implementation dependent warning that may be raised if the configuration parameter
"

namespaces

"
is set to

true

and an unbound namespace prefix is
encountered in an entity's replacement text. Raising this warning is not
enforced since some existing parsers may not recognize unbound namespace
prefixes in the replacement text of entities.
**"unknown-character-denormalization" [fatal]:** Raised if the
configuration parameter "ignore-unknown-character-denormalizations" is
set to

false

and a character is encountered for which the
processor cannot determine the normalization properties.
**"unsupported-encoding" [fatal]:** Raised if an unsupported
encoding is encountered.
**"unsupported-media-type" [fatal]:** Raised if the configuration parameter "supported-media-types-only" is set
to

true

and an unsupported media type is encountered.

In addition to raising the defined errors and warnings, implementations
are expected to raise implementation specific errors and warnings for any
other error and warning cases such as IO errors (file not found,
permission denied,...), XML well-formedness errors, and so on.

LSParser

provides an API for parsing XML and building the
corresponding DOM document structure. A

LSParser

instance
can be obtained by invoking the

DOMImplementationLS.createLSParser()

method.

As specified in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, when a document is first made available via the LSParser:

- there will
never be two adjacent nodes of type NODE_TEXT, and there will never be
empty text nodes.
- it is expected that the

value

and

nodeValue

attributes of an

Attr

node initially
return the

XML 1.0
normalized value

. However, if the parameters
"

validate-if-schema

" and
"

datatype-normalization

"
are set to

true

, depending on the attribute normalization
used, the attribute values may differ from the ones obtained by the XML
1.0 attribute normalization. If the parameters
"

datatype-normalization

"
is set to

false

, the XML 1.0 attribute normalization is
guaranteed to occur, and if the attributes list does not contain
namespace declarations, the

attributes

attribute on

Element

node represents the property

[attributes]

defined in

objects are expected to also
implement the

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getDomConfig

```java
DOMConfiguration
getDomConfig()
```

The

DOMConfiguration

object used when parsing an input
source. This

DOMConfiguration

is specific to the parse
operation. No parameter values from this

DOMConfiguration

object are passed automatically to the

DOMConfiguration

object on the

Document

that is created, or used, by the
parse operation. The DOM application is responsible for passing any
needed parameter values from this

DOMConfiguration

object to the

DOMConfiguration

object referenced by the

Document

object.

In addition to the parameters recognized in on the

DOMConfiguration

interface defined in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, the

DOMConfiguration

objects for

LSParser

add or modify the following parameters:

**"charset-overrides-xml-encoding":** **true:** [

optional

] (

default

) If a higher level protocol such as HTTP
[

IETF RFC 2616

] provides an
indication of the character encoding of the input stream being
processed, that will override any encoding specified in the XML
declaration or the Text declaration (see also section 4.3.3,
"Character Encoding in Entities", in [

XML 1.0

]).
Explicitly setting an encoding in the

LSInput

overrides
any encoding from the protocol.
**false:** [

required

] The parser ignores any character set encoding information from
higher-level protocols.
**"disallow-doctype":** **true:** [

optional

] Throw a fatal

"doctype-not-allowed"

error
if a doctype node is found while parsing the document. This is
useful when dealing with things like SOAP envelopes where doctype
nodes are not allowed.
**false:** [

required

] (

default

) Allow doctype nodes in the document.
**"ignore-unknown-character-denormalizations":** **true:** [

required

] (

default

) If, while verifying full normalization when
[

XML 1.1

] is
supported, a processor encounters characters for which it cannot
determine the normalization properties, then the processor will
ignore any possible denormalizations caused by these characters.
This parameter is ignored for [

XML 1.0

].
**false:** [

optional

] Report an fatal

"unknown-character-denormalization"

error if a character is encountered for which the processor cannot
determine the normalization properties.
**"infoset":** See
the definition of

DOMConfiguration

for a description of
this parameter. Unlike in [

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, this parameter will default to

true

for

LSParser

.
**"namespaces":** **true:** [

required

] (

default

) Perform the namespace processing as defined in
[

XML Namespaces

]
and [

XML Namespaces 1.1

]
.
**false:** [

optional

] Do not perform the namespace processing.
**"resource-resolver":** [

required

] A reference to a

LSResourceResolver

object, or null. If
the value of this parameter is not null when an external resource
(such as an external XML entity or an XML schema location) is
encountered, the implementation will request that the

LSResourceResolver

referenced in this parameter resolves
the resource.
**"supported-media-types-only":** **true:** [

optional

] Check that the media type of the parsed resource is a supported media
type. If an unsupported media type is encountered, a fatal error of
type

"unsupported-media-type"

will be raised. The media types defined in
[

IETF RFC 3023

] must always
be accepted.
**false:** [

required

] (

default

) Accept any media type.
**"validate":** See the definition of

DOMConfiguration

for a description of this parameter.
Unlike in [

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, the processing of the internal subset is always accomplished, even
if this parameter is set to

false

.
**"validate-if-schema":** See the definition of

DOMConfiguration

for a description of this parameter.
Unlike in [

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, the processing of the internal subset is always accomplished, even
if this parameter is set to

false

.
**"well-formed":** See the definition of

DOMConfiguration

for a description of this parameter.
Unlike in [

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, this parameter cannot be set to

false

.

- getFilter

```java
LSParserFilter
getFilter()
```

When a filter is provided, the implementation will call out to the
filter as it is constructing the DOM tree structure. The filter can
choose to remove elements from the document being constructed, or to
terminate the parsing early.

The filter is invoked after the operations requested by the

DOMConfiguration

parameters have been applied. For
example, if "

validate

"
is set to

true

, the validation is done before invoking the
filter.

- setFilter

```java
void setFilter​(
LSParserFilter
filter)
```

When a filter is provided, the implementation will call out to the
filter as it is constructing the DOM tree structure. The filter can
choose to remove elements from the document being constructed, or to
terminate the parsing early.

The filter is invoked after the operations requested by the

DOMConfiguration

parameters have been applied. For
example, if "

validate

"
is set to

true

, the validation is done before invoking the
filter.

- getAsync

```java
boolean getAsync()
```

true

if the

LSParser

is asynchronous,

false

if it is synchronous.

- getBusy

```java
boolean getBusy()
```

true

if the

LSParser

is currently busy
loading a document, otherwise

false

.

- parse

```java
Document
parse​(
LSInput
input)
throws
DOMException
,

LSException
```

Parse an XML document from a resource identified by a

LSInput

.

**Parameters:** input

- The

LSInput

from which the source of the
document is to be read.
**Returns:** If the

LSParser

is a synchronous

LSParser

, the newly created and populated

Document

is returned. If the

LSParser

is
asynchronous,

null

is returned since the document
object may not yet be constructed when this method returns.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

's

LSParser.busy

attribute is

true

.
**Throws:** LSException

- PARSE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

was unable to load
the XML document. DOM applications should attach a

DOMErrorHandler

using the parameter
"

error-handler

"
if they wish to get details on the error.

- parseURI

```java
Document
parseURI​(
String
uri)
throws
DOMException
,

LSException
```

Parse an XML document from a location identified by a URI reference
[

IETF RFC 2396

]. If the URI
contains a fragment identifier (see section 4.1 in
[

IETF RFC 2396

]), the
behavior is not defined by this specification, future versions of
this specification may define the behavior.

**Parameters:** uri

- The location of the XML document to be read.
**Returns:** If the

LSParser

is a synchronous

LSParser

, the newly created and populated

Document

is returned, or

null

if an error
occured. If the

LSParser

is asynchronous,

null

is returned since the document object may not yet
be constructed when this method returns.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser.busy

attribute is

true

.
**Throws:** LSException

- PARSE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

was unable to load
the XML document. DOM applications should attach a

DOMErrorHandler

using the parameter
"

error-handler

"
if they wish to get details on the error.

- parseWithContext

```java
Node
parseWithContext​(
LSInput
input,

Node
contextArg,
short action)
throws
DOMException
,

LSException
```

Parse an XML fragment from a resource identified by a

LSInput

and insert the content into an existing document
at the position specified with the

context

and

action

arguments. When parsing the input stream, the
context node (or its parent, depending on where the result will be
inserted) is used for resolving unbound namespace prefixes. The
context node's

ownerDocument

node (or the node itself if
the node of type

DOCUMENT_NODE

) is used to resolve
default attributes and entity references.

As the new data is inserted into the document, at least one
mutation event is fired per new immediate child or sibling of the
context node.

If the context node is a

Document

node and the action
is

ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN

, then the document that is
passed as the context node will be changed such that its

xmlEncoding

,

documentURI

,

xmlVersion

,

inputEncoding

,

xmlStandalone

, and all other such attributes are set to
what they would be set to if the input source was parsed using

LSParser.parse()

.

This method is always synchronous, even if the

LSParser

is asynchronous (

LSParser.async

is

true

).

If an error occurs while parsing, the caller is notified through
the

ErrorHandler

instance associated with the
"

error-handler

"
parameter of the

DOMConfiguration

.

When calling

parseWithContext

, the values of the
following configuration parameters will be ignored and their default
values will always be used instead:
"

validate

",
"

validate-if-schema

",
and
"

element-content-whitespace

".
Other parameters will be treated normally, and the parser is expected
to call the

LSParserFilter

just as if a whole document
was parsed.

**Parameters:** input

- The

LSInput

from which the source document
is to be read. The source document must be an XML fragment, i.e.
anything except a complete XML document (except in the case where
the context node of type

DOCUMENT_NODE

, and the action
is

ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN

), a DOCTYPE (internal
subset), entity declaration(s), notation declaration(s), or XML or
text declaration(s).
**Parameters:** contextArg

- The node that is used as the context for the data
that is being parsed. This node must be a

Document

node, a

DocumentFragment

node, or a node of a type
that is allowed as a child of an

Element

node, e.g. it
cannot be an

Attribute

node.
**Parameters:** action

- This parameter describes which action should be taken
between the new set of nodes being inserted and the existing
children of the context node. The set of possible actions is
defined in

ACTION_TYPES

above.
**Returns:** Return the node that is the result of the parse operation. If
the result is more than one top-level node, the first one is
returned.
**Throws:** DOMException

- HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if the content cannot replace, be
inserted before, after, or as a child of the context node (see also

Node.insertBefore

or

Node.replaceChild

in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
).

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

doesn't
support this method, or if the context node is of type

Document

and the DOM implementation doesn't support
the replacement of the

DocumentType

child or

Element

child.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if the context node is a
read only node and the content is being appended to its child list,
or if the parent node of the context node is read only node and the
content is being inserted in its child list.

INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser.busy

attribute is

true

.
**Throws:** LSException

- PARSE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

was unable to load
the XML fragment. DOM applications should attach a

DOMErrorHandler

using the parameter
"

error-handler

"
if they wish to get details on the error.

- abort

```java
void abort()
```

Abort the loading of the document that is currently being loaded by
the

LSParser

. If the

LSParser

is currently
not busy, a call to this method does nothing.

object.

In addition to the parameters recognized in on the

DOMConfiguration

interface defined in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, the

DOMConfiguration

objects for

LSParser

add or modify the following parameters:

**"charset-overrides-xml-encoding":** **true:** [

optional

] (

default

) If a higher level protocol such as HTTP
[

IETF RFC 2616

"Character Encoding in Entities", in [

XML 1.0

]).
Explicitly setting an encoding in the

LSInput

overrides
any encoding from the protocol.
**false:** [

required

] The parser ignores any character set encoding information from

referenced in this parameter resolves
the resource.
**"supported-media-types-only":** **true:** [

optional

] Check that the media type of the parsed resource is a supported media
type. If an unsupported media type is encountered, a fatal error of

- getFilter

```java
LSParserFilter
getFilter()
```

When a filter is provided, the implementation will call out to the
filter as it is constructing the DOM tree structure. The filter can
choose to remove elements from the document being constructed, or to
terminate the parsing early.

The filter is invoked after the operations requested by the

DOMConfiguration

parameters have been applied. For
example, if "

validate

"
is set to

true

, the validation is done before invoking the
filter.

- setFilter

```java
void setFilter​(
LSParserFilter
filter)
```

When a filter is provided, the implementation will call out to the
filter as it is constructing the DOM tree structure. The filter can
choose to remove elements from the document being constructed, or to
terminate the parsing early.

The filter is invoked after the operations requested by the

DOMConfiguration

parameters have been applied. For
example, if "

validate

"
is set to

true

, the validation is done before invoking the
filter.

- getAsync

```java
boolean getAsync()
```

if the

LSParser

is asynchronous,

false

if it is synchronous.

- getBusy

```java
boolean getBusy()
```

true

if the

LSParser

is currently busy
loading a document, otherwise

false

.

- parse

```java
Document
parse​(
LSInput
input)
throws
DOMException
,

LSException
```

Parse an XML document from a resource identified by a

LSInput

.

**Parameters:** input

- The

LSInput

from which the source of the
document is to be read.
**Returns:** If the

LSParser

is a synchronous

LSParser

, the newly created and populated

Document

is returned. If the

LSParser

is
asynchronous,

null

is returned since the document
object may not yet be constructed when this method returns.
**Throws:** DOMException

- INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

's

LSParser.busy

attribute is

true

.
**Throws:** LSException

- PARSE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

was unable to load
the XML document. DOM applications should attach a

DOMErrorHandler

using the parameter
"

error-handler

"
if they wish to get details on the error.

- parseURI

```java
Document
parseURI​(
String
uri)
throws
DOMException
,

LSException
```

Parse an XML document from a location identified by a URI reference
[

IETF RFC 2396

]. If the URI
contains a fragment identifier (see section 4.1 in
[

IETF RFC 2396

]), the
behavior is not defined by this specification, future versions of
this specification may define the behavior.

**Parameters:** uri

- The location of the XML document to be read.
**Returns:** If the

LSParser

is a synchronous

LSParser

, the newly created and populated

Document

is returned, or

null

if an error
occured. If the

- parseWithContext

```java
Node
parseWithContext​(
LSInput
input,

Node
contextArg,
short action)
throws
DOMException
,

LSException
```

Parse an XML fragment from a resource identified by a

LSInput

and insert the content into an existing document
at the position specified with the

context

and

action

arguments. When parsing the input stream, the
context node (or its parent, depending on where the result will be
inserted) is used for resolving unbound namespace prefixes. The
context node's

ownerDocument

node (or the node itself if
the node of type

DOCUMENT_NODE

) is used to resolve
default attributes and entity references.

As the new data is inserted into the document, at least one
mutation event is fired per new immediate child or sibling of the
context node.

If the context node is a

Document

node and the action
is

ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN

, then the document that is
passed as the context node will be changed such that its

xmlEncoding

,

documentURI

,

xmlVersion

,

inputEncoding

,

xmlStandalone

, and all other such attributes are set to
what they would be set to if the input source was parsed using

LSParser.parse()

.

This method is always synchronous, even if the

LSParser

is asynchronous (

LSParser.async

is

true

).

If an error occurs while parsing, the caller is notified through
the

ErrorHandler

instance associated with the
"

error-handler

"
parameter of the

DOMConfiguration

.

When calling

parseWithContext

, the values of the
following configuration parameters will be ignored and their default
values will always be used instead:
"

validate

",
"

validate-if-schema

",
and
"

element-content-whitespace

".
Other parameters will be treated normally, and the parser is expected
to call the

LSParserFilter

just as if a whole document
was parsed.

**Parameters:** input

- The

LSInput

from which the source document
is to be read. The source document must be an XML fragment, i.e.
anything except a complete XML document (except in the case where
the context node of type

DOCUMENT_NODE

, and the action
is

ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN

), a DOCTYPE (internal
subset), entity declaration(s), notation declaration(s), or XML or
text declaration(s).
**Parameters:** contextArg

- The node that is used as the context for the data
that is being parsed. This node must be a

Document

node, a

DocumentFragment

node, or a node of a type
that is allowed as a child of an

Element

node, e.g. it
cannot be an

Attribute

node.
**Parameters:** action

- This parameter describes which action should be taken
between the new set of nodes being inserted and the existing
children of the context node. The set of possible actions is
defined in

ACTION_TYPES

above.
**Returns:** Return the node that is the result of the parse operation. If
the result is more than one top-level node, the first one is
returned.
**Throws:** DOMException

- HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if the content cannot replace, be
inserted before, after, or as a child of the context node (see also

Node.insertBefore

or

Node.replaceChild

in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
).

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

doesn't
support this method, or if the context node is of type

Document

and the DOM implementation doesn't support
the replacement of the

DocumentType

child or

Element

child.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if the context node is a
read only node and the content is being appended to its child list,
or if the parent node of the context node is read only node and the
content is being inserted in its child list.

INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser.busy

attribute is

true

.
**Throws:** LSException

- PARSE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

was unable to load
the XML fragment. DOM applications should attach a

DOMErrorHandler

using the parameter
"

error-handler

"
if they wish to get details on the error.

- abort

```java
void abort()
```

Abort the loading of the document that is currently being loaded by
the

LSParser

. If the

LSParser

is currently
not busy, a call to this method does nothing.

#### Method Detail

getDomConfig

```java
DOMConfiguration
getDomConfig()
```

The

DOMConfiguration

object used when parsing an input
source. This

DOMConfiguration

is specific to the parse
operation. No parameter values from this

DOMConfiguration

object are passed automatically to the

DOMConfiguration

object on the

Document

that is created, or used, by the
parse operation. The DOM application is responsible for passing any
needed parameter values from this

DOMConfiguration

object to the

DOMConfiguration

object referenced by the

Document

object.

In addition to the parameters recognized in on the

DOMConfiguration

interface defined in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, the

DOMConfiguration

objects for

LSParser

add or modify the following parameters:

**"charset-overrides-xml-encoding":** **true:** [

optional

] (

default

) If a higher level protocol such as HTTP
[

IETF RFC 2616

] provides an
indication of the character encoding of the input stream being
processed, that will override any encoding specified in the XML
declaration or the Text declaration (see also section 4.3.3,
"Character Encoding in Entities", in [

XML 1.0

]).
Explicitly setting an encoding in the

LSInput

overrides
any encoding from the protocol.
**false:** [

required

] The parser ignores any character set encoding information from
higher-level protocols.
**"disallow-doctype":** **true:** [

optional

] Throw a fatal

"doctype-not-allowed"

error
if a doctype node is found while parsing the document. This is
useful when dealing with things like SOAP envelopes where doctype
nodes are not allowed.
**false:** [

required

] (

default

) Allow doctype nodes in the document.
**"ignore-unknown-character-denormalizations":** **true:** [

required

] (

default

) If, while verifying full normalization when
[

XML 1.1

] is
supported, a processor encounters characters for which it cannot
determine the normalization properties, then the processor will
ignore any possible denormalizations caused by these characters.
This parameter is ignored for [

XML 1.0

].
**false:** [

optional

] Report an fatal

"unknown-character-denormalization"

error if a character is encountered for which the processor cannot
determine the normalization properties.
**"infoset":** See
the definition of

DOMConfiguration

for a description of
this parameter. Unlike in [

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, this parameter will default to

true

for

LSParser

.
**"namespaces":** **true:** [

required

] (

default

) Perform the namespace processing as defined in
[

XML Namespaces

]
and [

XML Namespaces 1.1

]
.
**false:** [

optional

] Do not perform the namespace processing.
**"resource-resolver":** [

required

] A reference to a

LSResourceResolver

object, or null. If
the value of this parameter is not null when an external resource
(such as an external XML entity or an XML schema location) is
encountered, the implementation will request that the

LSResourceResolver

referenced in this parameter resolves
the resource.
**"supported-media-types-only":** **true:** [

optional

] Check that the media type of the parsed resource is a supported media
type. If an unsupported media type is encountered, a fatal error of
type

"unsupported-media-type"

will be raised. The media types defined in
[

IETF RFC 3023

] must always
be accepted.
**false:** [

required

] (

default

) Accept any media type.
**"validate":** See the definition of

DOMConfiguration

for a description of this parameter.
Unlike in [

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, the processing of the internal subset is always accomplished, even
if this parameter is set to

false

.
**"validate-if-schema":** See the definition of

DOMConfiguration

for a description of this parameter.
Unlike in [

DOM Level 3 Core

]
, the processing of the internal subset is always accomplished, even
if this parameter is set to

false

.
**"well-formed":** See the definition of

DOMConfiguration

for a description of this parameter.
Unlike in [

DOM Level 3 Core

choose to remove elements from the document being constructed, or to
terminate the parsing early.

The filter is invoked after the operations requested by the

DOMConfiguration

parameters have been applied. For

parseWithContext

```java
Node
parseWithContext​(
LSInput
input,

Node
contextArg,
short action)
throws
DOMException
,

LSException
```

Parse an XML fragment from a resource identified by a

LSInput

and insert the content into an existing document
at the position specified with the

context

and

action

arguments. When parsing the input stream, the
context node (or its parent, depending on where the result will be
inserted) is used for resolving unbound namespace prefixes. The
context node's

ownerDocument

node (or the node itself if
the node of type

DOCUMENT_NODE

) is used to resolve
default attributes and entity references.

As the new data is inserted into the document, at least one
mutation event is fired per new immediate child or sibling of the
context node.

If the context node is a

Document

node and the action
is

ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN

, then the document that is
passed as the context node will be changed such that its

xmlEncoding

,

documentURI

,

xmlVersion

,

inputEncoding

,

xmlStandalone

, and all other such attributes are set to
what they would be set to if the input source was parsed using

LSParser.parse()

.

This method is always synchronous, even if the

LSParser

is asynchronous (

LSParser.async

is

true

).

If an error occurs while parsing, the caller is notified through
the

ErrorHandler

instance associated with the
"

error-handler

"
parameter of the

DOMConfiguration

.

When calling

parseWithContext

, the values of the
following configuration parameters will be ignored and their default
values will always be used instead:
"

validate

",
"

validate-if-schema

",
and
"

element-content-whitespace

".
Other parameters will be treated normally, and the parser is expected
to call the

LSParserFilter

just as if a whole document
was parsed.

**Parameters:** input

- The

LSInput

from which the source document
is to be read. The source document must be an XML fragment, i.e.
anything except a complete XML document (except in the case where
the context node of type

DOCUMENT_NODE

, and the action
is

ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN

), a DOCTYPE (internal
subset), entity declaration(s), notation declaration(s), or XML or
text declaration(s).
**Parameters:** contextArg

- The node that is used as the context for the data
that is being parsed. This node must be a

Document

node, a

DocumentFragment

node, or a node of a type
that is allowed as a child of an

Element

node, e.g. it
cannot be an

Attribute

node.
**Parameters:** action

- This parameter describes which action should be taken
between the new set of nodes being inserted and the existing
children of the context node. The set of possible actions is
defined in

ACTION_TYPES

above.
**Returns:** Return the node that is the result of the parse operation. If
the result is more than one top-level node, the first one is
returned.
**Throws:** DOMException

- HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if the content cannot replace, be
inserted before, after, or as a child of the context node (see also

Node.insertBefore

or

Node.replaceChild

in
[

DOM Level 3 Core

]
).

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

doesn't
support this method, or if the context node is of type

Document

and the DOM implementation doesn't support
the replacement of the

DocumentType

child or

Element

child.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if the context node is a
read only node and the content is being appended to its child list,
or if the parent node of the context node is read only node and the
content is being inserted in its child list.

INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser.busy

attribute is

true

.
**Throws:** LSException

- PARSE_ERR: Raised if the

LSParser

was unable to load
the XML fragment. DOM applications should attach a

DOMErrorHandler

using the parameter
"

error-handler

"
if they wish to get details on the error.
