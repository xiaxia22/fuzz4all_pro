# Class StackWalker

**Source:** `java.base\java\lang\StackWalker.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
StackWalker

extends
Object
```

A stack walker.

The

walk

method opens a sequential stream
of

StackFrame

s for the current thread and then applies
the given function to walk the

StackFrame

stream.
The stream reports stack frame elements in order, from the top most frame
that represents the execution point at which the stack was generated to
the bottom most frame.
The

StackFrame

stream is closed when the

walk

method returns.
If an attempt is made to reuse the closed stream,

IllegalStateException

will be thrown.

The

stack walking options

of a

StackWalker

determines the information of

StackFrame

objects to be returned.
By default, stack frames of the reflection API and implementation
classes are

hidden

and

StackFrame

s have the class name and method name
available but not the

Class reference

.

StackWalker

is thread-safe. Multiple threads can share
a single

StackWalker

object to traverse its own stack.
A permission check is performed when a

StackWalker

is created,
according to the options it requests.
No further permission check is done at stack walking time.

**API Note:** Examples

1. To find the first caller filtering a known list of implementation class:

```java
StackWalker walker = StackWalker.getInstance(Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE);
Optional<Class<?>> callerClass = walker.walk(s ->
s.map(StackFrame::getDeclaringClass)
.filter(interestingClasses::contains)
.findFirst());
```

2. To snapshot the top 10 stack frames of the current thread,

```java
List<StackFrame> stack = StackWalker.getInstance().walk(s ->
s.limit(10).collect(Collectors.toList()));
```

Unless otherwise noted, passing a

null

argument to a
constructor or method in this

StackWalker

class
will cause a

NullPointerException

to be thrown.

,
it calls its

checkPermission

method for

RuntimePermission("getStackWalkerWithClassReference")

.

**Parameters:**
- options

-

stack walking option

**Returns:**
- a

StackWalker

configured with the given options

**Throws:**

checkPermission

method denies access.

---

#### public static
StackWalker
getInstance​(
Set
<
StackWalker.Option
> options,
int estimateDepth)

Returns a

StackWalker

instance with the given

options

specifying
the stack frame information it can access. If the given

options

is empty, this

StackWalker

is configured to skip all

hidden frames

and no

class reference

is retained.

If a security manager is present and the given

options

contains

Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE

,
it calls its

checkPermission

method for

RuntimePermission("getStackWalkerWithClassReference")

.

The

estimateDepth

specifies the estimate number of stack frames
this

StackWalker

will traverse that the

StackWalker

could
use as a hint for the buffer size.

-

stack walking options
- estimateDepth

- Estimate number of stack frames to be traversed.

**Returns:**
- a

StackWalker

configured with the given options

**Throws:**

---

#### public <T> T walk​(
Function
<? super
Stream
<
StackWalker.StackFrame
>,​? extends T> function)

Applies the given function to the stream of

StackFrame

s
for the current thread, traversing from the top frame of the stack,
which is the method calling this

walk

method.

The

StackFrame

stream will be closed when
this method returns. When a closed

Stream<StackFrame>

object
is reused,

IllegalStateException

will be thrown.

**Parameters:**
- function

- a function that takes a stream of

stack frames

and returns a result.

**Returns:**
- the result of applying the function to the stream of

stack frame

.

**API Note:**
- For example, to find the first 10 calling frames, first skipping those frames
whose declaring class is in package

com.foo

:

```java
List<StackFrame> frames = StackWalker.getInstance().walk(s ->
s.dropWhile(f -> f.getClassName().startsWith("com.foo."))
.limit(10)
.collect(Collectors.toList()));
```

This method takes a

Function

accepting a

Stream<StackFrame>

,
rather than returning a

Stream<StackFrame>

and allowing the
caller to directly manipulate the stream. The Java virtual machine is
free to reorganize a thread's control stack, for example, via
deoptimization. By taking a

Function

parameter, this method
allows access to stack frames through a stable view of a thread's control
stack.

Parallel execution is effectively disabled and stream pipeline
execution will only occur on the current thread.

**Implementation Note:**
- The implementation stabilizes the stack by anchoring a frame
specific to the stack walking and ensures that the stack walking is
performed above the anchored frame. When the stream object is closed or
being reused,

IllegalStateException

will be thrown.

**Type Parameters:**
- T

- The type of the result of applying the function to the
stream of

stack frame

.

---

#### public void forEach​(
Consumer
<? super
StackWalker.StackFrame
> action)

Performs the given action on each element of

StackFrame

stream
of the current thread, traversing from the top frame of the stack,
which is the method calling this

forEach

method.

This method is equivalent to calling

walk(s -> { s.forEach(action); return null; });

**Parameters:**
- action

- an action to be performed on each

StackFrame

of the stack of the current thread

---

#### public
Class
<?> getCallerClass()

Gets the

Class

object of the caller who invoked the method
that invoked

getCallerClass

.

This method filters

reflection
frames

,

MethodHandle

, and

hidden frames

regardless of the

SHOW_REFLECT_FRAMES

and

SHOW_HIDDEN_FRAMES

options
this

StackWalker

has been configured with.

This method should be called when a caller frame is present. If
it is called from the bottom most frame on the stack,

IllegalCallerException

will be thrown.

This method throws

UnsupportedOperationException

if this

StackWalker

is not configured with the

RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE

option.

**Returns:**
- Class

object of the caller's caller invoking this method.

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- if this

StackWalker

is not configured with

Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE

.
- IllegalCallerException

- if there is no caller frame, i.e.
when this

getCallerClass

method is called from a method
which is the last frame on the stack.

**API Note:**
- For example,

Util::getResourceBundle

loads a resource bundle
on behalf of the caller. It invokes

getCallerClass

to identify
the class whose method called

Util::getResourceBundle

.
Then, it obtains the class loader of that class, and uses
the class loader to load the resource bundle. The caller class
in this example is

MyTool

.

```java
class Util {
private final StackWalker walker = StackWalker.getInstance(Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE);
public ResourceBundle getResourceBundle(String bundleName) {
Class<?> caller = walker.getCallerClass();
return ResourceBundle.getBundle(bundleName, Locale.getDefault(), caller.getClassLoader());
}
}

class MyTool {
private final Util util = new Util();
private void init() {
ResourceBundle rb = util.getResourceBundle("mybundle");
}
}
```

An equivalent way to find the caller class using the

walk

method is as follows
(filtering the reflection frames,

MethodHandle

and hidden frames
not shown below):

```java
Optional<Class<?>> caller = walker.walk(s ->
s.map(StackFrame::getDeclaringClass)
.skip(2)
.findFirst());
```

When the

getCallerClass

method is called from a method that
is the bottom most frame on the stack,
for example,

static public void main

method launched by the

java

launcher, or a method invoked from a JNI attached thread,

IllegalCallerException

is thrown.

- walk

```java
public <T> T walk​(

```

Applies the given function to the stream of

StackFrame

s
for the current thread, traversing from the top frame of the stack,
which is the method calling this

walk

method.

The

StackFrame

stream will be closed when
this method returns. When a closed

Stream<StackFrame>

object
is reused,

IllegalStateException

will be thrown.

**API Note:** For example, to find the first 10 calling frames, first skipping those frames
whose declaring class is in package

com.foo

:

```java
List<StackFrame> frames = StackWalker.getInstance().walk(s ->
s.dropWhile(f -> f.getClassName().startsWith("com.foo."))
.limit(10)
.collect(Collectors.toList()));
```

This method takes a

Function

accepting a

Stream<StackFrame>

,
rather than returning a

Stream<StackFrame>

and allowing the
caller to directly manipulate the stream. The Java virtual machine is
free to reorganize a thread's control stack, for example, via
deoptimization. By taking a

Function

parameter, this method
allows access to stack frames through a stable view of a thread's control

**Implementation Note:** The implementation stabilizes the stack by anchoring a frame
specific to the stack walking and ensures that the stack walking is
performed above the anchored frame. When the stream object is closed or

IllegalStateException

will be thrown.
**Type Parameters:** T

- The type of the result of applying the function to the
stream of

stack frame

.
**Parameters:** function

- a function that takes a stream of

stack frames

and returns a result.
**Returns:** the result of applying the function to the stream of

stack frame

.

- forEach

```java
public void forEach​(
Consumer
<? super
StackWalker.StackFrame
> action)
```

Performs the given action on each element of

StackFrame

stream
of the current thread, traversing from the top frame of the stack,
which is the method calling this

forEach

method.

This method is equivalent to calling

walk(s -> { s.forEach(action); return null; });

**Parameters:** action

- an action to be performed on each

StackFrame

of the stack of the current thread

- getCallerClass

```java
public
Class
<?> getCallerClass()
```

Gets the

Class

object of the caller who invoked the method
that invoked

getCallerClass

.

This method filters

reflection
frames

,

MethodHandle

, and

hidden frames

regardless of the

SHOW_REFLECT_FRAMES

and

SHOW_HIDDEN_FRAMES

options
this

StackWalker

has been configured with.

This method should be called when a caller frame is present. If
it is called from the bottom most frame on the stack,

IllegalCallerException

will be thrown.

This method throws

UnsupportedOperationException

if this

StackWalker

is not configured with the

RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE

option.

**API Note:** For example,

Util::getResourceBundle

loads a resource bundle
on behalf of the caller. It invokes

getCallerClass

to identify
the class whose method called

Util::getResourceBundle

.
Then, it obtains the class loader of that class, and uses
the class loader to load the resource bundle. The caller class
in this example is

MyTool

.

```java
class Util {
private final StackWalker walker = StackWalker.getInstance(Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE);
public ResourceBundle getResourceBundle(String bundleName) {
Class<?> caller = walker.getCallerClass();
return ResourceBundle.getBundle(bundleName, Locale.getDefault(), caller.getClassLoader());
}
}

class MyTool {
private final Util util = new Util();
private void init() {
ResourceBundle rb = util.getResourceBundle("mybundle");
}
}
```

An equivalent way to find the caller class using the

walk

method is as follows
(filtering the reflection frames,

MethodHandle

and hidden frames
not shown below):

```java
Optional<Class<?>> caller = walker.walk(s ->
s.map(StackFrame::getDeclaringClass)
.skip(2)
.findFirst());
```

When the

getCallerClass

method is called from a method that
is the bottom most frame on the stack,
for example,

static public void main

StackWalker

instance with the given

options

specifying
the stack frame information it can access. If the given

options

is empty, this

StackWalker

is configured to skip all

hidden frames

and no

class reference

is retained.

If a security manager is present and the given

options

contains

Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE

,
it calls its

checkPermission

method for

RuntimePermission("getStackWalkerWithClassReference")

.

**Parameters:** options

-

stack walking option
**Returns:** a

StackWalker

configured with the given options
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method denies access.

- getInstance

```java
public static
StackWalker
getInstance​(
Set
<
StackWalker.Option
> options,
int estimateDepth)
```

Returns a

StackWalker

instance with the given

options

specifying
the stack frame information it can access. If the given

options

is empty, this

StackWalker

is configured to skip all

hidden frames

and no

class reference

is retained.

If a security manager is present and the given

options

contains

Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE

,
it calls its

checkPermission

method for

RuntimePermission("getStackWalkerWithClassReference")

.

The

estimateDepth

specifies the estimate number of stack frames
this

StackWalker

will traverse that the

StackWalker

could
use as a hint for the buffer size.

**Parameters:** options

-

stack walking options
**Parameters:** estimateDepth

- Estimate number of stack frames to be traversed.
**Returns:** a

StackWalker

configured with the given options
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if

estimateDepth <= 0
**Throws:** SecurityException

- if a security manager exists and its

checkPermission

method denies access.

- walk

```java
public <T> T walk​(
Function
<? super
Stream
<
StackWalker.StackFrame
>,​? extends T> function)
```

Applies the given function to the stream of

StackFrame

s
for the current thread, traversing from the top frame of the stack,
which is the method calling this

walk

method.

The

StackFrame

stream will be closed when
this method returns. When a closed

Stream<StackFrame>

object
is reused,

IllegalStateException

will be thrown.

**API Note:** For example, to find the first 10 calling frames, first skipping those frames
whose declaring class is in package

com.foo

:

```java
List<StackFrame> frames = StackWalker.getInstance().walk(s ->
s.dropWhile(f -> f.getClassName().startsWith("com.foo."))
.limit(10)
.collect(Collectors.toList()));
```

This method takes a

Function

accepting a

Stream<StackFrame>

,
rather than returning a

Stream<StackFrame>

and allowing the
caller to directly manipulate the stream. The Java virtual machine is
free to reorganize a thread's control stack, for example, via
deoptimization. By taking a

Function

parameter, this method
allows access to stack frames through a stable view of a thread's control
stack.

Parallel execution is effectively disabled and stream pipeline
execution will only occur on the current thread.
**Implementation Note:** The implementation stabilizes the stack by anchoring a frame
specific to the stack walking and ensures that the stack walking is
performed above the anchored frame. When the stream object is closed or
being reused,

IllegalStateException

will be thrown.
**Type Parameters:** T

- The type of the result of applying the function to the
stream of

stack frame

.
**Parameters:** function

- a function that takes a stream of

stack frames

and returns a result.
**Returns:** the result of applying the function to the stream of

stack frame

.

- forEach

```java
public void forEach​(
Consumer
<? super
StackWalker.StackFrame
> action)
```

Performs the given action on each element of

StackFrame

stream
of the current thread, traversing from the top frame of the stack,
which is the method calling this

forEach

method.

This method is equivalent to calling

walk(s -> { s.forEach(action); return null; });

**Parameters:** action

- an action to be performed on each

StackFrame

of the stack of the current thread

- getCallerClass

```java
public
Class
<?> getCallerClass()
```

Gets the

Class

object of the caller who invoked the method
that invoked

getCallerClass

.

This method filters

reflection
frames

,

MethodHandle

, and

hidden frames

regardless of the

SHOW_REFLECT_FRAMES

and

SHOW_HIDDEN_FRAMES

options
this

StackWalker

has been configured with.

This method should be called when a caller frame is present. If
it is called from the bottom most frame on the stack,

IllegalCallerException

will be thrown.

This method throws

UnsupportedOperationException

if this

StackWalker

is not configured with the

RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE

option.

**API Note:** For example,

Util::getResourceBundle

loads a resource bundle
on behalf of the caller. It invokes

getCallerClass

to identify
the class whose method called

Util::getResourceBundle

.
Then, it obtains the class loader of that class, and uses
the class loader to load the resource bundle. The caller class
in this example is

MyTool

.

```java
class Util {
private final StackWalker walker = StackWalker.getInstance(Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE);
public ResourceBundle getResourceBundle(String bundleName) {
Class<?> caller = walker.getCallerClass();
return ResourceBundle.getBundle(bundleName, Locale.getDefault(), caller.getClassLoader());
}
}

class MyTool {
private final Util util = new Util();
private void init() {
ResourceBundle rb = util.getResourceBundle("mybundle");
}
}
```

An equivalent way to find the caller class using the

walk

method is as follows
(filtering the reflection frames,

MethodHandle

and hidden frames
not shown below):

```java
Optional<Class<?>> caller = walker.walk(s ->
s.map(StackFrame::getDeclaringClass)
.skip(2)
.findFirst());
```

When the

getCallerClass

method is called from a method that
is the bottom most frame on the stack,
for example,

static public void main

method launched by the

java

launcher, or a method invoked from a JNI attached thread,

IllegalCallerException

is thrown.
**Returns:** Class

object of the caller's caller invoking this method.
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- if this

StackWalker

is not configured with

Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE

.
**Throws:** IllegalCallerException

- if there is no caller frame, i.e.
when this

getCallerClass

method is called from a method
which is the last frame on the stack.
