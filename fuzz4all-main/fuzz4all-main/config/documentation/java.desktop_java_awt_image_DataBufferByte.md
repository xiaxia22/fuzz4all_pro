# Class DataBufferByte

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\image\DataBufferByte.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
DataBufferByte

extends
DataBuffer
```

This class extends

DataBuffer

and stores data internally as bytes.
Values stored in the byte array(s) of this

DataBuffer

are treated as
unsigned values.

Note that some implementations may function more efficiently
if they can maintain control over how the data for an image is
stored.
For example, optimizations such as caching an image in video
memory require that the implementation track all modifications
to that data.
Other implementations may operate better if they can store the
data in locations other than a Java array.
To maintain optimum compatibility with various optimizations
it is best to avoid constructors and methods which expose the
underlying storage as a Java array, as noted below in the
documentation for those methods.
