# Class SimpleDateFormat

**Source:** `java.base\java\text\SimpleDateFormat.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
SimpleDateFormat

extends
DateFormat
```

SimpleDateFormat

is a concrete class for formatting and
parsing dates in a locale-sensitive manner. It allows for formatting
(date → text), parsing (text → date), and normalization.

SimpleDateFormat

allows you to start by choosing
any user-defined patterns for date-time formatting. However, you
are encouraged to create a date-time formatter with either

getTimeInstance

,

getDateInstance

, or

getDateTimeInstance

in

DateFormat

. Each
of these class methods can return a date/time formatter initialized
with a default format pattern. You may modify the format pattern
using the

applyPattern

methods as desired.
For more information on using these methods, see

DateFormat

.

Date and Time Patterns

Date and time formats are specified by

date and time pattern

strings.
Within date and time pattern strings, unquoted letters from

'A'

to

'Z'

and from

'a'

to

'z'

are interpreted as pattern letters representing the
components of a date or time string.
Text can be quoted using single quotes (

'

) to avoid
interpretation.

"''"

represents a single quote.
All other characters are not interpreted; they're simply copied into the
output string during formatting or matched against the input string
during parsing.

The following pattern letters are defined (all other characters from

'A'

to

'Z'

and from

'a'

to

'z'

are reserved):

Pattern letters are usually repeated, as their number determines the
exact presentation:

- Text:

For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 4 or more,
the full form is used; otherwise a short or abbreviated form
is used if available.
For parsing, both forms are accepted, independent of the number
of pattern letters.
- Number:

For formatting, the number of pattern letters is the minimum
number of digits, and shorter numbers are zero-padded to this amount.
For parsing, the number of pattern letters is ignored unless
it's needed to separate two adjacent fields.
- Year:

If the formatter's

Calendar

is the Gregorian
calendar, the following rules are applied.

- For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 2, the year
is truncated to 2 digits; otherwise it is interpreted as a

number

.

For parsing, if the number of pattern letters is more than 2,
the year is interpreted literally, regardless of the number of
digits. So using the pattern "MM/dd/yyyy", "01/11/12" parses to
Jan 11, 12 A.D.

For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern ("y" or "yy"),

SimpleDateFormat

must interpret the abbreviated year
relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be
within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the

SimpleDateFormat

instance is created. For example, using a pattern of "MM/dd/yy" and a

SimpleDateFormat

instance created on Jan 1, 1997, the string
"01/11/12" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string "05/04/64"
would be interpreted as May 4, 1964.
During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by

Character.isDigit(char)

, will be parsed into the default century.
Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit
string, or a two digit string that isn't all digits (for example, "-1"), is
interpreted literally. So "01/02/3" or "01/02/003" are parsed, using the
same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD. Likewise, "01/02/-3" is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC.

Otherwise, calendar system specific forms are applied.
For both formatting and parsing, if the number of pattern
letters is 4 or more, a calendar specific

long form

is used. Otherwise, a calendar
specific

short or abbreviated form

is used.

If week year

'Y'

is specified and the

calendar

doesn't support any

week
years

, the calendar year (

'y'

) is used instead. The
support of week years can be tested with a call to

getCalendar()

.

isWeekDateSupported()

.
- Month:

If the number of pattern letters is 3 or more, the month is
interpreted as

text

; otherwise,
it is interpreted as a

number

.

- Letter

M

produces context-sensitive month names, such as the
embedded form of names. Letter

M

is context-sensitive in the
sense that when it is used in the standalone pattern, for example,
"MMMM", it gives the standalone form of a month name and when it is
used in the pattern containing other field(s), for example, "d MMMM",
it gives the format form of a month name. For example, January in the
Catalan language is "de gener" in the format form while it is "gener"
in the standalone form. In this case, "MMMM" will produce "gener" and
the month part of the "d MMMM" will produce "de gener". If a

DateFormatSymbols

has been set explicitly with constructor

SimpleDateFormat(String,DateFormatSymbols)

or method

setDateFormatSymbols(DateFormatSymbols)

, the month names given by
the

DateFormatSymbols

are used.
- Letter

L

produces the standalone form of month names.
- General time zone:

Time zones are interpreted as

text

if they have
names. For time zones representing a GMT offset value, the
following syntax is used:

```java
GMTOffsetTimeZone:

GMT

Sign

Hours

:

Minutes

Sign:
one of

+ -

Hours:

Digit

Digit

Digit

Minutes:

Digit

Digit

Digit:
one of

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

Hours

must be between 0 and 23, and

Minutes

must be between
00 and 59. The format is locale independent and digits must be taken
from the Basic Latin block of the Unicode standard.

For parsing,

RFC 822 time zones

are also
accepted.
- RFC 822 time zone:

For formatting, the RFC 822 4-digit time zone format is used:

```java
RFC822TimeZone:

Sign

TwoDigitHours

Minutes

TwoDigitHours:

Digit Digit
```

TwoDigitHours

must be between 00 and 23. Other definitions
are as for

general time zones

.

For parsing,

general time zones

are also
accepted.

ISO 8601 Time zone:

The number of pattern letters designates the format for both formatting
and parsing as follows:

```java
ISO8601TimeZone:

OneLetterISO8601TimeZone

TwoLetterISO8601TimeZone

ThreeLetterISO8601TimeZone

OneLetterISO8601TimeZone:

Sign

TwoDigitHours

Z

TwoLetterISO8601TimeZone:

Sign

TwoDigitHours

Minutes

Z

ThreeLetterISO8601TimeZone:

Sign

TwoDigitHours

:

Minutes

Z
```

Other definitions are as for

general time zones

or

RFC 822 time zones

.

For formatting, if the offset value from GMT is 0,

"Z"

is
produced. If the number of pattern letters is 1, any fraction of an hour
is ignored. For example, if the pattern is

"X"

and the time zone is

"GMT+05:30"

,

"+05"

is produced.

For parsing,

"Z"

is parsed as the UTC time zone designator.

General time zones

are

not

accepted.

If the number of pattern letters is 4 or more,

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown when constructing a

SimpleDateFormat

or

applying a
pattern

.

SimpleDateFormat

also supports

localized date and time
pattern

strings. In these strings, the pattern letters described above
may be replaced with other, locale dependent, pattern letters.

SimpleDateFormat

does not deal with the localization of text
other than the pattern letters; that's up to the client of the class.

Synchronization

Date formats are not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

---

#### public
Date
parse​(
String
text,

ParsePosition
pos)

Parses text from a string to produce a

Date

.

The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by

pos

.
If parsing succeeds, then the index of

pos

is updated
to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
date is returned. The updated

pos

can be used to
indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
If an error occurs, then the index of

pos

is not
changed, the error index of

pos

is set to the index of
the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

This parsing operation uses the

calendar

to produce a

Date

. All of the

calendar

's date-time fields are

cleared

before parsing, and the

calendar

's default
values of the date-time fields are used for any missing
date-time information. For example, the year value of the
parsed

Date

is 1970 with

GregorianCalendar

if
no year value is given from the parsing operation. The

TimeZone

value may be overwritten, depending on the given
pattern and the time zone value in

text

. Any

TimeZone

value that has previously been set by a call to

setTimeZone

may need
to be restored for further operations.

**Specified by:**
- parse

in class

DateFormat

**Parameters:**
- text

- A

String

, part of which should be parsed.
- pos

- A

ParsePosition

object with index and error
index information as described above.

**Returns:**
- A

Date

parsed from the string. In case of
error, returns null.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if

text

or

pos

is null.

"''"

represents a single quote.
All other characters are not interpreted; they're simply copied into the

Pattern letters are usually repeated, as their number determines the
exact presentation:

- Text:

For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 4 or more,
the full form is used; otherwise a short or abbreviated form
is used if available.
For parsing, both forms are accepted, independent of the number
of pattern letters.
- Number:

For formatting, the number of pattern letters is the minimum
number of digits, and shorter numbers are zero-padded to this amount.
For parsing, the number of pattern letters is ignored unless
it's needed to separate two adjacent fields.
- Year:

If the formatter's

Calendar

is the Gregorian
calendar, the following rules are applied.

- For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 2, the year
is truncated to 2 digits; otherwise it is interpreted as a

number

.

For parsing, if the number of pattern letters is more than 2,
the year is interpreted literally, regardless of the number of
digits. So using the pattern "MM/dd/yyyy", "01/11/12" parses to
Jan 11, 12 A.D.

For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern ("y" or "yy"),

SimpleDateFormat

must interpret the abbreviated year
relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be
within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the

SimpleDateFormat

instance is created. For example, using a pattern of "MM/dd/yy" and a

SimpleDateFormat

instance created on Jan 1, 1997, the string
"01/11/12" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string "05/04/64"
would be interpreted as May 4, 1964.
During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by

Character.isDigit(char)

, will be parsed into the default century.
Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit
string, or a two digit string that isn't all digits (for example, "-1"), is
interpreted literally. So "01/02/3" or "01/02/003" are parsed, using the
same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD. Likewise, "01/02/-3" is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC.

Otherwise, calendar system specific forms are applied.
For both formatting and parsing, if the number of pattern
letters is 4 or more, a calendar specific

long form

is used. Otherwise, a calendar
specific

short or abbreviated form

is used.

If week year

'Y'

is specified and the

calendar

doesn't support any

week
years

, the calendar year (

'y'

) is used instead. The
support of week years can be tested with a call to

getCalendar()

.

isWeekDateSupported()

.
- Month:

If the number of pattern letters is 3 or more, the month is
interpreted as

text

; otherwise,
it is interpreted as a

number

.

- Letter

M

produces context-sensitive month names, such as the
embedded form of names. Letter

M

is context-sensitive in the
sense that when it is used in the standalone pattern, for example,
"MMMM", it gives the standalone form of a month name and when it is
used in the pattern containing other field(s), for example, "d MMMM",
it gives the format form of a month name. For example, January in the
Catalan language is "de gener" in the format form while it is "gener"
in the standalone form. In this case, "MMMM" will produce "gener" and
the month part of the "d MMMM" will produce "de gener". If a

DateFormatSymbols

has been set explicitly with constructor

SimpleDateFormat(String,DateFormatSymbols)

or method

setDateFormatSymbols(DateFormatSymbols)

, the month names given by
the

DateFormatSymbols

are used.
- Letter

L

produces the standalone form of month names.
- General time zone:

Time zones are interpreted as

text

if they have
names. For time zones representing a GMT offset value, the
following syntax is used:

public class

SimpleDateFormat

extends

DateFormat

SimpleDateFormat

is a concrete class for formatting and
parsing dates in a locale-sensitive manner. It allows for formatting
(date → text), parsing (text → date), and normalization.

SimpleDateFormat

allows you to start by choosing
any user-defined patterns for date-time formatting. However, you
are encouraged to create a date-time formatter with either

getTimeInstance

,

getDateInstance

, or

getDateTimeInstance

in

DateFormat

. Each
of these class methods can return a date/time formatter initialized
with a default format pattern. You may modify the format pattern
using the

applyPattern

methods as desired.
For more information on using these methods, see

DateFormat

.

Date and Time Patterns

Date and time formats are specified by

date and time pattern

strings.
Within date and time pattern strings, unquoted letters from

'A'

to

'Z'

and from

'a'

to

'z'

are interpreted as pattern letters representing the
components of a date or time string.
Text can be quoted using single quotes (

'

) to avoid
interpretation.

"''"

represents a single quote.
All other characters are not interpreted; they're simply copied into the
output string during formatting or matched against the input string
during parsing.

The following pattern letters are defined (all other characters from

'A'

to

'Z'

and from

'a'

to

'z'

are reserved):

Pattern letters are usually repeated, as their number determines the
exact presentation:

- Text:

For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 4 or more,
the full form is used; otherwise a short or abbreviated form
is used if available.
For parsing, both forms are accepted, independent of the number
of pattern letters.
- Number:

For formatting, the number of pattern letters is the minimum
number of digits, and shorter numbers are zero-padded to this amount.
For parsing, the number of pattern letters is ignored unless
it's needed to separate two adjacent fields.
- Year:

If the formatter's

Calendar

is the Gregorian
calendar, the following rules are applied.

- For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 2, the year
is truncated to 2 digits; otherwise it is interpreted as a

number

.

For parsing, if the number of pattern letters is more than 2,
the year is interpreted literally, regardless of the number of
digits. So using the pattern "MM/dd/yyyy", "01/11/12" parses to
Jan 11, 12 A.D.

For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern ("y" or "yy"),

SimpleDateFormat

must interpret the abbreviated year
relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be
within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the

SimpleDateFormat

instance is created. For example, using a pattern of "MM/dd/yy" and a

SimpleDateFormat

instance created on Jan 1, 1997, the string
"01/11/12" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string "05/04/64"
would be interpreted as May 4, 1964.
During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by

Character.isDigit(char)

, will be parsed into the default century.
Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit
string, or a two digit string that isn't all digits (for example, "-1"), is
interpreted literally. So "01/02/3" or "01/02/003" are parsed, using the
same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD. Likewise, "01/02/-3" is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC.

Otherwise, calendar system specific forms are applied.
For both formatting and parsing, if the number of pattern
letters is 4 or more, a calendar specific

long form

is used. Otherwise, a calendar
specific

short or abbreviated form

is used.

If week year

'Y'

is specified and the

calendar

doesn't support any

week
years

, the calendar year (

'y'

) is used instead. The
support of week years can be tested with a call to

getCalendar()

.

isWeekDateSupported()

.
- Month:

If the number of pattern letters is 3 or more, the month is
interpreted as

text

; otherwise,
it is interpreted as a

number

.

- Letter

M

produces context-sensitive month names, such as the
embedded form of names. Letter

M

is context-sensitive in the
sense that when it is used in the standalone pattern, for example,
"MMMM", it gives the standalone form of a month name and when it is
used in the pattern containing other field(s), for example, "d MMMM",
it gives the format form of a month name. For example, January in the
Catalan language is "de gener" in the format form while it is "gener"
in the standalone form. In this case, "MMMM" will produce "gener" and
the month part of the "d MMMM" will produce "de gener". If a

DateFormatSymbols

has been set explicitly with constructor

SimpleDateFormat(String,DateFormatSymbols)

or method

setDateFormatSymbols(DateFormatSymbols)

, the month names given by
the

DateFormatSymbols

are used.
- Letter

L

produces the standalone form of month names.
- General time zone:

Time zones are interpreted as

text

if they have
names. For time zones representing a GMT offset value, the
following syntax is used:

```java
GMTOffsetTimeZone:

GMT

Hours

Pattern letters are usually repeated, as their number determines the
exact presentation:

- Text:

For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 4 or more,
the full form is used; otherwise a short or abbreviated form
is used if available.
For parsing, both forms are accepted, independent of the number
of pattern letters.
- Number:

For formatting, the number of pattern letters is the minimum
number of digits, and shorter numbers are zero-padded to this amount.
For parsing, the number of pattern letters is ignored unless
it's needed to separate two adjacent fields.
- Year:

If the formatter's

Calendar

is the Gregorian
calendar, the following rules are applied.

- For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 2, the year
is truncated to 2 digits; otherwise it is interpreted as a

number

.

For parsing, if the number of pattern letters is more than 2,
the year is interpreted literally, regardless of the number of
digits. So using the pattern "MM/dd/yyyy", "01/11/12" parses to
Jan 11, 12 A.D.

For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern ("y" or "yy"),

SimpleDateFormat

must interpret the abbreviated year
relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be
within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the

SimpleDateFormat

instance is created. For example, using a pattern of "MM/dd/yy" and a

SimpleDateFormat

instance created on Jan 1, 1997, the string
"01/11/12" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string "05/04/64"
would be interpreted as May 4, 1964.
During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by

Character.isDigit(char)

, will be parsed into the default century.
Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit
string, or a two digit string that isn't all digits (for example, "-1"), is
interpreted literally. So "01/02/3" or "01/02/003" are parsed, using the
same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD. Likewise, "01/02/-3" is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC.

Otherwise, calendar system specific forms are applied.
For both formatting and parsing, if the number of pattern
letters is 4 or more, a calendar specific

long form

is used. Otherwise, a calendar
specific

short or abbreviated form

is used.

If week year

'Y'

is specified and the

calendar

doesn't support any

week
years

, the calendar year (

'y'

) is used instead. The
support of week years can be tested with a call to

getCalendar()

.

isWeekDateSupported()

.
- Month:

If the number of pattern letters is 3 or more, the month is
interpreted as

text

; otherwise,
it is interpreted as a

number

.

- Letter

M

produces context-sensitive month names, such as the
embedded form of names. Letter

M

is context-sensitive in the
sense that when it is used in the standalone pattern, for example,
"MMMM", it gives the standalone form of a month name and when it is
used in the pattern containing other field(s), for example, "d MMMM",
it gives the format form of a month name. For example, January in the
Catalan language is "de gener" in the format form while it is "gener"
in the standalone form. In this case, "MMMM" will produce "gener" and
the month part of the "d MMMM" will produce "de gener". If a

DateFormatSymbols

has been set explicitly with constructor

SimpleDateFormat(String,DateFormatSymbols)

or method

setDateFormatSymbols(DateFormatSymbols)

, the month names given by
the

DateFormatSymbols

are used.
- Letter

L

produces the standalone form of month names.
- General time zone:

Time zones are interpreted as

text

if they have
names. For time zones representing a GMT offset value, the
following syntax is used:

```java
GMTOffsetTimeZone:

GMT

Hours

must be between 0 and 23, and

Minutes

00 and 59. The format is locale independent and digits must be taken
from the Basic Latin block of the Unicode standard.

For parsing,

RFC 822 time zones

are also
accepted.

For formatting, the RFC 822 4-digit time zone format is used:

TwoDigitHours

must be between 00 and 23. Other definitions

For parsing,

accepted.

ISO 8601 Time zone:

The number of pattern letters designates the format for both formatting
and parsing as follows:

```java
ISO8601TimeZone:

Other definitions are as for

or

RFC 822 time zones

.

For formatting, if the offset value from GMT is 0,

"Z"

is
produced. If the number of pattern letters is 1, any fraction of an hour
is ignored. For example, if the pattern is

"X"

and the time zone is

"GMT+05:30"

,

"+05"

is produced.

For parsing,

"Z"

is parsed as the UTC time zone designator.

General time zones

are

not

accepted.

If the number of pattern letters is 4 or more,

IllegalArgumentException

is thrown when constructing a

SimpleDateFormat

or

applying a
pattern

.

SimpleDateFormat

also supports

localized date and time
pattern

strings. In these strings, the pattern letters described above
may be replaced with other, locale dependent, pattern letters.

SimpleDateFormat

does not deal with the localization of text
other than the pattern letters; that's up to the client of the class.

#### Synchronization

Date formats are not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

Date
startDate)
```

Sets the 100-year period 2-digit years will be interpreted as being in
to begin on the date the user specifies.

**Parameters:** startDate

- During parsing, two digit years will be placed in the range

startDate

to

startDate + 100 years

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

Date
date,

StringBuffer
toAppendTo,

FieldPosition
pos)
```

Formats the given

Date

into a date/time string and appends
the result to the given

StringBuffer

.

**Specified by:** format

in class

DateFormat
**Parameters:** date

- the date-time value to be formatted into a date-time string.
**Parameters:** toAppendTo

- where the new date-time text is to be appended.
**Parameters:** pos

- keeps track on the position of the field within
the returned string. For example, given a date-time text

"1996.07.10 AD at 15:08:56 PDT"

, if the given

fieldPosition

is

DateFormat.YEAR_FIELD

, the begin index and end index of

fieldPosition

will be set to 0 and 4, respectively.
Notice that if the same date-time field appears more than once in a
pattern, the

fieldPosition

will be set for the first occurrence
of that date-time field. For instance, formatting a

Date

to the
date-time string

"1 PM PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)"

using the
pattern

"h a z (zzzz)"

and the alignment field

DateFormat.TIMEZONE_FIELD

, the begin index and end index of

fieldPosition

will be set to 5 and 8, respectively, for the
first occurrence of the timezone pattern character

'z'

.
**Returns:** the formatted date-time string.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if any of the parameters is

null

.

- formatToCharacterIterator

```java
public
AttributedCharacterIterator
formatToCharacterIterator​(
Object
obj)
```

Formats an Object producing an

AttributedCharacterIterator

.
You can use the returned

AttributedCharacterIterator

to build the resulting String, as well as to determine information
about the resulting String.

Each attribute key of the AttributedCharacterIterator will be of type

DateFormat.Field

, with the corresponding attribute value
being the same as the attribute key.

**Overrides:** formatToCharacterIterator

in class

Format
**Parameters:** obj

- The object to format
**Returns:** AttributedCharacterIterator describing the formatted value.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if obj is null.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the Format cannot format the
given object, or if the Format's pattern string is invalid.
**Since:** 1.4

- parse

```java
public
Date
parse​(
String
text,

ParsePosition
pos)
```

Parses text from a string to produce a

Date

.

The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by

pos

.
If parsing succeeds, then the index of

pos

is updated
to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
date is returned. The updated

pos

can be used to
indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
If an error occurs, then the index of

pos

is not
changed, the error index of

pos

is set to the index of
the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

This parsing operation uses the

calendar

to produce a

Date

. All of the

calendar

's date-time fields are

cleared

before parsing, and the

calendar

's default
values of the date-time fields are used for any missing
date-time information. For example, the year value of the
parsed

Date

is 1970 with

GregorianCalendar

if
no year value is given from the parsing operation. The

TimeZone

value may be overwritten, depending on the given
pattern and the time zone value in

text

. Any

TimeZone

value that has previously been set by a call to

setTimeZone

may need
to be restored for further operations.

**Specified by:** parse

in class

DateFormat
**Parameters:** text

- A

String

, part of which should be parsed.
**Parameters:** pos

- A

ParsePosition

object with index and error
index information as described above.
**Returns:** A

Date

parsed from the string. In case of
error, returns null.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

text

or

pos

is null.

Date
startDate)
```

Sets the 100-year period 2-digit years will be interpreted as being in
to begin on the date the user specifies.

**Parameters:** startDate

- During parsing, two digit years will be placed in the range

startDate

to

startDate + 100 years

.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

startDate

is

null

.

**See Also:** get2DigitYearStart()

- get2DigitYearStart

```java
public
Date
get2DigitYearStart()
```

Returns the beginning date of the 100-year period 2-digit years are interpreted
as being within.

**Returns:** the start of the 100-year period into which two digit years are
parsed
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** set2DigitYearStart(java.util.Date)

- format

```java
public
StringBuffer
format​(
Date
date,

StringBuffer
toAppendTo,

FieldPosition
pos)
```

Formats the given

Date

into a date/time string and appends
the result to the given

StringBuffer

.

**Specified by:** format

in class

DateFormat
**Parameters:** date

- the date-time value to be formatted into a date-time string.
**Parameters:** toAppendTo

- where the new date-time text is to be appended.
**Parameters:** pos

- keeps track on the position of the field within
the returned string. For example, given a date-time text

"1996.07.10 AD at 15:08:56 PDT"

, if the given

fieldPosition

is

DateFormat.YEAR_FIELD

, the begin index and end index of

fieldPosition

will be set to 0 and 4, respectively.
Notice that if the same date-time field appears more than once in a
pattern, the

fieldPosition

will be set for the first occurrence
of that date-time field. For instance, formatting a

Date

to the
date-time string

"1 PM PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)"

using the
pattern

"h a z (zzzz)"

and the alignment field

DateFormat.TIMEZONE_FIELD

AttributedCharacterIterator

.
You can use the returned

AttributedCharacterIterator

to build the resulting String, as well as to determine information
about the resulting String.

Each attribute key of the AttributedCharacterIterator will be of type

DateFormat.Field

, with the corresponding attribute value
being the same as the attribute key.

**Overrides:** formatToCharacterIterator

in class

Format
**Parameters:** obj

- The object to format

- parse

```java
public
Date
parse​(
String
text,

ParsePosition
pos)
```

Parses text from a string to produce a

Date

.

The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by

pos

.
If parsing succeeds, then the index of

pos

is updated
to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
date is returned. The updated

pos

can be used to
indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
If an error occurs, then the index of

pos

is not
changed, the error index of

pos

is set to the index of
the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

This parsing operation uses the

calendar

to produce a

Date

. All of the

calendar

's date-time fields are

cleared

before parsing, and the

calendar

's default
values of the date-time fields are used for any missing
date-time information. For example, the year value of the
parsed

Date

is 1970 with

GregorianCalendar

if
no year value is given from the parsing operation. The

TimeZone

value may be overwritten, depending on the given
pattern and the time zone value in

text

. Any

TimeZone

value that has previously been set by a call to

setTimeZone

may need
to be restored for further operations.

**Specified by:** parse

in class

DateFormat
**Parameters:** text

- A

String

, part of which should be parsed.
**Parameters:** pos

- A

ParsePosition

object with index and error
index information as described above.
