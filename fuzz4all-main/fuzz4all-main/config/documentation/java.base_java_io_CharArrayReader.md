# Class CharArrayReader

**Source:** `java.base\java\io\CharArrayReader.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
CharArrayReader

extends
Reader
```

This class implements a character buffer that can be used as a
character-input stream.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Closeable

,

AutoCloseable

,

Readable

---

### Field Details

#### protected char[] buf

The character buffer.

---

#### protected int pos

The current buffer position.

---

#### protected int markedPos

The position of mark in buffer.

---

#### protected int count

The index of the end of this buffer. There is not valid
data at or beyond this index.

---

### Constructor Details

#### public CharArrayReader​(char[] buf)

Creates a CharArrayReader from the specified array of chars.

**Parameters:**
- buf

- Input buffer (not copied)

---

#### public CharArrayReader​(char[] buf,
int offset,
int length)

Creates a CharArrayReader from the specified array of chars.

The resulting reader will start reading at the given

offset

. The total number of

char

values that can be
read from this reader will be either

length

or

buf.length-offset

, whichever is smaller.

**Parameters:**
- buf

- Input buffer (not copied)
- offset

- Offset of the first char to read
- length

- Number of chars to read

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If

offset

is negative or greater than

buf.length

, or if

length

is negative, or if
the sum of these two values is negative.

---

### Method Details

#### public int read()
throws
IOException

Reads a single character.

**Overrides:**
- read

in class

Reader

**Returns:**
- The character read, as an integer in the range 0 to 65535
(

0x00-0xffff

), or -1 if the end of the stream has
been reached

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public int read​(char[] b,
int off,
int len)
throws
IOException

Reads characters into a portion of an array.

**Specified by:**
- read

in class

Reader

**Parameters:**
- b

- Destination buffer
- off

- Offset at which to start storing characters
- len

- Maximum number of characters to read

**Returns:**
- The actual number of characters read, or -1 if
the end of the stream has been reached

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public long skip​(long n)
throws
IOException

Skips characters. Returns the number of characters that were skipped.

The

n

parameter may be negative, even though the

skip

method of the

Reader

superclass throws
an exception in this case. If

n

is negative, then
this method does nothing and returns

0

.

**Overrides:**
- skip

in class

Reader

**Parameters:**
- n

- The number of characters to skip

**Returns:**
- The number of characters actually skipped

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If the stream is closed, or an I/O error occurs

---

#### public boolean ready()
throws
IOException

Tells whether this stream is ready to be read. Character-array readers
are always ready to be read.

**Overrides:**
- ready

in class

Reader

**Returns:**
- True if the next read() is guaranteed not to block for input,
false otherwise. Note that returning false does not guarantee that the
next read will block.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public boolean markSupported()

Tells whether this stream supports the mark() operation, which it does.

**Overrides:**
- markSupported

in class

Reader

**Returns:**
- true if and only if this stream supports the mark operation.

---

#### public void mark​(int readAheadLimit)
throws
IOException

Marks the present position in the stream. Subsequent calls to reset()
will reposition the stream to this point.

**Overrides:**
- mark

in class

Reader

**Parameters:**
- readAheadLimit

- Limit on the number of characters that may be
read while still preserving the mark. Because
the stream's input comes from a character array,
there is no actual limit; hence this argument is
ignored.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public void reset()
throws
IOException

Resets the stream to the most recent mark, or to the beginning if it has
never been marked.

**Overrides:**
- reset

in class

Reader

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs

---

#### public void close()

Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with
it. Once the stream has been closed, further read(), ready(),
mark(), reset(), or skip() invocations will throw an IOException.
Closing a previously closed stream has no effect. This method will block
while there is another thread blocking on the reader.
