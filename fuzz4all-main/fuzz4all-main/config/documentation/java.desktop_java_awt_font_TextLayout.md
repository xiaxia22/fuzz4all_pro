# Class TextLayout

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\font\TextLayout.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
TextLayout

extends
Object

implements
Cloneable
```

TextLayout

is an immutable graphical representation of styled
character data.

It provides the following capabilities:

- implicit bidirectional analysis and reordering,

cursor positioning and movement, including split cursors for
mixed directional text,

highlighting, including both logical and visual highlighting
for mixed directional text,

multiple baselines (roman, hanging, and centered),

hit testing,

justification,

default font substitution,

metric information such as ascent, descent, and advance, and

rendering

A

TextLayout

object can be rendered using
its

draw

method.

TextLayout

can be constructed either directly or through
the use of a

LineBreakMeasurer

. When constructed directly, the
source text represents a single paragraph.

LineBreakMeasurer

allows styled text to be broken into lines that fit within a particular
width. See the

LineBreakMeasurer

documentation for more
information.

TextLayout

construction logically proceeds as follows:

- paragraph attributes are extracted and examined,

text is analyzed for bidirectional reordering, and reordering
information is computed if needed,

text is segmented into style runs

fonts are chosen for style runs, first by using a font if the
attribute

TextAttribute.FONT

is present, otherwise by computing
a default font using the attributes that have been defined

if text is on multiple baselines, the runs or subruns are further
broken into subruns sharing a common baseline,

glyphvectors are generated for each run using the chosen font,

final bidirectional reordering is performed on the glyphvectors

All graphical information returned from a

TextLayout

object's methods is relative to the origin of the

TextLayout

, which is the intersection of the

TextLayout

object's baseline with its left edge. Also,
coordinates passed into a

TextLayout

object's methods
are assumed to be relative to the

TextLayout

object's
origin. Clients usually need to translate between a

TextLayout

object's coordinate system and the coordinate
system in another object (such as a

Graphics

object).

TextLayout

objects are constructed from styled text,
but they do not retain a reference to their source text. Thus,
changes in the text previously used to generate a

TextLayout

do not affect the

TextLayout

.

Three methods on a

TextLayout

object
(

getNextRightHit

,

getNextLeftHit

, and

hitTestChar

) return instances of

TextHitInfo

.
The offsets contained in these

TextHitInfo

objects
are relative to the start of the

TextLayout

,

not

to the text used to create the

TextLayout

. Similarly,

TextLayout

methods that accept

TextHitInfo

instances as parameters expect the

TextHitInfo

object's
offsets to be relative to the

TextLayout

, not to any
underlying text storage model.

Examples

:

Constructing and drawing a

TextLayout

and its bounding
rectangle:

```java
Graphics2D g = ...;
Point2D loc = ...;
Font font = Font.getFont("Helvetica-bold-italic");
FontRenderContext frc = g.getFontRenderContext();
TextLayout layout = new TextLayout("This is a string", font, frc);
layout.draw(g, (float)loc.getX(), (float)loc.getY());

Rectangle2D bounds = layout.getBounds();
bounds.setRect(bounds.getX()+loc.getX(),
bounds.getY()+loc.getY(),
bounds.getWidth(),
bounds.getHeight());
g.draw(bounds);
```

Hit-testing a

TextLayout

(determining which character is at
a particular graphical location):

```java
Point2D click = ...;
TextHitInfo hit = layout.hitTestChar(
(float) (click.getX() - loc.getX()),
(float) (click.getY() - loc.getY()));
```

Responding to a right-arrow key press:

```java
int insertionIndex = ...;
TextHitInfo next = layout.getNextRightHit(insertionIndex);
if (next != null) {
// translate graphics to origin of layout on screen
g.translate(loc.getX(), loc.getY());
Shape[] carets = layout.getCaretShapes(next.getInsertionIndex());
g.draw(carets[0]);
if (carets[1] != null) {
g.draw(carets[1]);
}
}
```

Drawing a selection range corresponding to a substring in the source text.
The selected area may not be visually contiguous:

```java
// selStart, selLimit should be relative to the layout,
// not to the source text

int selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;
Color selectionColor = ...;
Shape selection = layout.getLogicalHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);
// selection may consist of disjoint areas
// graphics is assumed to be translated to origin of layout
g.setColor(selectionColor);
g.fill(selection);
```

Drawing a visually contiguous selection range. The selection range may
correspond to more than one substring in the source text. The ranges of
the corresponding source text substrings can be obtained with

getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection()

:

```java
TextHitInfo selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;
Shape selection = layout.getVisualHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);
g.setColor(selectionColor);
g.fill(selection);
int[] ranges = getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection(selStart, selLimit);
// ranges[0], ranges[1] is the first selection range,
// ranges[2], ranges[3] is the second selection range, etc.
```

Note: Font rotations can cause text baselines to be rotated, and
multiple runs with different rotations can cause the baseline to
bend or zig-zag. In order to account for this (rare) possibility,
some APIs are specified to return metrics and take parameters 'in
baseline-relative coordinates' (e.g. ascent, advance), and others
are in 'in standard coordinates' (e.g. getBounds). Values in
baseline-relative coordinates map the 'x' coordinate to the
distance along the baseline, (positive x is forward along the
baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance along the
perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (positive y is 90 degrees
clockwise from the baseline vector). Values in standard
coordinates are measured along the x and y axes, with 0,0 at the
origin of the TextLayout. Documentation for each relevant API
indicates what values are in what coordinate system. In general,
measurement-related APIs are in baseline-relative coordinates,
while display-related APIs are in standard coordinates.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Cloneable

### Field Details

#### public static final
TextLayout.CaretPolicy
DEFAULT_CARET_POLICY

This

CaretPolicy

is used when a policy is not specified
by the client. With this policy, a hit on a character whose direction
is the same as the line direction is stronger than a hit on a
counterdirectional character. If the characters' directions are
the same, a hit on the leading edge of a character is stronger
than a hit on the trailing edge of a character.

### Constructor Details

#### public TextLayout​(
String
string,

Font
font,

FontRenderContext
frc)

Constructs a

TextLayout

from a

String

### Method Details

#### protected
Object
clone()

Creates a copy of this

TextLayout

.

**Overrides:**
- clone

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- a clone of this instance.

**See Also:**
- Cloneable

---

#### public
TextLayout
getJustifiedLayout​(float justificationWidth)

Creates a copy of this

TextLayout

justified to the
specified width.

If this

TextLayout

has already been justified, an
exception is thrown. If this

TextLayout

object's
justification ratio is zero, a

TextLayout

identical
to this

TextLayout

is returned.

**Parameters:**
- justificationWidth

- the width to use when justifying the line.
For best results, it should not be too different from the current
advance of the line.

**Returns:**
- a

TextLayout

justified to the specified width.

**Throws:**
- Error

- if this layout has already been justified, an Error is
thrown.

---

#### protected void handleJustify​(float justificationWidth)

Justify this layout. Overridden by subclassers to control justification
(if there were subclassers, that is...)

The layout will only justify if the paragraph attributes (from the
source text, possibly defaulted by the layout attributes) indicate a
non-zero justification ratio. The text will be justified to the
indicated width. The current implementation also adjusts hanging
punctuation and trailing whitespace to overhang the justification width.
Once justified, the layout may not be rejustified.

Some code may rely on immutability of layouts. Subclassers should not
call this directly, but instead should call getJustifiedLayout, which
will call this method on a clone of this layout, preserving
the original.

**Parameters:**
- justificationWidth

- the width to use when justifying the line.
For best results, it should not be too different from the current
advance of the line.

**See Also:**
- getJustifiedLayout(float)

---

#### public byte getBaseline()

Returns the baseline for this

TextLayout

.
The baseline is one of the values defined in

Font

,
which are roman, centered and hanging. Ascent and descent are
relative to this baseline. The

baselineOffsets

are also relative to this baseline.

**Returns:**
- the baseline of this

TextLayout

.

**See Also:**
- getBaselineOffsets()

,

Font

---

#### public float[] getBaselineOffsets()

Returns the offsets array for the baselines used for this

TextLayout

.

The array is indexed by one of the values defined in

Font

, which are roman, centered and hanging. The
values are relative to this

TextLayout

object's
baseline, so that

getBaselineOffsets[getBaseline()] == 0

.
Offsets are added to the position of the

TextLayout

object's baseline to get the position for the new baseline.

**Returns:**
- the offsets array containing the baselines used for this

TextLayout

.

**See Also:**
- getBaseline()

,

Font

---

#### public float getAdvance()

Returns the advance of this

TextLayout

.
The advance is the distance from the origin to the advance of the
rightmost (bottommost) character. This is in baseline-relative
coordinates.

**Returns:**
- the advance of this

TextLayout

.

---

#### public float getVisibleAdvance()

Returns the advance of this

TextLayout

, minus trailing
whitespace. This is in baseline-relative coordinates.

**Returns:**
- the advance of this

TextLayout

without the
trailing whitespace.

**See Also:**
- getAdvance()

---

#### public float getAscent()

Returns the ascent of this

TextLayout

.
The ascent is the distance from the top (right) of the

TextLayout

to the baseline. It is always either
positive or zero. The ascent is sufficient to
accommodate superscripted text and is the maximum of the sum of the
ascent, offset, and baseline of each glyph. The ascent is
the maximum ascent from the baseline of all the text in the
TextLayout. It is in baseline-relative coordinates.

**Returns:**
- the ascent of this

TextLayout

.

---

#### public float getDescent()

Returns the descent of this

TextLayout

.
The descent is the distance from the baseline to the bottom (left) of
the

TextLayout

. It is always either positive or zero.
The descent is sufficient to accommodate subscripted text and is the
maximum of the sum of the descent, offset, and baseline of each glyph.
This is the maximum descent from the baseline of all the text in
the TextLayout. It is in baseline-relative coordinates.

**Returns:**
- the descent of this

TextLayout

.

---

#### public float getLeading()

Returns the leading of the

TextLayout

.
The leading is the suggested interline spacing for this

TextLayout

. This is in baseline-relative
coordinates.

The leading is computed from the leading, descent, and baseline
of all glyphvectors in the

TextLayout

. The algorithm
is roughly as follows:

```java
maxD = 0;
maxDL = 0;
for (GlyphVector g in all glyphvectors) {
maxD = max(maxD, g.getDescent() + offsets[g.getBaseline()]);
maxDL = max(maxDL, g.getDescent() + g.getLeading() +
offsets[g.getBaseline()]);
}
return maxDL - maxD;
```

**Returns:**
- the leading of this

TextLayout

.

---

#### public
Rectangle2D
getBounds()

Returns the bounds of this

TextLayout

.
The bounds are in standard coordinates.

Due to rasterization effects, this bounds might not enclose all of the
pixels rendered by the TextLayout.

It might not coincide exactly with the ascent, descent,
origin or advance of the

TextLayout

.

**Returns:**
- a

Rectangle2D

that is the bounds of this

TextLayout

.

---

#### public
Rectangle
getPixelBounds​(
FontRenderContext
frc,
float x,
float y)

Returns the pixel bounds of this

TextLayout

when
rendered in a graphics with the given

FontRenderContext

at the given location. The
graphics render context need not be the same as the

FontRenderContext

used to create this

TextLayout

, and can be null. If it is null, the

FontRenderContext

of this

TextLayout

is used.

**Parameters:**
- frc

- the

FontRenderContext

of the

Graphics

.
- x

- the x-coordinate at which to render this

TextLayout

.
- y

- the y-coordinate at which to render this

TextLayout

.

**Returns:**
- a

Rectangle

bounding the pixels that would be affected.

**See Also:**
- GlyphVector.getPixelBounds(java.awt.font.FontRenderContext, float, float)

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public boolean isLeftToRight()

Returns

true

if this

TextLayout

has
a left-to-right base direction or

false

if it has
a right-to-left base direction. The

TextLayout

has a base direction of either left-to-right (LTR) or
right-to-left (RTL). The base direction is independent of the
actual direction of text on the line, which may be either LTR,
RTL, or mixed. Left-to-right layouts by default should position
flush left. If the layout is on a tabbed line, the
tabs run left to right, so that logically successive layouts position
left to right. The opposite is true for RTL layouts. By default they
should position flush left, and tabs run right-to-left.

**Returns:**
- true

if the base direction of this

TextLayout

is left-to-right;

false

otherwise.

---

#### public boolean isVertical()

Returns

true

if this

TextLayout

is vertical.

**Returns:**
- true

if this

TextLayout

is vertical;

false

otherwise.

---

#### public int getCharacterCount()

- the number of characters in this

TextLayout

.

---

#### public float[] getCaretInfo​(
TextHitInfo
hit,

Rectangle2D
bounds)

Returns information about the caret corresponding to

hit

.
The first element of the array is the intersection of the caret with
the baseline, as a distance along the baseline. The second element
of the array is the inverse slope (run/rise) of the caret, measured
with respect to the baseline at that point.

This method is meant for informational use. To display carets, it
is better to use

getCaretShapes

.

Shape
[] getCaretShapes​(int offset,

Rectangle2D
bounds,

TextLayout.CaretPolicy
policy)

Returns two paths corresponding to the strong and weak caret.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- an offset in this

TextLayout
- bounds

- the bounds to which to extend the carets. The
bounds is in baseline-relative coordinates.
- policy

Shape
[] getCaretShapes​(int offset,

Rectangle2D
bounds)

Returns two paths corresponding to the strong and weak caret.
This method is a convenience overload of

getCaretShapes

that uses the default caret policy.

- an offset in this

TextLayout
- bounds

- the bounds to which to extend the carets. This is
in baseline-relative coordinates.

defined by the

DEFAULT_CARET_POLICY

. These are
in standard coordinates.

---

#### public
Shape
[] getCaretShapes​(int offset)

Returns two paths corresponding to the strong and weak caret.
This method is a convenience overload of

getCaretShapes

that uses the default caret policy and this

TextLayout

object's natural bounds.

**Parameters:**
- offset

- an offset in this

TextLayout

**Returns:**
- two paths corresponding to the strong and weak caret as
defined by the

DEFAULT_CARET_POLICY

. These are
in standard coordinates.

---

#### public int[] getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection​(
TextHitInfo
firstEndpoint,

TextHitInfo
secondEndpoint)

Returns the logical ranges of text corresponding to a visual selection.

**Parameters:**
- firstEndpoint

- an endpoint of the visual range
- secondEndpoint

- the other endpoint of the visual range.
This endpoint can be less than

firstEndpoint

.

**Returns:**
- an array of integers representing start/limit pairs for the
selected ranges.

**See Also:**
- getVisualHighlightShape(TextHitInfo, TextHitInfo, Rectangle2D)

---

#### public
Shape
getVisualHighlightShape​(
TextHitInfo
firstEndpoint,

TextHitInfo
secondEndpoint,

Rectangle2D
bounds)

Returns a path enclosing the visual selection in the specified range,
extended to

bounds

.

If the selection includes the leftmost (topmost) position, the selection
is extended to the left (top) of

bounds

. If the
selection includes the rightmost (bottommost) position, the selection
is extended to the right (bottom) of the bounds. The height
(width on vertical lines) of the selection is always extended to

bounds

.

Although the selection is always contiguous, the logically selected
text can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text. The
logical ranges of text selected can be retrieved using

getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection

. For example,
consider the text 'ABCdef' where capital letters indicate
right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line, with a visual
selection from 0L (the leading edge of 'A') to 3T (the trailing edge
of 'd'). The text appears as follows, with bold underlined areas
representing the selection:

```java
d
efCBA
```

The logical selection ranges are 0-3, 4-6 (ABC, ef) because the
visually contiguous text is logically discontiguous. Also note that
since the rightmost position on the layout (to the right of 'A') is
selected, the selection is extended to the right of the bounds.

**Parameters:**
- firstEndpoint

- one end of the visual selection
- secondEndpoint

- the other end of the visual selection
- bounds

- the bounding rectangle to which to extend the selection.
This is in baseline-relative coordinates.

**Returns:**
- a

Shape

enclosing the selection. This is in
standard coordinates.

**See Also:**
- getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection(TextHitInfo, TextHitInfo)

,

getLogicalHighlightShape(int, int, Rectangle2D)

---

#### public
Shape
getVisualHighlightShape​(
TextHitInfo
firstEndpoint,

TextHitInfo
secondEndpoint)

Returns a

Shape

enclosing the visual selection in the
specified range, extended to the bounds. This method is a
convenience overload of

getVisualHighlightShape

that
uses the natural bounds of this

TextLayout

.

**Parameters:**
- firstEndpoint

- one end of the visual selection
- secondEndpoint

- the other end of the visual selection

**Returns:**
- a

Shape

enclosing the selection. This is
in standard coordinates.

---

#### public
Shape
getLogicalHighlightShape​(int firstEndpoint,
int secondEndpoint,

Rectangle2D
bounds)

Returns a

Shape

enclosing the logical selection in the
specified range, extended to the specified

bounds

.

If the selection range includes the first logical character, the
selection is extended to the portion of

bounds

before
the start of this

TextLayout

. If the range includes
the last logical character, the selection is extended to the portion
of

bounds

after the end of this

TextLayout

.
The height (width on vertical lines) of the selection is always
extended to

bounds

.

The selection can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text.
Only those characters in the logical range between start and limit
appear selected. For example, consider the text 'ABCdef' where capital
letters indicate right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line,
with a logical selection from 0 to 4 ('ABCd'). The text appears as
follows, with bold standing in for the selection, and underlining for
the extension:

```java
d
ef
CBA
```

The selection is discontiguous because the selected characters are
visually discontiguous. Also note that since the range includes the
first logical character (A), the selection is extended to the portion
of the

bounds

before the start of the layout, which in
this case (a right-to-left line) is the right portion of the

bounds

.

TextLayout

is an immutable graphical representation of styled
character data.

It provides the following capabilities:

- implicit bidirectional analysis and reordering,

cursor positioning and movement, including split cursors for
mixed directional text,

highlighting, including both logical and visual highlighting
for mixed directional text,

multiple baselines (roman, hanging, and centered),

hit testing,

justification,

default font substitution,

metric information such as ascent, descent, and advance, and

rendering

A

TextLayout

object can be rendered using
its

draw

method.

TextLayout

can be constructed either directly or through
the use of a

LineBreakMeasurer

. When constructed directly, the
source text represents a single paragraph.

LineBreakMeasurer

allows styled text to be broken into lines that fit within a particular
width. See the

LineBreakMeasurer

documentation for more
information.

TextLayout

construction logically proceeds as follows:

- paragraph attributes are extracted and examined,

text is analyzed for bidirectional reordering, and reordering
information is computed if needed,

text is segmented into style runs

fonts are chosen for style runs, first by using a font if the
attribute

TextAttribute.FONT

is present, otherwise by computing
a default font using the attributes that have been defined

if text is on multiple baselines, the runs or subruns are further
broken into subruns sharing a common baseline,

glyphvectors are generated for each run using the chosen font,

final bidirectional reordering is performed on the glyphvectors

All graphical information returned from a

TextLayout

object's methods is relative to the origin of the

TextLayout

, which is the intersection of the

TextLayout

object's baseline with its left edge. Also,
coordinates passed into a

TextLayout

object's methods
are assumed to be relative to the

TextLayout

object's
origin. Clients usually need to translate between a

TextLayout

object's coordinate system and the coordinate
system in another object (such as a

Graphics

object).

TextLayout

objects are constructed from styled text,
but they do not retain a reference to their source text. Thus,
changes in the text previously used to generate a

TextLayout

do not affect the

TextLayout

.

Three methods on a

TextLayout

object
(

getNextRightHit

,

getNextLeftHit

, and

hitTestChar

) return instances of

TextHitInfo

.
The offsets contained in these

TextHitInfo

objects
are relative to the start of the

TextLayout

,

not

to the text used to create the

TextLayout

. Similarly,

TextLayout

methods that accept

TextHitInfo

instances as parameters expect the

TextHitInfo

object's
offsets to be relative to the

TextLayout

, not to any
underlying text storage model.

Examples

:

Constructing and drawing a

TextLayout

and its bounding
rectangle:

```java
Graphics2D g = ...;
Point2D loc = ...;
Font font = Font.getFont("Helvetica-bold-italic");
FontRenderContext frc = g.getFontRenderContext();
TextLayout layout = new TextLayout("This is a string", font, frc);
layout.draw(g, (float)loc.getX(), (float)loc.getY());

Rectangle2D bounds = layout.getBounds();
bounds.setRect(bounds.getX()+loc.getX(),
bounds.getY()+loc.getY(),
bounds.getWidth(),
bounds.getHeight());
g.draw(bounds);
```

Hit-testing a

TextLayout

(determining which character is at
a particular graphical location):

```java
Point2D click = ...;
TextHitInfo hit = layout.hitTestChar(
(float) (click.getX() - loc.getX()),
(float) (click.getY() - loc.getY()));
```

Responding to a right-arrow key press:

```java
int insertionIndex = ...;
TextHitInfo next = layout.getNextRightHit(insertionIndex);
if (next != null) {
// translate graphics to origin of layout on screen
g.translate(loc.getX(), loc.getY());
Shape[] carets = layout.getCaretShapes(next.getInsertionIndex());
g.draw(carets[0]);
if (carets[1] != null) {
g.draw(carets[1]);
}
}
```

Drawing a selection range corresponding to a substring in the source text.
The selected area may not be visually contiguous:

```java
// selStart, selLimit should be relative to the layout,
// not to the source text

int selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;
Color selectionColor = ...;
Shape selection = layout.getLogicalHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);
// selection may consist of disjoint areas
// graphics is assumed to be translated to origin of layout
g.setColor(selectionColor);
g.fill(selection);
```

Drawing a visually contiguous selection range. The selection range may
correspond to more than one substring in the source text. The ranges of
the corresponding source text substrings can be obtained with

getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection()

:

```java
TextHitInfo selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;
Shape selection = layout.getVisualHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);
g.setColor(selectionColor);
g.fill(selection);
int[] ranges = getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection(selStart, selLimit);
// ranges[0], ranges[1] is the first selection range,
// ranges[2], ranges[3] is the second selection range, etc.
```

Note: Font rotations can cause text baselines to be rotated, and
multiple runs with different rotations can cause the baseline to
bend or zig-zag. In order to account for this (rare) possibility,
some APIs are specified to return metrics and take parameters 'in
baseline-relative coordinates' (e.g. ascent, advance), and others
are in 'in standard coordinates' (e.g. getBounds). Values in
baseline-relative coordinates map the 'x' coordinate to the
distance along the baseline, (positive x is forward along the
baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance along the
perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (positive y is 90 degrees
clockwise from the baseline vector). Values in standard
coordinates are measured along the x and y axes, with 0,0 at the
origin of the TextLayout. Documentation for each relevant API
indicates what values are in what coordinate system. In general,
measurement-related APIs are in baseline-relative coordinates,
while display-related APIs are in standard coordinates.

multiple runs with different rotations can cause the baseline to
bend or zig-zag. In order to account for this (rare) possibility,
some APIs are specified to return metrics and take parameters 'in
baseline-relative coordinates' (e.g. ascent, advance), and others
are in 'in standard coordinates' (e.g. getBounds). Values in
baseline-relative coordinates map the 'x' coordinate to the
distance along the baseline, (positive x is forward along the
baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance along the
perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (positive y is 90 degrees
clockwise from the baseline vector). Values in standard
coordinates are measured along the x and y axes, with 0,0 at the
origin of the TextLayout. Documentation for each relevant API
indicates what values are in what coordinate system. In general,
measurement-related APIs are in baseline-relative coordinates,
while display-related APIs are in standard coordinates.

TextLayout

can be constructed either directly or through
the use of a

LineBreakMeasurer

. When constructed directly, the
source text represents a single paragraph.

LineBreakMeasurer

allows styled text to be broken into lines that fit within a particular
width. See the

LineBreakMeasurer

documentation for more
information.

TextLayout

construction logically proceeds as follows:

- paragraph attributes are extracted and examined,

text is analyzed for bidirectional reordering, and reordering
information is computed if needed,

text is segmented into style runs

fonts are chosen for style runs, first by using a font if the
attribute

TextAttribute.FONT

is present, otherwise by computing
a default font using the attributes that have been defined

if text is on multiple baselines, the runs or subruns are further
broken into subruns sharing a common baseline,

glyphvectors are generated for each run using the chosen font,

final bidirectional reordering is performed on the glyphvectors

All graphical information returned from a

TextLayout

object's methods is relative to the origin of the

TextLayout

, which is the intersection of the

TextLayout

object's baseline with its left edge. Also,
coordinates passed into a

TextLayout

object's methods
are assumed to be relative to the

TextLayout

object's
origin. Clients usually need to translate between a

TextLayout

object's coordinate system and the coordinate
system in another object (such as a

Graphics

object).

TextLayout

objects are constructed from styled text,
but they do not retain a reference to their source text. Thus,
changes in the text previously used to generate a

TextLayout

do not affect the

TextLayout

.

Three methods on a

TextLayout

object
(

getNextRightHit

,

getNextLeftHit

, and

hitTestChar

) return instances of

TextHitInfo

.
The offsets contained in these

TextHitInfo

objects
are relative to the start of the

TextLayout

,

not

to the text used to create the

TextLayout

. Similarly,

TextLayout

methods that accept

TextHitInfo

instances as parameters expect the

TextHitInfo

object's
offsets to be relative to the

TextLayout

, not to any
underlying text storage model.

Examples

:

Constructing and drawing a

TextLayout

and its bounding
rectangle:

```java
Graphics2D g = ...;
Point2D loc = ...;
Font font = Font.getFont("Helvetica-bold-italic");
FontRenderContext frc = g.getFontRenderContext();
TextLayout layout = new TextLayout("This is a string", font, frc);
layout.draw(g, (float)loc.getX(), (float)loc.getY());

Rectangle2D bounds = layout.getBounds();
bounds.setRect(bounds.getX()+loc.getX(),
bounds.getY()+loc.getY(),
bounds.getWidth(),
bounds.getHeight());
g.draw(bounds);
```

Hit-testing a

TextLayout

(determining which character is at
a particular graphical location):

```java
Point2D click = ...;
TextHitInfo hit = layout.hitTestChar(
(float) (click.getX() - loc.getX()),
(float) (click.getY() - loc.getY()));
```

Responding to a right-arrow key press:

```java
int insertionIndex = ...;
TextHitInfo next = layout.getNextRightHit(insertionIndex);
if (next != null) {
// translate graphics to origin of layout on screen
g.translate(loc.getX(), loc.getY());
Shape[] carets = layout.getCaretShapes(next.getInsertionIndex());
g.draw(carets[0]);
if (carets[1] != null) {
g.draw(carets[1]);
}
}
```

Drawing a selection range corresponding to a substring in the source text.
The selected area may not be visually contiguous:

```java
// selStart, selLimit should be relative to the layout,
// not to the source text

int selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;
Color selectionColor = ...;
Shape selection = layout.getLogicalHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);
// selection may consist of disjoint areas
// graphics is assumed to be translated to origin of layout
g.setColor(selectionColor);
g.fill(selection);
```

Drawing a visually contiguous selection range. The selection range may
correspond to more than one substring in the source text. The ranges of
the corresponding source text substrings can be obtained with

:

```java
TextHitInfo selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;
Shape selection = layout.getVisualHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);
g.setColor(selectionColor);

int[] ranges = getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection(selStart, selLimit);
// ranges[0], ranges[1] is the first selection range,
// ranges[2], ranges[3] is the second selection range, etc.
```

Drawing a selection range corresponding to a substring in the source text.
The selected area may not be visually contiguous:

```java
// selStart, selLimit should be relative to the layout,
// not to the source text

int selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;
Color selectionColor = ...;
Shape selection = layout.getLogicalHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);
// selection may consist of disjoint areas
// graphics is assumed to be translated to origin of layout
g.setColor(selectionColor);
g.fill(selection);
```

Drawing a visually contiguous selection range. The selection range may
correspond to more than one substring in the source text. The ranges of
the corresponding source text substrings can be obtained with

getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection()

:

```java
TextHitInfo selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;
Shape selection = layout.getVisualHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);
g.setColor(selectionColor);
g.fill(selection);
int[] ranges = getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection(selStart, selLimit);
// ranges[0], ranges[1] is the first selection range,
// ranges[2], ranges[3] is the second selection range, etc.
```

Note: Font rotations can cause text baselines to be rotated, and
multiple runs with different rotations can cause the baseline to
bend or zig-zag. In order to account for this (rare) possibility,
some APIs are specified to return metrics and take parameters 'in
baseline-relative coordinates' (e.g. ascent, advance), and others
are in 'in standard coordinates' (e.g. getBounds). Values in
baseline-relative coordinates map the 'x' coordinate to the
distance along the baseline, (positive x is forward along the
baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance along the
perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (positive y is 90 degrees
clockwise from the baseline vector). Values in standard
coordinates are measured along the x and y axes, with 0,0 at the
origin of the TextLayout. Documentation for each relevant API
indicates what values are in what coordinate system. In general,
measurement-related APIs are in baseline-relative coordinates,
while display-related APIs are in standard coordinates.

Graphics2D g = ...;
Point2D loc = ...;
Font font = Font.getFont("Helvetica-bold-italic");

```

Responding to a right-arrow key press:

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- DEFAULT_CARET_POLICY

```java
public static final
TextLayout.CaretPolicy
DEFAULT_CARET_POLICY
```

This

CaretPolicy

is used when a policy is not specified
by the client. With this policy, a hit on a character whose direction
is the same as the line direction is stronger than a hit on a
counterdirectional character. If the characters' directions are
the same, a hit on the leading edge of a character is stronger
than a hit on the trailing edge of a character.

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- TextLayout

```java
public TextLayout​(
String
string,

Font
font,

FontRenderContext
frc)
```

Constructs a

TextLayout

from a

String

and a

Font

. All the text is styled using the specified

Font

.

from a

String

and an attribute set.

All the text is styled using the provided attributes.

string

must specify a single paragraph of text because an
entire paragraph is required for the bidirectional algorithm.

**Parameters:** string

- the text to display
**Parameters:** attributes

- the attributes used to style the text
**Parameters:** frc

- contains information about a graphics device which is needed
to measure the text correctly.
Text measurements can vary slightly depending on the
device resolution, and attributes such as antialiasing. This
parameter does not specify a translation between the

TextLayout

and user space.

- TextLayout

```java
public TextLayout​(
AttributedCharacterIterator
text,

FontRenderContext
frc)
```

Constructs a

TextLayout

from an iterator over styled text.

The iterator must specify a single paragraph of text because an
entire paragraph is required for the bidirectional
algorithm.

**Parameters:** text

- the styled text to display
**Parameters:** frc

- contains information about a graphics device which is needed
to measure the text correctly.
Text measurements can vary slightly depending on the
device resolution, and attributes such as antialiasing. This
parameter does not specify a translation between the

TextLayout

and user space.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- clone

```java
protected
Object
clone()
```

Creates a copy of this

TextLayout

.

**Overrides:** clone

in class

Object
**Returns:** a clone of this instance.
**See Also:** Cloneable

- getJustifiedLayout

```java
public
TextLayout
getJustifiedLayout​(float justificationWidth)
```

Creates a copy of this

TextLayout

justified to the
specified width.

If this

TextLayout

has already been justified, an
exception is thrown. If this

TextLayout

object's
justification ratio is zero, a

TextLayout

identical
to this

TextLayout

is returned.

**Parameters:** justificationWidth

- the width to use when justifying the line.
For best results, it should not be too different from the current
advance of the line.
**Returns:** a

TextLayout

justified to the specified width.
**Throws:** Error

- if this layout has already been justified, an Error is
thrown.

- handleJustify

```java
protected void handleJustify​(float justificationWidth)
```

Justify this layout. Overridden by subclassers to control justification
(if there were subclassers, that is...)

The layout will only justify if the paragraph attributes (from the
source text, possibly defaulted by the layout attributes) indicate a
non-zero justification ratio. The text will be justified to the
indicated width. The current implementation also adjusts hanging
punctuation and trailing whitespace to overhang the justification width.
Once justified, the layout may not be rejustified.

Some code may rely on immutability of layouts. Subclassers should not
call this directly, but instead should call getJustifiedLayout, which
will call this method on a clone of this layout, preserving
the original.

**Parameters:** justificationWidth

- the width to use when justifying the line.
For best results, it should not be too different from the current
advance of the line.
**See Also:** getJustifiedLayout(float)

- getBaseline

```java
public byte getBaseline()
```

Returns the baseline for this

TextLayout

.
The baseline is one of the values defined in

Font

,
which are roman, centered and hanging. Ascent and descent are
relative to this baseline. The

baselineOffsets

are also relative to this baseline.

**Returns:** the baseline of this

TextLayout

.
**See Also:** getBaselineOffsets()

,

Font

- getBaselineOffsets

```java
public float[] getBaselineOffsets()
```

Returns the offsets array for the baselines used for this

TextLayout

.

The array is indexed by one of the values defined in

Font

, which are roman, centered and hanging. The
values are relative to this

TextLayout

object's
baseline, so that

getBaselineOffsets[getBaseline()] == 0

.
Offsets are added to the position of the

TextLayout

object's baseline to get the position for the new baseline.

**Returns:** the offsets array containing the baselines used for this

TextLayout

.
**See Also:** getBaseline()

,

Font

- getAdvance

```java
public float getAdvance()
```

Returns the advance of this

TextLayout

.
The advance is the distance from the origin to the advance of the
rightmost (bottommost) character. This is in baseline-relative
coordinates.

**Returns:** the advance of this

TextLayout

.

- getVisibleAdvance

```java
public float getVisibleAdvance()
```

Returns the advance of this

TextLayout

, minus trailing
whitespace. This is in baseline-relative coordinates.

**Returns:** the advance of this

TextLayout

without the
trailing whitespace.
**See Also:** getAdvance()

- getAscent

```java
public float getAscent()
```

Returns the ascent of this

TextLayout

.
The ascent is the distance from the top (right) of the

TextLayout

to the baseline. It is always either
positive or zero. The ascent is sufficient to
accommodate superscripted text and is the maximum of the sum of the
ascent, offset, and baseline of each glyph. The ascent is
the maximum ascent from the baseline of all the text in the
TextLayout. It is in baseline-relative coordinates.

**Returns:** the ascent of this

TextLayout

.

- getDescent

```java
public float getDescent()
```

Returns the descent of this

TextLayout

.
The descent is the distance from the baseline to the bottom (left) of
the

TextLayout

. It is always either positive or zero.
The descent is sufficient to accommodate subscripted text and is the
maximum of the sum of the descent, offset, and baseline of each glyph.
This is the maximum descent from the baseline of all the text in
the TextLayout. It is in baseline-relative coordinates.

**Returns:** the descent of this

TextLayout

.

- getLeading

```java
public float getLeading()
```

Returns the leading of the

TextLayout

.
The leading is the suggested interline spacing for this

TextLayout

. This is in baseline-relative
coordinates.

The leading is computed from the leading, descent, and baseline
of all glyphvectors in the

TextLayout

. The algorithm
is roughly as follows:

```java
maxD = 0;
maxDL = 0;
for (GlyphVector g in all glyphvectors) {
maxD = max(maxD, g.getDescent() + offsets[g.getBaseline()]);
maxDL = max(maxDL, g.getDescent() + g.getLeading() +
offsets[g.getBaseline()]);
}
return maxDL - maxD;
```

**Returns:** the leading of this

TextLayout

.

- getBounds

```java
public
Rectangle2D
getBounds()
```

Returns the bounds of this

TextLayout

.
The bounds are in standard coordinates.

Due to rasterization effects, this bounds might not enclose all of the
pixels rendered by the TextLayout.

It might not coincide exactly with the ascent, descent,
origin or advance of the

TextLayout

.

**Returns:** a

Rectangle2D

that is the bounds of this

TextLayout

.

- getPixelBounds

```java
public
Rectangle
getPixelBounds​(
FontRenderContext
frc,
float x,
float y)
```

Returns the pixel bounds of this

TextLayout

when
rendered in a graphics with the given

FontRenderContext

at the given location. The
graphics render context need not be the same as the

FontRenderContext

used to create this

TextLayout

, and can be null. If it is null, the

FontRenderContext

of this

TextLayout

is used.

**Parameters:** frc

- the

FontRenderContext

of the

Graphics

.
**Parameters:** x

- the x-coordinate at which to render this

TextLayout

.
**Parameters:** y

- the y-coordinate at which to render this

TextLayout

.

Rectangle

bounding the pixels that would be affected.
**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** GlyphVector.getPixelBounds(java.awt.font.FontRenderContext, float, float)

- isLeftToRight

```java
public boolean isLeftToRight()
```

Returns

true

if this

TextLayout

has
a left-to-right base direction or

false

if it has
a right-to-left base direction. The

TextLayout

has a base direction of either left-to-right (LTR) or
right-to-left (RTL). The base direction is independent of the
actual direction of text on the line, which may be either LTR,
RTL, or mixed. Left-to-right layouts by default should position
flush left. If the layout is on a tabbed line, the
tabs run left to right, so that logically successive layouts position
left to right. The opposite is true for RTL layouts. By default they
should position flush left, and tabs run right-to-left.

**Returns:** true

if the base direction of this

TextLayout

is left-to-right;

false

otherwise.

- isVertical

```java
public boolean isVertical()
```

Returns

TextLayout

.

- getCaretInfo

```java
public float[] getCaretInfo​(
TextHitInfo
hit,

Rectangle2D
bounds)
```

Returns information about the caret corresponding to

hit

.
The first element of the array is the intersection of the caret with
the baseline, as a distance along the baseline. The second element
of the array is the inverse slope (run/rise) of the caret, measured
with respect to the baseline at that point.

This method is meant for informational use. To display carets, it
is better to use

getCaretShapes

.

Returns two paths corresponding to the strong and weak caret.
This method is a convenience overload of

getCaretShapes

that uses the default caret policy and this

TextLayout

object's natural bounds.

**Parameters:** offset

- an offset in this

TextLayout
**Returns:** two paths corresponding to the strong and weak caret as
defined by the

DEFAULT_CARET_POLICY

- getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection

```java
public int[] getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection​(
TextHitInfo
firstEndpoint,

TextHitInfo
secondEndpoint)
```

Returns the logical ranges of text corresponding to a visual selection.

**Parameters:** firstEndpoint

- an endpoint of the visual range
**Parameters:** secondEndpoint

- the other endpoint of the visual range.
This endpoint can be less than

firstEndpoint

.
**Returns:** an array of integers representing start/limit pairs for the
selected ranges.
**See Also:** getVisualHighlightShape(TextHitInfo, TextHitInfo, Rectangle2D)

- getVisualHighlightShape

```java
public
Shape
getVisualHighlightShape​(
TextHitInfo
firstEndpoint,

TextHitInfo
secondEndpoint,

Rectangle2D
bounds)
```

Returns a path enclosing the visual selection in the specified range,
extended to

bounds

.

If the selection includes the leftmost (topmost) position, the selection
is extended to the left (top) of

bounds

. If the
selection includes the rightmost (bottommost) position, the selection
is extended to the right (bottom) of the bounds. The height
(width on vertical lines) of the selection is always extended to

bounds

.

Although the selection is always contiguous, the logically selected
text can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text. The
logical ranges of text selected can be retrieved using

getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection

. For example,
consider the text 'ABCdef' where capital letters indicate
right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line, with a visual
selection from 0L (the leading edge of 'A') to 3T (the trailing edge
of 'd'). The text appears as follows, with bold underlined areas
representing the selection:

```java
d
efCBA
```

The logical selection ranges are 0-3, 4-6 (ABC, ef) because the
visually contiguous text is logically discontiguous. Also note that
since the rightmost position on the layout (to the right of 'A') is
selected, the selection is extended to the right of the bounds.

**Parameters:** firstEndpoint

- one end of the visual selection
**Parameters:** secondEndpoint

- the other end of the visual selection
**Parameters:** bounds

- the bounding rectangle to which to extend the selection.
This is in baseline-relative coordinates.
**Returns:** a

Shape

enclosing the selection. This is in
standard coordinates.
**See Also:** getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection(TextHitInfo, TextHitInfo)

,

getLogicalHighlightShape(int, int, Rectangle2D)

- getVisualHighlightShape

```java
public
Shape
getVisualHighlightShape​(
TextHitInfo
firstEndpoint,

TextHitInfo
secondEndpoint)
```

Returns a

Shape

enclosing the visual selection in the
specified range, extended to the bounds. This method is a
convenience overload of

getVisualHighlightShape

that
uses the natural bounds of this

TextLayout

.

**Parameters:** firstEndpoint

- one end of the visual selection
**Parameters:** secondEndpoint

- the other end of the visual selection
**Returns:** a

Shape

enclosing the selection. This is
in standard coordinates.

- getLogicalHighlightShape

```java
public
Shape
getLogicalHighlightShape​(int firstEndpoint,
int secondEndpoint,

Rectangle2D
bounds)
```

Returns a

Shape

enclosing the logical selection in the
specified range, extended to the specified

bounds

.

If the selection range includes the first logical character, the
selection is extended to the portion of

bounds

before
the start of this

TextLayout

. If the range includes
the last logical character, the selection is extended to the portion
of

bounds

after the end of this

TextLayout

.
The height (width on vertical lines) of the selection is always
extended to

bounds

.

The selection can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text.
Only those characters in the logical range between start and limit
appear selected. For example, consider the text 'ABCdef' where capital
letters indicate right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line,
with a logical selection from 0 to 4 ('ABCd'). The text appears as
follows, with bold standing in for the selection, and underlining for
the extension:

```java
d
ef
CBA
```

The selection is discontiguous because the selected characters are
visually discontiguous. Also note that since the range includes the
first logical character (A), the selection is extended to the portion
of the

bounds

before the start of the layout, which in
this case (a right-to-left line) is the right portion of the

bounds

.

**Parameters:** firstEndpoint

- an endpoint in the range of characters to select
**Parameters:** secondEndpoint

- the other endpoint of the range of characters
to select. Can be less than

firstEndpoint

. The range
includes the character at min(firstEndpoint, secondEndpoint), but
excludes max(firstEndpoint, secondEndpoint).
**Parameters:** bounds

- the bounding rectangle to which to extend the selection.
This is in baseline-relative coordinates.
**Returns:** an area enclosing the selection. This is in standard
coordinates.
**See Also:** getVisualHighlightShape(TextHitInfo, TextHitInfo, Rectangle2D)

- getLogicalHighlightShape

```java
public
Shape
getLogicalHighlightShape​(int firstEndpoint,
int secondEndpoint)
```

Returns a

Shape

enclosing the logical selection in the
specified range, extended to the natural bounds of this

TextLayout

. This method is a convenience overload of

getLogicalHighlightShape

that uses the natural bounds of
this

TextLayout

.

**Parameters:** firstEndpoint

- an endpoint in the range of characters to select
**Parameters:** secondEndpoint

- the other endpoint of the range of characters
to select. Can be less than

firstEndpoint

. The range
includes the character at min(firstEndpoint, secondEndpoint), but
excludes max(firstEndpoint, secondEndpoint).
**Returns:** a

Shape

enclosing the selection. This is in
standard coordinates.

- getBlackBoxBounds

```java
public
Shape
getBlackBoxBounds​(int firstEndpoint,
int secondEndpoint)
```

Returns the black box bounds of the characters in the specified range.
The black box bounds is an area consisting of the union of the bounding
boxes of all the glyphs corresponding to the characters between start
and limit. This area can be disjoint.

**Parameters:** firstEndpoint

- one end of the character range
**Parameters:** secondEndpoint

- the other end of the character range. Can be
less than

firstEndpoint

.
**Returns:** a

Method Detail

- clone

```java
protected
Object
clone()
```

Creates a copy of this

TextLayout

.

**Overrides:** clone

in class

Object
**Returns:** a clone of this instance.
**See Also:** Cloneable

- getJustifiedLayout

```java
public
TextLayout
getJustifiedLayout​(float justificationWidth)
```

Creates a copy of this

TextLayout

justified to the
specified width.

If this

TextLayout

has already been justified, an
exception is thrown. If this

TextLayout

object's
justification ratio is zero, a

TextLayout

identical
to this

TextLayout

is returned.

**Parameters:** justificationWidth

- the width to use when justifying the line.
For best results, it should not be too different from the current
advance of the line.
**Returns:** a

TextLayout

justified to the specified width.
**Throws:** Error

- if this layout has already been justified, an Error is
thrown.

- handleJustify

```java
protected void handleJustify​(float justificationWidth)
```

Justify this layout. Overridden by subclassers to control justification
(if there were subclassers, that is...)

The layout will only justify if the paragraph attributes (from the
source text, possibly defaulted by the layout attributes) indicate a
non-zero justification ratio. The text will be justified to the
indicated width. The current implementation also adjusts hanging
punctuation and trailing whitespace to overhang the justification width.
Once justified, the layout may not be rejustified.

Some code may rely on immutability of layouts. Subclassers should not
call this directly, but instead should call getJustifiedLayout, which
will call this method on a clone of this layout, preserving
the original.

**Parameters:** justificationWidth

- the width to use when justifying the line.
For best results, it should not be too different from the current
advance of the line.
**See Also:** getJustifiedLayout(float)

- getBaseline

```java
public byte getBaseline()
```

Returns the baseline for this

TextLayout

.
The baseline is one of the values defined in

Font

,
which are roman, centered and hanging. Ascent and descent are
relative to this baseline. The

baselineOffsets

are also relative to this baseline.

**Returns:** the baseline of this

TextLayout

.
**See Also:** getBaselineOffsets()

,

Font

- getBaselineOffsets

```java
public float[] getBaselineOffsets()
```

Returns the offsets array for the baselines used for this

TextLayout

.

The array is indexed by one of the values defined in

Font

, which are roman, centered and hanging. The
values are relative to this

TextLayout

object's
baseline, so that

getBaselineOffsets[getBaseline()] == 0

.
Offsets are added to the position of the

TextLayout

object's baseline to get the position for the new baseline.

**Returns:** the offsets array containing the baselines used for this

TextLayout

.
**See Also:** getBaseline()

,

Font

- getAdvance

```java

```java
public float getAscent()
```

Returns the ascent of this

TextLayout

.
The ascent is the distance from the top (right) of the

TextLayout

to the baseline. It is always either
positive or zero. The ascent is sufficient to
accommodate superscripted text and is the maximum of the sum of the
ascent, offset, and baseline of each glyph. The ascent is
the maximum ascent from the baseline of all the text in the
TextLayout. It is in baseline-relative coordinates.

**Returns:** the ascent of this

TextLayout

.

- getDescent

```java
public float getDescent()
```

Returns the descent of this

TextLayout

.
The descent is the distance from the baseline to the bottom (left) of
the

TextLayout

. It is always either positive or zero.
The descent is sufficient to accommodate subscripted text and is the
maximum of the sum of the descent, offset, and baseline of each glyph.
This is the maximum descent from the baseline of all the text in
the TextLayout. It is in baseline-relative coordinates.

**Returns:** the descent of this

TextLayout

.

- getLeading

```java
public float getLeading()
```

Returns the leading of the

TextLayout

.
The leading is the suggested interline spacing for this

TextLayout

. This is in baseline-relative
coordinates.

The leading is computed from the leading, descent, and baseline
of all glyphvectors in the

TextLayout

. The algorithm
is roughly as follows:

```java
maxD = 0;
maxDL = 0;
for (GlyphVector g in all glyphvectors) {
maxD = max(maxD, g.getDescent() + offsets[g.getBaseline()]);
maxDL = max(maxDL, g.getDescent() + g.getLeading() +
offsets[g.getBaseline()]);
}
return maxDL - maxD;

pixels rendered by the TextLayout.

It might not coincide exactly with the ascent, descent,
origin or advance of the

TextLayout

.

**Returns:** a

Rectangle2D

that is the bounds of this

TextLayout

.

TextLayout

when
rendered in a graphics with the given

FontRenderContext

at the given location. The
graphics render context need not be the same as the

FontRenderContext

of this

TextLayout

is used.

**Parameters:** frc

- the

FontRenderContext

of the

Graphics

- isLeftToRight

```java
public boolean isLeftToRight()
```

Returns

true

if this

TextLayout

has
a left-to-right base direction or

false

if it has
a right-to-left base direction. The

TextLayout

has a base direction of either left-to-right (LTR) or
right-to-left (RTL). The base direction is independent of the
actual direction of text on the line, which may be either LTR,
RTL, or mixed. Left-to-right layouts by default should position
flush left. If the layout is on a tabbed line, the
tabs run left to right, so that logically successive layouts position
left to right. The opposite is true for RTL layouts. By default they
should position flush left, and tabs run right-to-left.

**Returns:** true

if the base direction of this

TextLayout

is left-to-right;

false

otherwise.

- isVertical

```java
public boolean isVertical()
```

hit

.
The first element of the array is the intersection of the caret with
the baseline, as a distance along the baseline. The second element
of the array is the inverse slope (run/rise) of the caret, measured
with respect to the baseline at that point.

This method is meant for informational use. To display carets, it
is better to use

is extended to the right (bottom) of the bounds. The height
(width on vertical lines) of the selection is always extended to

bounds

.

Although the selection is always contiguous, the logically selected
text can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text. The
logical ranges of text selected can be retrieved using

getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection

. For example,
consider the text 'ABCdef' where capital letters indicate
right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line, with a visual
selection from 0L (the leading edge of 'A') to 3T (the trailing edge
of 'd'). The text appears as follows, with bold underlined areas
representing the selection:

```java
d
efCBA
```

The logical selection ranges are 0-3, 4-6 (ABC, ef) because the
visually contiguous text is logically discontiguous. Also note that
since the rightmost position on the layout (to the right of 'A') is
selected, the selection is extended to the right of the bounds.

**Parameters:** firstEndpoint

- one end of the visual selection
**Parameters:** secondEndpoint

- the other end of the visual selection
**Parameters:** bounds

- the bounding rectangle to which to extend the selection.
This is in baseline-relative coordinates.
**Returns:** a

Shape

enclosing the selection. This is in
standard coordinates.

,

getLogicalHighlightShape(int, int, Rectangle2D)

- getVisualHighlightShape

```java
public
Shape
getVisualHighlightShape​(
TextHitInfo
firstEndpoint,

TextHitInfo
secondEndpoint)
```

Returns a

Shape

enclosing the visual selection in the
specified range, extended to the bounds. This method is a
convenience overload of

getVisualHighlightShape

that
uses the natural bounds of this

TextLayout

.

**Parameters:** firstEndpoint

- one end of the visual selection
**Parameters:** secondEndpoint

- the other end of the visual selection
**Returns:** a

Shape

enclosing the selection. This is
in standard coordinates.

- getLogicalHighlightShape

```java
public
Shape
getLogicalHighlightShape​(int firstEndpoint,
int secondEndpoint,

Rectangle2D
bounds)
```

Returns a

Shape

enclosing the logical selection in the
specified range, extended to the specified

bounds

.

If the selection range includes the first logical character, the
selection is extended to the portion of

bounds

before
the start of this

TextLayout

. If the range includes
the last logical character, the selection is extended to the portion
of

bounds

after the end of this

TextLayout

.
The height (width on vertical lines) of the selection is always
extended to

bounds

.

The selection can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text.
Only those characters in the logical range between start and limit
appear selected. For example, consider the text 'ABCdef' where capital
letters indicate right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line,
with a logical selection from 0 to 4 ('ABCd'). The text appears as
follows, with bold standing in for the selection, and underlining for
the extension:

```java
d
ef
CBA
```

The selection is discontiguous because the selected characters are
visually discontiguous. Also note that since the range includes the
first logical character (A), the selection is extended to the portion
of the

bounds

before the start of the layout, which in
this case (a right-to-left line) is the right portion of the

bounds

.

**Parameters:** firstEndpoint

- an endpoint in the range of characters to select

- the other endpoint of the range of characters
to select. Can be less than

firstEndpoint

. The range

handleJustify

```java
protected void handleJustify​(float justificationWidth)
```

Justify this layout. Overridden by subclassers to control justification
(if there were subclassers, that is...)

The layout will only justify if the paragraph attributes (from the
source text, possibly defaulted by the layout attributes) indicate a
non-zero justification ratio. The text will be justified to the
indicated width. The current implementation also adjusts hanging
punctuation and trailing whitespace to overhang the justification width.
Once justified, the layout may not be rejustified.

Some code may rely on immutability of layouts. Subclassers should not
call this directly, but instead should call getJustifiedLayout, which
will call this method on a clone of this layout, preserving
the original.

**Parameters:** justificationWidth

- the width to use when justifying the line.
For best results, it should not be too different from the current
advance of the line.

```

Returns a path enclosing the visual selection in the specified range,
extended to

bounds

.

If the selection includes the leftmost (topmost) position, the selection
is extended to the left (top) of

bounds

. If the
selection includes the rightmost (bottommost) position, the selection
is extended to the right (bottom) of the bounds. The height
(width on vertical lines) of the selection is always extended to

bounds

.

Although the selection is always contiguous, the logically selected
text can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text. The
logical ranges of text selected can be retrieved using

getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection

. For example,
consider the text 'ABCdef' where capital letters indicate
right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line, with a visual
selection from 0L (the leading edge of 'A') to 3T (the trailing edge
of 'd'). The text appears as follows, with bold underlined areas
representing the selection:

```java
d
efCBA
```

The logical selection ranges are 0-3, 4-6 (ABC, ef) because the
visually contiguous text is logically discontiguous. Also note that
since the rightmost position on the layout (to the right of 'A') is
selected, the selection is extended to the right of the bounds.

**Parameters:** firstEndpoint

edge of the character, as appropriate. If the path is
broken at the side of the character represented by the hit, the
point will be adjacent to the character.
