# Class KeyStore

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\KeyStore.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
KeyStore

extends
Object
```

This class represents a storage facility for cryptographic
keys and certificates.

A

KeyStore

manages different types of entries.
Each type of entry implements the

KeyStore.Entry

interface.
Three basic

KeyStore.Entry

implementations are provided:

- KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry

This type of entry holds a cryptographic

PrivateKey

,
which is optionally stored in a protected format to prevent
unauthorized access. It is also accompanied by a certificate chain
for the corresponding public key.

Private keys and certificate chains are used by a given entity for
self-authentication. Applications for this authentication include software
distribution organizations which sign JAR files as part of releasing
and/or licensing software.

KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry

This type of entry holds a cryptographic

SecretKey

,
which is optionally stored in a protected format to prevent
unauthorized access.

KeyStore.TrustedCertificateEntry

This type of entry contains a single public key

Certificate

belonging to another party. It is called a

trusted certificate

because the keystore owner trusts that the public key in the certificate
indeed belongs to the identity identified by the

subject

(owner)
of the certificate.

This type of entry can be used to authenticate other parties.

Each entry in a keystore is identified by an "alias" string. In the
case of private keys and their associated certificate chains, these strings
distinguish among the different ways in which the entity may authenticate
itself. For example, the entity may authenticate itself using different
certificate authorities, or using different public key algorithms.

Whether aliases are case sensitive is implementation dependent. In order
to avoid problems, it is recommended not to use aliases in a KeyStore that
only differ in case.

Whether keystores are persistent, and the mechanisms used by the
keystore if it is persistent, are not specified here. This allows
use of a variety of techniques for protecting sensitive (e.g., private or
secret) keys. Smart cards or other integrated cryptographic engines
(SafeKeyper) are one option, and simpler mechanisms such as files may also
be used (in a variety of formats).

Typical ways to request a KeyStore object include
specifying an existing keystore file,
relying on the default type and providing a specific keystore type.

- To specify an existing keystore file:

```java
// get keystore password
char[] password = getPassword();

// probe the keystore file and load the keystore entries
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(new File("keyStoreName"), password);
```

The system will probe the specified file to determine its keystore type
and return a keystore implementation with its entries already loaded.
When this approach is used there is no need to call the keystore's

load

method.

To rely on the default type:

```java
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
```

The system will return a keystore implementation for the default type.

To provide a specific keystore type:

```java
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");
```

The system will return the most preferred implementation of the
specified keystore type available in the environment.

Before a keystore can be accessed, it must be

loaded

(unless it was already loaded during instantiation).

```java
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());

// get user password and file input stream
char[] password = getPassword();

try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("keyStoreName")) {
ks.load(fis, password);
}
```

To create an empty keystore using the above

load

method,
pass

null

as the

InputStream

argument.

Once the keystore has been loaded, it is possible
to read existing entries from the keystore, or to write new entries
into the keystore:

```java
KeyStore.ProtectionParameter protParam =
new KeyStore.PasswordProtection(password);

// get my private key
KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry pkEntry = (KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry)
ks.getEntry("privateKeyAlias", protParam);
PrivateKey myPrivateKey = pkEntry.getPrivateKey();

// save my secret key
javax.crypto.SecretKey mySecretKey;
KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry skEntry =
new KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry(mySecretKey);
ks.setEntry("secretKeyAlias", skEntry, protParam);

// store away the keystore
try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("newKeyStoreName")) {
ks.store(fos, password);
}
```

Note that although the same password may be used to
load the keystore, to protect the private key entry,
to protect the secret key entry, and to store the keystore
(as is shown in the sample code above),
different passwords or other protection parameters
may also be used.

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support
the following standard

KeyStore

type:

- PKCS12

This type is described in the

KeyStore section

of the
Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.
Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
other types are supported.

#### Class KeyStore

java.lang.Object

- java.security.KeyStore

java.security.KeyStore

```java
public class
KeyStore

extends
Object
```

This class represents a storage facility for cryptographic
keys and certificates.

A

KeyStore

manages different types of entries.
Each type of entry implements the

KeyStore.Entry

interface.
Three basic

KeyStore.Entry

implementations are provided:

- KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry

This type of entry holds a cryptographic

PrivateKey

,
which is optionally stored in a protected format to prevent
unauthorized access. It is also accompanied by a certificate chain
for the corresponding public key.

Private keys and certificate chains are used by a given entity for
self-authentication. Applications for this authentication include software
distribution organizations which sign JAR files as part of releasing
and/or licensing software.

KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry

This type of entry holds a cryptographic

SecretKey

,
which is optionally stored in a protected format to prevent
unauthorized access.

KeyStore.TrustedCertificateEntry

This type of entry contains a single public key

Certificate

belonging to another party. It is called a

trusted certificate

because the keystore owner trusts that the public key in the certificate
indeed belongs to the identity identified by the

subject

(owner)
of the certificate.

This type of entry can be used to authenticate other parties.

Each entry in a keystore is identified by an "alias" string. In the
case of private keys and their associated certificate chains, these strings
distinguish among the different ways in which the entity may authenticate
itself. For example, the entity may authenticate itself using different
certificate authorities, or using different public key algorithms.

Whether aliases are case sensitive is implementation dependent. In order
to avoid problems, it is recommended not to use aliases in a KeyStore that
only differ in case.

Whether keystores are persistent, and the mechanisms used by the
keystore if it is persistent, are not specified here. This allows
use of a variety of techniques for protecting sensitive (e.g., private or
secret) keys. Smart cards or other integrated cryptographic engines
(SafeKeyper) are one option, and simpler mechanisms such as files may also
be used (in a variety of formats).

Typical ways to request a KeyStore object include
specifying an existing keystore file,
relying on the default type and providing a specific keystore type.

- To specify an existing keystore file:

```java
// get keystore password
char[] password = getPassword();

// probe the keystore file and load the keystore entries
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(new File("keyStoreName"), password);
```

The system will probe the specified file to determine its keystore type
and return a keystore implementation with its entries already loaded.
When this approach is used there is no need to call the keystore's

load

method.

To rely on the default type:

```java
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
```

The system will return a keystore implementation for the default type.

To provide a specific keystore type:

```java
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");
```

The system will return the most preferred implementation of the
specified keystore type available in the environment.

Before a keystore can be accessed, it must be

loaded

(unless it was already loaded during instantiation).

```java
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());

// get user password and file input stream
char[] password = getPassword();

try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("keyStoreName")) {
ks.load(fis, password);
}
```

To create an empty keystore using the above

load

method,
pass

null

as the

InputStream

argument.

Once the keystore has been loaded, it is possible
to read existing entries from the keystore, or to write new entries
into the keystore:

```java
KeyStore.ProtectionParameter protParam =
new KeyStore.PasswordProtection(password);

// get my private key
KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry pkEntry = (KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry)
ks.getEntry("privateKeyAlias", protParam);
PrivateKey myPrivateKey = pkEntry.getPrivateKey();

// save my secret key
javax.crypto.SecretKey mySecretKey;
KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry skEntry =
new KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry(mySecretKey);
ks.setEntry("secretKeyAlias", skEntry, protParam);

// store away the keystore
try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("newKeyStoreName")) {
ks.store(fos, password);
}
```

Note that although the same password may be used to
load the keystore, to protect the private key entry,
to protect the secret key entry, and to store the keystore
(as is shown in the sample code above),
different passwords or other protection parameters
may also be used.

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support
the following standard

KeyStore

type:

- PKCS12

This type is described in the

KeyStore section

of the
Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.
Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
other types are supported.

char[] password = getPassword();

// probe the keystore file and load the keystore entries
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(new File("keyStoreName"), password);
```

The system will probe the specified file to determine its keystore type
and return a keystore implementation with its entries already loaded.
When this approach is used there is no need to call the keystore's

load

method.

To rely on the default type:

```java
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
```

The system will return a keystore implementation for the default type.

To provide a specific keystore type:

```java
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");
```

The system will return the most preferred implementation of the
specified keystore type available in the environment.

// get keystore password
char[] password = getPassword();

// probe the keystore file and load the keystore entries
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(new File("keyStoreName"), password);

KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());

KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");

Before a keystore can be accessed, it must be

loaded

(unless it was already loaded during instantiation).

```java
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());

// get user password and file input stream
char[] password = getPassword();

try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("keyStoreName")) {
ks.load(fis, password);
}
```

To create an empty keystore using the above

load

method,
pass

null

as the

InputStream

argument.

Once the keystore has been loaded, it is possible
to read existing entries from the keystore, or to write new entries
into the keystore:

```java
KeyStore.ProtectionParameter protParam =
new KeyStore.PasswordProtection(password);

// get my private key
KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry pkEntry = (KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry)
ks.getEntry("privateKeyAlias", protParam);
PrivateKey myPrivateKey = pkEntry.getPrivateKey();

// save my secret key
javax.crypto.SecretKey mySecretKey;
KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry skEntry =
new KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry(mySecretKey);
ks.setEntry("secretKeyAlias", skEntry, protParam);

// store away the keystore
try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("newKeyStoreName")) {
ks.store(fos, password);
}
```

Note that although the same password may be used to
load the keystore, to protect the private key entry,
to protect the secret key entry, and to store the keystore
(as is shown in the sample code above),
different passwords or other protection parameters
may also be used.

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support
the following standard

KeyStore

type:

- PKCS12

This type is described in the

KeyStore section

of the
Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.
Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
other types are supported.

KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());

// get user password and file input stream
char[] password = getPassword();

try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("keyStoreName")) {
ks.load(fis, password);
}

Once the keystore has been loaded, it is possible
to read existing entries from the keystore, or to write new entries
into the keystore:

```java
KeyStore.ProtectionParameter protParam =
new KeyStore.PasswordProtection(password);

// get my private key
KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry pkEntry = (KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry)
ks.getEntry("privateKeyAlias", protParam);
PrivateKey myPrivateKey = pkEntry.getPrivateKey();

// save my secret key
javax.crypto.SecretKey mySecretKey;
KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry skEntry =
new KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry(mySecretKey);
ks.setEntry("secretKeyAlias", skEntry, protParam);

// store away the keystore
try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("newKeyStoreName")) {
ks.store(fos, password);
}
```

Note that although the same password may be used to
load the keystore, to protect the private key entry,
to protect the secret key entry, and to store the keystore

- getDefaultType

```java
public static final
String
getDefaultType()
```

Returns the default keystore type as specified by the

keystore.type

security property, or the string
"jks" (acronym for "Java keystore")
if no such property exists.

The default keystore type can be used by applications that do not
want to use a hard-coded keystore type when calling one of the

getInstance

methods, and want to provide a default keystore
type in case a user does not specify its own.

The default keystore type can be changed by setting the value of the

keystore.type

security property to the desired keystore type.

**Returns:** the default keystore type as specified by the

keystore.type

security property, or the string "jks"
if no such property exists.
**See Also:** security properties

- getProvider

```java
public final

setEntry

with a

PrivateKeyEntry

or

SecretKeyEntry

.

**Parameters:** alias

- if the keystore has not been initialized
(loaded).
**Throws:** NoSuchAlgorithmException

- if the algorithm for recovering the
key cannot be found
**Throws:** UnrecoverableKeyException

- if the key cannot be recovered
(e.g., the given password is wrong).

- getCertificateChain

```java
public final
Certificate
[] getCertificateChain​(
String
alias)
throws
KeyStoreException
```

Returns the certificate chain associated with the given alias.
The certificate chain must have been associated with the alias
by a call to

setKeyEntry

,
or by a call to

setEntry

with a

PrivateKeyEntry

.

**Parameters:** alias
