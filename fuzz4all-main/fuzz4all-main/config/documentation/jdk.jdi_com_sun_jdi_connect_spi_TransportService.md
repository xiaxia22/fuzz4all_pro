# Class TransportService

**Source:** `jdk.jdi\com\sun\jdi\connect\spi\TransportService.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
TransportService

extends
Object
```

A transport service for connections between a debugger and
a target VM.

A transport service is a concrete subclass of this class
that has a zero-argument constructor and implements the abstract
methods specified below. It is the underlying service
used by a

Transport

for connections between a debugger
and a target VM.

A transport service is used to establish a connection
between a debugger and a target VM, and to transport Java
Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets over an underlying
communication protocol. In essence a transport service
implementation binds JDWP (as specified in the

JDWP specification

) to an underlying communication
protocol. A transport service implementation provides
a reliable JDWP packet transportation service. JDWP
packets are sent to and from the target VM without duplication
or data loss. A transport service implementation may be
based on an underlying communication protocol that is
reliable or unreliable. If the underlying communication
protocol is reliable then the transport service implementation
may be relatively simple and may only need to transport JDWP
packets as payloads of the underlying communication
protocol. In the case of an unreliable communication
protocol the transport service implementation may include
additional protocol support in order to ensure that packets
are not duplicated and that there is no data loss. The
details of such protocols are specific to the implementation
but may involve techniques such as the

positive
acknowledgment with retransmission

technique used in
protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
(see

RFC 793

).

A transport service can be used to initiate a connection
to a target VM. This is done by invoking the

attach(java.lang.String, long, long)

method. Alternatively, a transport service can listen and
accept connections initiated by a target VM. This is done
by invoking the

startListening(String)

method to
put the transport into listen mode. Then the

accept(com.sun.jdi.connect.spi.TransportService.ListenKey, long, long)

method is used to accept a connection initiated by a
target VM.

#### public abstract
Connection
attach​(
String
address,
long attachTimeout,
long handshakeTimeout)
throws
IOException

Attaches to the specified address.

Attaches to the specified address and returns a connection
representing the bi-directional communication channel to the
target VM.

Attaching to the target VM involves two steps:
First, a connection is established to specified address. This
is followed by a handshake to ensure that the connection is
to a target VM. The handshake involves the exchange
of a string

JDWP-Handshake

as specified in the

Java Debug Wire Protocol

specification.

**Parameters:**
- address

- The address of the target VM.
- attachTimeout

- If this transport service supports an attach timeout,
and if

attachTimeout

is positive, then it specifies
the timeout, in milliseconds (more or less), to use
when attaching to the target VM. If the transport service
does not support an attach timeout, or if

attachTimeout

is specified as zero then attach without any timeout.
- handshakeTimeout

- If this transport service supports a handshake timeout,
and if

handshakeTimeout

is positive, then it
specifies the timeout, in milliseconds (more or less), to
use when handshaking with the target VM. The exact
usage of the timeout are specific to the transport service.
A transport service may, for example, use the handshake
timeout as the inter-character timeout while waiting for
the

JDWP-Handshake

message from the target VM.
Alternatively, a transport service may, for example,
use the handshakeTimeout as a timeout for the duration of the
handshake exchange.
If the transport service does not support a handshake
timeout, or if

handshakeTimeout

is specified
as zero then the handshake does not timeout if there
isn't a response from the target VM.

**Returns:**
- The Connection representing the bi-directional
communication channel to the target VM.

**Throws:**
- TransportTimeoutException

- If a timeout occurs while establishing the connection.
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs (including a timeout when
handshaking).
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the address is invalid or the value of the
attach timeout or handshake timeout is negative.

#### public abstract
TransportService.ListenKey
startListening​(
String
address)
throws
IOException

Listens on the specified address for inbound connections.

This method starts the transport service listening on
the specified address so that it can subsequently accept
an inbound connection. It does not wait until an inbound
connection is established.

**Parameters:**
- address

- The address to start listening for connections,
or

null

to listen on an address chosen
by the transport service.

**Returns:**
- a listen key to be used in subsequent calls to be

accept

or

stopListening

methods.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs.
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the specific address is invalid

---

#### public abstract
TransportService.ListenKey
startListening()
throws
IOException

Listens on an address chosen by the transport service.

This convenience method works as if by invoking

startListening(null)

.

**Returns:**
- a listen key to be used in subsequent calls to be

accept

or

stopListening

methods.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs.

---

#### public abstract void stopListening​(
TransportService.ListenKey
listenKey)
throws
IOException

Stop listening for inbound connections.

Invoking this method while another thread is blocked
in

accept

, with the same listen key,
waiting to accept a connection will cause that thread to
throw an IOException. If the thread blocked in accept
has already accepted a connection from a target VM and
is in the process of handshaking with the target VM then
invoking this method will not cause the thread to throw
an exception.

**Parameters:**
- listenKey

- The listen key obtained from a previous call to

startListening(String)

or

startListening()

.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the listen key is invalid
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs.

---

#### public abstract
Connection
accept​(
TransportService.ListenKey
listenKey,
long acceptTimeout,
long handshakeTimeout)
throws
IOException

Accept a connection from a target VM.

Waits (indefinitely or with timeout) to accept a connection
from a target VM. Returns a connection representing the
bi-directional communication channel to the target VM.

Accepting a connection from a target VM involves two
steps. First, the transport service waits to accept
the connection from the target VM. Once the connection is
established a handshake is performed to ensure that the
connection is indeed to a target VM. The handshake involves
the exchange of a string

JDWP-Handshake

as specified
in the

Java Debug Wire Protocol

specification.

**Parameters:**
- listenKey

- A listen key obtained from a previous call to

startListening(String)

or

startListening()

.
- acceptTimeout

- if this transport service supports an accept timeout, and
if

acceptTimeout

is positive then block for up to

acceptTimeout

milliseconds, more or less, while waiting
for the target VM to connect.
If the transport service does not support an accept timeout
or if

acceptTimeout

is zero then block indefinitely
for a target VM to connect.
- handshakeTimeout

- If this transport service supports a handshake timeout,
and if

handshakeTimeout

is positive, then it
specifies the timeout, in milliseconds (more or less), to
use when handshaking with the target VM. The exact
usage of the timeout is specific to the transport service.
A transport service may, for example, use the handshake
timeout as the inter-character timeout while waiting for
the

JDWP-Handshake

message from the target VM.
Alternatively, a transport service may, for example,
use the timeout as a timeout for the duration of the
handshake exchange.
If the transport service does not support a handshake
timeout, of if

handshakeTimeout

is specified
as zero then the handshake does not timeout if there
isn't a response from the target VM.

**Returns:**
- The Connection representing the bi-directional
communication channel to the target VM.

**Throws:**
- TransportTimeoutException

- If a timeout occurs while waiting for a target VM
to connect.
- IOException

- If an I/O error occurs (including a timeout when
handshaking).
- IllegalArgumentException

- If the value of the acceptTimeout argument, or
handshakeTimeout is negative, or an invalid listen key
is provided.
- IllegalStateException

- If

stopListening

has already been
called with this listen key and the transport service
is no longer listening for inbound connections.

message from the target VM.
Alternatively, a transport service may, for example,
use the handshakeTimeout as a timeout for the duration of the
handshake exchange.
If the transport service does not support a handshake
timeout, or if

handshakeTimeout

is specified
as zero then the handshake does not timeout if there
isn't a response from the target VM.
**Returns:** The Connection representing the bi-directional
communication channel to the target VM.
**Throws:** TransportTimeoutException

- If a timeout occurs while establishing the connection.
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs (including a timeout when
handshaking).
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the address is invalid or the value of the
attach timeout or handshake timeout is negative.

```

Listens on the specified address for inbound connections.

This method starts the transport service listening on
the specified address so that it can subsequently accept
an inbound connection. It does not wait until an inbound
connection is established.

**Parameters:** address

- The address to start listening for connections,
or

null

to listen on an address chosen
by the transport service.
**Returns:** a listen key to be used in subsequent calls to be

accept

or

stopListening

methods.
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the specific address is invalid

- startListening

```java
public abstract
TransportService.ListenKey
startListening()
throws
IOException
```

Listens on an address chosen by the transport service.

This convenience method works as if by invoking

startListening(null)

.

**Returns:** a listen key to be used in subsequent calls to be

accept

or

stopListening

methods.
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs.

- stopListening

```java
public abstract void stopListening​(
TransportService.ListenKey
listenKey)
throws
IOException
```

Stop listening for inbound connections.

Invoking this method while another thread is blocked
in

accept

, with the same listen key,
waiting to accept a connection will cause that thread to
throw an IOException. If the thread blocked in accept
has already accepted a connection from a target VM and
is in the process of handshaking with the target VM then
invoking this method will not cause the thread to throw
an exception.

**Parameters:** listenKey

- The listen key obtained from a previous call to

startListening(String)

or

startListening()

.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the listen key is invalid
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs.

- accept

```java
public abstract
Connection
accept​(
TransportService.ListenKey
listenKey,
long acceptTimeout,
long handshakeTimeout)
throws
IOException
```

Accept a connection from a target VM.

Waits (indefinitely or with timeout) to accept a connection
from a target VM. Returns a connection representing the
bi-directional communication channel to the target VM.

Accepting a connection from a target VM involves two
steps. First, the transport service waits to accept
the connection from the target VM. Once the connection is
established a handshake is performed to ensure that the
connection is indeed to a target VM. The handshake involves
the exchange of a string

JDWP-Handshake

as specified
in the

Java Debug Wire Protocol

specification.

**Parameters:** listenKey

- A listen key obtained from a previous call to

startListening(String)

or

startListening()

.
**Parameters:** acceptTimeout

- if this transport service supports an accept timeout, and
if

acceptTimeout

is positive then block for up to

acceptTimeout

milliseconds, more or less, while waiting
for the target VM to connect.
If the transport service does not support an accept timeout
or if

acceptTimeout

is zero then block indefinitely
for a target VM to connect.
**Parameters:** handshakeTimeout

- If this transport service supports a handshake timeout,
and if

handshakeTimeout

is positive, then it
specifies the timeout, in milliseconds (more or less), to
use when handshaking with the target VM. The exact
usage of the timeout is specific to the transport service.
A transport service may, for example, use the handshake
timeout as the inter-character timeout while waiting for
the

JDWP-Handshake

message from the target VM.
Alternatively, a transport service may, for example,
use the timeout as a timeout for the duration of the
handshake exchange.
If the transport service does not support a handshake
timeout, of if

handshakeTimeout

is specified
as zero then the handshake does not timeout if there
isn't a response from the target VM.
**Returns:** The Connection representing the bi-directional
communication channel to the target VM.
**Throws:** TransportTimeoutException

- If a timeout occurs while waiting for a target VM
to connect.
**Throws:** IOException

- If an I/O error occurs (including a timeout when
handshaking).
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the value of the acceptTimeout argument, or
handshakeTimeout is negative, or an invalid listen key
is provided.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If

stopListening

has already been
called with this listen key and the transport service
is no longer listening for inbound connections.

throws
IOException
```

Attaches to the specified address.

Attaches to the specified address and returns a connection
representing the bi-directional communication channel to the
target VM.

Attaching to the target VM involves two steps:
First, a connection is established to specified address. This
is followed by a handshake to ensure that the connection is
to a target VM. The handshake involves the exchange
of a string

JDWP-Handshake

as specified in the

Java Debug Wire Protocol

specification.

**Parameters:** address

- The address of the target VM.
**Parameters:** attachTimeout

- If this transport service supports an attach timeout,
and if

attachTimeout

is positive, then it specifies
the timeout, in milliseconds (more or less), to use
when attaching to the target VM. If the transport service
does not support an attach timeout, or if

attachTimeout

is specified as zero then attach without any timeout.
**Parameters:** handshakeTimeout

- If this transport service supports a handshake timeout,
and if

handshakeTimeout

is positive, then it
specifies the timeout, in milliseconds (more or less), to
use when handshaking with the target VM. The exact
usage of the timeout are specific to the transport service.
A transport service may, for example, use the handshake
timeout as the inter-character timeout while waiting for
