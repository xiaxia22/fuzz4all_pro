# Interface DataOutput

**Source:** `java.base\java\io\DataOutput.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
DataOutput
```

The

DataOutput

interface provides
for converting data from any of the Java
primitive types to a series of bytes and
writing these bytes to a binary stream.
There is also a facility for converting
a

String

into

modified UTF-8

format and writing the resulting series
of bytes.

For all the methods in this interface that
write bytes, it is generally true that if
a byte cannot be written for any reason,
an

IOException

is thrown.

s

, taken in order, one byte
is written to the output stream. If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown.

If

s.length

is zero, then no bytes are written. Otherwise,
the character

s[0]

is written
first, then

s[1]

, and so on;
the last character written is

s[s.length-1]

.
For each character, one byte is written,
the low-order byte, in exactly the manner
of the

writeByte

NullPointerException

is thrown. If

s.length

is zero, then no characters are written.
Otherwise, the character

s[0]

is written first, then

s[1]

,
and so on; the last character written is

s[s.length-1]

. For each character,
two bytes are actually written, high-order
byte first, in exactly the manner of the

writeChar

method.

**Parameters:**

#### void writeUTF​(
String
s)
throws
IOException

Writes two bytes of length information
to the output stream, followed
by the

modified UTF-8

representation

s

.
If

s

is

null

,
a

NullPointerException

is thrown.
Each character in the string

s

is converted to a group of one, two, or
three bytes, depending on the value of the
character.

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0001

through

\u007f

, it is represented
by one byte:

```java
(byte)c
```

If a character

c

is

\u0000

or is in the range

\u0080

through

\u07ff

, then it is
represented by two bytes, to be written
in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xc0 | (0x1f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0800

through

uffff

, then it is
represented by three bytes, to be written
in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xe0 | (0x0f & (c >> 12)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

First,
the total number of bytes needed to represent
all the characters of

s

is
calculated. If this number is larger than

65535

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, this length is written
to the output stream in exactly the manner
of the

writeShort

method;
after this, the one-, two-, or three-byte
representation of each character in the
string

s

is written.

The
bytes written by this method may be read
by the

readUTF

method of interface

DataInput

, which will then
return a

String

equal to

s

.

**Parameters:**
- s

- the string value to be written.

**Throws:**
- IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

Writes two bytes of length information
to the output stream, followed
by the

modified UTF-8

representation
of every character in the string

s

.
If

s

is

null

,
a

NullPointerException

is thrown.
Each character in the string

s

is converted to a group of one, two, or
three bytes, depending on the value of the
character.

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0001

through

\u007f

, it is represented
by one byte:

```java
(byte)c
```

If a character

c

is

\u0000

or is in the range

\u0080

through

\u07ff

, then it is
represented by two bytes, to be written
in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xc0 | (0x1f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0800

through

uffff

, then it is
represented by three bytes, to be written
in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xe0 | (0x0f & (c >> 12)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

First,
the total number of bytes needed to represent
all the characters of

s

is
calculated. If this number is larger than

65535

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, this length is written
to the output stream in exactly the manner
of the

writeShort

method;
after this, the one-, two-, or three-byte
representation of each character in the
string

s

is written.

The
bytes written by this method may be read
by the

readUTF

method of interface

DataInput

, which will then
return a

String

equal to

s

.

**Parameters:** s

- the string value to be written.

#### writeDouble

void writeDouble​(double v)
throws

IOException

Writes a

double

value,
which is comprised of eight bytes, to the output stream.
It does this as if it first converts this

double

value to a

long

in exactly the manner of the

Double.doubleToLongBits

method and then writes the

long

value in exactly the manner of the

writeLong

method. The bytes written by this method
may be read by the

readDouble

method of interface

DataInput

,
which will then return a

double

equal to

v

.

writeBytes

```java
void writeBytes​(
String
s)
throws
IOException
```

Writes a string to the output stream.
For every character in the string

s

, taken in order, one byte
is written to the output stream. If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown.

If

s.length

is zero, then no bytes are written. Otherwise,
the character

s[0]

is written
first, then

s[1]

, and so on;
the last character written is

s[s.length-1]

.
For each character, one byte is written,
the low-order byte, in exactly the manner
of the

writeByte

method . The
high-order eight bits of each character
in the string are ignored.

**Parameters:** s

- the string of bytes to be written.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

#### writeBytes

void writeBytes​(

String

s)
throws

IOException

Writes a string to the output stream.
For every character in the string

s

, taken in order, one byte
is written to the output stream. If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown.

If

s.length

is zero, then no bytes are written. Otherwise,
the character

s[0]

is written
first, then

s[1]

, and so on;
the last character written is

s[s.length-1]

.
For each character, one byte is written,
the low-order byte, in exactly the manner
of the

writeByte

method . The
high-order eight bits of each character
in the string are ignored.

If

s.length

is zero, then no bytes are written. Otherwise,
the character

s[0]

is written
first, then

s[1]

, and so on;
the last character written is

s[s.length-1]

.
For each character, one byte is written,
the low-order byte, in exactly the manner
of the

writeByte

method . The
high-order eight bits of each character
in the string are ignored.

writeChars

```java
void writeChars​(
String
s)
throws
IOException
```

Writes every character in the string

s

,
to the output stream, in order,
two bytes per character. If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown. If

s.length

is zero, then no characters are written.
Otherwise, the character

s[0]

is written first, then

s[1]

,
and so on; the last character written is

s[s.length-1]

. For each character,
two bytes are actually written, high-order
byte first, in exactly the manner of the

writeChar

method.

**Parameters:** s

- the string value to be written.
**Throws:** IOException

- if an I/O error occurs.

---

#### writeChars

void writeChars​(

String

s)
throws

IOException

Writes every character in the string

s

,
to the output stream, in order,
two bytes per character. If

s

is

null

, a

NullPointerException

is thrown. If

s.length

is zero, then no characters are written.
Otherwise, the character

s[0]

is written first, then

s[1]

,
and so on; the last character written is

s[s.length-1]

. For each character,
two bytes are actually written, high-order
byte first, in exactly the manner of the

writeChar

method.

writeUTF

```java
void writeUTF​(
String
s)
throws
IOException
```

Writes two bytes of length information
to the output stream, followed
by the

modified UTF-8

representation
of every character in the string

s

.
If

s

is

null

,
a

NullPointerException

is thrown.
Each character in the string

s

is converted to a group of one, two, or
three bytes, depending on the value of the
character.

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0001

through

\u007f

, it is represented
by one byte:

```java
(byte)c
```

If a character

c

is

\u0000

or is in the range

\u0080

through

\u07ff

, then it is
represented by two bytes, to be written
in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xc0 | (0x1f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

If a character

c

is in the range

\u0800

through

uffff

, then it is
represented by three bytes, to be written
in the order shown:

```java
(byte)(0xe0 | (0x0f & (c >> 12)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & (c >> 6)))
(byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
```

First,
the total number of bytes needed to represent
all the characters of

s

is
calculated. If this number is larger than

65535

, then a

UTFDataFormatException

is thrown. Otherwise, this length is written
to the output stream in exactly the manner
of the

writeShort

method;
after this, the one-, two-, or three-byte
representation of each character in the
string

s

is written.

The
bytes written by this method may be read
by the

readUTF

method of interface

DataInput
