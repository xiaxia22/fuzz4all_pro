# Class LayoutPath

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\font\LayoutPath.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
LayoutPath

extends
Object
```

LayoutPath provides a mapping between locations relative to the
baseline and points in user space. Locations consist of an advance
along the baseline, and an offset perpendicular to the baseline at
the advance. Positive values along the perpendicular are in the
direction that is 90 degrees clockwise from the baseline vector.
Locations are represented as a

Point2D

, where x is the advance and
y is the offset.

**Since:** 1.6

### Method Details

#### public abstract boolean pointToPath​(
Point2D
point,

Point2D
location)

Convert a point in user space to a location relative to the
path. The location is chosen so as to minimize the distance
from the point to the path (e.g., the magnitude of the offset
will be smallest). If there is more than one such location,
the location with the smallest advance is chosen.

**Parameters:**
- point

- the point to convert. If it is not the same
object as location, point will remain unmodified by this call.
- location

- a

Point2D

to hold the returned location.
It can be the same object as point.

**Returns:**
- true if the point is associated with the portion of the
path preceding the location, false if it is associated with
the portion following. The default, if the location is not at
a break or sharp bend in the path, is to return true.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if point or location is null

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public abstract void pathToPoint​(
Point2D
location,
boolean preceding,

Point2D
point)

Convert a location relative to the path to a point in user
coordinates. The path might bend abruptly or be disjoint at
the location's advance. If this is the case, the value of
'preceding' is used to disambiguate the portion of the path
whose location and slope is to be used to interpret the offset.

**Parameters:**
- location

- a

Point2D

representing the advance (in x) and
offset (in y) of a location relative to the path. If location
is not the same object as point, location will remain
unmodified by this call.
- preceding

- if true, the portion preceding the advance
should be used, if false the portion after should be used.
This has no effect if the path does not break or bend sharply
at the advance.
- point

- a

Point2D

to hold the returned point. It can be
the same object as location.

**Throws:**
- NullPointerException

- if location or point is null

**Since:**
- 1.6

```java
public abstract boolean pointToPath​(

Convert a point in user space to a location relative to the

from the point to the path (e.g., the magnitude of the offset
will be smallest). If there is more than one such location,
the location with the smallest advance is chosen.

object as location, point will remain unmodified by this call.
**Parameters:** location

It can be the same object as point.
**Returns:** true if the point is associated with the portion of the
path preceding the location, false if it is associated with
the portion following. The default, if the location is not at
a break or sharp bend in the path, is to return true.
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- pathToPoint

```java

Convert a location relative to the path to a point in user
coordinates. The path might bend abruptly or be disjoint at
the location's advance. If this is the case, the value of
'preceding' is used to disambiguate the portion of the path
whose location and slope is to be used to interpret the offset.

offset (in y) of a location relative to the path. If location
is not the same object as point, location will remain

should be used, if false the portion after should be used.
