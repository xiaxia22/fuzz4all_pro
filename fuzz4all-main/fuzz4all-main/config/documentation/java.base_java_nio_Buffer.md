# Class Buffer

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\Buffer.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
Buffer

extends
Object
```

A container for data of a specific primitive type.

A buffer is a linear, finite sequence of elements of a specific
primitive type. Aside from its content, the essential properties of a
buffer are its capacity, limit, and position:

A buffer's

capacity

is the number of elements it contains. The
capacity of a buffer is never negative and never changes.

A buffer's

limit

is the index of the first element that should
not be read or written. A buffer's limit is never negative and is never
greater than its capacity.

A buffer's

position

is the index of the next element to be
read or written. A buffer's position is never negative and is never
greater than its limit.

There is one subclass of this class for each non-boolean primitive type.

Transferring data

Each subclass of this class defines two categories of

get

and

put

operations:

Relative

operations read or write one or more elements starting
at the current position and then increment the position by the number of
elements transferred. If the requested transfer exceeds the limit then a
relative

get

operation throws a

BufferUnderflowException

and a relative

put

operation throws a

BufferOverflowException

; in either case, no data is transferred.

Absolute

operations take an explicit element index and do not
affect the position. Absolute

get

and

put

operations throw
an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

if the index argument exceeds the
limit.

Data may also, of course, be transferred in to or out of a buffer by the
I/O operations of an appropriate channel, which are always relative to the
current position.

Marking and resetting

A buffer's

mark

is the index to which its position will be reset
when the

reset

method is invoked. The mark is not always
defined, but when it is defined it is never negative and is never greater
than the position. If the mark is defined then it is discarded when the
position or the limit is adjusted to a value smaller than the mark. If the
mark is not defined then invoking the

reset

method causes an

InvalidMarkException

to be thrown.

Invariants

The following invariant holds for the mark, position, limit, and
capacity values:

0

<=

mark

<=

position

<=

limit

<=

capacity

A newly-created buffer always has a position of zero and a mark that is
undefined. The initial limit may be zero, or it may be some other value
that depends upon the type of the buffer and the manner in which it is
constructed. Each element of a newly-allocated buffer is initialized
to zero.

Additional operations

In addition to methods for accessing the position, limit, and capacity
values and for marking and resetting, this class also defines the following
operations upon buffers:

- clear()

makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
channel-read or relative

put

operations: It sets the limit to the
capacity and the position to zero.
- flip()

makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
channel-write or relative

get

operations: It sets the limit to the
current position and then sets the position to zero.
- rewind()

makes a buffer ready for re-reading the data that
it already contains: It leaves the limit unchanged and sets the position
to zero.
- slice()

creates a subsequence of a buffer: It leaves the
limit and the position unchanged.
- duplicate()

creates a shallow copy of a buffer: It leaves
the limit and the position unchanged.

Read-only buffers

Every buffer is readable, but not every buffer is writable. The
mutation methods of each buffer class are specified as

optional
operations

that will throw a

ReadOnlyBufferException

when
invoked upon a read-only buffer. A read-only buffer does not allow its
content to be changed, but its mark, position, and limit values are mutable.
Whether or not a buffer is read-only may be determined by invoking its

isReadOnly

method.

Thread safety

Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. If a
buffer is to be used by more than one thread then access to the buffer
should be controlled by appropriate synchronization.

Invocation chaining

Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked. This allows
method invocations to be chained; for example, the sequence of statements

```java
b.flip();
b.position(23);
b.limit(42);
```

can be replaced by the single, more compact statement

```java
b.flip().position(23).limit(42);
```

#### public
Buffer
mark()

Sets this buffer's mark at its position.

**Returns:**
- This buffer

---

#### public
Buffer
reset()

Resets this buffer's position to the previously-marked position.

Invoking this method neither changes nor discards the mark's
value.

**Returns:**
- This buffer

**Throws:**
- InvalidMarkException

- If the mark has not been set

---

#### public
Buffer
clear()

Clears this buffer. The position is set to zero, the limit is set to
the capacity, and the mark is discarded.

Invoke this method before using a sequence of channel-read or

put

operations to fill this buffer. For example:

```java
buf.clear(); // Prepare buffer for reading
in.read(buf); // Read data
```

This method does not actually erase the data in the buffer, but it
is named as if it did because it will most often be used in situations
in which that might as well be the case.

**Returns:**
- This buffer

---

#### public
Buffer
flip()

Flips this buffer. The limit is set to the current position and then
the position is set to zero. If the mark is defined then it is
discarded.

After a sequence of channel-read or

put

operations, invoke
this method to prepare for a sequence of channel-write or relative

get

operations. For example:

```java
buf.put(magic); // Prepend header
in.read(buf); // Read data into rest of buffer
buf.flip(); // Flip buffer
out.write(buf); // Write header + data to channel
```

This method is often used in conjunction with the

compact

method when transferring data from
one place to another.

**Returns:**
- This buffer

---

#### public
Buffer
rewind()

Rewinds this buffer. The position is set to zero and the mark is
discarded.

Invoke this method before a sequence of channel-write or

get

operations, assuming that the limit has already been set
appropriately. For example:

```java
out.write(buf); // Write remaining data
buf.rewind(); // Rewind buffer
buf.get(array); // Copy data into array
```

**Returns:**
- This buffer

---

#### public final int remaining()

Returns the number of elements between the current position and the
limit.

**Returns:**
- The number of elements remaining in this buffer

---

#### public final boolean hasRemaining()

Tells whether there are any elements between the current position and
the limit.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, there is at least one element
remaining in this buffer

---

#### public abstract boolean isReadOnly()

Tells whether or not this buffer is read-only.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this buffer is read-only

---

#### public abstract boolean hasArray()

Tells whether or not this buffer is backed by an accessible
array.

If this method returns

true

then the

array

and

arrayOffset

methods may safely be invoked.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this buffer
is backed by an array and is not read-only

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public abstract
Object
array()

Returns the array that backs this
buffer

(optional operation)

.

This method is intended to allow array-backed buffers to be
passed to native code more efficiently. Concrete subclasses
provide more strongly-typed return values for this method.

Modifications to this buffer's content will cause the returned
array's content to be modified, and vice versa.

Invoke the

hasArray

method before invoking this
method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing
array.

**Returns:**
- The array that backs this buffer

**Throws:**
- ReadOnlyBufferException

- If this buffer is backed by an array but is read-only
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If this buffer is not backed by an accessible array

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public abstract int arrayOffset()

Returns the offset within this buffer's backing array of the first
element of the buffer

(optional operation)

.

If this buffer is backed by an array then buffer position

p

corresponds to array index

p

+

arrayOffset()

.

Invoke the

hasArray

method before invoking this
method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing
array.

**Returns:**
- The offset within this buffer's array
of the first element of the buffer

**Throws:**
- ReadOnlyBufferException

- If this buffer is backed by an array but is read-only
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If this buffer is not backed by an accessible array

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public abstract boolean isDirect()

Tells whether or not this buffer is

direct

.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this buffer is direct

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public abstract
Buffer
slice()

Creates a new buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of
this buffer's content.

The content of the new buffer will start at this buffer's current
position. Changes to this buffer's content will be visible in the new
buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark
values will be independent.

The new buffer's position will be zero, its capacity and its limit
will be the number of elements remaining in this buffer, its mark will be
undefined. The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is
direct, and it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is
read-only.

**Returns:**
- The new buffer

**Since:**
- 9

---

#### public abstract
Buffer
duplicate()

Creates a new buffer that shares this buffer's content.

The content of the new buffer will be that of this buffer. Changes
to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer, and vice
versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark values will be
independent.

The new buffer's capacity, limit, position and mark values will be
identical to those of this buffer. The new buffer will be direct if, and
only if, this buffer is direct, and it will be read-only if, and only if,
this buffer is read-only.

**Returns:**
- The new buffer

**Since:**
- 9

A container for data of a specific primitive type.

A buffer is a linear, finite sequence of elements of a specific
primitive type. Aside from its content, the essential properties of a
buffer are its capacity, limit, and position:

A buffer's

capacity

is the number of elements it contains. The
capacity of a buffer is never negative and never changes.

A buffer's

limit

is the index of the first element that should
not be read or written. A buffer's limit is never negative and is never
greater than its capacity.

A buffer's

position

is the index of the next element to be
read or written. A buffer's position is never negative and is never
greater than its limit.

There is one subclass of this class for each non-boolean primitive type.

Transferring data

Each subclass of this class defines two categories of

get

and

put

operations:

Relative

operations read or write one or more elements starting
at the current position and then increment the position by the number of
elements transferred. If the requested transfer exceeds the limit then a
relative

get

operation throws a

BufferUnderflowException

and a relative

put

operation throws a

BufferOverflowException

; in either case, no data is transferred.

Absolute

operations take an explicit element index and do not
affect the position. Absolute

get

and

put

operations throw
an

IndexOutOfBoundsException

if the index argument exceeds the
limit.

Data may also, of course, be transferred in to or out of a buffer by the
I/O operations of an appropriate channel, which are always relative to the
current position.

Marking and resetting

A buffer's

mark

is the index to which its position will be reset
when the

reset

method is invoked. The mark is not always
defined, but when it is defined it is never negative and is never greater
than the position. If the mark is defined then it is discarded when the
position or the limit is adjusted to a value smaller than the mark. If the
mark is not defined then invoking the

reset

method causes an

InvalidMarkException

to be thrown.

Invariants

The following invariant holds for the mark, position, limit, and
capacity values:

0

<=

mark

<=

position

<=

limit

<=

capacity

A newly-created buffer always has a position of zero and a mark that is
undefined. The initial limit may be zero, or it may be some other value
that depends upon the type of the buffer and the manner in which it is
constructed. Each element of a newly-allocated buffer is initialized
to zero.

Additional operations

In addition to methods for accessing the position, limit, and capacity
values and for marking and resetting, this class also defines the following
operations upon buffers:

- clear()

makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
channel-read or relative

put

operations: It sets the limit to the
capacity and the position to zero.
- flip()

makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
channel-write or relative

get

operations: It sets the limit to the
current position and then sets the position to zero.
- rewind()

makes a buffer ready for re-reading the data that
it already contains: It leaves the limit unchanged and sets the position
to zero.
- slice()

creates a subsequence of a buffer: It leaves the
limit and the position unchanged.
- duplicate()

creates a shallow copy of a buffer: It leaves
the limit and the position unchanged.

Read-only buffers

Every buffer is readable, but not every buffer is writable. The
mutation methods of each buffer class are specified as

optional
operations

that will throw a

ReadOnlyBufferException

when
invoked upon a read-only buffer. A read-only buffer does not allow its
content to be changed, but its mark, position, and limit values are mutable.
Whether or not a buffer is read-only may be determined by invoking its

Thread safety

Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. If a

should be controlled by appropriate synchronization.

Invocation chaining

capacity and the position to zero.
- flip()

makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
channel-write or relative

get

operations: It sets the limit to the
current position and then sets the position to zero.
- rewind()

makes a buffer ready for re-reading the data that
it already contains: It leaves the limit unchanged and sets the position
to zero.
- slice()

creates a subsequence of a buffer: It leaves the
limit and the position unchanged.
- duplicate()

creates a shallow copy of a buffer: It leaves
the limit and the position unchanged.

Read-only buffers

Every buffer is readable, but not every buffer is writable. The
mutation methods of each buffer class are specified as

optional
operations

that will throw a

ReadOnlyBufferException

when
invoked upon a read-only buffer. A read-only buffer does not allow its
content to be changed, but its mark, position, and limit values are mutable.
Whether or not a buffer is read-only may be determined by invoking its

isReadOnly

method.

Thread safety

Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. If a
buffer is to be used by more than one thread then access to the buffer
should be controlled by appropriate synchronization.

Invocation chaining

Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked. This allows
method invocations to be chained; for example, the sequence of statements

```java
b.flip();
b.position(23);
b.limit(42);
```

can be replaced by the single, more compact statement

```java
b.flip().position(23).limit(42);
```

#### Invariants

The following invariant holds for the mark, position, limit, and
capacity values:

0

<=

mark

<=

position

<=

limit

<=

capacity

A newly-created buffer always has a position of zero and a mark that is
undefined. The initial limit may be zero, or it may be some other value
that depends upon the type of the buffer and the manner in which it is
constructed. Each element of a newly-allocated buffer is initialized
to zero.

Additional operations

In addition to methods for accessing the position, limit, and capacity
values and for marking and resetting, this class also defines the following
operations upon buffers:

- clear()

makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
channel-read or relative

put

operations: It sets the limit to the
capacity and the position to zero.
- flip()

makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
channel-write or relative

get

current position and then sets the position to zero.
- rewind()

makes a buffer ready for re-reading the data that
it already contains: It leaves the limit unchanged and sets the position
to zero.
- slice()

creates a subsequence of a buffer: It leaves the
limit and the position unchanged.
- duplicate()

creates a shallow copy of a buffer: It leaves
the limit and the position unchanged.

```java
public final int position()
```

Returns this buffer's position.

**Returns:** The position of this buffer

- position

```java
public
Buffer
position​(int newPosition)
```

Sets this buffer's position. If the mark is defined and larger than the
new position then it is discarded.

```java
public final int limit()
```

Returns this buffer's limit.

**Returns:** The limit of this buffer

- limit

```java
public
Buffer
limit​(int newLimit)
```

Sets this buffer's limit. If the position is larger than the new limit
then it is set to the new limit. If the mark is defined and larger than
the new limit then it is discarded.

**Parameters:** newLimit

- The new limit value; must be non-negative
and no larger than this buffer's capacity
**Returns:** This buffer
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the preconditions on

newLimit

do not hold

Invoking this method neither changes nor discards the mark's
value.

**Returns:** This buffer
**Throws:** InvalidMarkException

- If the mark has not been set

- clear

```java
public
Buffer
clear()
```

Clears this buffer. The position is set to zero, the limit is set to
the capacity, and the mark is discarded.

Invoke this method before using a sequence of channel-read or

put

operations to fill this buffer. For example:

```java
buf.clear(); // Prepare buffer for reading
in.read(buf); // Read data
```

This method does not actually erase the data in the buffer, but it
is named as if it did because it will most often be used in situations
in which that might as well be the case.

**Returns:** This buffer

- flip

```java
public
Buffer
flip()
```

Flips this buffer. The limit is set to the current position and then
the position is set to zero. If the mark is defined then it is

put

operations, invoke
this method to prepare for a sequence of channel-write or relative

get

operations. For example:

```java
buf.put(magic); // Prepend header
in.read(buf); // Read data into rest of buffer
buf.flip(); // Flip buffer
out.write(buf); // Write header + data to channel
```

This method is often used in conjunction with the

compact

method when transferring data from
one place to another.

**Returns:** This buffer

- rewind

```java
public
Buffer
rewind()
```

Rewinds this buffer. The position is set to zero and the mark is
discarded.

array's content to be modified, and vice versa.

Invoke the

hasArray

method before invoking this
method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing
array.

**Returns:** The array that backs this buffer
**Throws:** ReadOnlyBufferException

- If this buffer is backed by an array but is read-only
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If this buffer is not backed by an accessible array
**Since:** 1.6

- arrayOffset

```java
public abstract int arrayOffset()
```

Returns the offset within this buffer's backing array of the first
element of the buffer

(optional operation)

.

If this buffer is backed by an array then buffer position

p

corresponds to array index

p

+

arrayOffset()

.

Invoke the

hasArray

method before invoking this
method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing
array.

**Returns:** The offset within this buffer's array
of the first element of the buffer
**Throws:** ReadOnlyBufferException

- If this buffer is backed by an array but is read-only

**Since:** 1.6

- isDirect

```java
public abstract boolean isDirect()
```

Tells whether or not this buffer is

direct

.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this buffer is direct
**Since:** 1.6

- slice

```java
public abstract
Buffer
slice()
```

Creates a new buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of
this buffer's content.

The content of the new buffer will start at this buffer's current
position. Changes to this buffer's content will be visible in the new
buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark
values will be independent.

The new buffer's position will be zero, its capacity and its limit
will be the number of elements remaining in this buffer, its mark will be
undefined. The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is
direct, and it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is
read-only.

**Returns:** The new buffer
**Since:** 9

- duplicate

```java
public abstract
Buffer
duplicate()
```

Creates a new buffer that shares this buffer's content.

The content of the new buffer will be that of this buffer. Changes
to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer, and vice
versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark values will be
independent.

The new buffer's capacity, limit, position and mark values will be
identical to those of this buffer. The new buffer will be direct if, and
only if, this buffer is direct, and it will be read-only if, and only if,
this buffer is read-only.

**Returns:** The new buffer
**Since:** 9

Creates a new buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of
this buffer's content.

The content of the new buffer will start at this buffer's current
position. Changes to this buffer's content will be visible in the new
buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark
values will be independent.

The new buffer's position will be zero, its capacity and its limit
will be the number of elements remaining in this buffer, its mark will be
undefined. The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is
direct, and it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is
read-only.

**Returns:** The new buffer
**Since:** 9

the position is set to zero. If the mark is defined then it is
discarded.

After a sequence of channel-read or

put

operations, invoke
this method to prepare for a sequence of channel-write or relative

get

operations. For example:

```java
buf.put(magic); // Prepend header
in.read(buf); // Read data into rest of buffer
buf.flip(); // Flip buffer
