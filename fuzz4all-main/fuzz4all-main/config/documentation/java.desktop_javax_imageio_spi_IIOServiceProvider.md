# Class IIOServiceProvider

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\imageio\spi\IIOServiceProvider.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
IIOServiceProvider

extends
Object

implements
RegisterableService
```

A superinterface for functionality common to all Image I/O service
provider interfaces (SPIs). For more information on service
provider classes, see the class comment for the

IIORegistry

class.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** RegisterableService

---

### Field Details

#### protected
String
vendorName

A

String

to be returned from

getVendorName

, initially

null

.
Constructors should set this to a non-

null

value.

---

#### protected
String
version

A

String

to be returned from

getVersion

, initially null. Constructors should
set this to a non-

null

value.

---

### Constructor Details

#### public IIOServiceProvider​(
String
vendorName,

String
version)

Constructs an

IIOServiceProvider

with a given
vendor name and version identifier.

**Parameters:**
- vendorName

- the vendor name.
- version

- a version identifier.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

vendorName

is

null

.
- IllegalArgumentException

- if

version

is

null

.

---

#### public IIOServiceProvider()

Constructs a blank

IIOServiceProvider

. It is up
to the subclass to initialize instance variables and/or
override method implementations in order to ensure that the

getVendorName

and

getVersion

methods
will return non-

null

values.

---

### Method Details

#### public void onRegistration​(
ServiceRegistry
registry,

Class
<?> category)

A callback that will be called exactly once after the Spi class
has been instantiated and registered in a

ServiceRegistry

. This may be used to verify that
the environment is suitable for this service, for example that
native libraries can be loaded. If the service cannot function
in the environment where it finds itself, it should deregister
itself from the registry.

Only the registry should call this method.

The default implementation does nothing.

**Specified by:**
- onRegistration

in interface

RegisterableService

**Parameters:**
- registry

- a

ServiceRegistry

where this
object has been registered.
- category

- a

Class

object indicating the
registry category under which this object has been registered.

**See Also:**
- ServiceRegistry.registerServiceProvider(Object provider)

---

#### public void onDeregistration​(
ServiceRegistry
registry,

Class
<?> category)

A callback that will be whenever the Spi class has been
deregistered from a

ServiceRegistry

.

Only the registry should call this method.

The default implementation does nothing.

**Specified by:**
- onDeregistration

in interface

RegisterableService

**Parameters:**
- registry

- a

ServiceRegistry

from which this
object is being (wholly or partially) deregistered.
- category

- a

Class

object indicating the
registry category from which this object is being deregistered.

**See Also:**
- ServiceRegistry.deregisterServiceProvider(Object provider)

---

#### public
String
getVendorName()

Returns the name of the vendor responsible for creating this
service provider and its associated implementation. Because
the vendor name may be used to select a service provider,
it is not localized.

The default implementation returns the value of the

vendorName

instance variable.

**Returns:**
- a non-

null String

containing
the name of the vendor.

---

#### public
String
getVersion()

Returns a string describing the version
number of this service provider and its associated
implementation. Because the version may be used by transcoders
to identify the service providers they understand, this method
is not localized.

The default implementation returns the value of the

version

instance variable.

**Returns:**
- a non-

null String

containing
the version of this service provider.

---

#### public abstract
String
getDescription​(
Locale
locale)

Returns a brief, human-readable description of this service
provider and its associated implementation. The resulting
string should be localized for the supplied

Locale

, if possible.

**Parameters:**
- locale

- a

Locale

for which the return value
should be localized.

**Returns:**
- a

String

containing a description of this
service provider.
