# Class State<T extends JComponent >

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\plaf\nimbus\State.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
State<T extends
JComponent
>

extends
Object
```

Represents a built in, or custom, state in Nimbus.

Synth provides several built in states, which are:

- Enabled
- Mouse Over
- Pressed
- Disabled
- Focused
- Selected
- Default

However, there are many more states that could be described in a LookAndFeel, and it
would be nice to style components differently based on these different states.
For example, a progress bar could be "indeterminate". It would be very convenient
to allow this to be defined as a "state".

This class, State, is intended to be used for such situations.
Simply implement the abstract #isInState method. It returns true if the given
JComponent is "in this state", false otherwise. This method will be called

many

times in

performance sensitive loops

. It must execute
very quickly.

For example, the following might be an implementation of a custom
"Indeterminate" state for JProgressBars:

```java
public final class IndeterminateState extends State<JProgressBar> {
public IndeterminateState() {
super("Indeterminate");
}

@Override
protected boolean isInState(JProgressBar c) {
return c.isIndeterminate();
}
}
```

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### protected State​(
String
name)

Create a new custom State. Specify the name for the state. The name should
be unique within the states set for any one particular component.
The name of the state should coincide with the name used in UIDefaults.

For example, the following would be correct:

```java
defaults.put("Button.States", "Enabled, Foo, Disabled");
defaults.put("Button.Foo", new FooState("Foo"));
```

**Parameters:**
- name

- a simple user friendly name for the state, such as "Indeterminate"
or "EmbeddedPanel" or "Blurred". It is customary to use camel case,
with the first letter capitalized.

---

### Method Details

#### protected abstract boolean isInState​(
T
c)

Gets whether the specified JComponent is in the custom state represented
by this class.

This is an extremely performance sensitive loop.

Please take proper precautions to ensure that it executes quickly.

Nimbus uses this method to help determine what state a JComponent is
in. For example, a custom State could exist for JProgressBar such that
it would return

true

when the progress bar is indeterminate.
Such an implementation of this method would simply be:

```java
return c.isIndeterminate();
```

**Parameters:**
- c

- the JComponent to test. This will never be null.

**Returns:**
- true if

c

is in the custom state represented by
this

State

instance

========= CONSTRUCTOR DETAIL ========

- Constructor Detail

- State

```java
protected State​(
String
name)
```

Create a new custom State. Specify the name for the state. The name should
be unique within the states set for any one particular component.
The name of the state should coincide with the name used in UIDefaults.

For example, the following would be correct:

```java
defaults.put("Button.States", "Enabled, Foo, Disabled");
defaults.put("Button.Foo", new FooState("Foo"));
```

**Parameters:** name

- a simple user friendly name for the state, such as "Indeterminate"
or "EmbeddedPanel" or "Blurred". It is customary to use camel case,
with the first letter capitalized.
