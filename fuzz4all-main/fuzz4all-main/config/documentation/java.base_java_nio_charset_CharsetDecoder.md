# Class CharsetDecoder

**Source:** `java.base\java\nio\charset\CharsetDecoder.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
CharsetDecoder

extends
Object
```

An engine that can transform a sequence of bytes in a specific charset into a sequence of
sixteen-bit Unicode characters.

The input byte sequence is provided in a byte buffer or a series
of such buffers. The output character sequence is written to a character buffer
or a series of such buffers. A decoder should always be used by making
the following sequence of method invocations, hereinafter referred to as a

decoding operation

:

- Reset the decoder via the

reset

method, unless it
has not been used before;
- Invoke the

decode

method zero or more times, as
long as additional input may be available, passing

false

for the

endOfInput

argument and filling the input buffer and flushing the
output buffer between invocations;
- Invoke the

decode

method one final time, passing

true

for the

endOfInput

argument; and then
- Invoke the

flush

method so that the decoder can
flush any internal state to the output buffer.

Each invocation of the

decode

method will decode as many
bytes as possible from the input buffer, writing the resulting characters
to the output buffer. The

decode

method returns when more
input is required, when there is not enough room in the output buffer, or
when a decoding error has occurred. In each case a

CoderResult

object is returned to describe the reason for termination. An invoker can
examine this object and fill the input buffer, flush the output buffer, or
attempt to recover from a decoding error, as appropriate, and try again.

There are two general types of decoding errors. If the input byte
sequence is not legal for this charset then the input is considered

malformed

. If
the input byte sequence is legal but cannot be mapped to a valid
Unicode character then an

unmappable character

has been encountered.

How a decoding error is handled depends upon the action requested for
that type of error, which is described by an instance of the

CodingErrorAction

class. The possible error actions are to

ignore

the erroneous input,

report

the error to the invoker via
the returned

CoderResult

object, or

replace

the erroneous input with the current value of the
replacement string. The replacement

has the initial value

"\uFFFD"

;

its value may be changed via the

replaceWith

method.

The default action for malformed-input and unmappable-character errors
is to

report

them. The
malformed-input error action may be changed via the

onMalformedInput

method; the
unmappable-character action may be changed via the

onUnmappableCharacter

method.

This class is designed to handle many of the details of the decoding
process, including the implementation of error actions. A decoder for a
specific charset, which is a concrete subclass of this class, need only
implement the abstract

decodeLoop

method, which
encapsulates the basic decoding loop. A subclass that maintains internal
state should, additionally, override the

implFlush

and

implReset

methods.

Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
threads.

byte of input. This value may be used to compute the worst-case size
of the output buffer required for a given input sequence.

**Returns:**
- The maximum number of characters that will be produced per
byte of input

---

#### public final
CoderResult
decode​(
ByteBuffer
in,

CharBuffer
out,
boolean endOfInput)

Decodes as many bytes as possible from the given input buffer,
writing the results to the given output buffer.

The buffers are read from, and written to, starting at their current
positions. At most

in.remaining()

bytes
will be read and at most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffers' positions will be advanced to
reflect the bytes read and the characters written, but their marks and
limits will not be modified.

In addition to reading bytes from the input buffer and writing
characters to the output buffer, this method returns a

CoderResult

object to describe its reason for termination:

- CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

indicates that as much of the
input buffer as possible has been decoded. If there is no further
input then the invoker can proceed to the next step of the

decoding operation

. Otherwise this method
should be invoked again with further input.
- CoderResult.OVERFLOW

indicates that there is
insufficient space in the output buffer to decode any more bytes.
This method should be invoked again with an output buffer that has
more

remaining

characters. This is
typically done by draining any decoded characters from the output
buffer.
- A

malformed-input

result indicates that a malformed-input
error has been detected. The malformed bytes begin at the input
buffer's (possibly incremented) position; the number of malformed
bytes may be determined by invoking the result object's

length

method. This case applies only if the

malformed action

of this decoder
is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT

; otherwise the malformed input
will be ignored or replaced, as requested.
- An

unmappable-character

result indicates that an
unmappable-character error has been detected. The bytes that
decode the unmappable character begin at the input buffer's (possibly
incremented) position; the number of such bytes may be determined
by invoking the result object's

length

method. This case applies only if the

unmappable action

of this decoder is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT

; otherwise the unmappable character will be
ignored or replaced, as requested.

In any case, if this method is to be reinvoked in the same decoding
operation then care should be taken to preserve any bytes remaining
in the input buffer so that they are available to the next invocation.

The

endOfInput

parameter advises this method as to whether
the invoker can provide further input beyond that contained in the given
input buffer. If there is a possibility of providing additional input
then the invoker should pass

false

for this parameter; if there
is no possibility of providing further input then the invoker should
pass

true

. It is not erroneous, and in fact it is quite
common, to pass

false

in one invocation and later discover that
no further input was actually available. It is critical, however, that
the final invocation of this method in a sequence of invocations always
pass

true

so that any remaining undecoded input will be treated
as being malformed.

This method works by invoking the

decodeLoop

method, interpreting its results, handling error conditions, and
reinvoking it as necessary.

**Parameters:**
- in

- The input byte buffer
- out

- The output character buffer
- endOfInput

-

true

if, and only if, the invoker can provide no
additional input bytes beyond those in the given buffer

**Returns:**
- A coder-result object describing the reason for termination

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If a decoding operation is already in progress and the previous
step was an invocation neither of the

reset

method, nor of this method with a value of

false

for
the

endOfInput

parameter, nor of this method with a
value of

true

for the

endOfInput

parameter
but a return value indicating an incomplete decoding operation
- CoderMalfunctionError

- If an invocation of the decodeLoop method threw
an unexpected exception

---

#### public final
CoderResult
flush​(
CharBuffer
out)

Flushes this decoder.

Some decoders maintain internal state and may need to write some
final characters to the output buffer once the overall input sequence has
been read.

Any additional output is written to the output buffer beginning at
its current position. At most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffer's position will be advanced
appropriately, but its mark and limit will not be modified.

If this method completes successfully then it returns

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

. If there is insufficient room in the output
buffer then it returns

CoderResult.OVERFLOW

. If this happens
then this method must be invoked again, with an output buffer that has
more room, in order to complete the current

decoding
operation

.

If this decoder has already been flushed then invoking this method
has no effect.

This method invokes the

implFlush

method to
perform the actual flushing operation.

**Parameters:**
- out

- The output character buffer

**Returns:**
- A coder-result object, either

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

or

CoderResult.OVERFLOW

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If the previous step of the current decoding operation was an
invocation neither of the

flush

method nor of
the three-argument

decode

method
with a value of

true

for the

endOfInput

parameter

---

#### protected
CoderResult
implFlush​(
CharBuffer
out)

Flushes this decoder.

The default implementation of this method does nothing, and always
returns

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

. This method should be overridden
by decoders that may need to write final characters to the output buffer
once the entire input sequence has been read.

**Parameters:**
- out

- The output character buffer

**Returns:**
- A coder-result object, either

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

or

CoderResult.OVERFLOW

---

#### public final
CharsetDecoder
reset()

Resets this decoder, clearing any internal state.

This method resets charset-independent state and also invokes the

implReset

method in order to perform any
charset-specific reset actions.

**Returns:**
- This decoder

---

#### protected void implReset()

Resets this decoder, clearing any charset-specific internal state.

The default implementation of this method does nothing. This method
should be overridden by decoders that maintain internal state.

---

#### protected abstract
CoderResult
decodeLoop​(
ByteBuffer
in,

CharBuffer
out)

Decodes one or more bytes into one or more characters.

This method encapsulates the basic decoding loop, decoding as many
bytes as possible until it either runs out of input, runs out of room
in the output buffer, or encounters a decoding error. This method is
invoked by the

decode

method, which handles result
interpretation and error recovery.

The buffers are read from, and written to, starting at their current
positions. At most

in.remaining()

bytes
will be read, and at most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffers' positions will be advanced to
reflect the bytes read and the characters written, but their marks and
limits will not be modified.

This method returns a

CoderResult

object to describe its
reason for termination, in the same manner as the

decode

method. Most implementations of this method will handle decoding errors
by returning an appropriate result object for interpretation by the

decode

method. An optimized implementation may instead
examine the relevant error action and implement that action itself.

An implementation of this method may perform arbitrary lookahead by
returning

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

until it receives sufficient
input.

**Parameters:**
- in

- The input byte buffer
- out

- The output character buffer

**Returns:**
- A coder-result object describing the reason for termination

---

#### public final
CharBuffer
decode​(
ByteBuffer
in)
throws
CharacterCodingException

Convenience method that decodes the remaining content of a single input
byte buffer into a newly-allocated character buffer.

This method implements an entire

decoding
operation

; that is, it resets this decoder, then it decodes the
bytes in the given byte buffer, and finally it flushes this
decoder. This method should therefore not be invoked if a decoding
operation is already in progress.

**Parameters:**
- in

- The input byte buffer

**Returns:**
- A newly-allocated character buffer containing the result of the
decoding operation. The buffer's position will be zero and its
limit will follow the last character written.

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If a decoding operation is already in progress
- MalformedInputException

- If the byte sequence starting at the input buffer's current
position is not legal for this charset and the current malformed-input action
is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT
- UnmappableCharacterException

- If the byte sequence starting at the input buffer's current
position cannot be mapped to an equivalent character sequence and
the current unmappable-character action is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT
- CharacterCodingException

---

#### public boolean isAutoDetecting()

Tells whether or not this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset.

The default implementation of this method always returns

false

; it should be overridden by auto-detecting decoders to
return

true

.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this decoder implements an
auto-detecting charset

---

#### public boolean isCharsetDetected()

Tells whether or not this decoder has yet detected a
charset

(optional operation)

.

If this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset then at a
single point during a decoding operation this method may start returning

true

to indicate that a specific charset has been detected in
the input byte sequence. Once this occurs, the

detectedCharset

method may be invoked to retrieve the detected charset.

That this method returns

false

does not imply that no bytes
have yet been decoded. Some auto-detecting decoders are capable of
decoding some, or even all, of an input byte sequence without fixing on
a particular charset.

The default implementation of this method always throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

; it should be overridden by
auto-detecting decoders to return

true

once the input charset
has been determined.

**Returns:**
- true

if, and only if, this decoder has detected a
specific charset

**Throws:**
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If this decoder does not implement an auto-detecting charset

---

#### public
Charset
detectedCharset()

Retrieves the charset that was detected by this
decoder

(optional operation)

.

If this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset then this
method returns the actual charset once it has been detected. After that
point, this method returns the same value for the duration of the
current decoding operation. If not enough input bytes have yet been
read to determine the actual charset then this method throws an

IllegalStateException

.

The default implementation of this method always throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

; it should be overridden by
auto-detecting decoders to return the appropriate value.

**Returns:**
- The charset detected by this auto-detecting decoder,
or

null

if the charset has not yet been determined

**Throws:**
- IllegalStateException

- If insufficient bytes have been read to determine a charset
- UnsupportedOperationException

- If this decoder does not implement an auto-detecting charset

java.nio.charset.CharsetDecoder

```java
public abstract class
CharsetDecoder

```

An engine that can transform a sequence of bytes in a specific charset into a sequence of
sixteen-bit Unicode characters.

The input byte sequence is provided in a byte buffer or a series
of such buffers. The output character sequence is written to a character buffer
or a series of such buffers. A decoder should always be used by making
the following sequence of method invocations, hereinafter referred to as a

:

- Reset the decoder via the

reset

method, unless it
has not been used before;
- Invoke the

decode

method zero or more times, as
long as additional input may be available, passing

false

for the

endOfInput

argument and filling the input buffer and flushing the
output buffer between invocations;
- Invoke the

decode

method one final time, passing

true

for the

endOfInput

argument; and then
- Invoke the

flush

method so that the decoder can
flush any internal state to the output buffer.

Each invocation of the

decode

method will decode as many
bytes as possible from the input buffer, writing the resulting characters
to the output buffer. The

decode

method returns when more
input is required, when there is not enough room in the output buffer, or

CoderResult

object is returned to describe the reason for termination. An invoker can
examine this object and fill the input buffer, flush the output buffer, or
attempt to recover from a decoding error, as appropriate, and try again.

There are two general types of decoding errors. If the input byte
sequence is not legal for this charset then the input is considered

malformed

. If
the input byte sequence is legal but cannot be mapped to a valid
Unicode character then an

unmappable character

has been encountered.

How a decoding error is handled depends upon the action requested for
that type of error, which is described by an instance of the

CodingErrorAction

class. The possible error actions are to

ignore

the erroneous input,

report

the error to the invoker via
the returned

CoderResult

object, or

replace

the erroneous input with the current value of the
replacement string. The replacement

has the initial value

"\uFFFD"

;

its value may be changed via the

replaceWith

method.

The default action for malformed-input and unmappable-character errors
is to

report

them. The
malformed-input error action may be changed via the

onMalformedInput

method; the
unmappable-character action may be changed via the

onUnmappableCharacter

method.

null
**Returns:** This decoder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the precondition on the parameter does not hold

- implOnUnmappableCharacter

```java
protected void implOnUnmappableCharacter​(
CodingErrorAction
newAction)
```

Reports a change to this decoder's unmappable-character action.

The default implementation of this method does nothing. This method
should be overridden by decoders that require notification of changes to
the unmappable-character action.

**Parameters:** newAction

- The new action

- averageCharsPerByte

```java
public final float averageCharsPerByte()
```

Returns the average number of characters that will be produced for each
byte of input. This heuristic value may be used to estimate the size
of the output buffer required for a given input sequence.

**Returns:** The average number of characters produced
per byte of input

- maxCharsPerByte

```java
public final float maxCharsPerByte()
```

Returns the maximum number of characters that will be produced for each
byte of input. This value may be used to compute the worst-case size
of the output buffer required for a given input sequence.

**Returns:** The maximum number of characters that will be produced per
byte of input

- decode

```java
public final
CoderResult
decode​(
ByteBuffer
in,

CharBuffer
out,
boolean endOfInput)
```

Decodes as many bytes as possible from the given input buffer,
writing the results to the given output buffer.

The buffers are read from, and written to, starting at their current
positions. At most

in.remaining()

bytes
will be read and at most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffers' positions will be advanced to
reflect the bytes read and the characters written, but their marks and
limits will not be modified.

In addition to reading bytes from the input buffer and writing
characters to the output buffer, this method returns a

CoderResult

object to describe its reason for termination:

- CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

indicates that as much of the
input buffer as possible has been decoded. If there is no further
input then the invoker can proceed to the next step of the

decoding operation

. Otherwise this method
should be invoked again with further input.
- CoderResult.OVERFLOW

indicates that there is
insufficient space in the output buffer to decode any more bytes.
This method should be invoked again with an output buffer that has
more

remaining

characters. This is
typically done by draining any decoded characters from the output
buffer.
- A

malformed-input

result indicates that a malformed-input
error has been detected. The malformed bytes begin at the input
buffer's (possibly incremented) position; the number of malformed
bytes may be determined by invoking the result object's

length

method. This case applies only if the

malformed action

of this decoder
is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT

; otherwise the malformed input
will be ignored or replaced, as requested.
- An

unmappable-character

result indicates that an
unmappable-character error has been detected. The bytes that
decode the unmappable character begin at the input buffer's (possibly
incremented) position; the number of such bytes may be determined
by invoking the result object's

length

method. This case applies only if the

unmappable action

of this decoder is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT

; otherwise the unmappable character will be
ignored or replaced, as requested.

In any case, if this method is to be reinvoked in the same decoding
operation then care should be taken to preserve any bytes remaining
in the input buffer so that they are available to the next invocation.

The

endOfInput

parameter advises this method as to whether
the invoker can provide further input beyond that contained in the given
input buffer. If there is a possibility of providing additional input
then the invoker should pass

false

for this parameter; if there
is no possibility of providing further input then the invoker should
pass

true

. It is not erroneous, and in fact it is quite
common, to pass

false

in one invocation and later discover that
no further input was actually available. It is critical, however, that
the final invocation of this method in a sequence of invocations always
pass

true

so that any remaining undecoded input will be treated
as being malformed.

This method works by invoking the

decodeLoop

method, interpreting its results, handling error conditions, and
reinvoking it as necessary.

**Parameters:** in

- The input byte buffer
**Parameters:** out

- The output character buffer
**Parameters:** endOfInput

-

true

if, and only if, the invoker can provide no
additional input bytes beyond those in the given buffer
**Returns:** A coder-result object describing the reason for termination
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If a decoding operation is already in progress and the previous
step was an invocation neither of the

reset

method, nor of this method with a value of

false

for
the

endOfInput

parameter, nor of this method with a
value of

true

for the

endOfInput

parameter
but a return value indicating an incomplete decoding operation
**Throws:** CoderMalfunctionError

- If an invocation of the decodeLoop method threw
an unexpected exception

- flush

```java
public final
CoderResult
flush​(
CharBuffer
out)
```

Flushes this decoder.

Some decoders maintain internal state and may need to write some
final characters to the output buffer once the overall input sequence has
been read.

Any additional output is written to the output buffer beginning at
its current position. At most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffer's position will be advanced
appropriately, but its mark and limit will not be modified.

If this method completes successfully then it returns

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

. If there is insufficient room in the output
buffer then it returns

CoderResult.OVERFLOW

. If this happens
then this method must be invoked again, with an output buffer that has
more room, in order to complete the current

decoding
operation

.

If this decoder has already been flushed then invoking this method
has no effect.

This method invokes the

implFlush

method to
perform the actual flushing operation.

**Parameters:** out

- The output character buffer
**Returns:** A coder-result object, either

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

or

CoderResult.OVERFLOW
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If the previous step of the current decoding operation was an
invocation neither of the

flush

method nor of
the three-argument

decode

method
with a value of

true

for the

endOfInput

parameter

- implFlush

```java
protected
CoderResult
implFlush​(
CharBuffer
out)
```

Flushes this decoder.

The default implementation of this method does nothing, and always
returns

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

. This method should be overridden
by decoders that may need to write final characters to the output buffer
once the entire input sequence has been read.

**Parameters:** out

- The output character buffer
**Returns:** A coder-result object, either

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

or

CoderResult.OVERFLOW

- reset

```java
public final
CharsetDecoder
reset()
```

Resets this decoder, clearing any internal state.

This method resets charset-independent state and also invokes the

implReset

method in order to perform any
charset-specific reset actions.

**Returns:** This decoder

- implReset

```java
protected void implReset()
```

Resets this decoder, clearing any charset-specific internal state.

The default implementation of this method does nothing. This method
should be overridden by decoders that maintain internal state.

- decodeLoop

```java
protected abstract
CoderResult
decodeLoop​(
ByteBuffer
in,

CharBuffer
out)
```

Decodes one or more bytes into one or more characters.

This method encapsulates the basic decoding loop, decoding as many
bytes as possible until it either runs out of input, runs out of room
in the output buffer, or encounters a decoding error. This method is
invoked by the

decode

method, which handles result
interpretation and error recovery.

The buffers are read from, and written to, starting at their current
positions. At most

in.remaining()

bytes
will be read, and at most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffers' positions will be advanced to
reflect the bytes read and the characters written, but their marks and
limits will not be modified.

This method returns a

CoderResult

object to describe its
reason for termination, in the same manner as the

decode

method. Most implementations of this method will handle decoding errors
by returning an appropriate result object for interpretation by the

decode

method. An optimized implementation may instead
examine the relevant error action and implement that action itself.

An implementation of this method may perform arbitrary lookahead by
returning

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

until it receives sufficient
input.

**Parameters:** in

- The input byte buffer
**Parameters:** out

- The output character buffer
**Returns:** A coder-result object describing the reason for termination

- decode

```java
public final
CharBuffer
decode​(
ByteBuffer
in)
throws
CharacterCodingException
```

Convenience method that decodes the remaining content of a single input
byte buffer into a newly-allocated character buffer.

This method implements an entire

decoding
operation

; that is, it resets this decoder, then it decodes the
bytes in the given byte buffer, and finally it flushes this
decoder. This method should therefore not be invoked if a decoding
operation is already in progress.

**Parameters:** in

- The input byte buffer
**Returns:** A newly-allocated character buffer containing the result of the
decoding operation. The buffer's position will be zero and its
limit will follow the last character written.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If a decoding operation is already in progress
**Throws:** MalformedInputException

- If the byte sequence starting at the input buffer's current
position is not legal for this charset and the current malformed-input action
is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT
**Throws:** UnmappableCharacterException

- If the byte sequence starting at the input buffer's current
position cannot be mapped to an equivalent character sequence and
the current unmappable-character action is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT
**Throws:** CharacterCodingException

- isAutoDetecting

```java
public boolean isAutoDetecting()
```

Tells whether or not this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset.

The default implementation of this method always returns

false

; it should be overridden by auto-detecting decoders to
return

true

.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this decoder implements an
auto-detecting charset

- isCharsetDetected

```java
public boolean isCharsetDetected()
```

Tells whether or not this decoder has yet detected a
charset

(optional operation)

.

If this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset then at a
single point during a decoding operation this method may start returning

true

to indicate that a specific charset has been detected in
the input byte sequence. Once this occurs, the

detectedCharset

method may be invoked to retrieve the detected charset.

That this method returns

false

does not imply that no bytes
have yet been decoded. Some auto-detecting decoders are capable of
decoding some, or even all, of an input byte sequence without fixing on
a particular charset.

The default implementation of this method always throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

; it should be overridden by
auto-detecting decoders to return

true

once the input charset
has been determined.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this decoder has detected a
specific charset
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If this decoder does not implement an auto-detecting charset

- detectedCharset

```java
public
Charset
detectedCharset()
```

Retrieves the charset that was detected by this
decoder

(optional operation)

.

If this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset then this
method returns the actual charset once it has been detected. After that
point, this method returns the same value for the duration of the
current decoding operation. If not enough input bytes have yet been
read to determine the actual charset then this method throws an

IllegalStateException

.

The default implementation of this method always throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

; it should be overridden by
auto-detecting decoders to return the appropriate value.

**Returns:** The charset detected by this auto-detecting decoder,
or

null

if the charset has not yet been determined
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If insufficient bytes have been read to determine a charset
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If this decoder does not implement an auto-detecting charset

The default implementation of this method does nothing. This method
should be overridden by decoders that require notification of changes to
the malformed-input action.

**Parameters:** newAction

- The new action

- unmappableCharacterAction

```java
public
CodingErrorAction
unmappableCharacterAction()
```

Returns this decoder's current action for unmappable-character errors.

**Returns:** The current unmappable-character action, which is never

null

- onUnmappableCharacter

```java
public final
CharsetDecoder
onUnmappableCharacter​(
CodingErrorAction
newAction)
```

Changes this decoder's action for unmappable-character errors.

This method invokes the

implOnUnmappableCharacter

method, passing the new action.

**Parameters:** newAction

- The new action; must not be

null
**Returns:** This decoder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- If the precondition on the parameter does not hold

- implOnUnmappableCharacter

```java
protected void implOnUnmappableCharacter​(
CodingErrorAction
newAction)
```

Reports a change to this decoder's unmappable-character action.

The default implementation of this method does nothing. This method
should be overridden by decoders that require notification of changes to
the unmappable-character action.

**Parameters:** newAction

- The new action

- averageCharsPerByte

```java
public final float averageCharsPerByte()
```

Returns the average number of characters that will be produced for each
byte of input. This heuristic value may be used to estimate the size
of the output buffer required for a given input sequence.

**Returns:** The average number of characters produced
per byte of input

- maxCharsPerByte

```java
public final float maxCharsPerByte()
```

Returns the maximum number of characters that will be produced for each
byte of input. This value may be used to compute the worst-case size
of the output buffer required for a given input sequence.

**Returns:** The maximum number of characters that will be produced per
byte of input

- decode

```java
public final
CoderResult
decode​(
ByteBuffer
in,

CharBuffer
out,
boolean endOfInput)
```

Decodes as many bytes as possible from the given input buffer,
writing the results to the given output buffer.

The buffers are read from, and written to, starting at their current
positions. At most

in.remaining()

bytes
will be read and at most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffers' positions will be advanced to
reflect the bytes read and the characters written, but their marks and
limits will not be modified.

In addition to reading bytes from the input buffer and writing
characters to the output buffer, this method returns a

CoderResult

object to describe its reason for termination:

- CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

indicates that as much of the
input buffer as possible has been decoded. If there is no further
input then the invoker can proceed to the next step of the

decoding operation

. Otherwise this method
should be invoked again with further input.
- CoderResult.OVERFLOW

indicates that there is
insufficient space in the output buffer to decode any more bytes.
This method should be invoked again with an output buffer that has
more

remaining

characters. This is
typically done by draining any decoded characters from the output
buffer.
- A

malformed-input

result indicates that a malformed-input
error has been detected. The malformed bytes begin at the input
buffer's (possibly incremented) position; the number of malformed
bytes may be determined by invoking the result object's

length

method. This case applies only if the

malformed action

of this decoder
is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT

; otherwise the malformed input
will be ignored or replaced, as requested.
- An

unmappable-character

result indicates that an
unmappable-character error has been detected. The bytes that
decode the unmappable character begin at the input buffer's (possibly
incremented) position; the number of such bytes may be determined
by invoking the result object's

length

method. This case applies only if the

unmappable action

of this decoder is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT

; otherwise the unmappable character will be
ignored or replaced, as requested.

In any case, if this method is to be reinvoked in the same decoding
operation then care should be taken to preserve any bytes remaining
in the input buffer so that they are available to the next invocation.

The

endOfInput

parameter advises this method as to whether
the invoker can provide further input beyond that contained in the given
input buffer. If there is a possibility of providing additional input
then the invoker should pass

false

for this parameter; if there
is no possibility of providing further input then the invoker should
pass

true

. It is not erroneous, and in fact it is quite
common, to pass

false

in one invocation and later discover that
no further input was actually available. It is critical, however, that
the final invocation of this method in a sequence of invocations always
pass

true

so that any remaining undecoded input will be treated
as being malformed.

This method works by invoking the

decodeLoop

method, interpreting its results, handling error conditions, and
reinvoking it as necessary.

**Parameters:** in

- The input byte buffer
**Parameters:** out

- The output character buffer
**Parameters:** endOfInput

-

true

if, and only if, the invoker can provide no
additional input bytes beyond those in the given buffer
**Returns:** A coder-result object describing the reason for termination
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If a decoding operation is already in progress and the previous
step was an invocation neither of the

reset

method, nor of this method with a value of

false

for
the

endOfInput

parameter, nor of this method with a
value of

true

for the

endOfInput

parameter
but a return value indicating an incomplete decoding operation
**Throws:** CoderMalfunctionError

- If an invocation of the decodeLoop method threw
an unexpected exception

- flush

```java
public final
CoderResult
flush​(
CharBuffer
out)
```

Flushes this decoder.

Some decoders maintain internal state and may need to write some
final characters to the output buffer once the overall input sequence has
been read.

Any additional output is written to the output buffer beginning at
its current position. At most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffer's position will be advanced
appropriately, but its mark and limit will not be modified.

If this method completes successfully then it returns

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

. If there is insufficient room in the output
buffer then it returns

CoderResult.OVERFLOW

. If this happens
then this method must be invoked again, with an output buffer that has
more room, in order to complete the current

decoding
operation

.

If this decoder has already been flushed then invoking this method
has no effect.

This method invokes the

implFlush

method to
perform the actual flushing operation.

**Parameters:** out

- The output character buffer
**Returns:** A coder-result object, either

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

or

CoderResult.OVERFLOW
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If the previous step of the current decoding operation was an
invocation neither of the

flush

method nor of
the three-argument

decode

method
with a value of

true

for the

endOfInput

parameter

- implFlush

```java
protected
CoderResult
implFlush​(
CharBuffer
out)
```

Flushes this decoder.

The default implementation of this method does nothing, and always
returns

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

. This method should be overridden
by decoders that may need to write final characters to the output buffer
once the entire input sequence has been read.

**Parameters:** out

- The output character buffer
**Returns:** A coder-result object, either

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

or

CoderResult.OVERFLOW

- reset

```java
public final
CharsetDecoder
reset()
```

Resets this decoder, clearing any internal state.

This method resets charset-independent state and also invokes the

implReset

method in order to perform any
charset-specific reset actions.

**Returns:** This decoder

- implReset

```java
protected void implReset()
```

Resets this decoder, clearing any charset-specific internal state.

The default implementation of this method does nothing. This method
should be overridden by decoders that maintain internal state.

- decodeLoop

```java
protected abstract
CoderResult
decodeLoop​(
ByteBuffer
in,

CharBuffer
out)
```

Decodes one or more bytes into one or more characters.

This method encapsulates the basic decoding loop, decoding as many
bytes as possible until it either runs out of input, runs out of room
in the output buffer, or encounters a decoding error. This method is
invoked by the

decode

method, which handles result
interpretation and error recovery.

The buffers are read from, and written to, starting at their current
positions. At most

in.remaining()

bytes
will be read, and at most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffers' positions will be advanced to
reflect the bytes read and the characters written, but their marks and
limits will not be modified.

This method returns a

CoderResult

object to describe its
reason for termination, in the same manner as the

decode

method. Most implementations of this method will handle decoding errors
by returning an appropriate result object for interpretation by the

decode

method. An optimized implementation may instead
examine the relevant error action and implement that action itself.

An implementation of this method may perform arbitrary lookahead by
returning

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

until it receives sufficient
input.

**Parameters:** in

- The input byte buffer
**Parameters:** out

- The output character buffer
**Returns:** A coder-result object describing the reason for termination

- decode

```java
public final
CharBuffer
decode​(
ByteBuffer
in)
throws
CharacterCodingException
```

Convenience method that decodes the remaining content of a single input
byte buffer into a newly-allocated character buffer.

This method implements an entire

decoding
operation

; that is, it resets this decoder, then it decodes the
bytes in the given byte buffer, and finally it flushes this
decoder. This method should therefore not be invoked if a decoding
operation is already in progress.

**Parameters:** in

- The input byte buffer
**Returns:** A newly-allocated character buffer containing the result of the
decoding operation. The buffer's position will be zero and its
limit will follow the last character written.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If a decoding operation is already in progress
**Throws:** MalformedInputException

- If the byte sequence starting at the input buffer's current
position is not legal for this charset and the current malformed-input action
is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT
**Throws:** UnmappableCharacterException

- If the byte sequence starting at the input buffer's current
position cannot be mapped to an equivalent character sequence and
the current unmappable-character action is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT
**Throws:** CharacterCodingException

- isAutoDetecting

```java
public boolean isAutoDetecting()
```

Tells whether or not this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset.

The default implementation of this method always returns

false

; it should be overridden by auto-detecting decoders to
return

true

.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this decoder implements an
auto-detecting charset

- isCharsetDetected

```java
public boolean isCharsetDetected()
```

Tells whether or not this decoder has yet detected a
charset

(optional operation)

.

If this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset then at a
single point during a decoding operation this method may start returning

true

to indicate that a specific charset has been detected in
the input byte sequence. Once this occurs, the

detectedCharset

method may be invoked to retrieve the detected charset.

That this method returns

false

does not imply that no bytes
have yet been decoded. Some auto-detecting decoders are capable of
decoding some, or even all, of an input byte sequence without fixing on
a particular charset.

The default implementation of this method always throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

; it should be overridden by
auto-detecting decoders to return

true

once the input charset
has been determined.

**Returns:** true

if, and only if, this decoder has detected a
specific charset
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If this decoder does not implement an auto-detecting charset

- detectedCharset

```java
public
Charset
detectedCharset()
```

Retrieves the charset that was detected by this
decoder

(optional operation)

.

If this decoder implements an auto-detecting charset then this
method returns the actual charset once it has been detected. After that
point, this method returns the same value for the duration of the
current decoding operation. If not enough input bytes have yet been
read to determine the actual charset then this method throws an

IllegalStateException

.

The default implementation of this method always throws an

UnsupportedOperationException

; it should be overridden by
auto-detecting decoders to return the appropriate value.

**Returns:** The charset detected by this auto-detecting decoder,
or

null

if the charset has not yet been determined
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- If insufficient bytes have been read to determine a charset
**Throws:** UnsupportedOperationException

- If this decoder does not implement an auto-detecting charset

decode

```java
public final
CoderResult
decode​(
ByteBuffer
in,

CharBuffer
out,

```

Decodes as many bytes as possible from the given input buffer,
writing the results to the given output buffer.

The buffers are read from, and written to, starting at their current
positions. At most

in.remaining()

bytes
will be read and at most

reflect the bytes read and the characters written, but their marks and
limits will not be modified.

In addition to reading bytes from the input buffer and writing
characters to the output buffer, this method returns a

CoderResult

object to describe its reason for termination:

- CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

indicates that as much of the
input buffer as possible has been decoded. If there is no further

decoding operation

. Otherwise this method
should be invoked again with further input.

typically done by draining any decoded characters from the output

- A

malformed-input

result indicates that a malformed-input
error has been detected. The malformed bytes begin at the input
buffer's (possibly incremented) position; the number of malformed
bytes may be determined by invoking the result object's

length

method. This case applies only if the

malformed action

of this decoder
is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT

input then the invoker can proceed to the next step of the

decoding operation

. Otherwise this method
should be invoked again with further input.
- CoderResult.OVERFLOW

indicates that there is
insufficient space in the output buffer to decode any more bytes.
This method should be invoked again with an output buffer that has
more

remaining

characters. This is
typically done by draining any decoded characters from the output
buffer.
- A

malformed-input

result indicates that a malformed-input
error has been detected. The malformed bytes begin at the input
buffer's (possibly incremented) position; the number of malformed
bytes may be determined by invoking the result object's

length

method. This case applies only if the

malformed action

of this decoder
is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT

; otherwise the malformed input
will be ignored or replaced, as requested.
- An

unmappable-character

result indicates that an
unmappable-character error has been detected. The bytes that
decode the unmappable character begin at the input buffer's (possibly
incremented) position; the number of such bytes may be determined
by invoking the result object's

length

method. This case applies only if the

unmappable action

of this decoder is

CodingErrorAction.REPORT

; otherwise the unmappable character will be
ignored or replaced, as requested.

In any case, if this method is to be reinvoked in the same decoding
operation then care should be taken to preserve any bytes remaining
in the input buffer so that they are available to the next invocation.

The

endOfInput

parameter advises this method as to whether
the invoker can provide further input beyond that contained in the given
input buffer. If there is a possibility of providing additional input
then the invoker should pass

false

for this parameter; if there
is no possibility of providing further input then the invoker should
pass

true

. It is not erroneous, and in fact it is quite
common, to pass

false

in one invocation and later discover that
no further input was actually available. It is critical, however, that
the final invocation of this method in a sequence of invocations always
pass

true

so that any remaining undecoded input will be treated
as being malformed.

decodeLoop

reinvoking it as necessary.

flush

```java
public final
CoderResult
flush​(
CharBuffer
out)
```

Flushes this decoder.

Some decoders maintain internal state and may need to write some
final characters to the output buffer once the overall input sequence has
been read.

Any additional output is written to the output buffer beginning at
its current position. At most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffer's position will be advanced
appropriately, but its mark and limit will not be modified.

If this method completes successfully then it returns

CoderResult.UNDERFLOW

. If there is insufficient room in the output
buffer then it returns

CoderResult.OVERFLOW

. If this happens
then this method must be invoked again, with an output buffer that has
more room, in order to complete the current

decodeLoop

```java
protected abstract
CoderResult
decodeLoop​(

```

Decodes one or more bytes into one or more characters.

This method encapsulates the basic decoding loop, decoding as many
bytes as possible until it either runs out of input, runs out of room
in the output buffer, or encounters a decoding error. This method is
invoked by the

decode

method, which handles result
interpretation and error recovery.

The buffers are read from, and written to, starting at their current
positions. At most

in.remaining()

bytes
will be read, and at most

out.remaining()

characters will be written. The buffers' positions will be advanced to
reflect the bytes read and the characters written, but their marks and
limits will not be modified.

This method returns a

CoderResult

object to describe its
reason for termination, in the same manner as the

**Parameters:** in

- The input byte buffer
**Returns:** A newly-allocated character buffer containing the result of the
decoding operation. The buffer's position will be zero and its
limit will follow the last character written.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException
