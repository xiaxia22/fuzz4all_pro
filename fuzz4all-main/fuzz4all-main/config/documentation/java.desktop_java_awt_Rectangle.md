# Class Rectangle

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\Rectangle.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
Rectangle

extends
Rectangle2D

implements
Shape
,
Serializable
```

A

Rectangle

specifies an area in a coordinate space that is
enclosed by the

Rectangle

object's upper-left point

(x,y)

in the coordinate space, its width, and its height.

A

Rectangle

object's

width

and

height

are

public

fields. The constructors
that create a

Rectangle

, and the methods that can modify
one, do not prevent setting a negative value for width or height.

A

Rectangle

whose width or height is exactly zero has location
along those axes with zero dimension, but is otherwise considered empty.

The

isEmpty()

method will return true for such a

Rectangle

.
Methods which test if an empty

Rectangle

contains or intersects
a point or rectangle will always return false if either dimension is zero.
Methods which combine such a

Rectangle

with a point or rectangle
will include the location of the

Rectangle

on that axis in the
result as if the

add(Point)

method were being called.

A

Rectangle

whose width or height is negative has neither
location nor dimension along those axes with negative dimensions.
Such a

Rectangle

is treated as non-existent along those axes.
Such a

Rectangle

is also empty with respect to containment
calculations and methods which test if it contains or intersects a
point or rectangle will always return false.
Methods which combine such a

Rectangle

with a point or rectangle
will ignore the

Rectangle

entirely in generating the result.
If two

Rectangle

objects are combined and each has a negative
dimension, the result will have at least one negative dimension.

Methods which affect only the location of a

Rectangle

will
operate on its location regardless of whether or not it has a negative
or zero dimension along either axis.

Note that a

Rectangle

constructed with the default no-argument
constructor will have dimensions of

0x0

and therefore be empty.
That

Rectangle

will still have a location of

(0,0)

and
will contribute that location to the union and add operations.
Code attempting to accumulate the bounds of a set of points should
therefore initially construct the

Rectangle

with a specifically
negative width and height or it should use the first point in the set
to construct the

Rectangle

.
For example:

```java
Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(0, 0, -1, -1);
for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
bounds.add(points[i]);
}
```

or if we know that the points array contains at least one point:

```java
Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(points[0]);
for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
bounds.add(points[i]);
}
```

This class uses 32-bit integers to store its location and dimensions.
Frequently operations may produce a result that exceeds the range of
a 32-bit integer.
The methods will calculate their results in a way that avoids any
32-bit overflow for intermediate results and then choose the best
representation to store the final results back into the 32-bit fields
which hold the location and dimensions.
The location of the result will be stored into the

x

and

y

fields by clipping the true result to the nearest 32-bit value.
The values stored into the

width

and

height

dimension
fields will be chosen as the 32-bit values that encompass the largest
part of the true result as possible.
Generally this means that the dimension will be clipped independently
to the range of 32-bit integers except that if the location had to be
moved to store it into its pair of 32-bit fields then the dimensions
will be adjusted relative to the "best representation" of the location.
If the true result had a negative dimension and was therefore
non-existent along one or both axes, the stored dimensions will be
negative numbers in those axes.
If the true result had a location that could be represented within
the range of 32-bit integers, but zero dimension along one or both
axes, then the stored dimensions will be zero in those axes.

#### public
Rectangle
getBounds()

Gets the bounding

Rectangle

of this

Rectangle

.

This method is included for completeness, to parallel the

getBounds

method of

Component

.

**Specified by:**
- getBounds

in interface

Shape

**Overrides:**
- getBounds

in class

RectangularShape

**Returns:**
- a new

Rectangle

, equal to the
bounding

Rectangle

for this

Rectangle

.

---

#### public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Specified by:**
- getBounds2D

in interface

Shape

**Overrides:**
- getBounds2D

in class

Rectangle2D

**Returns:**
- an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

Shape

.

- Shape.getBounds()

**Since:**
- 1.2

#### public void add​(int newx,
int newy)

Adds a point, specified by the integer arguments

newx,newy

to the bounds of this

Rectangle

.

If this

Rectangle

has any dimension less than zero,
the rules for

non-existent

rectangles apply.
In that case, the new bounds of this

Rectangle

will
have a location equal to the specified coordinates and
width and height equal to zero.

After adding a point, a call to

contains

with the
added point as an argument does not necessarily return

true

. The

contains

method does not
return

true

for points on the right or bottom
edges of a

Rectangle

. Therefore, if the added point
falls on the right or bottom edge of the enlarged

Rectangle

,

contains

returns

false

for that point.
If the specified point must be contained within the new

Rectangle

, a 1x1 rectangle should be added instead:

```java
r.add(newx, newy, 1, 1);
```

**Parameters:**
- newx

- the X coordinate of the new point
- newy

- the Y coordinate of the new point

---

#### public void add​(
Point
pt)

Adds the specified

Point

to the bounds of this

Rectangle

.

If this

Rectangle

has any dimension less than zero,
the rules for

non-existent

rectangles apply.
In that case, the new bounds of this

Rectangle

will
have a location equal to the coordinates of the specified

Point

and width and height equal to zero.

After adding a

Point

, a call to

contains

with the added

Point

as an argument does not
necessarily return

true

. The

contains

method does not return

true

for points on the right
or bottom edges of a

Rectangle

. Therefore if the added

Point

falls on the right or bottom edge of the
enlarged

Rectangle

,

contains

returns

false

for that

Point

.
If the specified point must be contained within the new

Rectangle

, a 1x1 rectangle should be added instead:

```java
r.add(pt.x, pt.y, 1, 1);
```

**Parameters:**
- pt

- the new

Point

to add to this

Rectangle

---

#### public void add​(
Rectangle
r)

Adds a

Rectangle

to this

Rectangle

.
The resulting

Rectangle

is the union of the two
rectangles.

If either

Rectangle

has any dimension less than 0, the
result will have the dimensions of the other

Rectangle

.
If both

Rectangle

s have at least one dimension less
than 0, the result will have at least one dimension less than 0.

If either

Rectangle

has one or both dimensions equal
to 0, the result along those axes with 0 dimensions will be
equivalent to the results obtained by adding the corresponding
origin coordinate to the result rectangle along that axis,
similar to the operation of the

add(Point)

method,
but contribute no further dimension beyond that.

If the resulting

Rectangle

would have a dimension
too large to be expressed as an

int

, the result
will have a dimension of

Integer.MAX_VALUE

along
that dimension.

**Parameters:**
- r

- the specified

Rectangle

---

#### public void grow​(int h,
int v)

Resizes the

Rectangle

both horizontally and vertically.

This method modifies the

units larger at both the top and bottom.

The new

Rectangle

has

(x - h, y - v)

as its upper-left corner,
width of

(width + 2h)

,
and a height of

(height + 2v)

.

If negative values are supplied for

h

and

v

, the size of the

Rectangle

decreases accordingly.
The

grow

method will check for integer overflow
and underflow, but does not check whether the resulting
values of

width

and

height

grow
from negative to non-negative or shrink from non-negative
to negative.

**Parameters:**
- h

- the horizontal expansion
- v

- the vertical expansion

public class
Rectangle

extends

implements
Shape
,
Serializable
```

A

Rectangle

specifies an area in a coordinate space that is
enclosed by the

Rectangle

object's upper-left point

(x,y)

in the coordinate space, its width, and its height.

A

Rectangle

object's

width

and

height

are

public

fields. The constructors
that create a

Rectangle

, and the methods that can modify
one, do not prevent setting a negative value for width or height.

A

Rectangle

whose width or height is exactly zero has location
along those axes with zero dimension, but is otherwise considered empty.

The

isEmpty()

method will return true for such a

Rectangle

.
Methods which test if an empty

Rectangle

contains or intersects
a point or rectangle will always return false if either dimension is zero.
Methods which combine such a

Rectangle

with a point or rectangle
will include the location of the

Rectangle

on that axis in the
result as if the

add(Point)

method were being called.

A

Rectangle

whose width or height is negative has neither
location nor dimension along those axes with negative dimensions.
Such a

Rectangle

is treated as non-existent along those axes.
Such a

Rectangle

is also empty with respect to containment
calculations and methods which test if it contains or intersects a
point or rectangle will always return false.
Methods which combine such a

Rectangle

with a point or rectangle
will ignore the

Rectangle

entirely in generating the result.
If two

Rectangle

objects are combined and each has a negative
dimension, the result will have at least one negative dimension.

Methods which affect only the location of a

Rectangle

will
operate on its location regardless of whether or not it has a negative
or zero dimension along either axis.

Note that a

Rectangle

constructed with the default no-argument
constructor will have dimensions of

0x0

and therefore be empty.
That

Rectangle

will still have a location of

(0,0)

and
will contribute that location to the union and add operations.
Code attempting to accumulate the bounds of a set of points should
therefore initially construct the

Rectangle

with a specifically
negative width and height or it should use the first point in the set
to construct the

Rectangle

.
For example:

```java
Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(0, 0, -1, -1);
for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
bounds.add(points[i]);
}
```

or if we know that the points array contains at least one point:

```java
Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(points[0]);
for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
bounds.add(points[i]);
}
```

This class uses 32-bit integers to store its location and dimensions.
Frequently operations may produce a result that exceeds the range of
a 32-bit integer.
The methods will calculate their results in a way that avoids any
32-bit overflow for intermediate results and then choose the best
representation to store the final results back into the 32-bit fields
which hold the location and dimensions.
The location of the result will be stored into the

x

and

y

fields by clipping the true result to the nearest 32-bit value.
The values stored into the

width

and

height

dimension
fields will be chosen as the 32-bit values that encompass the largest
part of the true result as possible.
Generally this means that the dimension will be clipped independently
to the range of 32-bit integers except that if the location had to be
moved to store it into its pair of 32-bit fields then the dimensions
will be adjusted relative to the "best representation" of the location.
If the true result had a negative dimension and was therefore
non-existent along one or both axes, the stored dimensions will be
negative numbers in those axes.
If the true result had a location that could be represented within
the range of 32-bit integers, but zero dimension along one or both
axes, then the stored dimensions will be zero in those axes.

- Method Detail

- getX

```java
public double getX()
```

Returns the X coordinate of the bounding

Rectangle

in

double

precision.

**Specified by:** getX

in class

RectangularShape
**Returns:** the X coordinate of the bounding

Rectangle

.

- getY

```java
public double getY()
```

Returns the Y coordinate of the bounding

Rectangle

in

double

precision.

**Specified by:** getY

in class

RectangularShape
**Returns:** the Y coordinate of the bounding

Rectangle

.

- getWidth

```java
public double getWidth()
```

Returns the width of the bounding

Rectangle

in

double

precision.

**Specified by:** getWidth

in class

RectangularShape
**Returns:** the width of the bounding

Rectangle

.

- getHeight

```java
public double getHeight()
```

Returns the height of the bounding

Rectangle

in

double

precision.

**Specified by:** getHeight

in class

RectangularShape
**Returns:** the height of the bounding

Rectangle

.

- getBounds

```java
public
Rectangle
getBounds()
```

Gets the bounding

Rectangle

of this

Rectangle

.

This method is included for completeness, to parallel the

getBounds

method of

Component

.

**Specified by:** getBounds

in interface

Shape
**Overrides:** getBounds

in class

RectangularShape
**Returns:** a new

Rectangle

, equal to the
bounding

Rectangle

for this

Rectangle

.
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** Component.getBounds()

,

setBounds(Rectangle)

,

setBounds(int, int, int, int)

- getBounds2D

```java
public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()
```

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Specified by:** getBounds2D

in interface

Shape
**Overrides:** getBounds2D

in class

Rectangle2D
**Returns:** an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

Shape

.
**Since:** 1.2
**See Also:** Shape.getBounds()

- setBounds

```java
public void setBounds​(
Rectangle
r)
```

Sets the bounding

Rectangle

of this

Rectangle

to match the specified

Rectangle
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** getBounds()

,

Component.setBounds(java.awt.Rectangle)

**Parameters:** x

- the new X coordinate for the upper-left
corner of this

Rectangle
**Parameters:** y

- the new Y coordinate for the upper-left
corner of this

Rectangle
**Parameters:** width

- the new width for this

Rectangle
**Parameters:** height

- the new height for this

Rectangle

Rectangle

. Returns a new

Rectangle

that
represents the union of the two rectangles.

If either

Rectangle

has any dimension less than zero
the rules for

non-existent

rectangles
apply.
If only one has a dimension less than zero, then the result
will be a copy of the other

Rectangle

.
If both have dimension less than zero, then the result will
have at least one dimension less than zero.

If the resulting

Rectangle

would have a dimension
too large to be expressed as an

int

, the result
will have a dimension of

Integer.MAX_VALUE

along
that dimension.

**Parameters:** r

- the specified

Rectangle
**Returns:** the smallest

Rectangle

containing both
the specified

Rectangle

and this

Rectangle

.

- add

```java
public void add​(int newx,
int newy)
```

Adds a point, specified by the integer arguments

newx,newy

to the bounds of this

Rectangle

.

If this

Rectangle

has any dimension less than zero,
the rules for

non-existent

rectangles apply.
In that case, the new bounds of this

Rectangle

will
have a location equal to the specified coordinates and
width and height equal to zero.

After adding a point, a call to

contains

with the
added point as an argument does not necessarily return

true

. The

contains

method does not
return

true

for points on the right or bottom
edges of a

Rectangle

. Therefore, if the added point
falls on the right or bottom edge of the enlarged

Rectangle

,

contains

returns

false

for that point.
If the specified point must be contained within the new

Rectangle

, a 1x1 rectangle should be added instead:

```java
r.add(newx, newy, 1, 1);
```

**Parameters:** newx

- the X coordinate of the new point
**Parameters:** newy

- the Y coordinate of the new point

- add

```java
public void add​(
Point
pt)
```

Adds the specified

Point

to the bounds of this

Rectangle

.

If this

Rectangle

has any dimension less than zero,
the rules for

non-existent

rectangles apply.
In that case, the new bounds of this

Rectangle

will
have a location equal to the coordinates of the specified

Point

and width and height equal to zero.

After adding a

Point

, a call to

contains

with the added

Point

as an argument does not
necessarily return

true

. The

contains

method does not return

true

for points on the right
or bottom edges of a

Rectangle

. Therefore if the added

Point

falls on the right or bottom edge of the
enlarged

Rectangle

,

contains

returns

false

for that

Point

.
If the specified point must be contained within the new

Rectangle

, a 1x1 rectangle should be added instead:

```java
r.add(pt.x, pt.y, 1, 1);
```

**Parameters:** pt

- the new

Point

to add to this

Rectangle

- add

```java
public void add​(
Rectangle
r)
```

Adds a

Rectangle

to this

Rectangle

.
The resulting

Rectangle

is the union of the two
rectangles.

If either

Rectangle

has any dimension less than 0, the
result will have the dimensions of the other

Rectangle

.
If both

Rectangle

s have at least one dimension less
than 0, the result will have at least one dimension less than 0.

If either

Rectangle

has one or both dimensions equal
to 0, the result along those axes with 0 dimensions will be
equivalent to the results obtained by adding the corresponding
origin coordinate to the result rectangle along that axis,
similar to the operation of the

add(Point)

method,
but contribute no further dimension beyond that.

If the resulting

Rectangle

would have a dimension
too large to be expressed as an

int

, the result
will have a dimension of

Integer.MAX_VALUE

along
that dimension.

**Parameters:** r

- the specified

Rectangle

- grow

```java
public void grow​(int h,
int v)
```

Resizes the

Rectangle

both horizontally and vertically.

This method modifies the

Rectangle

so that it is

h

units larger on both the left and right side,
and

v

units larger at both the top and bottom.

The new

Rectangle

has

(x - h, y - v)

as its upper-left corner,
width of

(width + 2h)

,
and a height of

(height + 2v)

.

If negative values are supplied for

h

and

v

, the size of the

Rectangle

decreases accordingly.
The

grow

method will check for integer overflow
and underflow, but does not check whether the resulting
values of

width

and

height

grow
from negative to non-negative or shrink from non-negative
to negative.

**Parameters:** h

- the horizontal expansion
**Parameters:** v

- the vertical expansion

public double getX()
```

Returns the X coordinate of the bounding

Rectangle

in

double

precision.

**Specified by:** getX

in class

RectangularShape
**Returns:** the X coordinate of the bounding

Rectangle

.

- getY

```java
public double getY()
```

Returns the Y coordinate of the bounding

Rectangle

in

double

precision.

**Specified by:** getY

in class

RectangularShape
**Returns:** the Y coordinate of the bounding

Rectangle

.

- getWidth

```java
public double getWidth()
```

Returns the width of the bounding

Rectangle

in

double

precision.

**Specified by:** getWidth

in class

RectangularShape
**Returns:** the width of the bounding

Rectangle

.

- getHeight

```java
public double getHeight()
```

Returns the height of the bounding

Rectangle

in

double

precision.

**Specified by:** getHeight

in class

RectangularShape
**Returns:** the height of the bounding

Rectangle

.

- getBounds

```java
public
Rectangle
getBounds()
```

Gets the bounding

Rectangle

of this

Rectangle

.

This method is included for completeness, to parallel the

getBounds

method of

Component

.

**Specified by:** getBounds

in interface

Shape
**Overrides:** getBounds

in class

RectangularShape
**Returns:** a new

Rectangle

, equal to the
bounding

Rectangle

for this

Rectangle

.
**Since:** 1.1
**See Also:** Component.getBounds()

,

setBounds(Rectangle)

,

setBounds(int, int, int, int)

- getBounds2D

```java
public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()
```

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a

point

is inside the

shape

according to the

contains(point)

method, then it must
be inside the returned

Rectangle2D

bounds object according
to the

contains(point)

method of the

bounds

. Specifically:

shape.contains(p)

requires

bounds.contains(p)

If a

point

is not inside the

shape

, then it might
still be contained in the

bounds

object:

bounds.contains(p)

does not imply

shape.contains(p)

**Specified by:** getBounds2D

in interface

Shape
**Overrides:** getBounds2D

in class

Rectangle2D
**Returns:** an instance of

Rectangle2D

that is a
high-precision bounding box of the

```

Computes the union of this

Rectangle

with the
specified

Rectangle

. Returns a new

Rectangle

that
represents the union of the two rectangles.

If either

Rectangle

has any dimension less than zero
the rules for

non-existent

rectangles
apply.
If only one has a dimension less than zero, then the result
will be a copy of the other

Rectangle

.
If both have dimension less than zero, then the result will
have at least one dimension less than zero.

If the resulting

Rectangle

would have a dimension
too large to be expressed as an

int

, the result
will have a dimension of

Integer.MAX_VALUE

along
that dimension.

**Parameters:** r

- the specified

Rectangle
**Returns:** the smallest

Rectangle

containing both
the specified

Rectangle

and this

Rectangle

.

- add

```java
public void add​(int newx,
int newy)
```

Adds a point, specified by the integer arguments

newx,newy

to the bounds of this

Rectangle

.

If this

Rectangle

has any dimension less than zero,
the rules for

non-existent

rectangles apply.
In that case, the new bounds of this

Rectangle

will
have a location equal to the specified coordinates and
width and height equal to zero.

After adding a point, a call to

contains

with the
added point as an argument does not necessarily return

true

. The

contains

method does not
return

true

for points on the right or bottom
edges of a

Rectangle

. Therefore, if the added point
falls on the right or bottom edge of the enlarged

Rectangle

,

contains

returns

false

for that point.
If the specified point must be contained within the new

Rectangle

, a 1x1 rectangle should be added instead:

```java
r.add(newx, newy, 1, 1);
```

**Parameters:** newx

- the X coordinate of the new point
**Parameters:** newy

- the Y coordinate of the new point

- add

```java
public void add​(
Point
pt)
```

Adds the specified

Point

to the bounds of this

Rectangle

.

If this

Rectangle

has any dimension less than zero,
the rules for

non-existent

rectangles apply.
In that case, the new bounds of this

Rectangle

will
have a location equal to the coordinates of the specified

Point

and width and height equal to zero.

After adding a

Point

, a call to

contains

with the added

Point

as an argument does not
necessarily return

true

. The

contains

method does not return

true

for points on the right
or bottom edges of a

Rectangle

. Therefore if the added

Point

falls on the right or bottom edge of the
enlarged

Rectangle

,

contains

returns

false

for that

Point

.
If the specified point must be contained within the new

Rectangle

, a 1x1 rectangle should be added instead:

```java
r.add(pt.x, pt.y, 1, 1);
```

**Parameters:** pt

- the new

Point

to add to this

Rectangle

- add

```java
public void add​(
Rectangle
r)
```

Adds a

Rectangle

to this

Rectangle

.
The resulting

Rectangle

is the union of the two
rectangles.

If either

Rectangle

has any dimension less than 0, the
result will have the dimensions of the other

Rectangle

.
If both

Rectangle

s have at least one dimension less
than 0, the result will have at least one dimension less than 0.

If either

Rectangle

has one or both dimensions equal
to 0, the result along those axes with 0 dimensions will be
equivalent to the results obtained by adding the corresponding
origin coordinate to the result rectangle along that axis,
similar to the operation of the

add(Point)

method,
but contribute no further dimension beyond that.

If the resulting

Rectangle

would have a dimension
too large to be expressed as an

int

, the result
will have a dimension of

Integer.MAX_VALUE

along
that dimension.

**Parameters:** r

- the specified

Rectangle

- grow

```java
public void grow​(int h,
int v)
```

Resizes the

Rectangle

both horizontally and vertically.

This method modifies the

Rectangle

so that it is

h

units larger on both the left and right side,
and

v

units larger at both the top and bottom.

The new

Rectangle

has

(x - h, y - v)

as its upper-left corner,
width of

(width + 2h)

,
and a height of

(height + 2v)

.

If negative values are supplied for

h

and

v

, the size of the

Rectangle

decreases accordingly.
The

grow

method will check for integer overflow
and underflow, but does not check whether the resulting
values of

width

and

height

grow
from negative to non-negative or shrink from non-negative
to negative.

**Parameters:** h

- the horizontal expansion
**Parameters:** v

- the vertical expansion

getBounds2D

```java
public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D()
```

Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
the

Shape

than the

getBounds

method.
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned

Rectangle2D

is the smallest bounding box that encloses
the

Shape

, only that the

Shape

lies
entirely within the indicated

Rectangle2D

. The
bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
returned by the

getBounds

method and never fails due
to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
the

Rectangle2D

that uses double precision values to
store the dimensions.

Note that the

definition of insideness

can lead to situations where points
on the defining outline of the

shape

may not be considered
contained in the returned

bounds

object, but only in cases
where those points are also not considered contained in the original

shape

.

If a
