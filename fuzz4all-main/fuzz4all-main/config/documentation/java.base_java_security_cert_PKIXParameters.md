# Class PKIXParameters

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\cert\PKIXParameters.html`

### Class Description

```java
public class
PKIXParameters

extends
Object

implements
CertPathParameters
```

Parameters used as input for the PKIX

CertPathValidator

algorithm.

A PKIX

CertPathValidator

uses these parameters to
validate a

CertPath

according to the PKIX certification path
validation algorithm.

To instantiate a

PKIXParameters

object, an
application must specify one or more

most-trusted CAs

as defined by
the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. The most-trusted CAs
can be specified using one of two constructors. An application
can call

PKIXParameters(Set)

,
specifying a

Set

of

TrustAnchor

objects, each
of which identify a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call

PKIXParameters(KeyStore)

, specifying a

KeyStore

instance containing trusted certificate entries, each
of which will be considered as a most-trusted CA.

Once a

PKIXParameters

object has been created, other parameters
can be specified (by calling

setInitialPolicies

or

setDate

, for instance) and then the

PKIXParameters

is passed along with the

CertPath

to be validated to

CertPathValidator.validate

.

Any parameter that is not set (or is set to

null

) will
be set to the default value for that parameter. The default value for the

date

parameter is

null

, which indicates
the current time when the path is validated. The default for the
remaining parameters is the least constrained.

Concurrent Access

Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
separate objects need not synchronize.

**All Implemented Interfaces:** Cloneable

<
TrustAnchor
> trustAnchors)
throws
InvalidAlgorithmParameterException

Sets the

Set

of most-trusted CAs.

Note that the

Set

is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- trustAnchors

- a

Set

of

TrustAnchor

s

are not of type

java.security.cert.TrustAnchor

**See Also:**
- getTrustAnchors()

---

#### public
Set
<
String
> getInitialPolicies()

Returns an immutable

Set

of initial
policy identifiers (OID strings), indicating that any one of these
policies would be acceptable to the certificate user for the purposes of
certification path processing. The default return value is an empty

Set

, which is interpreted as meaning that any policy would
be acceptable.

**Returns:**
- an immutable

Set

of initial policy OIDs in

String

format, or an empty

Set

(implying any
policy is acceptable). Never returns

null

.

**See Also:**
- setInitialPolicies(java.util.Set<java.lang.String>)

---

#### public void setInitialPolicies​(
Set
<
String
> initialPolicies)

Sets the

Set

of initial policy identifiers
(OID strings), indicating that any one of these
policies would be acceptable to the certificate user for the purposes of
certification path processing. By default, any policy is acceptable
(i.e. all policies), so a user that wants to allow any policy as
acceptable does not need to call this method, or can call it
with an empty

Set

(or

null

).

Note that the

Set

is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- initialPolicies

- a

Set

of initial policy
OIDs in

String

format (or

null

)

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if any of the elements in the set are
not of type

String

**See Also:**
- getInitialPolicies()

---

#### public void setCertStores​(
List
<
CertStore
> stores)

Sets the list of

CertStore

s to be used in finding
certificates and CRLs. May be

null

, in which case
no

CertStore

s will be used. The first

CertStore

s in the list may be preferred to those that
appear later.

Note that the

List

is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- stores

- a

List

of

CertStore

s (or

null

)

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if any of the elements in the list are
not of type

java.security.cert.CertStore

**See Also:**
- getCertStores()

---

#### public void addCertStore​(
CertStore
store)

Adds a

CertStore

to the end of the list of

CertStore

s used in finding certificates and CRLs.

**Parameters:**
- store

- the

CertStore

to add. If

null

,
the store is ignored (not added to list).

---

#### public
List
<
CertStore
> getCertStores()

Returns an immutable

List

of

CertStore

s that
are used to find certificates and CRLs.

**Returns:**
- an immutable

List

of

CertStore

s
(may be empty, but never

null

)

**See Also:**
- setCertStores(java.util.List<java.security.cert.CertStore>)

---

#### public void setRevocationEnabled​(boolean val)

Sets the RevocationEnabled flag. If this flag is true, the default
revocation checking mechanism of the underlying PKIX service provider
will be used. If this flag is false, the default revocation checking
mechanism will be disabled (not used).

When a

PKIXParameters

object is created, this flag is set
to true. This setting reflects the most common strategy for checking
revocation, since each service provider must support revocation
checking to be PKIX compliant. Sophisticated applications should set
this flag to false when it is not practical to use a PKIX service
provider's default revocation checking mechanism or when an alternative
revocation checking mechanism is to be substituted (by also calling the

addCertPathChecker

or

setCertPathCheckers

methods).

**Parameters:**
- val

- the new value of the RevocationEnabled flag

---

#### public boolean isRevocationEnabled()

Checks the RevocationEnabled flag. If this flag is true, the default
revocation checking mechanism of the underlying PKIX service provider
will be used. If this flag is false, the default revocation checking
mechanism will be disabled (not used). See the

setRevocationEnabled

method for more details on
setting the value of this flag.

**Returns:**
- the current value of the RevocationEnabled flag

---

#### public void setExplicitPolicyRequired​(boolean val)

Sets the ExplicitPolicyRequired flag. If this flag is true, an
acceptable policy needs to be explicitly identified in every certificate.
By default, the ExplicitPolicyRequired flag is false.

**Parameters:**
- val

-

true

if explicit policy is to be required,

false

otherwise

---

#### public boolean isExplicitPolicyRequired()

Checks if explicit policy is required. If this flag is true, an
acceptable policy needs to be explicitly identified in every certificate.
By default, the ExplicitPolicyRequired flag is false.

**Returns:**
- true

if explicit policy is required,

false

otherwise

---

#### public void setPolicyMappingInhibited​(boolean val)

Sets the PolicyMappingInhibited flag. If this flag is true, policy
mapping is inhibited. By default, policy mapping is not inhibited (the
flag is false).

**Parameters:**
- val

-

true

if policy mapping is to be inhibited,

false

otherwise

---

#### public boolean isPolicyMappingInhibited()

Checks if policy mapping is inhibited. If this flag is true, policy
mapping is inhibited. By default, policy mapping is not inhibited (the
flag is false).

**Returns:**
- true if policy mapping is inhibited, false otherwise

---

#### public void setAnyPolicyInhibited​(boolean val)

Sets state to determine if the any policy OID should be processed
if it is included in a certificate. By default, the any policy OID
is not inhibited (

isAnyPolicyInhibited()

returns

false

).

**Parameters:**
- val

-

true

if the any policy OID is to be
inhibited,

false

otherwise

---

#### public boolean isAnyPolicyInhibited()

Checks whether the any policy OID should be processed if it
is included in a certificate.

**Returns:**
- true

if the any policy OID is inhibited,

false

otherwise

---

#### public void setPolicyQualifiersRejected​(boolean qualifiersRejected)

Sets the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag. If this flag is true,
certificates that include policy qualifiers in a certificate
policies extension that is marked critical are rejected.
If the flag is false, certificates are not rejected on this basis.

When a

PKIXParameters

object is created, this flag is
set to true. This setting reflects the most common (and simplest)
strategy for processing policy qualifiers. Applications that want to use
a more sophisticated policy must set this flag to false.

Note that the PKIX certification path validation algorithm specifies
that any policy qualifier in a certificate policies extension that is
marked critical must be processed and validated. Otherwise the
certification path must be rejected. If the policyQualifiersRejected flag
is set to false, it is up to the application to validate all policy
qualifiers in this manner in order to be PKIX compliant.

**Parameters:**
- qualifiersRejected

- the new value of the PolicyQualifiersRejected
flag

**See Also:**
- getPolicyQualifiersRejected()

,

PolicyQualifierInfo

---

#### public boolean getPolicyQualifiersRejected()

Gets the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag. If this flag is true,
certificates that include policy qualifiers in a certificate policies
extension that is marked critical are rejected.
If the flag is false, certificates are not rejected on this basis.

When a

PKIXParameters

object is created, this flag is
set to true. This setting reflects the most common (and simplest)
strategy for processing policy qualifiers. Applications that want to use
a more sophisticated policy must set this flag to false.

**Returns:**
- the current value of the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag

**See Also:**
- setPolicyQualifiersRejected(boolean)

---

#### public
Date
getDate()

Returns the time for which the validity of the certification path
should be determined. If

null

, the current time is used.

Note that the

Date

returned is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Returns:**
- the

Date

, or

null

if not set

**See Also:**
- setDate(java.util.Date)

---

#### public void setDate​(
Date
date)

Sets the time for which the validity of the certification path
should be determined. If

null

, the current time is used.

Note that the

Date

supplied here is copied to protect
against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- date

- the

Date

, or

null

for the
current time

**See Also:**
- getDate()

---

#### public void setCertPathCheckers​(
List
<
PKIXCertPathChecker
> checkers)

Sets a

List

of additional certification path checkers. If
the specified

List

contains an object that is not a

PKIXCertPathChecker

, it is ignored.

Each

PKIXCertPathChecker

specified implements
additional checks on a certificate. Typically, these are checks to
process and verify private extensions contained in certificates.
Each

PKIXCertPathChecker

should be instantiated with any
initialization parameters needed to execute the check.

This method allows sophisticated applications to extend a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

.
Each of the specified

PKIXCertPathChecker

s will be called,
in turn, by a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

for each certificate processed or
validated.

Regardless of whether these additional

PKIXCertPathChecker

s
are set, a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

must perform all of the required PKIX
checks on each certificate. The one exception to this rule is if the
RevocationEnabled flag is set to false (see the

setRevocationEnabled

method).

Note that the

List

supplied here is copied and each

PKIXCertPathChecker

in the list is cloned to protect
against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:**
- checkers

- a

List

of

PKIXCertPathChecker

s.
May be

null

, in which case no additional checkers will be
used.

**Throws:**
- ClassCastException

- if any of the elements in the list
are not of type

java.security.cert.PKIXCertPathChecker

**See Also:**
- getCertPathCheckers()

---

#### public
List
<
PKIXCertPathChecker

Parameters used as input for the PKIX

CertPathValidator

algorithm.

A PKIX

CertPathValidator

uses these parameters to
validate a

CertPath

according to the PKIX certification path
validation algorithm.

To instantiate a

PKIXParameters

object, an
application must specify one or more

most-trusted CAs

as defined by
the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. The most-trusted CAs
can be specified using one of two constructors. An application
can call

PKIXParameters(Set)

,
specifying a

Set

of

TrustAnchor

objects, each
of which identify a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call

PKIXParameters(KeyStore)

, specifying a

KeyStore

instance containing trusted certificate entries, each
of which will be considered as a most-trusted CA.

Once a

PKIXParameters

object has been created, other parameters
can be specified (by calling

setInitialPolicies

or

setDate

, for instance) and then the

PKIXParameters

is passed along with the

CertPath

to be validated to

CertPathValidator.validate

.

Any parameter that is not set (or is set to

null

) will
be set to the default value for that parameter. The default value for the

date

parameter is

null

, which indicates
the current time when the path is validated. The default for the
remaining parameters is the least constrained.

Concurrent Access

Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
separate objects need not synchronize.

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getTrustAnchors

```java
public
Set
<
TrustAnchor
> getTrustAnchors()
```

Returns an immutable

Set

of the most-trusted
CAs.

**Returns:** an immutable

Set

of

TrustAnchor

s
(never

null

)
**See Also:** setTrustAnchors(java.util.Set<java.security.cert.TrustAnchor>)

- setTrustAnchors

```java

throws
InvalidAlgorithmParameterException
```

Sets the

Set

of most-trusted CAs.

Note that the

Set

is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

java.security.cert.TrustAnchor
**See Also:** getTrustAnchors()

- getInitialPolicies

```java
public
Set
<
String
> getInitialPolicies()
```

Returns an immutable

Set

of initial
policy identifiers (OID strings), indicating that any one of these
policies would be acceptable to the certificate user for the purposes of
certification path processing. The default return value is an empty

Set

, which is interpreted as meaning that any policy would
be acceptable.

**Returns:** an immutable

Set

of initial policy OIDs in

String

format, or an empty

Set

(implying any
policy is acceptable). Never returns

null

.
**See Also:** setInitialPolicies(java.util.Set<java.lang.String>)

- setInitialPolicies

```java
public void setInitialPolicies​(
Set
<
String
> initialPolicies)
```

Sets the

Set

of initial policy identifiers
(OID strings), indicating that any one of these
policies would be acceptable to the certificate user for the purposes of
certification path processing. By default, any policy is acceptable
(i.e. all policies), so a user that wants to allow any policy as
acceptable does not need to call this method, or can call it
with an empty

Set

(or

null

).

Note that the

Set

is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** initialPolicies

- a

Set

of initial policy
OIDs in

String

format (or

null

)
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if any of the elements in the set are
not of type

String
**See Also:** getInitialPolicies()

- setCertStores

```java
public void setCertStores​(
List
<
CertStore
> stores)
```

Sets the list of

CertStore

s to be used in finding
certificates and CRLs. May be

null

, in which case
no

CertStore

s will be used. The first

CertStore

s in the list may be preferred to those that
appear later.

Note that the

List

is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** stores

- a

List

of

CertStore

s (or

null

)
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if any of the elements in the list are
not of type

java.security.cert.CertStore
**See Also:** getCertStores()

- addCertStore

```java
public void addCertStore​(
CertStore
store)
```

Adds a

CertStore

to the end of the list of

CertStore

s used in finding certificates and CRLs.

public
List
<
CertStore
> getCertStores()
```

Returns an immutable

List

of

CertStore

s that
are used to find certificates and CRLs.

**Returns:** an immutable

List

of

CertStore

s
(may be empty, but never

null

)
**See Also:** setCertStores(java.util.List<java.security.cert.CertStore>)

- setRevocationEnabled

```java
public void setRevocationEnabled​(boolean val)
```

Sets the RevocationEnabled flag. If this flag is true, the default
revocation checking mechanism of the underlying PKIX service provider
will be used. If this flag is false, the default revocation checking
mechanism will be disabled (not used).

When a

PKIXParameters

object is created, this flag is set
to true. This setting reflects the most common strategy for checking
revocation, since each service provider must support revocation
checking to be PKIX compliant. Sophisticated applications should set
this flag to false when it is not practical to use a PKIX service
provider's default revocation checking mechanism or when an alternative
revocation checking mechanism is to be substituted (by also calling the

addCertPathChecker

or

setCertPathCheckers

methods).

**Parameters:** val

- the new value of the RevocationEnabled flag

- isRevocationEnabled

```java
public boolean isRevocationEnabled()
```

Checks the RevocationEnabled flag. If this flag is true, the default
revocation checking mechanism of the underlying PKIX service provider
will be used. If this flag is false, the default revocation checking
mechanism will be disabled (not used). See the

setRevocationEnabled

method for more details on
setting the value of this flag.

**Returns:** the current value of the RevocationEnabled flag

- setExplicitPolicyRequired

```java
public void setExplicitPolicyRequired​(boolean val)
```

Sets the ExplicitPolicyRequired flag. If this flag is true, an
acceptable policy needs to be explicitly identified in every certificate.
By default, the ExplicitPolicyRequired flag is false.

**Parameters:** val

-

true

if explicit policy is to be required,

false

otherwise

- isExplicitPolicyRequired

```java
public boolean isExplicitPolicyRequired()
```

Checks if explicit policy is required. If this flag is true, an
acceptable policy needs to be explicitly identified in every certificate.
By default, the ExplicitPolicyRequired flag is false.

**Returns:** true

if explicit policy is required,

false

otherwise

- setPolicyMappingInhibited

```java
public void setPolicyMappingInhibited​(boolean val)
```

Sets the PolicyMappingInhibited flag. If this flag is true, policy
mapping is inhibited. By default, policy mapping is not inhibited (the
flag is false).

**Parameters:** val

-

true

if policy mapping is to be inhibited,

false

otherwise

- isPolicyMappingInhibited

```java
public boolean isPolicyMappingInhibited()
```

Checks if policy mapping is inhibited. If this flag is true, policy
mapping is inhibited. By default, policy mapping is not inhibited (the
flag is false).

**Returns:** true if policy mapping is inhibited, false otherwise

- setAnyPolicyInhibited

```java
public void setAnyPolicyInhibited​(boolean val)
```

Sets state to determine if the any policy OID should be processed
if it is included in a certificate. By default, the any policy OID
is not inhibited (

isAnyPolicyInhibited()

returns

false

).

**Parameters:** val

-

true

if the any policy OID is to be
inhibited,

false

otherwise

- isAnyPolicyInhibited

```java
public boolean isAnyPolicyInhibited()
```

Checks whether the any policy OID should be processed if it
is included in a certificate.

**Returns:** true

if the any policy OID is inhibited,

false

otherwise

- setPolicyQualifiersRejected

```java
public void setPolicyQualifiersRejected​(boolean qualifiersRejected)
```

Sets the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag. If this flag is true,
certificates that include policy qualifiers in a certificate
policies extension that is marked critical are rejected.
If the flag is false, certificates are not rejected on this basis.

When a

PKIXParameters

object is created, this flag is
set to true. This setting reflects the most common (and simplest)
strategy for processing policy qualifiers. Applications that want to use
a more sophisticated policy must set this flag to false.

Note that the PKIX certification path validation algorithm specifies
that any policy qualifier in a certificate policies extension that is
marked critical must be processed and validated. Otherwise the
certification path must be rejected. If the policyQualifiersRejected flag
is set to false, it is up to the application to validate all policy
qualifiers in this manner in order to be PKIX compliant.

**Parameters:** qualifiersRejected

- the new value of the PolicyQualifiersRejected
flag
**See Also:** getPolicyQualifiersRejected()

,

PolicyQualifierInfo

- getPolicyQualifiersRejected

```java
public boolean getPolicyQualifiersRejected()
```

Gets the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag. If this flag is true,
certificates that include policy qualifiers in a certificate policies
extension that is marked critical are rejected.
If the flag is false, certificates are not rejected on this basis.

When a

PKIXParameters

object is created, this flag is
set to true. This setting reflects the most common (and simplest)
strategy for processing policy qualifiers. Applications that want to use
a more sophisticated policy must set this flag to false.

**Returns:** the current value of the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag
**See Also:** setPolicyQualifiersRejected(boolean)

- getDate

```java
public
Date
getDate()
```

Returns the time for which the validity of the certification path
should be determined. If

null

, the current time is used.

Note that the

Date

returned is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Returns:** the

Date

, or

null

if not set
**See Also:** setDate(java.util.Date)

- setDate

```java
public void setDate​(
Date
date)
```

Sets the time for which the validity of the certification path
should be determined. If

null

, the current time is used.

Note that the

Date

supplied here is copied to protect
against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** date

- the

Date

, or

null

for the
current time
**See Also:** getDate()

- setCertPathCheckers

```java
public void setCertPathCheckers​(
List
<
PKIXCertPathChecker
> checkers)
```

Sets a

List

of additional certification path checkers. If
the specified

List

contains an object that is not a

PKIXCertPathChecker

, it is ignored.

Each

PKIXCertPathChecker

specified implements
additional checks on a certificate. Typically, these are checks to
process and verify private extensions contained in certificates.
Each

PKIXCertPathChecker

should be instantiated with any
initialization parameters needed to execute the check.

This method allows sophisticated applications to extend a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

.
Each of the specified

PKIXCertPathChecker

s will be called,
in turn, by a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

for each certificate processed or
validated.

Regardless of whether these additional

PKIXCertPathChecker

s
are set, a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

must perform all of the required PKIX
checks on each certificate. The one exception to this rule is if the
RevocationEnabled flag is set to false (see the

setRevocationEnabled

method).

Note that the

List

supplied here is copied and each

PKIXCertPathChecker

in the list is cloned to protect
against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** checkers

- a

List

of

PKIXCertPathChecker

s.
May be

null

, in which case no additional checkers will be
used.
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if any of the elements in the list
are not of type

java.security.cert.PKIXCertPathChecker
**See Also:** getCertPathCheckers()

- getCertPathCheckers

```java
public
List
<
PKIXCertPathChecker
> getCertPathCheckers()

List

of certification path checkers.
The returned

List

is immutable, and each

PKIXCertPathChecker

in the

List

is cloned
to protect against subsequent modifications.

```

Returns an immutable

Set

of initial
policy identifiers (OID strings), indicating that any one of these
policies would be acceptable to the certificate user for the purposes of
certification path processing. The default return value is an empty

Set

, which is interpreted as meaning that any policy would
be acceptable.

.
**See Also:** setInitialPolicies(java.util.Set<java.lang.String>)

- setInitialPolicies

```java
public void setInitialPolicies​(
Set
<
String
> initialPolicies)
```

Sets the

Set

of initial policy identifiers
(OID strings), indicating that any one of these
policies would be acceptable to the certificate user for the purposes of
certification path processing. By default, any policy is acceptable
(i.e. all policies), so a user that wants to allow any policy as
acceptable does not need to call this method, or can call it
with an empty

Set

(or

null

).

Note that the

Set

is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** initialPolicies

- a

Set

of initial policy
OIDs in

String

format (or

null

)
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if any of the elements in the set are
not of type

String

CertStore

s to be used in finding
certificates and CRLs. May be

null

, in which case
no

CertStore

s will be used. The first

CertStore

s in the list may be preferred to those that
appear later.

Note that the

List

is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** stores

- a

List

of

CertStore

s (or

- setRevocationEnabled

```java
public void setRevocationEnabled​(boolean val)
```

Sets the RevocationEnabled flag. If this flag is true, the default
revocation checking mechanism of the underlying PKIX service provider
will be used. If this flag is false, the default revocation checking
mechanism will be disabled (not used).

When a

PKIXParameters

object is created, this flag is set
to true. This setting reflects the most common strategy for checking
revocation, since each service provider must support revocation
checking to be PKIX compliant. Sophisticated applications should set
this flag to false when it is not practical to use a PKIX service
provider's default revocation checking mechanism or when an alternative
revocation checking mechanism is to be substituted (by also calling the

addCertPathChecker

or

setCertPathCheckers

methods).

**Parameters:** val

- the new value of the RevocationEnabled flag

- isRevocationEnabled

```java
public boolean isRevocationEnabled()
```

Checks the RevocationEnabled flag. If this flag is true, the default
revocation checking mechanism of the underlying PKIX service provider
will be used. If this flag is false, the default revocation checking
mechanism will be disabled (not used). See the

setRevocationEnabled

method for more details on
setting the value of this flag.

**Returns:** the current value of the RevocationEnabled flag

- setExplicitPolicyRequired

```java
public void setExplicitPolicyRequired​(boolean val)
```

Sets the ExplicitPolicyRequired flag. If this flag is true, an
acceptable policy needs to be explicitly identified in every certificate.
By default, the ExplicitPolicyRequired flag is false.

**Parameters:** val

-

true

if explicit policy is to be required,

false

otherwise

- isExplicitPolicyRequired

```java
public boolean isExplicitPolicyRequired()
```

Checks if explicit policy is required. If this flag is true, an
acceptable policy needs to be explicitly identified in every certificate.
By default, the ExplicitPolicyRequired flag is false.

**Returns:** true

if explicit policy is required,

false

otherwise

- setPolicyMappingInhibited

```java
public void setPolicyMappingInhibited​(boolean val)
```

Sets the PolicyMappingInhibited flag. If this flag is true, policy
mapping is inhibited. By default, policy mapping is not inhibited (the

**Parameters:** val

-

true

if policy mapping is to be inhibited,

false

otherwise

- isPolicyMappingInhibited

```java
public boolean isPolicyMappingInhibited()
```

Checks if policy mapping is inhibited. If this flag is true, policy
mapping is inhibited. By default, policy mapping is not inhibited (the
flag is false).

**Returns:** true if policy mapping is inhibited, false otherwise

- setAnyPolicyInhibited

```java
public void setAnyPolicyInhibited​(boolean val)
```

Sets state to determine if the any policy OID should be processed
if it is included in a certificate. By default, the any policy OID
is not inhibited (

isAnyPolicyInhibited()

returns

false

).

**Parameters:** val

-

true

if the any policy OID is to be
inhibited,

false

otherwise

- isAnyPolicyInhibited

```java
public boolean isAnyPolicyInhibited()
```

Checks whether the any policy OID should be processed if it
is included in a certificate.

**Returns:** true

if the any policy OID is inhibited,

false

otherwise

- setPolicyQualifiersRejected

```java
public void setPolicyQualifiersRejected​(boolean qualifiersRejected)
```

Sets the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag. If this flag is true,
certificates that include policy qualifiers in a certificate
policies extension that is marked critical are rejected.
If the flag is false, certificates are not rejected on this basis.

When a

PKIXParameters

object is created, this flag is
set to true. This setting reflects the most common (and simplest)
strategy for processing policy qualifiers. Applications that want to use
a more sophisticated policy must set this flag to false.

Note that the PKIX certification path validation algorithm specifies
that any policy qualifier in a certificate policies extension that is
marked critical must be processed and validated. Otherwise the
certification path must be rejected. If the policyQualifiersRejected flag
is set to false, it is up to the application to validate all policy
qualifiers in this manner in order to be PKIX compliant.

**Parameters:** qualifiersRejected

- the new value of the PolicyQualifiersRejected
flag
**See Also:** getPolicyQualifiersRejected()

,

PolicyQualifierInfo

- getPolicyQualifiersRejected

```java
public boolean getPolicyQualifiersRejected()
```

Gets the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag. If this flag is true,
certificates that include policy qualifiers in a certificate policies
extension that is marked critical are rejected.
If the flag is false, certificates are not rejected on this basis.

When a

PKIXParameters

object is created, this flag is
set to true. This setting reflects the most common (and simplest)
strategy for processing policy qualifiers. Applications that want to use
a more sophisticated policy must set this flag to false.

**Returns:** the current value of the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag
**See Also:** setPolicyQualifiersRejected(boolean)

- getDate

```java
public
Date
getDate()
```

Returns the time for which the validity of the certification path
should be determined. If

null

, the current time is used.

Note that the

Date

returned is copied to protect against
subsequent modifications.

**Returns:** the

Date

, or

null

if not set
**See Also:** setDate(java.util.Date)

- setDate

```java
public void setDate​(

, or

null

for the
current time
**See Also:** getDate()

- setCertPathCheckers

```java
public void setCertPathCheckers​(
List
<
PKIXCertPathChecker
> checkers)
```

Sets a

List

of additional certification path checkers. If
the specified

List

contains an object that is not a

PKIXCertPathChecker

, it is ignored.

Each

PKIXCertPathChecker

specified implements
additional checks on a certificate. Typically, these are checks to
process and verify private extensions contained in certificates.
Each

PKIXCertPathChecker

should be instantiated with any
initialization parameters needed to execute the check.

This method allows sophisticated applications to extend a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

.
Each of the specified

PKIXCertPathChecker

s will be called,
in turn, by a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

for each certificate processed or
validated.

Regardless of whether these additional

PKIXCertPathChecker

s
are set, a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

must perform all of the required PKIX
checks on each certificate. The one exception to this rule is if the
RevocationEnabled flag is set to false (see the

setRevocationEnabled

method).

Note that the

List

supplied here is copied and each

PKIXCertPathChecker

in the list is cloned to protect
against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** checkers

- a

List

of

PKIXCertPathChecker

s.
May be

null

, in which case no additional checkers will be
used.

**Returns:** the current value of the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag
**See Also:** setPolicyQualifiersRejected(boolean)

---

#### getPolicyQualifiersRejected

public boolean getPolicyQualifiersRejected()

Gets the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag. If this flag is true,
certificates that include policy qualifiers in a certificate policies
extension that is marked critical are rejected.
If the flag is false, certificates are not rejected on this basis.

When a

PKIXParameters

object is created, this flag is
set to true. This setting reflects the most common (and simplest)
strategy for processing policy qualifiers. Applications that want to use
a more sophisticated policy must set this flag to false.

setCertPathCheckers

```java
public void setCertPathCheckers​(
List
<
PKIXCertPathChecker
> checkers)
```

Sets a

List

of additional certification path checkers. If
the specified

List

contains an object that is not a

PKIXCertPathChecker

, it is ignored.

Each

PKIXCertPathChecker

specified implements
additional checks on a certificate. Typically, these are checks to
process and verify private extensions contained in certificates.
Each

PKIXCertPathChecker

should be instantiated with any
initialization parameters needed to execute the check.

This method allows sophisticated applications to extend a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

.
Each of the specified

PKIXCertPathChecker

s will be called,
in turn, by a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

for each certificate processed or
validated.

Regardless of whether these additional

PKIXCertPathChecker

s
are set, a PKIX

CertPathValidator

or

CertPathBuilder

must perform all of the required PKIX
checks on each certificate. The one exception to this rule is if the
RevocationEnabled flag is set to false (see the

setRevocationEnabled

method).

Note that the

List

supplied here is copied and each

PKIXCertPathChecker

in the list is cloned to protect
against subsequent modifications.

**Parameters:** checkers

- a

List

of

PKIXCertPathChecker

s.
May be

null

, in which case no additional checkers will be
used.
**Throws:** ClassCastException

- if any of the elements in the list
are not of type
