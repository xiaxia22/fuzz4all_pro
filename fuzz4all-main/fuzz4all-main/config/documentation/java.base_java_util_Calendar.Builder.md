# Class Calendar.Builder

**Source:** `java.base\java\util\Calendar.Builder.html`

### Class Description

```java
public static class
Calendar.Builder

extends
Object
```

Calendar.Builder

is used for creating a

Calendar

from
various date-time parameters.

There are two ways to set a

Calendar

to a date-time value. One
is to set the instant parameter to a millisecond offset from the

Epoch

. The other is to set individual
field parameters, such as

YEAR

, to their desired
values. These two ways can't be mixed. Trying to set both the instant and
individual fields will cause an

IllegalStateException

to be
thrown. However, it is permitted to override previous values of the
instant or field parameters.

If no enough field parameters are given for determining date and/or
time, calendar specific default values are used when building a

Calendar

. For example, if the

YEAR

value
isn't given for the Gregorian calendar, 1970 will be used. If there are
any conflicts among field parameters, the

resolution rules

are applied.
Therefore, the order of field setting matters.

In addition to the date-time parameters,
the

locale

,

time zone

,

week definition

, and

leniency mode

parameters can be set.

Examples

The following are sample usages. Sample code assumes that the

Calendar

constants are statically imported.

The following code produces a

Calendar

with date 2012-12-31
(Gregorian) because Monday is the first day of a week with the

ISO 8601
compatible week parameters

.

```java
Calendar cal = new Calendar.Builder().setCalendarType("iso8601")
.setWeekDate(2013, 1, MONDAY).build();
```

The following code produces a Japanese

Calendar

with date
1989-01-08 (Gregorian), assuming that the default

ERA

is

Heisei

that started on that day.

```java
Calendar cal = new Calendar.Builder().setCalendarType("japanese")
.setFields(YEAR, 1, DAY_OF_YEAR, 1).build();
```

instant

value that is
a millisecond offset from

the
Epoch

.

**Parameters:**

#### public
Calendar.Builder
setInstant​(
Date
instant)

Sets the instant parameter to the

parameter to the given

value

.

field

is an index to the

Calendar.fields

, such as

used to determine the

first
week

of a year. The parameters given by this method have
precedence over the default values given by the

locale

.

**Parameters:**
- firstDayOfWeek

---

#### public
Calendar
build()

Returns a

Calendar

built from the parameters set by the
setter methods. The calendar type given by the

setCalendarType

method or the

locale

is
used to determine what

Calendar

to be created. If no explicit
calendar type is given, the locale's default calendar is created.

If the calendar type is

"iso8601"

, the

Gregorian change date

of a

GregorianCalendar

is set to

Date(Long.MIN_VALUE)

to be the

proleptic

Gregorian calendar. Its week definition
parameters are also set to be

compatible
with the ISO 8601 standard

. Note that the

getCalendarType

method of
a

GregorianCalendar

created with

"iso8601"

returns

"gregory"

.

The default values are used for locale and time zone if these
parameters haven't been given explicitly.

If the locale contains the time zone with "tz"

Unicode extension

,
and time zone hasn't been given explicitly, time zone in the locale
is used.

Any out of range field values are either normalized in lenient
mode or detected as an invalid value in non-lenient mode.

**Returns:**
- a

Calendar

built with parameters of this

Calendar.Builder

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the calendar type is unknown, or
if any invalid field values are given in non-lenient mode, or
if a week date is given for the calendar type that doesn't
support week dates.

**Enclosing class:** Calendar

```java
public static class
Calendar.Builder

extends
Object
```

Calendar.Builder

is used for creating a

Calendar

from
various date-time parameters.

There are two ways to set a

Calendar

to a date-time value. One
is to set the instant parameter to a millisecond offset from the

Epoch

. The other is to set individual
field parameters, such as

YEAR

, to their desired
values. These two ways can't be mixed. Trying to set both the instant and
individual fields will cause an

IllegalStateException

to be
thrown. However, it is permitted to override previous values of the
instant or field parameters.

If no enough field parameters are given for determining date and/or
time, calendar specific default values are used when building a

Calendar

. For example, if the

YEAR

value
isn't given for the Gregorian calendar, 1970 will be used. If there are
any conflicts among field parameters, the

resolution rules

are applied.
Therefore, the order of field setting matters.

In addition to the date-time parameters,
the

locale

,

time zone

,

week definition

, and

leniency mode

parameters can be set.

Examples

The following are sample usages. Sample code assumes that the

Calendar

constants are statically imported.

The following code produces a

Calendar

with date 2012-12-31
(Gregorian) because Monday is the first day of a week with the

ISO 8601
compatible week parameters

.

```java
Calendar cal = new Calendar.Builder().setCalendarType("iso8601")
.setWeekDate(2013, 1, MONDAY).build();
```

The following code produces a Japanese

Calendar

with date
1989-01-08 (Gregorian), assuming that the default

ERA

is

Heisei

that started on that day.

```java
Calendar cal = new Calendar.Builder().setCalendarType("japanese")

- build

```java
public
Calendar
build()
```

Returns a

Calendar

built from the parameters set by the
setter methods. The calendar type given by the

setCalendarType

method or the

locale

is
used to determine what

Calendar

to be created. If no explicit
calendar type is given, the locale's default calendar is created.

If the calendar type is

"iso8601"

, the

Gregorian change date

of a

GregorianCalendar

is set to

Date(Long.MIN_VALUE)

to be the

proleptic

Gregorian calendar. Its week definition
parameters are also set to be

compatible
with the ISO 8601 standard

. Note that the

getCalendarType

method of
a

GregorianCalendar

created with

"iso8601"

returns

"gregory"

.

The default values are used for locale and time zone if these
parameters haven't been given explicitly.

If the locale contains the time zone with "tz"

Unicode extension

,
and time zone hasn't been given explicitly, time zone in the locale
is used.

Any out of range field values are either normalized in lenient
mode or detected as an invalid value in non-lenient mode.

**Returns:** a

Calendar

built with parameters of this

Calendar.Builder
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the calendar type is unknown, or
if any invalid field values are given in non-lenient mode, or
if a week date is given for the calendar type that doesn't
support week dates.

normalized in lenient mode or detected as an invalid value in
non-lenient mode when building a

Calendar

.

setFields

```java
public
Calendar.Builder
setFields​(int... fieldValuePairs)
```

Sets field parameters to their values given by

fieldValuePairs

that are pairs of a field and its value.
For example,

```java
setFields(Calendar.YEAR, 2013,
Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.DECEMBER,
Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 23);
```

is equivalent to the sequence of the following

set

calls:

```java
set(Calendar.YEAR, 2013)
.set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.DECEMBER)
.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 23);
```

**Parameters:** fieldValuePairs

- field-value pairs
**Returns:** this

Calendar.Builder
**Throws:** NullPointerException

- if

fieldValuePairs

is

null
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if any of fields are invalid,
or if

fieldValuePairs.length

is an odd number.
**Throws:** IllegalStateException

- if the instant value has been set,
or if fields have been set too many (approximately

Integer.MAX_VALUE

) times.
