# Interface Temporal

**Source:** `java.base\java\time\temporal\Temporal.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
Temporal

extends
TemporalAccessor
```

Framework-level interface defining read-write access to a temporal object,
such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.

This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects that
are complete enough to be manipulated using plus and minus.
It is implemented by those classes that can provide and manipulate information
as

fields

or

queries

.
See

TemporalAccessor

for the read-only version of this interface.

Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
These are modeled using

TemporalField

with the number held using
a

long

to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
See

ChronoField

for the standard set of fields.

Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
the

chronology

and the

time-zone

.
These can be accessed via

queries

using
the static methods defined on

TemporalQuery

.

This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
around instances of concrete types, such as

LocalDate

.
There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
See

ChronoLocalDate

for a fuller discussion of the issues.

When to implement

A class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:

- it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per

TemporalAccessor

the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest

the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the
valid range of values for the fields that are represented

Four examples make this clear:

- LocalDate

implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine
the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.

LocalTime

implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine
validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.

MonthDay

, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement
this interface. While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,
the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values
for day-of-month. As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.

The combination day-of-week and day-of-month ("Friday the 13th") should not implement
this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps
days to months.

### Method Details

#### boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

**Parameters:**
- unit

- the unit to check, null returns false

**Returns:**
- true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must check and handle all units defined in

ChronoUnit

.
If the unit is supported, then true must be returned, otherwise false must be returned.

If the field is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.

---

#### default
Temporal
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Parameters:**
- adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must not alter either this object or the specified temporal object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
return adjuster.adjustInto(this);
```

---

#### Temporal
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Parameters:**
- field

- the field to set in the result, not null
- newValue

- the new value of the field in the result

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in

ChronoField

.
If the field is supported, then the adjustment must be performed.
If unsupported, then an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the first argument.

Implementations must not alter this object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

---

#### default
Temporal
plus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Parameters:**
- amount

- the amount to add, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the addition cannot be made
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must not alter either this object or the specified temporal object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
return amount.addTo(this);
```

---

#### Temporal
plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Parameters:**
- amountToAdd

- the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
- unit

- the unit of the amount to add, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be added
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must check and handle all units defined in

ChronoUnit

.
If the unit is supported, then the addition must be performed.
If unsupported, then an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the first argument.

Implementations must not alter this object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

---

#### default
Temporal
minus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Parameters:**
- amount

- the amount to subtract, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the subtraction cannot be made
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must not alter either this object or the specified temporal object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
return amount.subtractFrom(this);
```

---

#### default
Temporal
minus​(long amountToSubtract,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period subtracted.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Parameters:**
- amountToSubtract

- the amount of the specified unit to subtract, may be negative
- unit

- the unit of the amount to subtract, not null

**Returns:**
- an object of the same type with the specified period subtracted, not null

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be subtracted
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must behave in a manor equivalent to the default method behavior.

Implementations must not alter this object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
return (amountToSubtract == Long.MIN_VALUE ?
plus(Long.MAX_VALUE, unit).plus(1, unit) : plus(-amountToSubtract, unit));
```

---

#### long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)

Calculates the amount of time until another temporal in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two temporal objects
in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified temporal.
The end point is converted to be of the same type as the start point if different.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in hours between two temporal objects can be
calculated using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two temporals.
For example, the amount in hours between the times 11:30 and 13:29
will only be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
temporal = start.until(end, unit);
temporal = unit.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

For example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to
be calculated:

```java
long daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);
// or alternatively
long daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);
```

**Parameters:**
- endExclusive

- the end temporal, exclusive, converted to be of the
same type as this object, not null
- unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null

**Returns:**
- the amount of time between this temporal object and the specified one
in terms of the unit; positive if the specified object is later than this one,
negative if it is earlier than this one

**Throws:**
- DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to the same type as this temporal
- UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
- ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implementations must begin by checking to ensure that the input temporal
object is of the same observable type as the implementation.
They must then perform the calculation for all instances of

ChronoUnit

.
An

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown for

ChronoUnit

instances that are unsupported.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
the second argument.

In summary, implementations must behave in a manner equivalent to this pseudo-code:

```java
// convert the end temporal to the same type as this class
if (unit instanceof ChronoUnit) {
// if unit is supported, then calculate and return result
// else throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for unsupported units
}
return unit.between(this, convertedEndTemporal);
```

Note that the unit's

between

method must only be invoked if the
two temporal objects have exactly the same type evaluated by

getClass()

.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.

for day-of-month. As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.

The combination day-of-week and day-of-month ("Friday the 13th") should not implement
this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps
days to months.

it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per

TemporalAccessor

the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest

the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the
valid range of values for the fields that are represented

Four examples make this clear:

- LocalDate

implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine
the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.

LocalTime

implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine
validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.

MonthDay

, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement
this interface. While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,
the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values
for day-of-month. As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.

The combination day-of-week and day-of-month ("Friday the 13th") should not implement

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- isSupported

```java
boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must check and handle all units defined in

ChronoUnit

.
If the unit is supported, then true must be returned, otherwise false must be returned.

If the field is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

- with

```java
default
Temporal
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must not alter either this object or the specified temporal object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
return adjuster.adjustInto(this);
```
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- with

```java
Temporal
with​(
TemporalField
field,
long newValue)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in

ChronoField

.
If the field is supported, then the adjustment must be performed.
If unsupported, then an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

If the field is not a

ChronoField

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the first argument.

Implementations must not alter this object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.
**Parameters:** field

- the field to set in the result, not null
**Parameters:** newValue

- the new value of the field in the result
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the field cannot be set
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the field is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
default
Temporal
plus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.

This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.plus(period); // add a Period instance
date = date.plus(duration); // add a Duration instance
date = date.plus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must not alter either this object or the specified temporal object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
return amount.addTo(this);
```
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the addition cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- plus

```java
Temporal
plus​(long amountToAdd,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must check and handle all units defined in

ChronoUnit

.
If the unit is supported, then the addition must be performed.
If unsupported, then an

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)

passing

this

as the first argument.

Implementations must not alter this object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.
**Parameters:** amountToAdd

- the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to add, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be added
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
Temporal
minus​(
TemporalAmount
amount)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.

This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
The amount is typically a

Period

but may be any other type implementing
the

TemporalAmount

interface, such as

Duration

.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.minus(period); // subtract a Period instance
date = date.minus(duration); // subtract a Duration instance
date = date.minus(workingDays(6)); // example user-written workingDays method
```

Note that calling

plus

followed by

minus

is not guaranteed to
return the same date-time.

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must not alter either this object or the specified temporal object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
return amount.subtractFrom(this);
```
**Parameters:** amount

- the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the subtraction cannot be made
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- minus

```java
default
Temporal
minus​(long amountToSubtract,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period subtracted.

This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period subtracted.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to subtract a number of years, months or days.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st March, then subtracting one month would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must behave in a manor equivalent to the default method behavior.

Implementations must not alter this object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
return (amountToSubtract == Long.MIN_VALUE ?
plus(Long.MAX_VALUE, unit).plus(1, unit) : plus(-amountToSubtract, unit));
```
**Parameters:** amountToSubtract

- the amount of the specified unit to subtract, may be negative
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit of the amount to subtract, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified period subtracted, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the unit cannot be subtracted
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

- until

```java
long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another temporal in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two temporal objects
in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified temporal.
The end point is converted to be of the same type as the start point if different.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in hours between two temporal objects can be
calculated using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two temporals.
For example, the amount in hours between the times 11:30 and 13:29
will only be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
temporal = start.until(end, unit);
temporal = unit.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

For example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to
be calculated:

```java
long daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);
// or alternatively
long daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);
```

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must begin by checking to ensure that the input temporal
object is of the same observable type as the implementation.
They must then perform the calculation for all instances of

ChronoUnit

.
An

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown for

ChronoUnit

instances that are unsupported.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
the second argument.

In summary, implementations must behave in a manner equivalent to this pseudo-code:

```java
// convert the end temporal to the same type as this class
if (unit instanceof ChronoUnit) {
// if unit is supported, then calculate and return result
// else throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for unsupported units
}
return unit.between(this, convertedEndTemporal);
```

Note that the unit's

between

method must only be invoked if the
two temporal objects have exactly the same type evaluated by

getClass()

.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.
**Parameters:** endExclusive

- the end temporal, exclusive, converted to be of the
same type as this object, not null
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null
**Returns:** the amount of time between this temporal object and the specified one
in terms of the unit; positive if the specified object is later than this one,
negative if it is earlier than this one
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to the same type as this temporal
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

For example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to
be calculated:

```java
long daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);

They must then perform the calculation for all instances of

ChronoUnit

.
An

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown for

ChronoUnit

instances that are unsupported.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
the second argument.

In summary, implementations must behave in a manner equivalent to this pseudo-code:

```java
// convert the end temporal to the same type as this class
if (unit instanceof ChronoUnit) {
// if unit is supported, then calculate and return result
// else throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for unsupported units
}
return unit.between(this, convertedEndTemporal);
```

Note that the unit's

between

method must only be invoked if the
two temporal objects have exactly the same type evaluated by

getClass()

.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.
**Parameters:** endExclusive

- the end temporal, exclusive, converted to be of the
same type as this object, not null
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null
**Returns:** the amount of time between this temporal object and the specified one
in terms of the unit; positive if the specified object is later than this one,
negative if it is earlier than this one
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to the same type as this temporal
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

#### Method Detail

isSupported

```java
boolean isSupported​(
TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must check and handle all units defined in

ChronoUnit

.
If the unit is supported, then true must be returned, otherwise false must be returned.

If the field is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)

passing

this

as the argument.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to check, null returns false
**Returns:** true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not

---

#### isSupported

boolean isSupported​(

TemporalUnit

unit)

Checks if the specified unit is supported.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this date-time.
If false, then calling the

plus(long, TemporalUnit)

and

minus

methods will throw an exception.

This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this date-time.

with

```java
default
Temporal
with​(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
```

Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.

This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
A selection of common adjustments is provided in

TemporalAdjusters

.
These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
lengths of month and leap years.

Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:

```java
date = date.with(Month.JULY); // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth()); // static import from Adjusters
date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY)); // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
```

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must not alter either this object or the specified temporal object.
Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:

```java
return adjuster.adjustInto(this);
```
**Parameters:** adjuster

- the adjuster to use, not null
**Returns:** an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if unable to make the adjustment
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

- if numeric overflow occurs

This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
For example, on a

LocalDate

, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in

until

```java
long until​(
Temporal
endExclusive,

TemporalUnit
unit)
```

Calculates the amount of time until another temporal in terms of the specified unit.

This calculates the amount of time between two temporal objects
in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified temporal.
The end point is converted to be of the same type as the start point if different.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in hours between two temporal objects can be
calculated using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two temporals.
For example, the amount in hours between the times 11:30 and 13:29
will only be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
temporal = start.until(end, unit);
temporal = unit.between(start, end);
```

The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

For example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to
be calculated:

```java
long daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);
// or alternatively
long daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);
```

**Implementation Requirements:** Implementations must begin by checking to ensure that the input temporal
object is of the same observable type as the implementation.
They must then perform the calculation for all instances of

ChronoUnit

.
An

UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

must be thrown for

ChronoUnit

instances that are unsupported.

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
the second argument.

In summary, implementations must behave in a manner equivalent to this pseudo-code:

```java
// convert the end temporal to the same type as this class
if (unit instanceof ChronoUnit) {
// if unit is supported, then calculate and return result
// else throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for unsupported units
}
return unit.between(this, convertedEndTemporal);
```

Note that the unit's

between

method must only be invoked if the
two temporal objects have exactly the same type evaluated by

getClass()

.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.
**Parameters:** endExclusive

- the end temporal, exclusive, converted to be of the
same type as this object, not null
**Parameters:** unit

- the unit to measure the amount in, not null
**Returns:** the amount of time between this temporal object and the specified one
in terms of the unit; positive if the specified object is later than this one,
negative if it is earlier than this one
**Throws:** DateTimeException

- if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
temporal cannot be converted to the same type as this temporal
**Throws:** UnsupportedTemporalTypeException

- if the unit is not supported
**Throws:** ArithmeticException

be calculated:

```java
long daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);
// or alternatively
long daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);
```

This calculates the amount of time between two temporal objects
in terms of a single

TemporalUnit

.
The start and end points are

this

and the specified temporal.
The end point is converted to be of the same type as the start point if different.
The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
For example, the amount in hours between two temporal objects can be
calculated using

startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)

.

The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
complete units between the two temporals.
For example, the amount in hours between the times 11:30 and 13:29
will only be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
The first is to invoke this method directly.
The second is to use

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

:

```java
// these two lines are equivalent
temporal = start.until(end, unit);
temporal = unit.between(start, end);
```

If the unit is not a

ChronoUnit

, then the result of this method
is obtained by invoking

TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)

passing

this

as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
the second argument.

In summary, implementations must behave in a manner equivalent to this pseudo-code:

```java
// convert the end temporal to the same type as this class
if (unit instanceof ChronoUnit) {
// if unit is supported, then calculate and return result
// else throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for unsupported units
}
return unit.between(this, convertedEndTemporal);
```

Note that the unit's

between

method must only be invoked if the
two temporal objects have exactly the same type evaluated by

getClass()

.

Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
read-only method is invoked.
