# Interface DatabaseMetaData

**Source:** `java.sql\java\sql\DatabaseMetaData.html`

### Class Description

```java
public interface
DatabaseMetaData

extends
Wrapper
```

Comprehensive information about the database as a whole.

This interface is implemented by driver vendors to let users know the capabilities
of a Database Management System (DBMS) in combination with
the driver based on JDBC™ technology
("JDBC driver") that is used with it. Different relational DBMSs often support
different features, implement features in different ways, and use different
data types. In addition, a driver may implement a feature on top of what the
DBMS offers. Information returned by methods in this interface applies
to the capabilities of a particular driver and a particular DBMS working
together. Note that as used in this documentation, the term "database" is
used generically to refer to both the driver and DBMS.

A user for this interface is commonly a tool that needs to discover how to
deal with the underlying DBMS. This is especially true for applications
that are intended to be used with more than one DBMS. For example, a tool might use the method

getTypeInfo

to find out what data types can be used in a

CREATE TABLE

statement. Or a user might call the method

supportsCorrelatedSubqueries

to see if it is possible to use
a correlated subquery or

supportsBatchUpdates

to see if it is
possible to use batch updates.

Some

DatabaseMetaData

methods return lists of information
in the form of

ResultSet

objects.
Regular

ResultSet

methods, such as

getString

and

getInt

, can be used
to retrieve the data from these

ResultSet

objects. If
a given form of metadata is not available, an empty

ResultSet

will be returned. Additional columns beyond the columns defined to be
returned by the

ResultSet

object for a given method
can be defined by the JDBC driver vendor and must be accessed
by their

column label

.

Some

DatabaseMetaData

methods take arguments that are
String patterns. These arguments all have names such as fooPattern.
Within a pattern String, "%" means match any substring of 0 or more
characters, and "_" means match any one character. Only metadata
entries matching the search pattern are returned. If a search pattern
argument is set to

null

, that argument's criterion will
be dropped from the search.

#### ResultSet
getTypeInfo()
throws
SQLException

Retrieves a description of all the data types supported by
this database. They are ordered by DATA_TYPE and then by how
closely the data type maps to the corresponding JDBC SQL type.

If the database supports SQL distinct types, then getTypeInfo() will return
a single row with a TYPE_NAME of DISTINCT and a DATA_TYPE of Types.DISTINCT.
If the database supports SQL structured types, then getTypeInfo() will return
a single row with a TYPE_NAME of STRUCT and a DATA_TYPE of Types.STRUCT.

If SQL distinct or structured types are supported, then information on the
individual types may be obtained from the getUDTs() method.

Each type description has the following columns:

String

=>

Type name

DATA_TYPE

int

=>

The PRECISION column represents the maximum column size that the server supports for the given datatype.
For numeric data, this is the maximum precision. For character data, this is the length in characters.
For datetime datatypes, this is the length in characters of the String representation (assuming the
maximum allowed precision of the fractional seconds component). For binary data, this is the length in bytes. For the ROWID datatype,
this is the length in bytes. Null is returned for data types where the
column size is not applicable.

#### Interface DatabaseMetaData

**All Superinterfaces:** Wrapper

```java
public interface
DatabaseMetaData

extends
Wrapper
```

Comprehensive information about the database as a whole.

This interface is implemented by driver vendors to let users know the capabilities
of a Database Management System (DBMS) in combination with
the driver based on JDBC™ technology
("JDBC driver") that is used with it. Different relational DBMSs often support
different features, implement features in different ways, and use different
data types. In addition, a driver may implement a feature on top of what the
DBMS offers. Information returned by methods in this interface applies
to the capabilities of a particular driver and a particular DBMS working
together. Note that as used in this documentation, the term "database" is
used generically to refer to both the driver and DBMS.

A user for this interface is commonly a tool that needs to discover how to
deal with the underlying DBMS. This is especially true for applications
that are intended to be used with more than one DBMS. For example, a tool might use the method

getTypeInfo

to find out what data types can be used in a

CREATE TABLE

statement. Or a user might call the method

supportsCorrelatedSubqueries

to see if it is possible to use
a correlated subquery or

supportsBatchUpdates

to see if it is
possible to use batch updates.

Some

DatabaseMetaData

methods return lists of information
in the form of

ResultSet

objects.
Regular

ResultSet

methods, such as

getString

and

getInt

, can be used
to retrieve the data from these

ResultSet

objects. If
a given form of metadata is not available, an empty

ResultSet

will be returned. Additional columns beyond the columns defined to be
returned by the

ResultSet

object for a given method
can be defined by the JDBC driver vendor and must be accessed
by their

column label

.

Some

DatabaseMetaData

methods take arguments that are
String patterns. These arguments all have names such as fooPattern.
Within a pattern String, "%" means match any substring of 0 or more
characters, and "_" means match any one character. Only metadata
entries matching the search pattern are returned. If a search pattern
argument is set to

null

, that argument's criterion will
be dropped from the search.

getTypeInfo

```java
ResultSet
getTypeInfo()
throws
SQLException
```

Retrieves a description of all the data types supported by
this database. They are ordered by DATA_TYPE and then by how
closely the data type maps to the corresponding JDBC SQL type.

If the database supports SQL distinct types, then getTypeInfo() will return
a single row with a TYPE_NAME of DISTINCT and a DATA_TYPE of Types.DISTINCT.
If the database supports SQL structured types, then getTypeInfo() will return
a single row with a TYPE_NAME of STRUCT and a DATA_TYPE of Types.STRUCT.

If SQL distinct or structured types are supported, then information on the
individual types may be obtained from the getUDTs() method.

Each type description has the following columns:

- TYPE_NAME

String

=>

Type name

DATA_TYPE

int

=>

SQL data type from java.sql.Types

PRECISION

int

=>

maximum precision

LITERAL_PREFIX

String

=>

prefix used to quote a literal
(may be

null

)

LITERAL_SUFFIX

String

=>

suffix used to quote a literal
(may be

null

)

CREATE_PARAMS

String

=>

parameters used in creating
the type (may be

null

)

NULLABLE

short

=>

can you use NULL for this type.

- typeNoNulls - does not allow NULL values

typeNullable - allows NULL values

typeNullableUnknown - nullability unknown

CASE_SENSITIVE

boolean

=>

is it case sensitive.

SEARCHABLE

short

=>

can you use "WHERE" based on this type:

- typePredNone - No support

typePredChar - Only supported with WHERE .. LIKE

typePredBasic - Supported except for WHERE .. LIKE

typeSearchable - Supported for all WHERE ..

UNSIGNED_ATTRIBUTE

boolean

=>

is it unsigned.

FIXED_PREC_SCALE

boolean

=>

can it be a money value.

AUTO_INCREMENT

boolean

=>

can it be used for an
auto-increment value.

LOCAL_TYPE_NAME

String

=>

localized version of type name
(may be

null

)

MINIMUM_SCALE

short

=>

minimum scale supported

MAXIMUM_SCALE

short

=>

maximum scale supported

SQL_DATA_TYPE

int

=>

unused

SQL_DATETIME_SUB

int

=>

unused

NUM_PREC_RADIX

int

=>

usually 2 or 10

The PRECISION column represents the maximum column size that the server supports for the given datatype.
For numeric data, this is the maximum precision. For character data, this is the length in characters.
For datetime datatypes, this is the length in characters of the String representation (assuming the
maximum allowed precision of the fractional seconds component). For binary data, this is the length in bytes. For the ROWID datatype,
this is the length in bytes. Null is returned for data types where the
column size is not applicable.

**Returns:** a

ResultSet

object in which each row is an SQL
type description
**Throws:** SQLException

The PRECISION column represents the maximum column size that the server supports for the given datatype.
For numeric data, this is the maximum precision. For character data, this is the length in characters.
For datetime datatypes, this is the length in characters of the String representation (assuming the
maximum allowed precision of the fractional seconds component). For binary data, this is the length in bytes. For the ROWID datatype,
this is the length in bytes. Null is returned for data types where the
column size is not applicable.

If the database supports SQL distinct types, then getTypeInfo() will return
a single row with a TYPE_NAME of DISTINCT and a DATA_TYPE of Types.DISTINCT.
If the database supports SQL structured types, then getTypeInfo() will return
a single row with a TYPE_NAME of STRUCT and a DATA_TYPE of Types.STRUCT.

If SQL distinct or structured types are supported, then information on the
individual types may be obtained from the getUDTs() method.
