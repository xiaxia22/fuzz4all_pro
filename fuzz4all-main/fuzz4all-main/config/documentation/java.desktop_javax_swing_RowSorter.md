# Class RowSorter<M>

**Source:** `java.desktop\javax\swing\RowSorter.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
RowSorter<M>

extends
Object
```

RowSorter

provides the basis for sorting and filtering.
Beyond creating and installing a

RowSorter

, you very rarely
need to interact with one directly. Refer to

TableRowSorter

for a concrete
implementation of

RowSorter

for

JTable

.

RowSorter

's primary role is to provide a mapping between
two coordinate systems: that of the view (for example a

JTable

) and that of the underlying data source, typically a
model.

The view invokes the following methods on the

RowSorter

:

- toggleSortOrder

— The view invokes this when the
appropriate user gesture has occurred to trigger a sort. For example,
the user clicked a column header in a table.

One of the model change methods — The view invokes a model
change method when the underlying model
has changed. There may be order dependencies in how the events are
delivered, so a

RowSorter

should not update its mapping
until one of these methods is invoked.

Because the view makes extensive use of the

convertRowIndexToModel

,

convertRowIndexToView

and

getViewRowCount

methods,
these methods need to be fast.

RowSorter

provides notification of changes by way of

RowSorterListener

. Two types of notification are sent:

- RowSorterEvent.Type.SORT_ORDER_CHANGED

— notifies
listeners that the sort order has changed. This is typically followed
by a notification that the sort has changed.

RowSorterEvent.Type.SORTED

— notifies listeners that
the mapping maintained by the

RowSorter

has changed in
some way.

RowSorter

implementations typically don't have a one-to-one
mapping with the underlying model, but they can.
For example, if a database does the sorting,

toggleSortOrder

might call through to the database
(on a background thread), and override the mapping methods to return the
argument that is passed in.

Concrete implementations of

RowSorter

need to reference a model such as

TableModel

or

ListModel

. The view classes, such as

JTable

and

JList

, will also have a
reference to the model. To avoid ordering dependencies,

RowSorter

implementations should not install a
listener on the model. Instead the view class will call into the

RowSorter

when the model changes. For
example, if a row is updated in a

TableModel

JTable

invokes

rowsUpdated

.
When the model changes, the view may call into any of the following methods:

modelStructureChanged

,

allRowsChanged

,

rowsInserted

,

rowsDeleted

and

rowsUpdated

.

**Type Parameters:** M

- the type of the underlying model

---

### Field Details

*No entries found.*

### Constructor Details

#### public RowSorter()

Creates a

RowSorter

.

---

### Method Details

#### public abstract
M
getModel()

Returns the underlying model.

**Returns:**
- the underlying model

---

#### public abstract void toggleSortOrder​(int column)

Reverses the sort order of the specified column. It is up to
subclasses to provide the exact behavior when invoked. Typically
this will reverse the sort order from ascending to descending (or
descending to ascending) if the specified column is already the
primary sorted column; otherwise, makes the specified column
the primary sorted column, with an ascending sort order. If
the specified column is not sortable, this method has no
effect.

If this results in changing the sort order and sorting, the
appropriate

RowSorterListener

notification will be
sent.

**Parameters:**
- column

- the column to toggle the sort ordering of, in
terms of the underlying model

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if column is outside the range of
the underlying model

---

#### public abstract int convertRowIndexToModel​(int index)

Returns the location of

index

in terms of the
underlying model. That is, for the row

index

in
the coordinates of the view this returns the row index in terms
of the underlying model.

**Parameters:**
- index

- the row index in terms of the underlying view

**Returns:**
- row index in terms of the view

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

index

is outside the
range of the view

---

#### public abstract int convertRowIndexToView​(int index)

Returns the location of

index

in terms of the
view. That is, for the row

index

in the
coordinates of the underlying model this returns the row index
in terms of the view.

**Parameters:**
- index

- the row index in terms of the underlying model

**Returns:**
- row index in terms of the view, or -1 if index has been
filtered out of the view

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

index

is outside
the range of the model

---

#### public abstract void setSortKeys​(
List
<? extends
RowSorter.SortKey
> keys)

Sets the current sort keys.

**Parameters:**
- keys

- the new

SortKeys

;

null

is a shorthand for specifying an empty list,
indicating that the view should be unsorted

---

#### public abstract
List
<? extends
RowSorter.SortKey
> getSortKeys()

Returns the current sort keys. This must return a

non-null List

and may return an unmodifiable

List

. If
you need to change the sort keys, make a copy of the returned

List

, mutate the copy and invoke

setSortKeys

with the new list.

**Returns:**
- the current sort order

---

#### public abstract int getViewRowCount()

Returns the number of rows in the view. If the contents have
been filtered this might differ from the row count of the
underlying model.

**Returns:**
- number of rows in the view

**See Also:**
- getModelRowCount()

---

#### public abstract int getModelRowCount()

Returns the number of rows in the underlying model.

**Returns:**
- number of rows in the underlying model

**See Also:**
- getViewRowCount()

---

#### public abstract void modelStructureChanged()

Invoked when the underlying model structure has completely
changed. For example, if the number of columns in a

TableModel

changed, this method would be invoked.

You normally do not call this method. This method is public
to allow view classes to call it.

---

#### public abstract void allRowsChanged()

Invoked when the contents of the underlying model have
completely changed. The structure of the table is the same,
only the contents have changed. This is typically sent when it
is too expensive to characterize the change in terms of the
other methods.

You normally do not call this method. This method is public
to allow view classes to call it.

---

#### public abstract void rowsInserted​(int firstRow,
int endRow)

Invoked when rows have been inserted into the underlying model
in the specified range (inclusive).

The arguments give the indices of the effected range.
The first argument is in terms of the model before the change, and
must be less than or equal to the size of the model before the change.
The second argument is in terms of the model after the change and must
be less than the size of the model after the change. For example,
if you have a 5-row model and add 3 items to the end of the model
the indices are 5, 7.

You normally do not call this method. This method is public
to allow view classes to call it.

**Parameters:**
- firstRow

- the first row
- endRow

- the last row

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if either argument is invalid, or

firstRow

>

endRow

---

#### public abstract void rowsDeleted​(int firstRow,
int endRow)

Invoked when rows have been deleted from the underlying model
in the specified range (inclusive).

The arguments give the indices of the effected range and
are in terms of the model

before

the change.
For example, if you have a 5-row model and delete 3 items from the end
of the model the indices are 2, 4.

You normally do not call this method. This method is public
to allow view classes to call it.

**Parameters:**
- firstRow

- the first row
- endRow

- the last row

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if either argument is outside
the range of the model before the change, or

firstRow

>

endRow

---

#### public abstract void rowsUpdated​(int firstRow,
int endRow)

Invoked when rows have been changed in the underlying model
between the specified range (inclusive).

You normally do not call this method. This method is public
to allow view classes to call it.

**Parameters:**
- firstRow

- the first row, in terms of the underlying model
- endRow

- the last row, in terms of the underlying model

**Throws:**
- IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if either argument is outside
the range of the underlying model, or

firstRow

>

endRow

---

#### public abstract void rowsUpdated​(int firstRow,
int endRow,
int column)

Invoked when the column in the rows have been updated in
the underlying model between the specified range.

You normally do not call this method. This method is public
to allow view classes to call it.

**Parameters:**
- firstRow

- the first row, in terms of the underlying model
- endRow

- the last row, in terms of the underlying model
- column

- the column that has changed, in terms of the underlying
model

**Throws:**

- if either argument is outside
the range of the underlying model after the change,

firstRow

>

endRow

, or

column

is outside the range of the underlying
model

---

#### public void addRowSorterListener​(
RowSorterListener
l)

Adds a

RowSorterListener

to receive notification
about this

RowSorter

. If the same
listener is added more than once it will receive multiple
notifications. If

l

============ METHOD DETAIL ==========

- Method Detail

- getModel

```java
public abstract
M
getModel()
```

Returns the underlying model.

**Returns:** the underlying model

- toggleSortOrder

```java
public abstract void toggleSortOrder​(int column)
```

Reverses the sort order of the specified column. It is up to
subclasses to provide the exact behavior when invoked. Typically
this will reverse the sort order from ascending to descending (or
descending to ascending) if the specified column is already the
primary sorted column; otherwise, makes the specified column
the primary sorted column, with an ascending sort order. If
the specified column is not sortable, this method has no
effect.

If this results in changing the sort order and sorting, the
appropriate

RowSorterListener

notification will be
sent.

**Parameters:** column

- the column to toggle the sort ordering of, in
terms of the underlying model
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if column is outside the range of
the underlying model

- convertRowIndexToModel

```java
public abstract int convertRowIndexToModel​(int index)
```

Returns the location of

index

in terms of the
underlying model. That is, for the row

index

in
the coordinates of the view this returns the row index in terms
of the underlying model.

**Parameters:** index

- the row index in terms of the underlying view
**Returns:** row index in terms of the view
**Throws:** IndexOutOfBoundsException

- if

index

is outside the
range of the view

- convertRowIndexToView

```java
public abstract int convertRowIndexToView​(int index)
```

Returns the location of

index

in terms of the
view. That is, for the row

index

in the
coordinates of the underlying model this returns the row index
in terms of the view.

**Parameters:** index

- the row index in terms of the underlying model
**Returns:** row index in terms of the view, or -1 if index has been
filtered out of the view
