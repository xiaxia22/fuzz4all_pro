# Class PermissionCollection

**Source:** `java.base\java\security\PermissionCollection.html`

### Class Description

```java
public abstract class
PermissionCollection

extends
Object

implements
Serializable
```

Abstract class representing a collection of Permission objects.

With a PermissionCollection, you can:

- add a permission to the collection using the

add

method.

check to see if a particular permission is implied in the
collection, using the

implies

method.

enumerate all the permissions, using the

elements

method.

When it is desirable to group together a number of Permission objects
of the same type, the

newPermissionCollection

method on that
particular type of Permission object should first be called. The default
behavior (from the Permission class) is to simply return null.
Subclasses of class Permission override the method if they need to store
their permissions in a particular PermissionCollection object in order
to provide the correct semantics when the

PermissionCollection.implies

method is called.
If a non-null value is returned, that PermissionCollection must be used.
If null is returned, then the caller of

newPermissionCollection

is free to store permissions of the
given type in any PermissionCollection they choose
(one that uses a Hashtable, one that uses a Vector, etc).

The PermissionCollection returned by the

Permission.newPermissionCollection

method is a homogeneous collection, which stores only Permission objects
for a given Permission type. A PermissionCollection may also be
heterogeneous. For example, Permissions is a PermissionCollection
subclass that represents a collection of PermissionCollections.
That is, its members are each a homogeneous PermissionCollection.
For example, a Permissions object might have a FilePermissionCollection
for all the FilePermission objects, a SocketPermissionCollection for all the
SocketPermission objects, and so on. Its

add

method adds a
permission to the appropriate collection.

Whenever a permission is added to a heterogeneous PermissionCollection
such as Permissions, and the PermissionCollection doesn't yet contain a
PermissionCollection of the specified permission's type, the
PermissionCollection should call
the

newPermissionCollection

method on the permission's class
to see if it requires a special PermissionCollection. If

newPermissionCollection

returns null, the PermissionCollection
is free to store the permission in any type of PermissionCollection it
desires (one using a Hashtable, one using a Vector, etc.). For example,
the Permissions object uses a default PermissionCollection implementation
that stores the permission objects in a Hashtable.

Subclass implementations of PermissionCollection should assume
that they may be called simultaneously from multiple threads,
and therefore should be synchronized properly. Furthermore,
Enumerations returned via the

elements

method are
not

fail-fast

. Modifications to a collection should not be
performed while enumerating over that collection.

### Method Details

#### public abstract void add​(
Permission
permission)

Adds a permission object to the current collection of permission objects.

**Parameters:**
- permission

- the Permission object to add.

**Throws:**
- SecurityException

- - if this PermissionCollection object
has been marked readonly
- IllegalArgumentException

- - if this PermissionCollection
object is a homogeneous collection and the permission
is not of the correct type.

---

#### public abstract boolean implies​(
Permission
permission)

Checks to see if the specified permission is implied by
the collection of Permission objects held in this PermissionCollection.

**Parameters:**
- permission

- the Permission object to compare.

**Returns:**
- true if "permission" is implied by the permissions in
the collection, false if not.

---

#### public abstract
Enumeration
<
Permission
> elements()

Returns an enumeration of all the Permission objects in the collection.

**Returns:**
- an enumeration of all the Permissions.

**See Also:**
- elementsAsStream()

---

#### public
Stream
<
Permission
> elementsAsStream()

Returns a stream of all the Permission objects in the collection.

The collection should not be modified (see

add(java.security.Permission)

) during the
execution of the terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the
terminal stream operation is undefined.

**Returns:**
- a stream of all the Permissions.

**Since:**
- 9

**Implementation Requirements:**
- The default implementation creates a stream whose source is derived from
the enumeration returned from a call to

elements()

.

---

#### public void setReadOnly()

Marks this PermissionCollection object as "readonly". After
a PermissionCollection object
is marked as readonly, no new Permission objects can be added to it
using

add

.

---

#### public boolean isReadOnly()

Returns true if this PermissionCollection object is marked as readonly.
If it is readonly, no new Permission objects can be added to it
using

add

.

By default, the object is

not

readonly. It can be set to
readonly by a call to

setReadOnly

.

**Returns:**
- true if this PermissionCollection object is marked as readonly,
false otherwise.

---

#### public
String
toString()

Returns a string describing this PermissionCollection object,
providing information about all the permissions it contains.
The format is:

```java
super.toString() (
// enumerate all the Permission
// objects and call toString() on them,
// one per line..
)
```

super.toString

is a call to the

toString

method of this
object's superclass, which is Object. The result is
this PermissionCollection's type name followed by this object's
hashcode, thus enabling clients to differentiate different
PermissionCollections object, even if they contain the same permissions.

**Overrides:**
- toString

in class

Object

**Returns:**
- information about this PermissionCollection object,
as described above.
