# Class TextAttribute

**Source:** `java.desktop\java\awt\font\TextAttribute.html`

### Class Description

```java
public final class
TextAttribute

extends
AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
```

The

TextAttribute

class defines attribute keys and
attribute values used for text rendering.

TextAttribute

instances are used as attribute keys to
identify attributes in

Font

,

TextLayout

,

AttributedCharacterIterator

,
and other classes handling text attributes. Other constants defined
in this class can be used as attribute values.

For each text attribute, the documentation provides:

- the type of its value,

the relevant predefined constants, if any

the default effect if the attribute is absent

the valid values if there are limitations

a description of the effect.

Values

- The values of attributes must always be immutable.

Where value limitations are given, any value outside of that
set is reserved for future use; the value will be treated as
the default.

The value

null

is treated the same as the
default value and results in the default behavior.

If the value is not of the proper type, the attribute
will be ignored.

The identity of the value does not matter, only the actual
value. For example,

TextAttribute.WEIGHT_BOLD

and

Float.valueOf(2.0f)

indicate the same

WEIGHT

.

Attribute values of type

Number

(used for

WEIGHT

,

WIDTH

,

POSTURE

,

SIZE

,

JUSTIFICATION

, and

TRACKING

) can vary along their natural range and are
not restricted to the predefined constants.

Number.floatValue()

is used to get the actual value
from the

Number

.

The values for

WEIGHT

,

WIDTH

, and

POSTURE

are interpolated by the system, which
can select the 'nearest available' font or use other techniques to
approximate the user's request.

### Field Details

#### public static final
TextAttribute
FAMILY

Attribute key for the font name. Values are instances of

String

. The default value is

"Default"

, which causes the platform default font
family to be used.

The

Font

class defines constants for the logical
font names

DIALOG

,

DIALOG_INPUT

,

SANS_SERIF

,

SERIF

, and

MONOSPACED

.

This defines the value passed as

name

to the

Font

constructor. Both logical and physical
font names are allowed. If a font with the requested name
is not found, the default font is used.

Note:

This attribute is unfortunately misnamed, as
it specifies the face name and not just the family. Thus
values such as "Lucida Sans Bold" will select that face if it
exists. Note, though, that if the requested face does not
exist, the default will be used with

regular

weight.
The "Bold" in the name is part of the face name, not a separate
request that the font's weight be bold.

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
WEIGHT

Attribute key for the weight of a font. Values are instances
of

Number

. The default value is

WEIGHT_REGULAR

.

Several constant values are provided, see

WEIGHT_EXTRA_LIGHT

,

WEIGHT_LIGHT

,

WEIGHT_DEMILIGHT

,

WEIGHT_REGULAR

,

WEIGHT_SEMIBOLD

,

WEIGHT_MEDIUM

,

WEIGHT_DEMIBOLD

,

WEIGHT_BOLD

,

WEIGHT_HEAVY

,

WEIGHT_EXTRABOLD

, and

WEIGHT_ULTRABOLD

. The
value

WEIGHT_BOLD

corresponds to the
style value

Font.BOLD

as passed to the

Font

constructor.

The value is roughly the ratio of the stem width to that of
the regular weight.

The system can interpolate the provided value.

.

Several constant values are provided, see

WIDTH_CONDENSED

,

WIDTH_SEMI_CONDENSED

,

WIDTH_REGULAR

,

#### public static final
TextAttribute
POSTURE

Attribute key for the posture of a font. Values are instances
of

Number

. The default value is

POSTURE_REGULAR

.

Two constant values are provided,

POSTURE_REGULAR

and

POSTURE_OBLIQUE

. The value

POSTURE_OBLIQUE

corresponds to the style value

Font.ITALIC

as passed to the

Font

constructor.

The value is roughly the slope of the stems of the font,
expressed as the run over the rise. Positive values lean right.

The system can interpolate the provided value.

This will affect the font's italic angle as returned by

Font.getItalicAngle

.

**See Also:**
- Font.getItalicAngle()

---

#### public static final
Float
POSTURE_REGULAR

The standard posture, upright. This is the default value for

POSTURE

.

**See Also:**
- POSTURE

---

#### public static final
Float
POSTURE_OBLIQUE

The standard italic posture.

**See Also:**
- POSTURE

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
SIZE

Attribute key for the font size. Values are instances of

Number

. The default value is 12pt.

This corresponds to the

size

parameter to the

Font

constructor.

Very large or small sizes will impact rendering performance,
and the rendering system might not render text at these sizes.
Negative sizes are illegal and result in the default size.

Note that the appearance and metrics of a 12pt font with a
2x transform might be different than that of a 24 point font
with no transform.

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
TRANSFORM

Attribute key for the transform of a font. Values are
instances of

TransformAttribute

. The
default value is

TransformAttribute.IDENTITY

.

The

TransformAttribute

class defines the
constant

IDENTITY

.

This corresponds to the transform passed to

Font.deriveFont(AffineTransform)

. Since that
transform is mutable and

TextAttribute

values must
not be, the

TransformAttribute

wrapper class is
used.

The primary intent is to support scaling and skewing, though
other effects are possible.

Some transforms will cause the baseline to be rotated and/or
shifted. The text and the baseline are transformed together so
that the text follows the new baseline. For example, with text
on a horizontal baseline, the new baseline follows the
direction of the unit x vector passed through the
transform. Text metrics are measured against this new baseline.
So, for example, with other things being equal, text rendered
with a rotated TRANSFORM and an unrotated TRANSFORM will measure as
having the same ascent, descent, and advance.

In styled text, the baselines for each such run are aligned
one after the other to potentially create a non-linear baseline
for the entire run of text. For more information, see

TextLayout.getLayoutPath()

.

**See Also:**
- TransformAttribute

,

AffineTransform

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
SUPERSCRIPT

Attribute key for superscripting and subscripting. Values are
instances of

Integer

. The default value is
0, which means that no superscript or subscript is used.

Two constant values are provided, see

SUPERSCRIPT_SUPER

and

SUPERSCRIPT_SUB

. These have
the values 1 and -1 respectively. Values of
greater magnitude define greater levels of superscript or
subscripting, for example, 2 corresponds to super-superscript,
3 to super-super-superscript, and similarly for negative values
and subscript, up to a level of 7 (or -7). Values beyond this
range are reserved; behavior is platform-dependent.

SUPERSCRIPT

can
impact the ascent and descent of a font. The ascent
and descent can never become negative, however.

---

#### public static final
Integer
SUPERSCRIPT_SUPER

Standard superscript.

**See Also:**
- SUPERSCRIPT

---

#### public static final
Integer
SUPERSCRIPT_SUB

Standard subscript.

**See Also:**
- SUPERSCRIPT

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
FONT

Attribute key used to provide the font to use to render text.
Values are instances of

Font

. The default
value is null, indicating that normal resolution of a

Font

from attributes should be performed.

TextLayout

and

AttributedCharacterIterator

work in terms of

Maps

of

TextAttributes

. Normally,
all the attributes are examined and used to select and
configure a

Font

instance. If a

FONT

attribute is present, though, its associated

Font

will be used. This provides a way for users to override the
resolution of font attributes into a

Font

, or
force use of a particular

Font

instance. This
also allows users to specify subclasses of

Font

in
cases where a

Font

can be subclassed.

FONT

is used for special situations where
clients already have a

Font

instance but still
need to use

Map

-based APIs. Typically, there will
be no other attributes in the

Map

except the

FONT

attribute. With

Map

-based APIs
the common case is to specify all attributes individually, so

FONT

is not needed or desirable.

However, if both

FONT

and other attributes are
present in the

Map

, the rendering system will
merge the attributes defined in the

Font

with the
additional attributes. This merging process classifies

TextAttributes

into two groups. One group, the
'primary' group, is considered fundamental to the selection and
metric behavior of a font. These attributes are

FAMILY

,

WEIGHT

,

WIDTH

,

POSTURE

,

SIZE

,

TRANSFORM

,

SUPERSCRIPT

, and

TRACKING

. The other group, the 'secondary' group,
consists of all other defined attributes, with the exception of

FONT

itself.

To generate the new

Map

, first the

Font

is obtained from the

FONT

attribute, and

all

of its attributes extracted into a
new

Map

. Then only the

secondary

attributes from the original

Map

are added to
those in the new

Map

. Thus the values of primary
attributes come solely from the

Font

, and the
values of secondary attributes originate with the

Font

but can be overridden by other values in the

Map

.

Note:

Font's Map

-based
constructor and

deriveFont

methods do not process
the

FONT

attribute, as these are used to create
new

Font

objects. Instead,

Font.getFont(Map)

should be used to
handle the

FONT

attribute.

- Font

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
CHAR_REPLACEMENT

Attribute key for a user-defined glyph to display in lieu
of the font's standard glyph for a character. Values are
instances of GraphicAttribute. The default value is null,
indicating that the standard glyphs provided by the font
should be used.

This attribute is used to reserve space for a graphic or
other component embedded in a line of text. It is required for
correct positioning of 'inline' components within a line when
bidirectional reordering (see

Bidi

) is
performed. Each character (Unicode code point) will be
rendered using the provided GraphicAttribute. Typically, the
characters to which this attribute is applied should be

\uFFFC

.

The GraphicAttribute determines the logical and visual
bounds of the text; the actual Font values are ignored.

**See Also:**
- GraphicAttribute

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
FOREGROUND

Attribute key for the paint used to render the text. Values are
instances of

Paint

. The default value is
null, indicating that the

Paint

set on the

Graphics2D

at the time of rendering is used.

Glyphs will be rendered using this

Paint

regardless of the

Paint

value
set on the

Graphics

(but see

SWAP_COLORS

).

**See Also:**
- Paint

,

SWAP_COLORS

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
BACKGROUND

Attribute key for the paint used to render the background of
the text. Values are instances of

Paint

.
The default value is null, indicating that the background
should not be rendered.

The logical bounds of the text will be filled using this

Paint

, and then the text will be rendered on top
of it (but see

SWAP_COLORS

).

The visual bounds of the text is extended to include the
logical bounds, if necessary. The outline is not affected.

**See Also:**
- Paint

,

SWAP_COLORS

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
UNDERLINE

Attribute key for underline. Values are instances of

Integer

. The default value is -1, which
means no underline.

The constant value

UNDERLINE_ON

is provided.

The underline affects both the visual bounds and the outline
of the text.

---

#### public static final
Integer
UNDERLINE_ON

Standard underline.

**See Also:**
- UNDERLINE

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
STRIKETHROUGH

Attribute key for strikethrough. Values are instances of

Boolean

. The default value is

false

, which means no strikethrough.

The constant value

STRIKETHROUGH_ON

is provided.

The strikethrough affects both the visual bounds and the
outline of the text.

---

#### public static final
Boolean
STRIKETHROUGH_ON

A single strikethrough.

**See Also:**
- STRIKETHROUGH

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
RUN_DIRECTION

Attribute key for the run direction of the line. Values are
instances of

Boolean

. The default value is
null, which indicates that the standard Bidi algorithm for
determining run direction should be used with the value

Bidi.DIRECTION_DEFAULT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT

.

The constants

RUN_DIRECTION_RTL

and

RUN_DIRECTION_LTR

are provided.

This determines the value passed to the

Bidi

constructor to select the primary direction of
the text in the paragraph.

Note:

This attribute should have the same value for
all the text in a paragraph, otherwise the behavior is
undetermined.

**See Also:**
- Bidi

---

#### public static final
Boolean
RUN_DIRECTION_LTR

Left-to-right run direction.

**See Also:**
- RUN_DIRECTION

---

#### public static final
Boolean
RUN_DIRECTION_RTL

Right-to-left run direction.

**See Also:**
- RUN_DIRECTION

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
BIDI_EMBEDDING

Attribute key for the embedding level of the text. Values are
instances of

Integer

. The default value is

null

, indicating that the Bidirectional
algorithm should run without explicit embeddings.

Positive values 1 through 61 are

embedding

levels,
negative values -1 through -61 are

override

levels.
The value 0 means that the base line direction is used. These
levels are passed in the embedding levels array to the

Bidi

constructor.

Note:

When this attribute is present anywhere in
a paragraph, then any Unicode bidi control characters (RLO,
LRO, RLE, LRE, and PDF) in the paragraph are
disregarded, and runs of text where this attribute is not
present are treated as though it were present and had the value
0.

**See Also:**
- Bidi

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
JUSTIFICATION

Attribute key for the justification of a paragraph. Values are
instances of

Number

. The default value is
1, indicating that justification should use the full width
provided. Values are pinned to the range [0..1].

The constants

JUSTIFICATION_FULL

and

JUSTIFICATION_NONE

are provided.

Specifies the fraction of the extra space to use when
justification is requested on a

TextLayout

. For
example, if the line is 50 points wide and it is requested to
justify to 70 points, a value of 0.75 will pad to use
three-quarters of the remaining space, or 15 points, so that
the resulting line will be 65 points in length.

Note:

This should have the same value for all the
text in a paragraph, otherwise the behavior is undetermined.

**See Also:**
- TextLayout.getJustifiedLayout(float)

---

#### public static final
Float
JUSTIFICATION_FULL

Justify the line to the full requested width. This is the
default value for

JUSTIFICATION

.

**See Also:**
- JUSTIFICATION

---

#### public static final
Float
JUSTIFICATION_NONE

Do not allow the line to be justified.

**See Also:**
- JUSTIFICATION

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT

Attribute key for input method highlight styles.

Values are instances of

InputMethodHighlight

or

Annotation

. The default value is

null

,
which means that input method styles should not be applied
before rendering.

If adjacent runs of text with the same

InputMethodHighlight

need to be rendered
separately, the

InputMethodHighlights

should be
wrapped in

Annotation

instances.

Input method highlights are used while text is being
composed by an input method. Text editing components should
retain them even if they generally only deal with unstyled
text, and make them available to the drawing routines.

**See Also:**
- Font

,

InputMethodHighlight

,

Annotation

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
INPUT_METHOD_UNDERLINE

Attribute key for input method underlines. Values
are instances of

Integer

. The default
value is

-1

, which means no underline.

Several constant values are provided, see

UNDERLINE_LOW_ONE_PIXEL

,

UNDERLINE_LOW_TWO_PIXEL

,

UNDERLINE_LOW_DOTTED

,

UNDERLINE_LOW_GRAY

, and

UNDERLINE_LOW_DASHED

.

This may be used in conjunction with

UNDERLINE

if
desired. The primary purpose is for use by input methods.
Other use of these underlines for simple ornamentation might
confuse users.

The input method underline affects both the visual bounds and
the outline of the text.

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public static final
Integer
UNDERLINE_LOW_ONE_PIXEL

Single pixel solid low underline.

TextAttribute
SWAP_COLORS

Attribute key for swapping foreground and background

Paints

. Values are instances of

Boolean

. The default value is

false

, which means do not swap colors.

The constant value

SWAP_COLORS_ON

is defined.

If the

FOREGROUND

attribute is set, its

Paint

will be used as the background, otherwise
the

Paint

currently on the

Graphics

will be used. If the

BACKGROUND

attribute is set, its

Paint

will be used as the foreground, otherwise
the system will find a contrasting color to the
(resolved) background so that the text will be visible.

**See Also:**
- FOREGROUND

,

BACKGROUND

---

#### public static final
Boolean
SWAP_COLORS_ON

Swap foreground and background.

**See Also:**
- SWAP_COLORS

**Since:**
- 1.3

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
NUMERIC_SHAPING

Attribute key for converting ASCII decimal digits to other
decimal ranges. Values are instances of

NumericShaper

.
The default is

null

, which means do not perform
numeric shaping.

When a numeric shaper is defined, the text is first
processed by the shaper before any other analysis of the text
is performed.

Note:

This should have the same value for all the
text in the paragraph, otherwise the behavior is undetermined.

**See Also:**
- NumericShaper

**Since:**
- 1.4

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
KERNING

Attribute key to request kerning. Values are instances of

Integer

. The default value is

0

, which does not request kerning.

The constant value

KERNING_ON

is provided.

The default advances of single characters are not
appropriate for some character sequences, for example "To" or
"AWAY". Without kerning the adjacent characters appear to be
separated by too much space. Kerning causes selected sequences
of characters to be spaced differently for a more pleasing
visual appearance.

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public static final
Integer
KERNING_ON

Request standard kerning.

**See Also:**
- KERNING

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
LIGATURES

Attribute key for enabling optional ligatures. Values are
instances of

Integer

. The default value is

0

, which means do not use optional ligatures.

The constant value

LIGATURES_ON

is defined.

Ligatures required by the writing system are always enabled.

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public static final
Integer
LIGATURES_ON

Request standard optional ligatures.

**See Also:**
- LIGATURES

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public static final
TextAttribute
TRACKING

Attribute key to control tracking. Values are instances of

Number

. The default value is

0

, which means no additional tracking.

The constant values

TRACKING_TIGHT

and

TRACKING_LOOSE

are provided.

The tracking value is multiplied by the font point size and
passed through the font transform to determine an additional
amount to add to the advance of each glyph cluster. Positive
tracking values will inhibit formation of optional ligatures.
Tracking values are typically between

-0.1

and

0.3

; values outside this range are generally not
desirable.

**Since:**
- 1.6

---

#### public static final
Float
TRACKING_TIGHT

Perform tight tracking.

**See Also:**
- TRACKING

**Since:**

```

The

TextAttribute

class defines attribute keys and
attribute values used for text rendering.

TextAttribute

instances are used as attribute keys to
identify attributes in

Font

,

TextLayout

,

AttributedCharacterIterator

,
and other classes handling text attributes. Other constants defined
in this class can be used as attribute values.

For each text attribute, the documentation provides:

- the type of its value,

the relevant predefined constants, if any

the default effect if the attribute is absent

the valid values if there are limitations

a description of the effect.

Values

- The values of attributes must always be immutable.

Where value limitations are given, any value outside of that
set is reserved for future use; the value will be treated as
the default.

The value

null

is treated the same as the
default value and results in the default behavior.

If the value is not of the proper type, the attribute
will be ignored.

The identity of the value does not matter, only the actual
value. For example,

TextAttribute.WEIGHT_BOLD

and

Float.valueOf(2.0f)

indicate the same

WEIGHT

.

Attribute values of type

Number

(used for

WEIGHT

,

WIDTH

,

POSTURE

,

SIZE

,

JUSTIFICATION

, and

TRACKING

) can vary along their natural range and are

public final class

TextAttribute

extends

AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute

The

TextAttribute

class defines attribute keys and
attribute values used for text rendering.

TextAttribute

instances are used as attribute keys to
identify attributes in

Font

,

TextLayout

,

AttributedCharacterIterator

,
and other classes handling text attributes. Other constants defined
in this class can be used as attribute values.

For each text attribute, the documentation provides:

- the type of its value,

the relevant predefined constants, if any

the default effect if the attribute is absent

the valid values if there are limitations

a description of the effect.

Values

- The values of attributes must always be immutable.

Where value limitations are given, any value outside of that
set is reserved for future use; the value will be treated as
the default.

The value

null

is treated the same as the
default value and results in the default behavior.

If the value is not of the proper type, the attribute
will be ignored.

The identity of the value does not matter, only the actual
value. For example,

TextAttribute.WEIGHT_BOLD

and

Float.valueOf(2.0f)

indicate the same

WEIGHT

.

Attribute values of type

Number

(used for

WEIGHT

,

WIDTH

,

POSTURE

,

SIZE

,

JUSTIFICATION

, and

============ FIELD DETAIL ===========

- Field Detail

- FAMILY

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
FAMILY
```

Attribute key for the font name. Values are instances of

String

. The default value is

"Default"

, which causes the platform default font
family to be used.

The

Font

class defines constants for the logical
font names

DIALOG

,

DIALOG_INPUT

,

SANS_SERIF

,

SERIF

, and

MONOSPACED

.

This defines the value passed as

name

to the

Font

constructor. Both logical and physical
font names are allowed. If a font with the requested name
is not found, the default font is used.

Note:

This attribute is unfortunately misnamed, as
it specifies the face name and not just the family. Thus
values such as "Lucida Sans Bold" will select that face if it
exists. Note, though, that if the requested face does not
exist, the default will be used with

regular

weight.
The "Bold" in the name is part of the face name, not a separate
request that the font's weight be bold.

- WEIGHT

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
WEIGHT
```

Attribute key for the weight of a font. Values are instances
of

Number

. The default value is

WEIGHT_REGULAR

.

Several constant values are provided, see

WEIGHT_EXTRA_LIGHT

,

WEIGHT_LIGHT

,

WEIGHT_DEMILIGHT

,

WEIGHT_REGULAR

,

WEIGHT_SEMIBOLD

,

WEIGHT_MEDIUM

,

WEIGHT_DEMIBOLD

,

WEIGHT_BOLD

,

WEIGHT_HEAVY

,

WEIGHT_EXTRABOLD

, and

WEIGHT_ULTRABOLD

. The
value

WEIGHT_BOLD

corresponds to the
style value

Font.BOLD

as passed to the

Font

constructor.

The value is roughly the ratio of the stem width to that of
the regular weight.

The system can interpolate the provided value.

- WEIGHT_EXTRA_LIGHT

```java
public static final
Float
WEIGHT_EXTRA_LIGHT
```

The lightest predefined weight.

**See Also:** WEIGHT

- WEIGHT_LIGHT

```java
public static final
Float

**See Also:** WEIGHT

- WIDTH

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
WIDTH
```

Attribute key for the width of a font. Values are instances of

Number

. The default value is

WIDTH_REGULAR

.

Several constant values are provided, see

WIDTH_CONDENSED

,

WIDTH_SEMI_CONDENSED

,

WIDTH_REGULAR

,

WIDTH_SEMI_EXTENDED

,

WIDTH_EXTENDED

.

The value is roughly the ratio of the advance width to that
of the regular width.

The system can interpolate the provided value.

- WIDTH_CONDENSED

```java
public static final
Float
WIDTH_CONDENSED
```

The most condensed predefined width.

**See Also:** WIDTH

- WIDTH_SEMI_CONDENSED

```java

```

The most extended predefined width.

**See Also:** WIDTH

- POSTURE

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
POSTURE
```

Attribute key for the posture of a font. Values are instances
of

Number

. The default value is

POSTURE_REGULAR

.

Two constant values are provided,

POSTURE_REGULAR

and

POSTURE_OBLIQUE

. The value

POSTURE_OBLIQUE

corresponds to the style value

Font.ITALIC

as passed to the

Font

constructor.

The value is roughly the slope of the stems of the font,
expressed as the run over the rise. Positive values lean right.

The system can interpolate the provided value.

This will affect the font's italic angle as returned by

Font.getItalicAngle

.

**See Also:** Font.getItalicAngle()

- POSTURE_REGULAR

```java
public static final
Float
POSTURE_REGULAR
```

The standard posture, upright. This is the default value for

POSTURE

.

**See Also:** POSTURE

- POSTURE_OBLIQUE

```java
public static final
Float
POSTURE_OBLIQUE
```

The standard italic posture.

**See Also:** POSTURE

- SIZE

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
SIZE
```

Attribute key for the font size. Values are instances of

Number

. The default value is 12pt.

This corresponds to the

size

parameter to the

Font

constructor.

Very large or small sizes will impact rendering performance,
and the rendering system might not render text at these sizes.
Negative sizes are illegal and result in the default size.

Note that the appearance and metrics of a 12pt font with a
2x transform might be different than that of a 24 point font
with no transform.

- TRANSFORM

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
TRANSFORM
```

Attribute key for the transform of a font. Values are
instances of

TransformAttribute

. The
default value is

TransformAttribute.IDENTITY

.

The

TransformAttribute

class defines the
constant

IDENTITY

.

This corresponds to the transform passed to

Font.deriveFont(AffineTransform)

. Since that
transform is mutable and

TextAttribute

values must
not be, the

TransformAttribute

wrapper class is
used.

The primary intent is to support scaling and skewing, though
other effects are possible.

Some transforms will cause the baseline to be rotated and/or
shifted. The text and the baseline are transformed together so
that the text follows the new baseline. For example, with text
on a horizontal baseline, the new baseline follows the
direction of the unit x vector passed through the
transform. Text metrics are measured against this new baseline.
So, for example, with other things being equal, text rendered
with a rotated TRANSFORM and an unrotated TRANSFORM will measure as
having the same ascent, descent, and advance.

In styled text, the baselines for each such run are aligned
one after the other to potentially create a non-linear baseline
for the entire run of text. For more information, see

TextLayout.getLayoutPath()

.

**See Also:** TransformAttribute

,

AffineTransform

- SUPERSCRIPT

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
SUPERSCRIPT
```

Attribute key for superscripting and subscripting. Values are
instances of

Integer

. The default value is
0, which means that no superscript or subscript is used.

Two constant values are provided, see

SUPERSCRIPT_SUPER

and

SUPERSCRIPT_SUB

. These have
the values 1 and -1 respectively. Values of
greater magnitude define greater levels of superscript or
subscripting, for example, 2 corresponds to super-superscript,
3 to super-super-superscript, and similarly for negative values
and subscript, up to a level of 7 (or -7). Values beyond this
range are reserved; behavior is platform-dependent.

SUPERSCRIPT

can
impact the ascent and descent of a font. The ascent
and descent can never become negative, however.

- SUPERSCRIPT_SUPER

```java
public static final
Integer
SUPERSCRIPT_SUPER
```

Standard superscript.

**See Also:** SUPERSCRIPT

- SUPERSCRIPT_SUB

```java
public static final
Integer
SUPERSCRIPT_SUB
```

Standard subscript.

**See Also:** SUPERSCRIPT

- FONT

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
FONT
```

Attribute key used to provide the font to use to render text.
Values are instances of

Font

. The default
value is null, indicating that normal resolution of a

Font

from attributes should be performed.

TextLayout

and

AttributedCharacterIterator

work in terms of

Maps

of

TextAttributes

. Normally,
all the attributes are examined and used to select and
configure a

Font

instance. If a

FONT

attribute is present, though, its associated

Font

will be used. This provides a way for users to override the
resolution of font attributes into a

Font

, or
force use of a particular

Font

instance. This
also allows users to specify subclasses of

Font

in
cases where a

Font

can be subclassed.

FONT

is used for special situations where
clients already have a

Font

instance but still
need to use

Map

-based APIs. Typically, there will
be no other attributes in the

Map

except the

FONT

attribute. With

Map

-based APIs
the common case is to specify all attributes individually, so

FONT

is not needed or desirable.

However, if both

FONT

and other attributes are
present in the

Map

, the rendering system will
merge the attributes defined in the

Font

with the
additional attributes. This merging process classifies

TextAttributes

into two groups. One group, the
'primary' group, is considered fundamental to the selection and
metric behavior of a font. These attributes are

FAMILY

,

WEIGHT

,

WIDTH

,

POSTURE

,

SIZE

,

TRANSFORM

,

SUPERSCRIPT

, and

TRACKING

. The other group, the 'secondary' group,
consists of all other defined attributes, with the exception of

FONT

itself.

To generate the new

Map

, first the

Font

is obtained from the

FONT

attribute, and

all

of its attributes extracted into a
new

Map

. Then only the

secondary

attributes from the original

Map

are added to
those in the new

Map

. Thus the values of primary
attributes come solely from the

Font

, and the
values of secondary attributes originate with the

Font

but can be overridden by other values in the

Map

.

Note:

Font's Map

-based
constructor and

deriveFont

methods do not process
the

FONT

attribute, as these are used to create
new

Font

objects. Instead,

Font.getFont(Map)

should be used to
handle the

FONT

attribute.

**See Also:** Font

- CHAR_REPLACEMENT

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
CHAR_REPLACEMENT
```

Attribute key for a user-defined glyph to display in lieu
of the font's standard glyph for a character. Values are
instances of GraphicAttribute. The default value is null,
indicating that the standard glyphs provided by the font
should be used.

This attribute is used to reserve space for a graphic or
other component embedded in a line of text. It is required for
correct positioning of 'inline' components within a line when
bidirectional reordering (see

Bidi

) is
performed. Each character (Unicode code point) will be
rendered using the provided GraphicAttribute. Typically, the
characters to which this attribute is applied should be

\uFFFC

.

The GraphicAttribute determines the logical and visual
bounds of the text; the actual Font values are ignored.

**See Also:** GraphicAttribute

- FOREGROUND

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
FOREGROUND
```

Attribute key for the paint used to render the text. Values are
instances of

Paint

. The default value is
null, indicating that the

Paint

set on the

Graphics2D

at the time of rendering is used.

Glyphs will be rendered using this

Paint

regardless of the

Paint

value
set on the

Graphics

(but see

SWAP_COLORS

).

**See Also:** Paint

,

SWAP_COLORS

- BACKGROUND

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
BACKGROUND
```

Attribute key for the paint used to render the background of
the text. Values are instances of

Paint

.
The default value is null, indicating that the background
should not be rendered.

The logical bounds of the text will be filled using this

Paint

, and then the text will be rendered on top
of it (but see

SWAP_COLORS

).

The visual bounds of the text is extended to include the
logical bounds, if necessary. The outline is not affected.

**See Also:** Paint

,

SWAP_COLORS

- UNDERLINE

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
UNDERLINE
```

Attribute key for underline. Values are instances of

Integer

. The default value is -1, which
means no underline.

The constant value

UNDERLINE_ON

is provided.

The underline affects both the visual bounds and the outline
of the text.

- UNDERLINE_ON

```java
public static final
Integer
UNDERLINE_ON
```

Standard underline.

**See Also:** UNDERLINE

- STRIKETHROUGH

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
STRIKETHROUGH
```

Attribute key for strikethrough. Values are instances of

Boolean

. The default value is

false

, which means no strikethrough.

The constant value

STRIKETHROUGH_ON

is provided.

The strikethrough affects both the visual bounds and the
outline of the text.

- STRIKETHROUGH_ON

```java
public static final
Boolean
STRIKETHROUGH_ON
```

A single strikethrough.

**See Also:** STRIKETHROUGH

- RUN_DIRECTION

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
RUN_DIRECTION
```

Attribute key for the run direction of the line. Values are
instances of

Boolean

. The default value is
null, which indicates that the standard Bidi algorithm for
determining run direction should be used with the value

Bidi.DIRECTION_DEFAULT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT

.

The constants

RUN_DIRECTION_RTL

and

RUN_DIRECTION_LTR

are provided.

This determines the value passed to the

Bidi

constructor to select the primary direction of
the text in the paragraph.

Note:

This attribute should have the same value for
all the text in a paragraph, otherwise the behavior is
undetermined.

**See Also:** Bidi

- RUN_DIRECTION_LTR

```java
public static final
Boolean
RUN_DIRECTION_LTR
```

Left-to-right run direction.

**See Also:** RUN_DIRECTION

- RUN_DIRECTION_RTL

```java
public static final
Boolean
RUN_DIRECTION_RTL
```

Right-to-left run direction.

**See Also:** RUN_DIRECTION

- BIDI_EMBEDDING

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
BIDI_EMBEDDING
```

Attribute key for the embedding level of the text. Values are
instances of

Integer

. The default value is

null

, indicating that the Bidirectional
algorithm should run without explicit embeddings.

Positive values 1 through 61 are

embedding

levels,
negative values -1 through -61 are

override

levels.
The value 0 means that the base line direction is used. These
levels are passed in the embedding levels array to the

Bidi

constructor.

Note:

When this attribute is present anywhere in
a paragraph, then any Unicode bidi control characters (RLO,
LRO, RLE, LRE, and PDF) in the paragraph are
disregarded, and runs of text where this attribute is not
present are treated as though it were present and had the value
0.

**See Also:** Bidi

- JUSTIFICATION

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
JUSTIFICATION
```

Attribute key for the justification of a paragraph. Values are
instances of

Number

. The default value is
1, indicating that justification should use the full width
provided. Values are pinned to the range [0..1].

The constants

JUSTIFICATION_FULL

and

JUSTIFICATION_NONE

are provided.

Specifies the fraction of the extra space to use when
justification is requested on a

TextLayout

. For
example, if the line is 50 points wide and it is requested to
justify to 70 points, a value of 0.75 will pad to use
three-quarters of the remaining space, or 15 points, so that
the resulting line will be 65 points in length.

Note:

This should have the same value for all the
text in a paragraph, otherwise the behavior is undetermined.

**See Also:** TextLayout.getJustifiedLayout(float)

- JUSTIFICATION_FULL

```java
public static final
Float
JUSTIFICATION_FULL
```

Justify the line to the full requested width. This is the
default value for

JUSTIFICATION

.

**See Also:** JUSTIFICATION

- JUSTIFICATION_NONE

public static final
Float
JUSTIFICATION_NONE
```

Do not allow the line to be justified.

**See Also:** JUSTIFICATION

- INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT
```

Attribute key for input method highlight styles.

Values are instances of

InputMethodHighlight

or

Annotation

. The default value is

null

,
which means that input method styles should not be applied
before rendering.

If adjacent runs of text with the same

InputMethodHighlight

need to be rendered
separately, the

InputMethodHighlights

should be
wrapped in

Annotation

instances.

Input method highlights are used while text is being
composed by an input method. Text editing components should
retain them even if they generally only deal with unstyled
text, and make them available to the drawing routines.

**See Also:** Font

,

InputMethodHighlight

,

Annotation

- INPUT_METHOD_UNDERLINE

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
INPUT_METHOD_UNDERLINE
```

Attribute key for input method underlines. Values
are instances of

. The default
value is

-1

, which means no underline.

Several constant values are provided, see

UNDERLINE_LOW_ONE_PIXEL

,

UNDERLINE_LOW_TWO_PIXEL

,

UNDERLINE_LOW_DOTTED

,

UNDERLINE_LOW_GRAY

, and

UNDERLINE_LOW_DASHED

.

This may be used in conjunction with

UNDERLINE

if
desired. The primary purpose is for use by input methods.
Other use of these underlines for simple ornamentation might
confuse users.

The input method underline affects both the visual bounds and
the outline of the text.

**Since:** 1.3

- UNDERLINE_LOW_ONE_PIXEL

```java
public static final
Integer
UNDERLINE_LOW_ONE_PIXEL
```

Single pixel solid low underline.

- SWAP_COLORS

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
SWAP_COLORS
```

Attribute key for swapping foreground and background

Paints

. Values are instances of

Boolean

. The default value is

false

, which means do not swap colors.

The constant value

SWAP_COLORS_ON

is defined.

If the

FOREGROUND

attribute is set, its

Paint

will be used as the background, otherwise
the

Paint

currently on the

Graphics

will be used. If the

BACKGROUND

attribute is set, its

Paint

will be used as the foreground, otherwise
the system will find a contrasting color to the
(resolved) background so that the text will be visible.

**See Also:** FOREGROUND

,

BACKGROUND

- SWAP_COLORS_ON

```java
public static final
Boolean
SWAP_COLORS_ON
```

Swap foreground and background.

**Since:** 1.3
**See Also:** SWAP_COLORS

- NUMERIC_SHAPING

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
NUMERIC_SHAPING
```

Attribute key for converting ASCII decimal digits to other
decimal ranges. Values are instances of

NumericShaper

.
The default is

null

, which means do not perform
numeric shaping.

When a numeric shaper is defined, the text is first
processed by the shaper before any other analysis of the text
is performed.

Note:

This should have the same value for all the
text in the paragraph, otherwise the behavior is undetermined.

**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** NumericShaper

- KERNING

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
KERNING
```

Attribute key to request kerning. Values are instances of

Integer

. The default value is

0

, which does not request kerning.

The constant value

KERNING_ON

is provided.

The default advances of single characters are not
appropriate for some character sequences, for example "To" or
"AWAY". Without kerning the adjacent characters appear to be
separated by too much space. Kerning causes selected sequences
of characters to be spaced differently for a more pleasing
visual appearance.

**Since:** 1.6

- KERNING_ON

```java
public static final
Integer
KERNING_ON
```

Request standard kerning.

**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** KERNING

- LIGATURES

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
LIGATURES
```

Attribute key for enabling optional ligatures. Values are
instances of

Integer

. The default value is

0

, which means do not use optional ligatures.

The constant value

LIGATURES_ON

is defined.

Ligatures required by the writing system are always enabled.

**Since:** 1.6

- LIGATURES_ON

```java
public static final
Integer
LIGATURES_ON
```

Request standard optional ligatures.

**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** LIGATURES

- TRACKING

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
TRACKING
```

Attribute key to control tracking. Values are instances of

Number

. The default value is

0

, which means no additional tracking.

The constant values

TRACKING_TIGHT

and

TRACKING_LOOSE

are provided.

The tracking value is multiplied by the font point size and
passed through the font transform to determine an additional
amount to add to the advance of each glyph cluster. Positive
tracking values will inhibit formation of optional ligatures.
Tracking values are typically between

-0.1

and

0.3

; values outside this range are generally not
desirable.

**Since:** 1.6

- TRACKING_TIGHT

```java
public static final
Float
TRACKING_TIGHT
```

Perform tight tracking.

**Since:** 1.6
**See Also:** TRACKING

- TRACKING_LOOSE

```java

Field Detail

- FAMILY

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
FAMILY
```

Attribute key for the font name. Values are instances of

String

. The default value is

"Default"

, which causes the platform default font
family to be used.

The

Font

class defines constants for the logical
font names

DIALOG

,

DIALOG_INPUT

,

SANS_SERIF

,

SERIF

, and

MONOSPACED

.

This defines the value passed as

name

to the

Font

constructor. Both logical and physical
font names are allowed. If a font with the requested name
is not found, the default font is used.

Note:

This attribute is unfortunately misnamed, as
it specifies the face name and not just the family. Thus
values such as "Lucida Sans Bold" will select that face if it
exists. Note, though, that if the requested face does not
exist, the default will be used with

regular

weight.
The "Bold" in the name is part of the face name, not a separate
request that the font's weight be bold.

- WEIGHT

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
WEIGHT
```

Attribute key for the weight of a font. Values are instances
of

Number

. The default value is

WEIGHT_REGULAR

.

Several constant values are provided, see

WEIGHT_EXTRA_LIGHT

,

WEIGHT_LIGHT

,

WEIGHT_MEDIUM

,

WEIGHT_DEMIBOLD

,

WEIGHT_BOLD

,

WEIGHT_HEAVY

,

WEIGHT_EXTRABOLD

, and

WEIGHT_ULTRABOLD

. The
value

WEIGHT_BOLD

corresponds to the
style value

Font.BOLD

as passed to the

Font

constructor.

The value is roughly the ratio of the stem width to that of
the regular weight.

The system can interpolate the provided value.

**See Also:** WEIGHT

- WIDTH

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
WIDTH
```

Attribute key for the width of a font. Values are instances of

.

Several constant values are provided, see

WIDTH_CONDENSED

,

WIDTH_SEMI_CONDENSED

,

WIDTH_REGULAR

,

WIDTH_SEMI_EXTENDED

,

WIDTH_EXTENDED

.

The value is roughly the ratio of the advance width to that
of the regular width.

The system can interpolate the provided value.

- WIDTH_CONDENSED

```java
public static final
Float
WIDTH_CONDENSED
```

The most condensed predefined width.

**See Also:** WIDTH

The standard width. This is the default value for

WIDTH

.

**See Also:** WIDTH

- WIDTH_SEMI_EXTENDED

```java
public static final
Float
WIDTH_SEMI_EXTENDED
```

A moderately extended width.

**See Also:** WIDTH

- POSTURE

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
POSTURE
```

Attribute key for the posture of a font. Values are instances
of

Number

. The default value is

POSTURE_REGULAR

.

Two constant values are provided,

POSTURE_REGULAR

and

POSTURE_OBLIQUE

. The value

POSTURE_OBLIQUE

corresponds to the style value

Font.ITALIC

as passed to the

Font

constructor.

The value is roughly the slope of the stems of the font,
expressed as the run over the rise. Positive values lean right.

The system can interpolate the provided value.

This will affect the font's italic angle as returned by

Font.getItalicAngle

.

**See Also:** Font.getItalicAngle()

- POSTURE_REGULAR

```java
public static final
Float
POSTURE_REGULAR
```

The standard posture, upright. This is the default value for

POSTURE

.

**See Also:** POSTURE

- POSTURE_OBLIQUE

```java
public static final
Float
POSTURE_OBLIQUE
```

The standard italic posture.

**See Also:** POSTURE

- SIZE

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
SIZE
```

Attribute key for the font size. Values are instances of

Number

. The default value is 12pt.

This corresponds to the

size

parameter to the

Font

constructor.

Very large or small sizes will impact rendering performance,
and the rendering system might not render text at these sizes.
Negative sizes are illegal and result in the default size.

Note that the appearance and metrics of a 12pt font with a
2x transform might be different than that of a 24 point font
with no transform.

- TRANSFORM

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
TRANSFORM
```

Attribute key for the transform of a font. Values are
instances of

TransformAttribute

. The
default value is

TransformAttribute.IDENTITY

.

The

TransformAttribute

class defines the
constant

IDENTITY

.

This corresponds to the transform passed to

Font.deriveFont(AffineTransform)

. Since that
transform is mutable and

TextAttribute

values must
not be, the

TransformAttribute

wrapper class is
used.

The primary intent is to support scaling and skewing, though
other effects are possible.

Some transforms will cause the baseline to be rotated and/or
shifted. The text and the baseline are transformed together so
that the text follows the new baseline. For example, with text
on a horizontal baseline, the new baseline follows the
direction of the unit x vector passed through the
transform. Text metrics are measured against this new baseline.
So, for example, with other things being equal, text rendered
with a rotated TRANSFORM and an unrotated TRANSFORM will measure as
having the same ascent, descent, and advance.

In styled text, the baselines for each such run are aligned
one after the other to potentially create a non-linear baseline
for the entire run of text. For more information, see

TextLayout.getLayoutPath()

.

**See Also:** TransformAttribute

,

AffineTransform

- SUPERSCRIPT

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
SUPERSCRIPT
```

Attribute key for superscripting and subscripting. Values are
instances of

Integer

. The default value is
0, which means that no superscript or subscript is used.

Two constant values are provided, see

SUPERSCRIPT_SUPER

and

SUPERSCRIPT_SUB

. These have
the values 1 and -1 respectively. Values of
greater magnitude define greater levels of superscript or
subscripting, for example, 2 corresponds to super-superscript,
3 to super-super-superscript, and similarly for negative values
and subscript, up to a level of 7 (or -7). Values beyond this
range are reserved; behavior is platform-dependent.

SUPERSCRIPT

can
impact the ascent and descent of a font. The ascent
and descent can never become negative, however.

- SUPERSCRIPT_SUPER

```java
public static final
Integer
SUPERSCRIPT_SUPER
```

Standard superscript.

**See Also:** SUPERSCRIPT

- SUPERSCRIPT_SUB

```java
public static final
Integer
SUPERSCRIPT_SUB
```

Standard subscript.

**See Also:** SUPERSCRIPT

- FONT

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
FONT
```

Attribute key used to provide the font to use to render text.
Values are instances of

Font

. The default
value is null, indicating that normal resolution of a

Font

from attributes should be performed.

TextLayout

and

AttributedCharacterIterator

work in terms of

Maps

of

TextAttributes

. Normally,
all the attributes are examined and used to select and
configure a

Font

instance. If a

FONT

attribute is present, though, its associated

Font

will be used. This provides a way for users to override the
resolution of font attributes into a

Font

, or
force use of a particular

Font

instance. This
also allows users to specify subclasses of

Font

in
cases where a

Font

can be subclassed.

FONT

is used for special situations where
clients already have a

Font

instance but still
need to use

Map

-based APIs. Typically, there will
be no other attributes in the

Map

except the

FONT

attribute. With

Map

-based APIs
the common case is to specify all attributes individually, so

FONT

is not needed or desirable.

However, if both

FONT

and other attributes are
present in the

Map

, the rendering system will
merge the attributes defined in the

Font

with the
additional attributes. This merging process classifies

TextAttributes

into two groups. One group, the
'primary' group, is considered fundamental to the selection and
metric behavior of a font. These attributes are

FAMILY

,

WEIGHT

,

WIDTH

,

POSTURE

,

SIZE

,

TRANSFORM

,

SUPERSCRIPT

, and

TRACKING

. The other group, the 'secondary' group,
consists of all other defined attributes, with the exception of

FONT

itself.

To generate the new

Map

, first the

Font

is obtained from the

FONT

attribute, and

all

of its attributes extracted into a
new

Map

. Then only the

secondary

attributes from the original

Map

are added to
those in the new

Map

. Thus the values of primary
attributes come solely from the

Font

, and the
values of secondary attributes originate with the

Font

but can be overridden by other values in the

Map

.

Note:

Font's Map

-based
constructor and

deriveFont

methods do not process
the

FONT

attribute, as these are used to create
new

Font

objects. Instead,

Font.getFont(Map)

should be used to
handle the

FONT

attribute.

- CHAR_REPLACEMENT

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
CHAR_REPLACEMENT
```

Attribute key for a user-defined glyph to display in lieu
of the font's standard glyph for a character. Values are
instances of GraphicAttribute. The default value is null,
indicating that the standard glyphs provided by the font
should be used.

This attribute is used to reserve space for a graphic or
other component embedded in a line of text. It is required for
correct positioning of 'inline' components within a line when
bidirectional reordering (see

Bidi

) is
performed. Each character (Unicode code point) will be
rendered using the provided GraphicAttribute. Typically, the
characters to which this attribute is applied should be

\uFFFC

.

The GraphicAttribute determines the logical and visual
bounds of the text; the actual Font values are ignored.

**See Also:** GraphicAttribute

- FOREGROUND

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
FOREGROUND
```

Attribute key for the paint used to render the text. Values are
instances of

Paint

. The default value is
null, indicating that the

Paint

set on the

Graphics2D

at the time of rendering is used.

Glyphs will be rendered using this

Paint

regardless of the

Paint

value
set on the

Graphics

(but see

SWAP_COLORS

).

**See Also:** Paint

,

SWAP_COLORS

- BACKGROUND

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
BACKGROUND
```

Attribute key for the paint used to render the background of
the text. Values are instances of

Paint

.
The default value is null, indicating that the background
should not be rendered.

The logical bounds of the text will be filled using this

Paint

, and then the text will be rendered on top
of it (but see

SWAP_COLORS

).

The visual bounds of the text is extended to include the
logical bounds, if necessary. The outline is not affected.

**See Also:** Paint

,

SWAP_COLORS

- UNDERLINE

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
UNDERLINE
```

Attribute key for underline. Values are instances of

Integer

. The default value is -1, which
means no underline.

The constant value

is provided.

The underline affects both the visual bounds and the outline
of the text.

- UNDERLINE_ON

```java
public static final
Integer
UNDERLINE_ON
```

Standard underline.

**See Also:** UNDERLINE

- STRIKETHROUGH

```java
public static final
TextAttribute

. The default value is

false

, which means no strikethrough.

The constant value

STRIKETHROUGH_ON

is provided.

The strikethrough affects both the visual bounds and the
outline of the text.

- STRIKETHROUGH_ON

```java
public static final
Boolean
STRIKETHROUGH_ON
```

A single strikethrough.

**See Also:** STRIKETHROUGH

- RUN_DIRECTION

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
RUN_DIRECTION
```

Attribute key for the run direction of the line. Values are
instances of

Boolean

. The default value is
null, which indicates that the standard Bidi algorithm for
determining run direction should be used with the value

Bidi.DIRECTION_DEFAULT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT

.

The constants

RUN_DIRECTION_RTL

and

RUN_DIRECTION_LTR

are provided.

This determines the value passed to the

Bidi

constructor to select the primary direction of
the text in the paragraph.

Note:

This attribute should have the same value for
all the text in a paragraph, otherwise the behavior is
undetermined.

**See Also:** Bidi

- RUN_DIRECTION_LTR

```java
public static final
Boolean
RUN_DIRECTION_LTR
```

Left-to-right run direction.

**See Also:** RUN_DIRECTION

- RUN_DIRECTION_RTL

```

Right-to-left run direction.

**See Also:** RUN_DIRECTION

- BIDI_EMBEDDING

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
BIDI_EMBEDDING
```

Attribute key for the embedding level of the text. Values are
instances of

Integer

. The default value is

null

, indicating that the Bidirectional
algorithm should run without explicit embeddings.

Positive values 1 through 61 are

embedding

levels,
negative values -1 through -61 are

override

levels.
The value 0 means that the base line direction is used. These
levels are passed in the embedding levels array to the

Bidi

constructor.

Note:

When this attribute is present anywhere in
a paragraph, then any Unicode bidi control characters (RLO,
LRO, RLE, LRE, and PDF) in the paragraph are
disregarded, and runs of text where this attribute is not
present are treated as though it were present and had the value
0.

**See Also:** Bidi

- JUSTIFICATION

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
JUSTIFICATION
```

Attribute key for the justification of a paragraph. Values are
instances of

Number

. The default value is
1, indicating that justification should use the full width
provided. Values are pinned to the range [0..1].

The constants

JUSTIFICATION_FULL

and

JUSTIFICATION_NONE

are provided.

Specifies the fraction of the extra space to use when
justification is requested on a

TextLayout

. For
example, if the line is 50 points wide and it is requested to
justify to 70 points, a value of 0.75 will pad to use
three-quarters of the remaining space, or 15 points, so that
the resulting line will be 65 points in length.

Note:

This should have the same value for all the
text in a paragraph, otherwise the behavior is undetermined.

**See Also:** TextLayout.getJustifiedLayout(float)

- JUSTIFICATION_FULL

```java
public static final
Float
JUSTIFICATION_FULL
```

- INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT
```

Attribute key for input method highlight styles.

Values are instances of

InputMethodHighlight

or

Annotation

. The default value is

null

,
which means that input method styles should not be applied
before rendering.

If adjacent runs of text with the same

InputMethodHighlight

need to be rendered
separately, the

InputMethodHighlights

should be
wrapped in

Annotation

instances.

Input method highlights are used while text is being
composed by an input method. Text editing components should
retain them even if they generally only deal with unstyled
text, and make them available to the drawing routines.

**See Also:** Font

,

InputMethodHighlight

,

Annotation

- INPUT_METHOD_UNDERLINE

```java
public static final

,

UNDERLINE_LOW_DOTTED

,

UNDERLINE_LOW_GRAY

, and

UNDERLINE_LOW_DASHED

.

This may be used in conjunction with

UNDERLINE

if
desired. The primary purpose is for use by input methods.
Other use of these underlines for simple ornamentation might
confuse users.

The input method underline affects both the visual bounds and
the outline of the text.

Paints

. Values are instances of

Boolean

. The default value is

false

, which means do not swap colors.

The constant value

SWAP_COLORS_ON

is defined.

If the

FOREGROUND

attribute is set, its

Paint

will be used as the background, otherwise
the

Paint

currently on the

Graphics

will be used. If the

BACKGROUND

attribute is set, its

Paint

will be used as the foreground, otherwise
the system will find a contrasting color to the
(resolved) background so that the text will be visible.

**See Also:** FOREGROUND

,

BACKGROUND

- NUMERIC_SHAPING

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
NUMERIC_SHAPING
```

Attribute key for converting ASCII decimal digits to other
decimal ranges. Values are instances of

NumericShaper

.
The default is

null

, which means do not perform
numeric shaping.

When a numeric shaper is defined, the text is first
processed by the shaper before any other analysis of the text
is performed.

Note:

This should have the same value for all the
text in the paragraph, otherwise the behavior is undetermined.

**Since:** 1.4
**See Also:** NumericShaper

- KERNING

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
KERNING
```

Attribute key to request kerning. Values are instances of

Integer

. The default value is

0

, which does not request kerning.

The constant value

KERNING_ON

is provided.

The default advances of single characters are not
appropriate for some character sequences, for example "To" or
"AWAY". Without kerning the adjacent characters appear to be
separated by too much space. Kerning causes selected sequences
of characters to be spaced differently for a more pleasing
visual appearance.

**Since:** 1.6

- KERNING_ON

```java
public static final
Integer
KERNING_ON
```

Request standard kerning.

**Since:** 1.6

. The default value is

0

, which means no additional tracking.

The constant values

TRACKING_TIGHT

and

TRACKING_LOOSE

are provided.

The tracking value is multiplied by the font point size and
passed through the font transform to determine an additional
amount to add to the advance of each glyph cluster. Positive
tracking values will inhibit formation of optional ligatures.
Tracking values are typically between

-0.1

and

0.3

; values outside this range are generally not
desirable.

**Since:** 1.6

- TRACKING_TIGHT

```java
public static final

#### Field Detail

FAMILY

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
FAMILY
```

Attribute key for the font name. Values are instances of

String

. The default value is

"Default"

, which causes the platform default font
family to be used.

The

Font

class defines constants for the logical
font names

DIALOG

,

,

SANS_SERIF

,

SERIF

, and

MONOSPACED

.

This defines the value passed as

name

to the

Font

constructor. Both logical and physical
font names are allowed. If a font with the requested name
is not found, the default font is used.

Note:

This attribute is unfortunately misnamed, as
it specifies the face name and not just the family. Thus
values such as "Lucida Sans Bold" will select that face if it
exists. Note, though, that if the requested face does not
exist, the default will be used with

regular

weight.
The "Bold" in the name is part of the face name, not a separate
request that the font's weight be bold.

TRANSFORM

```java
public static final
TextAttribute
TRANSFORM
```

Attribute key for the transform of a font. Values are
instances of

TransformAttribute

. The
default value is

TransformAttribute.IDENTITY

.

The

TransformAttribute

class defines the
constant

IDENTITY

.

This corresponds to the transform passed to

Font.deriveFont(AffineTransform)

. Since that
transform is mutable and

TextAttribute

values must
not be, the

TransformAttribute

wrapper class is
used.

The primary intent is to support scaling and skewing, though
other effects are possible.

Some transforms will cause the baseline to be rotated and/or
shifted. The text and the baseline are transformed together so
that the text follows the new baseline. For example, with text
on a horizontal baseline, the new baseline follows the
direction of the unit x vector passed through the
transform. Text metrics are measured against this new baseline.
So, for example, with other things being equal, text rendered
with a rotated TRANSFORM and an unrotated TRANSFORM will measure as
having the same ascent, descent, and advance.

In styled text, the baselines for each such run are aligned
one after the other to potentially create a non-linear baseline
for the entire run of text. For more information, see

TextLayout.getLayoutPath()

0, which means that no superscript or subscript is used.

Two constant values are provided, see

FONT

```

Attribute key used to provide the font to use to render text.
Values are instances of

Font

. The default
value is null, indicating that normal resolution of a

Font

from attributes should be performed.

TextLayout

and

AttributedCharacterIterator

work in terms of

Maps

of

TextAttributes

. Normally,
all the attributes are examined and used to select and
configure a

Font

instance. If a

FONT

attribute is present, though, its associated

Font

will be used. This provides a way for users to override the
resolution of font attributes into a

Font

, or
force use of a particular

Font

instance. This
also allows users to specify subclasses of

Font

in
cases where a

Font

can be subclassed.

FONT

is used for special situations where
clients already have a

Font

instance but still
need to use

Map

-based APIs. Typically, there will
be no other attributes in the

Map

except the

FONT

attribute. With

Map

-based APIs
the common case is to specify all attributes individually, so

FONT

is not needed or desirable.

However, if both

FONT

and other attributes are
present in the

Map

, the rendering system will
merge the attributes defined in the

Font

with the
additional attributes. This merging process classifies

TextAttributes

into two groups. One group, the
'primary' group, is considered fundamental to the selection and
metric behavior of a font. These attributes are

FAMILY

,

WEIGHT

,

WIDTH

,

POSTURE

,

SIZE

,

TRANSFORM

,

SUPERSCRIPT

, and

TRACKING

. The other group, the 'secondary' group,
consists of all other defined attributes, with the exception of

FONT

itself.

To generate the new

Map

, first the

Font

is obtained from the

FONT

attribute, and

all

of its attributes extracted into a
new

Map

. Then only the

secondary

attributes from the original

Map

are added to

This attribute is used to reserve space for a graphic or
other component embedded in a line of text. It is required for
correct positioning of 'inline' components within a line when
bidirectional reordering (see
