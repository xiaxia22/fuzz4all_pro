### Class Description

```java
public interface
InterfaceType

extends
ReferenceType
```

A mirror of an interface in the target VM. An InterfaceType is
a refinement of

ReferenceType

that applies to true interfaces
in the JLS sense of the definition (not a class, not an array type).
An interface type will never be returned by

ObjectReference.referenceType()

, but it may be in the list
of implemented interfaces for a

ClassType

that is returned
by that method.

InvocationException

Invokes the specified static

Method

in the
target VM. The
specified method must be defined in this interface.
The method must be a static method
but not a static initializer.

The method invocation will occur in the specified thread.
Method invocation can occur only if the specified thread
has been suspended by an event which occurred in that thread.
Method invocation is not supported
when the target VM has been suspended through

VirtualMachine.suspend()

or when the specified thread
is suspended through

ThreadReference.suspend()

.

The specified method is invoked with the arguments in the specified
argument list. The method invocation is synchronous; this method
does not return until the invoked method returns in the target VM.
If the invoked method throws an exception, this method will throw
an

InvocationException

which contains a mirror to the exception
object thrown.

Object arguments must be assignment compatible with the argument type
(This implies that the argument type must be loaded through the
enclosing class' class loader). Primitive arguments must be
either assignment compatible with the argument type or must be
convertible to the argument type without loss of information.
If the method being called accepts a variable number of arguments,
then the last argument type is an array of some component type.
The argument in the matching position can be omitted, or can be null,
an array of the same component type, or an argument of the
component type followed by any number of other arguments of the same
type. If the argument is omitted, then a 0 length array of the
component type is passed. The component type can be a primitive type.
Autoboxing is not supported.

See Section 5.2 of

The Java™ Language Specification

for more information on assignment compatibility.

By default, all threads in the target VM are resumed while
the method is being invoked if they were previously
suspended by an event or by

VirtualMachine.suspend()

or

ThreadReference.suspend()

. This is done to prevent the deadlocks
that will occur if any of the threads own monitors
that will be needed by the invoked method.
Note, however, that this implicit resume acts exactly like

ThreadReference.resume()

, so if the thread's suspend
count is greater than 1, it will remain in a suspended state
during the invocation and thus a deadlock could still occur.
By default, when the invocation completes,
all threads in the target VM are suspended, regardless their state
before the invocation.
It is possible that
breakpoints or other events might occur during the invocation.
This can cause deadlocks as described above. It can also cause a deadlock
if invokeMethod is called from the client's event handler thread. In this
case, this thread will be waiting for the invokeMethod to complete and
won't read the EventSet that comes in for the new event. If this
new EventSet is SUSPEND_ALL, then a deadlock will occur because no
one will resume the EventSet. To avoid this, all EventRequests should
be disabled before doing the invokeMethod, or the invokeMethod should
not be done from the client's event handler thread.

The resumption of other threads during the invocation can be prevented
by specifying the

ClassType.INVOKE_SINGLE_THREADED

bit flag in the

options

argument; however,
there is no protection against or recovery from the deadlocks
described above, so this option should be used with great caution.
Only the specified thread will be resumed (as described for all
threads above). Upon completion of a single threaded invoke, the invoking thread
will be suspended once again. Note that any threads started during
the single threaded invocation will not be suspended when the
invocation completes.

If the target VM is disconnected during the invoke (for example, through

VirtualMachine.dispose()

) the method invocation continues.

**Parameters:**
- thread

- the thread in which to invoke.
- method

- the

Method

to invoke.
- arguments

- the list of

Value

arguments bound to the
invoked method. Values from the list are assigned to arguments
in the order they appear in the method signature.
- options

- the integer bit flag options.

**Returns:**
- a

Value

mirror of the invoked method's return value.

**Throws:**
- IllegalArgumentException

- if the method is not
a member of this interface, if the size of the argument list
does not match the number of declared arguments for the method, or
if the method is not static or is a static initializer.
- ClassNotLoadedException

- if any argument type has not yet been loaded
through the appropriate class loader.
- IncompatibleThreadStateException

- if the specified thread has not
been suspended by an event.
- InvocationException

- if the method invocation resulted in
an exception in the target VM.
- InvalidTypeException

- If the arguments do not meet this requirement --
Object arguments must be assignment compatible with the argument
type. This implies that the argument type must be
loaded through the enclosing class' class loader.
Primitive arguments must be either assignment compatible with the
argument type or must be convertible to the argument type without loss
of information. See JLS section 5.2 for more information on assignment
compatibility.
- VMCannotBeModifiedException

- if the VirtualMachine is read-only - see

VirtualMachine.canBeModified()

.

The specified method is invoked with the arguments in the specified
argument list. The method invocation is synchronous; this method
does not return until the invoked method returns in the target VM.
If the invoked method throws an exception, this method will throw
an

InvocationException

which contains a mirror to the exception
object thrown.

Object arguments must be assignment compatible with the argument type
(This implies that the argument type must be loaded through the
enclosing class' class loader). Primitive arguments must be
either assignment compatible with the argument type or must be
convertible to the argument type without loss of information.
If the method being called accepts a variable number of arguments,
then the last argument type is an array of some component type.
The argument in the matching position can be omitted, or can be null,
an array of the same component type, or an argument of the
component type followed by any number of other arguments of the same
type. If the argument is omitted, then a 0 length array of the
component type is passed. The component type can be a primitive type.
Autoboxing is not supported.

See Section 5.2 of

The Java™ Language Specification

for more information on assignment compatibility.

By default, all threads in the target VM are resumed while
the method is being invoked if they were previously
suspended by an event or by

VirtualMachine.suspend()

or

ThreadReference.suspend()

. This is done to prevent the deadlocks
that will occur if any of the threads own monitors
that will be needed by the invoked method.
Note, however, that this implicit resume acts exactly like

ThreadReference.resume()

, so if the thread's suspend
count is greater than 1, it will remain in a suspended state
during the invocation and thus a deadlock could still occur.
By default, when the invocation completes,
all threads in the target VM are suspended, regardless their state
before the invocation.
It is possible that
breakpoints or other events might occur during the invocation.
This can cause deadlocks as described above. It can also cause a deadlock
if invokeMethod is called from the client's event handler thread. In this
case, this thread will be waiting for the invokeMethod to complete and
won't read the EventSet that comes in for the new event. If this
new EventSet is SUSPEND_ALL, then a deadlock will occur because no
one will resume the EventSet. To avoid this, all EventRequests should
be disabled before doing the invokeMethod, or the invokeMethod should
not be done from the client's event handler thread.

The resumption of other threads during the invocation can be prevented
by specifying the

ClassType.INVOKE_SINGLE_THREADED

bit flag in the

options

argument; however,
there is no protection against or recovery from the deadlocks
described above, so this option should be used with great caution.
Only the specified thread will be resumed (as described for all
threads above). Upon completion of a single threaded invoke, the invoking thread
will be suspended once again. Note that any threads started during
the single threaded invocation will not be suspended when the
invocation completes.

If the target VM is disconnected during the invoke (for example, through

VirtualMachine.dispose()

) the method invocation continues.

**Parameters:** thread

- the thread in which to invoke.
**Parameters:** method

- the

Method

to invoke.
**Parameters:** arguments

- the list of

Value

arguments bound to the
invoked method. Values from the list are assigned to arguments
in the order they appear in the method signature.
**Parameters:** options

- the integer bit flag options.
**Returns:** a

Value

mirror of the invoked method's return value.
**Throws:** IllegalArgumentException

- if the method is not
a member of this interface, if the size of the argument list
does not match the number of declared arguments for the method, or
if the method is not static or is a static initializer.
**Throws:** ClassNotLoadedException

- if any argument type has not yet been loaded
through the appropriate class loader.
**Throws:** IncompatibleThreadStateException

- if the specified thread has not
been suspended by an event.
**Throws:** InvocationException

- if the method invocation resulted in
an exception in the target VM.
**Throws:** InvalidTypeException

- If the arguments do not meet this requirement --
Object arguments must be assignment compatible with the argument
type. This implies that the argument type must be
loaded through the enclosing class' class loader.
Primitive arguments must be either assignment compatible with the
argument type or must be convertible to the argument type without loss
of information. See JLS section 5.2 for more information on assignment
compatibility.
**Throws:** VMCannotBeModifiedException

- if the VirtualMachine is read-only - see

VirtualMachine.canBeModified()

.
**Since:** 1.8
